<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview No. 16. (inaudible at 0:00:21.5) Interview No. 16.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:27.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:32.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because knowing (inaudible at 0:00:33.9) I was down (inaudible at 0:00:36.3)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually when I come to (inaudible at 0:00:57.3) I've already had one thing like iced tea or something. This is my first (inaudible at 0:01:02.9) [0:01:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're really thirsty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Really dry. (inaudible at 0:01:05.3) Since I go to get a drink of water, my kids (inaudible at 0:01:15.8) for each other to take a drink. And then they turn off the water. One of them holds the water and counts to 10 and turns it off, right? They do that to me too. So I have (inaudible at 0:01:25.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand that. Is that because they can't reach it and -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's because some kids hog the water fountain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. So —</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:36.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of drinking the water, you're just one of the kids.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:01:53.7) I'm kind of sure that I want to talk about a lot things but right now I just feel a little keyed up. [0:02:02.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Just because (inaudible at 0:02:05.9) I'm always more anxious right after school than if I sit around for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like — I don't know — you're still sort of (inaudible at 0:02:23.8) or -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel more energy is still at a higher peak than it would be say in an hour. In an hour, I would be tired. When I come home from school, I can do a lot of things. If I have the desire I can do a lot of things (inaudible at 0:02:44.2) I've had (inaudible at 0:02:51.3) a lot longer. I don't know. I don't really (inaudible at 0:02:54.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is the — 16th time. [0:03:05.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. This is? So I only missed (inaudible at 0:03:07.9) by one. (inaudible at 0:03:09.1) 20 times. I don't think. What are they going to do? Choke me or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have no idea —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:20.0) The thing is though —</p>

<p>PATIENT: They do have to take test (inaudible at 0:03:25.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Wow. Yeah. So I guess what I suggest you're doing is talk to the man whose (inaudible at 0:03:33.7) this is and find out —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who's that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The guy whose (inaudible at 0:03:38.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did (inaudible at 0:03:39.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not the long haired blonde guy if that's one of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other one. Heavy set guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. On the third floor maybe?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:49.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's the next —let's see. Next week is my last week of work. And, immediately after that, I'm going to go to Canada for a week. And then I'm going to come back and go to Europe. [0:04:08.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me give you the forms. And you can reach him through the center here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or his extension is (inaudible at 0:04:28.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. I'll call him. He's only here until like 5:00 p.m. or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's not — no, he's often here quite later. Today, he's not in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I mean if I were to like call maybe (inaudible at 0:04:52.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:02.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think they have our therapy in there. [0:05:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see myself kind of a wash out of therapy. And I just in my own mind — actually I feel like maybe I'm more relaxed. I'm — I feel like I get a better (inaudible at 0:05:22.6) about it all the time. And I don't agree with (inaudible at 0:05:27.5) for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I don't know what that means (inaudible at 0:05:33.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I won't talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I thought that he was trying to prove that, if he knew you only had 20 weeks or 20 times to come or something, you would accomplish so much as some other indefinite (inaudible at 0:05:53.0) That's what I thought (inaudible at 0:05:54.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for you —</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me, I don't think that's true. I mean I —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:59.7) accomplish all that well. [0:06:01.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've accomplished some things. I don't know what they are but I know that they're there. But, I don't know feel very (inaudible at 0:06:14.9) not at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like if I could never — if I had to stop right away, I feel like I was being cheated. (inaudible at 0:06:28.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there's something there for you to get but just don't have the time. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That — I don't know. Maybe if you came in with a definition in your head (inaudible at 0:06:42.2) yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:47.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of something — some kind of (inaudible at 0:06:49.8) or something. Maybe give you a base to work from or something maybe that would be another —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:06:55.4) or maybe it's hard for me to — I don't know what - something with you. (inaudible at 0:07:03.8) [0:07:06.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But your (inaudible at 0:07:10.8) it sounds like —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm telling you that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. What you're telling (inaudible at 0:07:14.9) is you can't establish rapport with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or is it that -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm telling you that that for me is (inaudible at 0:07:20.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it sounds like it doesn't work for you for two reasons. One is that you don't or didn't come in with a kind of definite problem (inaudible at 0:07:36.3) in your head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other thing that you're kind of having trouble trusting me or letting go with me or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I suppose trust in the right word even though it sounds kind of awkward to me. But I think so. It must be.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You said to me last thing the (inaudible at 0:08:26.9) And you asked me how it made me feel. And at the time, I gave you no answer at all I'm sure. And I thought about it though. And, I made me feel like not such (inaudible at 0:08:47.0)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also feel that somewhere I'm not sure what I was thinking of but I have things that I want to talk about that I can't talk about (inaudible at 0:09:01.1) [0:09:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that I guess that you're saying two things. One is that the fact that —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I (inaudible at 0:09:14.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That my feeling was that like therapy isn't something magic that happens in a vacuum. Like maybe you feel less stupid because it hadn't happened for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other thing (inaudible at 0:09:29.4) you feel like there's more — something —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I (inaudible at 0:09:40.7) Maybe it's just because I was floundering so much before I can't (inaudible at 0:09:45.2) or I don't know. And I don't know what to talk about (inaudible at 0:09:54.0)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions and phone ringing on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I just think like I want to get straight. Is that — you said.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Using therapy as a crutch. I was just thinking that in the car. I forgot what it was. Oh. I was just thinking about things that I don't usually think about like going to school or work — things like that. And I thought about discussing that. And then I thought (inaudible at 0:10:43.0) and maybe that's —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what (inaudible at 0:10:52.4) crutch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe I — I don't know. Let's see. Oh. I think and maybe something happens and I think I'd like to talk about that with you. [0:11:08.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at0:11:08.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you're my way out. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that (inaudible at 0:11:14.8) association with that (inaudible at 0:11:17.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not constantly but (inaudible at 0:11:21.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're leery of who (inaudible at 0:11:24.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just I think (inaudible at 0:11:26.8) Maybe I feel like — I don't know. There's something (inaudible at 0:11:51.2) It's not minor but it's minor in the way that I think about it because I don't think about it a lot. [0:12:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a really pressing problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I thought well, again is that (inaudible at 0:12:11.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's not — something that's making you bleed, if it's not —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Super vital all the time, is there something wrong with talking about it (inaudible at 0:12:22.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Or using it for the wrong purpose. That's what I mean. I think — I mean I don't know. I don't know many people in therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:12:37.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you read about (inaudible at 0:12:38.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Come up with something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it seems like (inaudible at 0:12:42.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're getting (inaudible at 0:12:42.9) by that far.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. Yeah. Like using it for a crutch that's for the wrong purpose or something. And then it's very funny because I thought about it as I was walking into the building. And then I thought I don't know. That doesn't — I don't know — I thought about it. And I thought well, that doesn't bother me. [0:13:10.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:13:08.0) And if you thought — sort of like to talk about the things that don't hound you every minute, for you in some way it has to feel like (inaudible at 0:13:18.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe (inaudible at 0:13:21.4) I mean I — maybe if I kept doing it and doing it —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say you kept doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everything that I wanted to say, I talked about. With you, I can't see ever —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that I don't feel —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Yeah. I guess so but what I'm hearing is it's something like I sort of have this think through my relationship with this guy and what you're — like be aware of — [0:14:13.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could (inaudible at 0:14:15.7) I don't know the goal but I don't know (inaudible at 0:14:20.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm afraid (inaudible at 0:14:19.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Calling him up in the middle of the night, this happened and that happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But like I say, I want to be clear why you're — if I seem like — I know like that's where I'm going.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand that. I mean I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's sort of —</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I must. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like of feels like (inaudible at 0:14:52.1)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't feel (inaudible at 0:14:56.5) Maybe yeah, maybe that's why (inaudible at 0:15:05.1) Maybe I can discuss (inaudible at 0:15:09.6) [0:15:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you looking -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I'm just hearing myself. I'm not —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:15:18.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thinking of these things before I say (inaudible at 0:15:20.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking out loud. Maybe it's (inaudible at 0:15:27.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:15:30.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I don't want to talk about (inaudible at 0:15:39.4) (Laughs) I don't. I just thought about (inaudible at 0:15:42.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's kind of an example (inaudible at 0:15:47.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That would be an example (inaudible at 0:15:48.4) You know what's bothering me though, don't you? I think it's something that (inaudible at 0:16:02.1) I think I'm (inaudible at 0:16:10.5) I don't — or something — I don't know. Something (inaudible at 0:16:25.9) I don't feel (inaudible at 0:16:30.6) I'm beginning to feel fairly comfortable. And, I'm not miserable —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind, I'm thinking (inaudible at 0:16:52.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:57.8) You don't feel like you're (inaudible at 0:17:01.5) [0:17:01.5]</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well but it sounds like you are (inaudible at 0:18:10.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am now. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the thought of going off to Europe and having (inaudible at 0:18:19.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:18:19.9) that I cared the most about, none of them have been really available to (inaudible at 0:18:24.7) But I say to myself that I have to (inaudible at 0:18:28.1) because I want to (inaudible at 0:18:30.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's sort of (inaudible at 0:18:35.4) doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No. (inaudible at 0:18:39.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:18:42.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also just tell myself it'll be all right. Which it will I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Sort of objectively you're (inaudible at 0:18:54.9) hand off and —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know if I can (inaudible at 0:18:58.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Weighing all of the possibilities (inaudible at 0:19:00.5) be all right. But it sounds like you said like you're doing it (inaudible at 0:19:06.4) [0:19:07.3]</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way that I — that it really is (inaudible at 0:19:19.9)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:19:24.4) because you don't want that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. When I get (inaudible at 0:19:33.0) I know that a lot of people (inaudible at 0:19:38.2) I've read about that a lot. And I don't know (inaudible at 0:19:49.0) And I don't really want to (inaudible at 0:19:50.8)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:20:06.0) I don't know if I should talk about being ashamed of wanting to get married or — but I don't know why that is. (inaudible at 0:20:22.5) I think I — or why I should —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like you choose between things to talk about. They're all like (inaudible at 0:20:57.3) [0:20:57.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:20:58.9) I don't know - not thinking about it, instead I go to the other (inaudible at 0:21:02.8) And then I feel (inaudible at 0:21:04.5) And, that's just — I've been thinking about them (inaudible at 0:21:10.6) I mean most people can just (inaudible at 0:21:19.0) sit down or do something (inaudible at 0:21:22.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like really the natural state for you is to want (inaudible at 0:21:38.6) It's like you have to almost like be violently turned off (inaudible at 0:21:44.3) there's the other (inaudible at 0:21:45.7)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:21:47.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you really have to work yourself up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I — I guess it's like a constant (inaudible at 0:22:14.2) Does that make sense? Yeah, I guess that's my (inaudible at 0:22:22.0) constantly reassurance being —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like constantly you need James to have (inaudible at 0:22:34.7) let you know what? That you're all right? That he's not going to leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Maybe. No. I guess just that he likes me.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I do think I'm getting worse. Because I don't think I was that bad. [0:23:12.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see yourself sort of running (inaudible at 0:23:19.8) more and more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like even (inaudible at 0:23:23.1) always together. I don't know. And I never used to be like that. And now, I have to force myself (inaudible at 0:23:40.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not to hang on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I really — that does —</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Like maybe that's just how it happens. There's nothing like you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not doing anything (inaudible at 0:24:00.8) [0:24:01.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Except with Drew, I was sick and (inaudible at 0:24:08.7) It just went on and on. And he's married. And I'm sure that I must — I'm sure that I got pregnant. (inaudible at 0:24:20.3) And I told him that at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know after it happened. And he was just horrified. (inaudible at 0:24:30.6) And, I thought he'd say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What (inaudible at 0:24:43.8) The only way to make that thing move between you and him was to get pregnant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's kind of — [0:25:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. Let me try it. Like you were helpless to make things move in any kind of simple forthright way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:25:26.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of that. Yeah. It wasn't a conscious act at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But looking back at it seems like (inaudible at 0:25:36.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Even a couple of months later, I was sure of that.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it's not a pattern I've done a hundred times so I can't tell if it's some kind of a sick thing or not. But maybe it's not at all. [0:26:27.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It hasn't really happened enough times to draw any conclusions whether it's something you're doing or whether it's just like (inaudible at 0:26:38.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When you start going out with any person, you don't think about marrying them. I mean literally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I don't know. I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like it just sneaks up on you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I don't know what to say. There's nothing else to say about my being ashamed of wanting to get married. (inaudible at 0:27:35.7) I am. I mean I don't think I would ever tell anybody that I'd like to do that except James because James tells me all the time that I want to get married. I mean he laughs about (inaudible at 0:27:45.9) And I tell him yeah, I probably do. But I'd never tell — I've never even told a girl (inaudible at 0:27:57.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like never told Drew straight or even told (inaudible at 0:28:02.3) [0:28:03.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Drew.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: James.</p>

<p>PATIENT: James. Like I want to marry you? Like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds like you hadn't set him straight. Like you were saying (inaudible at 0:28:12.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. If he would have teased me about it, I'd have told him. But I mean just sit down and say I'm ashamed of the fact that I want to get married because I think it's wrong for me to want to get married, I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How come? What's wrong with getting married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing is wrong with getting married except that there's a good chance that I won't. And I don't want to (inaudible at 0:28:42.5) about it. I guess maybe that's — if I don't, I don't want to live a life of you know like —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:28:49.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. An old maid with other people's children and all that kind of baggage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean that sort of sounds like that's what you can see in front of you is something that you — [0:29:01.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I don't see that. I can — I don't see that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really but I can't imagine like being (inaudible at 0:29:12.1) 45. When a woman is 45, she doesn't have very many dates. I'm sure. I mean maybe it's (inaudible at 0:29:24.2) but not many because men that are her age that might be unattached go out with younger women for sure. And if she doesn't have a family and her chances are that like the parents are dead and like that. And I don't want to be feeling sorry for myself then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And to think about getting married and have those chances slip through your fingers or whatever that is (inaudible at 0:29:54.0) 45 and lonely and kind of (inaudible at 0:29:56.9) about (inaudible at 0:29:59.6) having tales of being all alone. [0:30:02.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think — see what I think is that I probably won't (inaudible at 0:30:06.6) But I think that I'll just be kidding myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I'm saying. Like I have a friend that isn't married that's 34 maybe, has a wonderful job. She's very attractive. Has all the stuff. Very nice. But I — it's like she's living in a book.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you know what I mean? Like she's really (inaudible at 0:30:38.1) because of her. She really in some ways would like to be married maybe just to have a man around all the time or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: While she's living more like in a dream or something in the book like she's kidding herself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I mean. And I don't want to be like that but I can just see myself doing that. Telling myself that this is nice. [0:31:01.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stiff upper lip.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Telling myself that this is real nice and half believing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not letting myself think that it isn't. I'd like to be able to believe that it would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The image I have of you is that someone (inaudible at 0:31:17.9) in a career in something like keep yourself busy all of the time to convince yourself how brave it is. And then like there are moments when she's not busy, like alone at night or something and all of the sudden the loneliness sort of crowds in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:31:34.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, if I didn't think I was going to think like that but see, I'm sure that I will.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I wouldn't mind it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you couldn't — if it weren't —</p>

<p>PATIENT: False.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For your — yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how to convince myself that it's not false. Because in my head, I tell myself that it's fine. The only — it's just not as easy. That's all. [0:32:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And that's your head talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really don't feel like that. I wish I did.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got say what, I need a man or -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know. I think I'm just lazy. I really do. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean (inaudible at 0:32:34.7) 45 I can have dates if I hustle but —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to —</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to hustle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today I don't want to hustle. I haven't wanted to hustle for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See and I — and we go to bars. And I look around and I think oh God, I don't want to do this again. See and I think that now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know what you — you can think it now but not later or -? [0:33:03.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think it now. And I think it's going to be a lot worse later when —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:33:06.7) look at me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Now you have a fighting chance or something so it's not so bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Plus, I don't know. What's the age? Maybe. It may be 30 — somewhere between 30 and 35 that single girls really stop going to bars. I think. You can't do that. I don't know what else to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess that's the point. You don't do as much as — when your fear is like you can't do much of anything as much as you use to do because -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It gets harder and harder to break the ice —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With a man. There are like fewer and fewer possibilities.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's true that there are. Plus sometimes I tell myself that and maybe this is true (ph) but I don't care. But, oh I don't know. About a man and such, I'm not sure. It's like not a desperate craving for a man. That's — I just think it's laziness. I really do think it's laziness because sometimes I'll — [0:34:29.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want an old comfortable pair of slippers to walk around in. (inaudible at 0:34:36.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Sometimes I do. Yeah. And I would like that feeling (inaudible at 0:34:40.7) (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, so my solution to all of this is that I tell myself (inaudible at 0:34:48.7) that I'm going to go and live somewhere like — I don't know where. What's remote? Maybe the (inaudible at 0:34:58.4) Island with me and some animals, right? And that's all because then I won't have to — I will accept myself in isolation already. And I won't have to put on any pretend. And, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:17.9) of being kind of social. It's like really (inaudible at 0:35:31.2) alone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah. A lot of times. Sure. It's a lot easier for me. I don't know about for other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's easier for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there's no outside pressure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For sure. I'm sure that comes down somehow from my being along all of the time when I was a kid. I think that I liked it. [0:36:11.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was in high school, I like — I was real social kind of but I probably spent most of my time with a horse then. And we lived in the country then. And I probably spent most of my time with my horse. Really and then I mean those were the times I probably liked the most. And that's probably why I have this image (inaudible at 0:36:44.1) Because I would be isolated like in the city, I wouldn't feel like —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like you should be out finding men or something if they're all around you. [0:37:08.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or doing something. Or do something. I don't know. I don't know if it's — maybe it's finding men. I think part of it has to do with money too. I really do because that's another thing about my being lazy. Sometimes I'm — a lot of times for years I thought that I wouldn't mind being married. It doesn't — it's not necessarily to somebody rich but just being married to say — having a divorce or my husband die or something so I wouldn't have to work all of the time. I mean to have some income. And I do — I don't know if that's true but I've told myself that (inaudible at 0:38:00.7) I wouldn't mind that. But I don't know if that's true. [0:38:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not so much having the man around but it's like having the source of income.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that's horrible. I do. (Laughs) Because I think that — I tell myself that every person should feel — to make his own way like that. But, and it's actually — I probably (inaudible at 0:38:44.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it makes you feel like (inaudible at 0:38:50.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:58.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [0:39:00.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm saying a lot of different things (inaudible at 0:39:20.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kind of tumbling them out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And not be very square on anything (inaudible at 0:39:28.4) so.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel bad. Okay. So then I tell myself I want — I'd like to get married for the wrong reasons. Okay. Because those (inaudible at 0:40:17.3) [0:40:17.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Then it's —</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:40:20.7) Some of the things I've said about not being married about being lazy and all. But on the other hand, I wouldn't have chosen to get married just to be married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying something like the point is not that you're ashamed of wanting to get married per say. But the point is you're ashamed of wanting to get married to an old slipper (inaudible at 0:40:52.0) income.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never thought of it like that. Maybe. But I wouldn't just marry anybody. I would at least have to convince myself that I was in love with them even if whatever — if that means that you are, if you've convinced yourself then okay. I don't know. [0:41:19.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got to feel — but that sounds like you're saying underneath it all, you (inaudible at 0:41:29.5) because you feel good to be telling yourself that you feel better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I can't — actually I can't see me (inaudible at 0:41:37.5) I have a question. I never questioned until the last year that I dated Neil. I was questioning my feelings about him and prior to that I didn't question the fact that I loved him. And now I don't question the fact that I love James but maybe I should. I don't know. I don't know (inaudible at 0:42:00.9) [0:42:01.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also the thought of being (inaudible at 0:42:06.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:42:06.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like special times (inaudible at 0:42:12.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) (inaudible at 0:42:20.3) that you love somebody that you don't. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I'm not sure what to respond to. I'm hearing like hearing you're (inaudible at 0:42:42.4) but I sort of have trouble like locating what's confusing you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's confusing is that I've never thought about it until today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all new.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About questioning whether or not I was in love in somebody. I just always said oh, I'm in love with him. That's what — that's (inaudible at 0:43:03.6) [0:43:03.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:03.6) And like say it's a constantly, maybe in a negative way, maybe I'm not in love with James. And that's new. (inaudible at 0:43:25.9) one way or the other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know. There's no (inaudible at 0:43:33.2) I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It isn't a dictionary. It sounds like there's no inside definition. That we could flip a coin.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. I feel certain ways but you know. I can't think of anything bad. [0:44:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd rather (inaudible at 0:44:03.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:44:08.3) there was never any inner confusion until today. And the reason that there — I thought about it today is because we were talking about a lot of (inaudible at 0:44:18.3) I feel (inaudible at 0:44:21.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't hear you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I feel function today. Do you know what love was but (inaudible at 0:44:29.0) to himself he was. And I thought well, I never thought about that. I must regroup to that whenever I (inaudible at 0:44:34.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To feeling functional?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. To thinking what. What am I doing (inaudible at 0:44:41.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:44:43.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whenever I can't think of anything to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when you can't come up with anything, it then starts feeling what the hell am I wasting my time for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I don't need to do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm functional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm all right. [0:45:00.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What am I doing here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's sort of one — kind of like one way of dealing with your problems (inaudible at 0:45:07.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why is it so good? Why is (inaudible at 0:45:23.6) so good? Because I'm supposed to be thinking but I'm not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:45:27.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:45:28.6) Because you're asking me why it's bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:45:36.1) I could just as easily ask you why it's good. I'm just like hearing like that you're uncomfortable with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Why think that? [0:46:11.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens for you (inaudible at 0:46:15.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get frustrated. I don't know. Thinking about (inaudible at 0:46:35.4) Before I was thinking to myself things like that I was selfish. Then I was thinking if I (inaudible at 0:46:52.1) things I didn't (inaudible at 0:46:56.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've found. Okay. The silences are bad because sometimes you think of things that make you uncomfortable that you don't want to talk about. [0:47:10.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Not that makes me uncomfortable. Things I couldn't see. (inaudible at 0:47:20.2) talking about either again or talking about (inaudible at 0:47:23.6) And now I feel bad because I feel like I'm really (inaudible at 0:47:32.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really ruined it now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I have. And actually I was looking forward to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you just screwed it up because you (inaudible at 0:47:48.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does it sound like that's self destructive? I don't know. I don't know. Because I think (inaudible at 0:48:27.3) did it on purpose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't know what really you're asking. Are you saying — are you asking whether it's — whether you don't like yourself (inaudible at 0:48:42.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:48:44.4) because I don't think (inaudible at 0:48:45.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not only (inaudible at 0:48:49.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) That's what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I don't know. The answer is I don't know. I really don't know. And I guess thinking of the question maybe (inaudible at 0:49:07.4) understand what on purpose means. As opposed to accidentally or what -? [0:49:12.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like some people seem to set themselves up to be disappointed. That's what I mean. More the (inaudible at 0:49:23.5) And sometimes (inaudible at 0:49:27.3) but I don't think that that's all of the time. Maybe I do it more than I think. And I was just wondering out loud if I had done that now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me — is part of that like you wondered whether you felt how — okay, so you were looking forward to coming here. And you wondered whether like you then proceeded to do something to disappoint yourself with. Is that the -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess so. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that I did. [0:50:06.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I (inaudible at 0:50:08.2) I mean literally I didn't do anything. I didn't — I really feel — I have no idea what we've talked about. But I feel that it's not helpful for me (inaudible at 0:50:27.0) whatever it was that I talked about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not that you don't really know — it isn't — doesn't feel to you like you did anything to mess it up. It's just like somehow it didn't work today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't feel like that. I feel like I did. I do feel like I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't know what it is you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't let myself think about whatever it is I wanted to think about. That's what — yeah, I did do it. [0:51:04.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you kind of set yourself away from (inaudible at 0:51:08.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of that is because I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Know how to talk about —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (inaudible at 0:51:18.1) Is that the same thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it may be Janet. I — what I thought you meant though was something like you had these thoughts inside and you didn't know how to talk about them. Excuse me. Didn't know how to talk about them. So whether than kind of talk haltingly or incoherently or something like better just to not to pay attention to them at all — not get into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I also feel that they weren't important today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They were or were not? [0:52:02.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Nothing that I consider very important was entering my head. That's all. And I don't think (inaudible at 0:52:11.2) important there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then that makes me feel bad. But I — I mean I think there's like a pattern.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:52:22.0) The pattern is sort of constantly doubting whether (inaudible at 0:52:27.1) to your thoughts it sounds like. Or whether it's really almost (inaudible at 0:52:33.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I talk about that a lot. It must be something that I — because I feel like I sometimes you know. But I guess a lot of times when I'm feeling bad but I don't really know (inaudible at 0:52:59.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretend like you have no — nothing under you at all. Like — [0:53:13.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think. Yeah. Oh. Well, I feel that there probably is something. Something but I don't know what it is. Maybe it's mush.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like looking at yourself in the mirror (inaudible at 0:53:40.9) like that. Do you know what I mean? And it's like you're saying something like I doubt my validity or something or other. And then the other layer then thinks — it comes I doubt that I doubt my validity. And like it's — I don't know — yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's exactly right. [0:54:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is (inaudible at 0:54:09.5) Like no end to the chain of doubts and even that can be doubted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact the day that I was talking about that, do you remember the — I (inaudible at 0:54:33.0) when I was talking about it. I remember about it. That's because I'm a Libra. That's a real good thing to study.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. For no other reason. It sounds almost (inaudible at 0:55:21.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I want to (inaudible at 0:55:32.3) I never thought of (inaudible at 0:55:35.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said that — some people said to me (inaudible at 0:55:46.7) And I thought that they were crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't feel like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:55:53.7) Yeah. I feel like there's — like I just go along and (inaudible at 0:56:09.3) just sort of skim along because I don't know (inaudible at 0:56:13.2) [0:56:15.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like all mush underneath. Maybe there's nothing underneath.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like that.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm real disgusted with myself now. I really am. [0:56:59.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a terrible waste of time. And it's your fault.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had the feeling that I shouldn't (inaudible at 0:57:21.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you wasted both of our time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that feeling doesn't get any better because I feel like that a lot of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You often feel like you've wasted your time and wasted the time of the person you're with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I feel like that a lot of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like neither one of us (inaudible at 0:57:56.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think because there's nothing happening. [0:58:03.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sad. Yeah. Sad. Sad and disgusted. Such as life (inaudible at 0:58:29.3) So it's not all bad. It's just bad for me. It's bad for me because there's no (inaudible at 0:58:38.7) looking here and there. I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like in relations with other people, that's not all bad (inaudible at 0:58:49.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not all bad to like be (inaudible at 0:58:53.8) and be able to take other people's roles or points of view. The point — the problem is bad in that you can't get to yourself. [0:59:02.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess you even don't know if you're getting yourself there sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If one side was stronger than the other, what that be (inaudible at 0:59:26.4) or is that (inaudible at 0:59:27.3) inside? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. It's like — how do I want to say it? Maybe there's kind of like war and things inside of you and whichever is stronger maybe that's you at that moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that's true.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversations/sessions on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you think of something specific?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like an incident or what you feel -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tell me some more of what you want. [1:00:06.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well like what war — like I got sort of the general shape of it but I don't know what it leads to or -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About what we were just talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/session on tape)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I just said about going to (inaudible at 1:00:35.2) is that an example?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you mean it to be (inaudible at 1:00:39.2)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/session on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lost our funding and we're — many of us on the staff are moving and starting a clinic in Highspire.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:00:57.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And the clinic you said you liked it because that's a little bit more modern. [1:01:06.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:01:06.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:01:06.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Why don't I want to mess it up? Because it's good or because I'm sick of somebody wanting to (inaudible at 1:01:13.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Wow. It's like (inaudible at 1:01:15.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I feel like I have kind of where you are and it's like I can't quite draw it. It's like — well, it's like every path has two branches. And that goes on forever. I don't have (inaudible at 1:01:36.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Boy, what (inaudible at 1:01:37.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it feels like? Give me -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:01:48.4) saying that (inaudible at 1:01:50.0) coming out. So. [1:02:01.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:02:04.9) Did you say so what (inaudible at 1:02:10.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no, it's just like (inaudible at 1:02:12.5) I mean what are you going to do? I don't know. I really (inaudible at 1:02:25.8)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation/session on tape)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. You want to (inaudible at 1:02:32.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I want to say this (inaudible at 1:02:33.5) It's like the external things in my life are always like okay because we lived in a city. We lived in the country. I even like went to two churches until I was 16 — Catholic and a Protestant every Sunday both churches. I like having a lot of friends. And I like being alone a lot. This — it seems to me that all external things were like this. Now, I don't know if external things (inaudible at 1:03:23.9) on me or if I —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now it's inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like (inaudible at 1:03:34.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not that I don't — it's not that it doesn't (inaudible at 1:03:52.5) state of indecisiveness all the time. Just when I sit and talk about it then it sounds horrible. (Laughs) [1:04:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I — it's not like in terms of all of your actions that you're not — you don't perceive yourself as like — when you sit down and kind of try to sort out your feeling and who you are and where you're going like then everything seems to branch. And nothing makes a hell of a lot of sense (inaudible at 1:04:25.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Around Christmas time, I was trying to decide what to do about Drew. And a girlfriend of mine decided it would be a wonderful idea if I would make up a list of reasons — bad things, good things. And I — well I just — it was impossible. It was so impossible for me to do this that I just — it was horrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why was it impossible?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the list was going all over. That's all. It was just — it's —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like the bad reasons connected and the good reasons connected to the bad reasons. [1:05:01.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing could come —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like (inaudible at 1:05:12.2) it's not merely branched inside but it's like all kind of complicated and interrelated (inaudible at 1:05:22.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tell myself I'm like that because — let's see — oh, you're clear headed. You can see (inaudible at 1:05:29.8) Do you see that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:05:33.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way I think about myself about (inaudible at 1:05:38.8) and couldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of mottled.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like sometimes I don't know if I'm intelligent or stupid. Sometimes I don't know if I'm good looking or ugly or just —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Basic things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Things that I didn't know I think (inaudible at 1:06:00.8) [1:06:01.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like kind of the simple facts of one's existence that you should be able to take for granted but they're really all up for grabs for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why. I never thought of moving around when I was (inaudible at 1:06:40.1) but I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You were saying before like there's (inaudible at 1:06:47.9) from your outside. But (inaudible at 1:06:55.7) so why that's sort of like important in the — I don't know. It seems like being in a — let's see — it's like having a kaleidoscope inside you like (inaudible at 1:07:14.9) like different configurations. [1:07:19.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:07:33.4) understand that I don't just tell myself well, you feel like this so you're going to do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you don't — when you're not here —</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm not sitting (inaudible at 1:07:45.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible at 1:07:47.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think well — sometimes I think how do you feel and I get no answer at all. So I tell myself I feel like doing this. I don't feel like doing this. It's not like I'm always indecisive. But if I ask myself a question then I run into trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Wow. I — let me see if I'm getting this. It sounds like a difference between like listening to yourself and talking to yourself. And so long as you talk to yourself, you're fine. And that's what you do. And that's okay. No big deal. But when you shut up and kind of listen (inaudible at 1:08:25.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:08:25.4) talking. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's not like (inaudible at 1:08:38.4) I'm now defending myself. No. But it's not like one moment I'm a raving maniac like that. No. No. No. It's just (inaudible at 1:08:56.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you don't want me to think that (inaudible at 1:09:05.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the thought just hit me. I said uh-huh. [1:09:07.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sounding like (inaudible at 1:09:08.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:09:15.3) Like that's what you (inaudible at 1:09:16.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. No. I know what you're talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's not how it is for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like more — it's like very quiet. And it happens in your (inaudible at 1:09:24.1) times a day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:09:30.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to come again at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday. [1:10:09.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be fine. Yeah. Only one trip again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you leaving early or (inaudible at 1:10:17.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I can only get — whatever time (inaudible at 1:10:20.4)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think the last time he told me he was going to (inaudible at 1:10:48.7) It was wonderful. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:10:53.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'll see you at four.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:10:58.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm not clear. Am I getting mixed messages? Would you rather come at five? [1:11:05.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't — I couldn't go anyway. It's all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:11:07.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:11:08.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:11:09.8)</p>

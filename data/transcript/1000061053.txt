<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really appreciate this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm supposed to meet somebody at 6:30, you know, and it's a long way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I thought I'd chance it anyways. And the weather is (inaudible 00:29)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really awful out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really awful out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not too bad, I guess just, you know, the rush hour. But it's a switch from (Robertles) yesterday. It's supposed to get nice again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought Spring was on the way for sure (Robertles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I was talking to somebody last week. Actually, it was my girlfriend's boyfriend and he was telling me that he went to a psychiatrist a couple years ago and that he used to plan what he was going to talk about before he went to him. One of the things I was thinking I was going to talk about today with you a few minutes ago because, I don't know-it's still bits and pieces in my mind. [01:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you should plan it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, he-he suggested it. He said, well, he said he always did and he asked me if I had done it. I said "No." Because I just-I-I don't know. It's kind of stupid in a way, because then it's like going to a class or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I was wondering if he got anything out of it when he did plan. And he said the sessions-he stopped going-they-he said-well something in him that it didn't work out right or he didn't think it was doing him any good because he was just, like you said, planning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I haven't planned anything (Robertles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a (inaudible 02:12).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you don't know where to start sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, everything's still going okay. It's nice and, I don't know, I'm going to be moving in the next couple of months downtown and everything, so I'll be closer to here. My landlady was around last night. And they're-well I was planning to move anyways, but they're raising the rents and everything, so... I guess there will be more things to do downtown. I've told this before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you looking forward to the move?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not the actually process of moving, but I guess the move, yeah. So I postponed it in December. I was supposed to move then and my lease was extended four months. But-because I didn't really want to move in Winter, but I hate packing and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Another big job. [03:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. I don't know. I guess, though, after you found a place and you settle all the money things, it's not too bad. But I have to get a bigger apartment because the baby needs to have some room. He's right in the middle of everything where I am now. He hears everything. We have a birthday party for him next Wednesday, just cake and coffee and ice cream for some friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it a first birthday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So he won't know what's going on but he likes to have a lot of people around. I guess when he gets older I'll get the hats and everything. Little kids like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that going to be fun for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A party?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (Robertles). I just-I guess-want-I-well having people around, but I think the excitement of the people and him that will-that will really be something too. He just-it's so nice to see him squeal with delight and everything. I love it when he's happy and he's smiling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so sweet. He's a clown. I was taking all the laundry and everything off the bed and putting it in something else and then-the other-dirty pillowcases and everything I had on the floor and he jumps on it and put his head down like he's sleeping-taking nap because somebody started to say "Awww" like that. So whenever he sees a big pile of clothes or anything, he'll just jump in it. So I took some pictures today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He gets around a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He gets around a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I took him for a walk on the street the other day and he just looks at everything on the sidewalk-wants to pick it up and then he notices the bigger things around him and he doesn't know where to go first. It's really something being that little on the ground.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whenever he sees cats or dogs he goes absolutely wild. [05:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He really keeps you turned on all the time to something</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-it's-you kind of see things from his eyes. You're like-you see everything-the whole picture and he just sees little things at a time as he looks from the ground up he gets real excited. And I don't-I-somebody was just asking me last night about the harnesses on babies, you know, that the mothers put on? And I always thought it was a terrible thing to do and I often asked myself if I would do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you (Robertles)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And-because I realize now why they put them on. But I don't think I'll put it on yet (Robertles). I think if I'm fast enough and keep him from running into the street he'll be okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll be a little animal walking down the street with a harness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really wouldn't want to trammel your child like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the street that I live on is pretty busy, too. But, I'll just have to watch him. We were out yesterday and I had brought-I didn't know how cold it was but I-he had jeans on, little slacks, and he had about three sweatshirts on (Robertles) and he was walking with his hands out. It was really funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He really gives you a kick a lot, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a cute kid. He's-I don't know, he's just amazing. Everything used to say that all the stuff is inherited and everything, you know, like from different people and families and I don't think it is. I just think it's the baby's feeling of love and a good feeling that he has about himself that lets him do all these things, I think. But, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of saying you feel like you can really give something good to your baby to really make him a happy baby...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...not really like you were or his father.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's kind of natural. He knows that he's cute and I love him and everything. Did I tell you that I didn't really know that I loved him until he was about seven weeks old. Did I tell you that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh Uh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're supposed to love your baby when they bring him down from the nursery and everything, but all I did was I held him and I get him over and everything. I thought he was cute and I was eager to see him, but I didn't feel-or I didn't really know that I loved him until he was seven weeks old and I think he was ready to fall or something. I knew I didn't want him to get hurt and I realized that I loved him and everything. So...that was kind of strange.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about that now? [08:26]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I said, I thought that I would love him right away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know I just-looking at him and-well I thought I'd feel a lot of things when I first saw him. All I did was just stare at him and he was up there, his eyes are going back and forth trying to keep them opened. But, like I said, I was eager to see him and have him come down. I'd sneak up to the nursery, too, to peek at the little babies at night a couple times. But I did not really love him until he was a little older.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you feel when you discovered you loved him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just-you know, like it dawned on me. (inaudible 09:18) and say "Hey, I love him! I really do!" And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 09:23)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a surprise in that I-well, I think it was a surprise because I realized that this was a kind of love and I did feel it in this way for him. Like Robert, when he was in Florida, he wrote-he said-he thought I'd be upset by it-he says "I think I love Adrian." Or he said it on the phone and he was expecting me to say something about it and I said "Well, that's okay because I..." He wasn't with Adrian and me as much as I'd been with Adrian alone because he was going back and forth to school and everything. I said to him-I said "Well, that's okay because I didn't realize I liked him until he was about two months old" and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now I think he's the most important thing in the world to me. I really think he is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's really the core of your life. Your feelings are wrapped up in him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A lot-and now I even think he's more important than my parents, my sisters and everything. Although I still love them but I realized when I'm making any kind of decisions or just planning things that he comes first. He even comes first, I think, even before me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. It's really the main thing that you think about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and when he was little, when he was in the hospital I know one-I guess it was-I guess you'd call it night-well it was going into the next morning. One of the student nurses or somebody made a mistake and they brought Adrian down at five o'clock and they weren't supposed to bring him down at that time for the feeding-just-I guess-nine-excuse me, nine o'clock or midnight feeding was last feeding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For the schedule that we were on and this girl made a mistake and she brought him down at five o'clock one morning and I didn't expect it, you know (Robertles)? And I thought-I could hardly see and my eyes were all sandman-ish and my stomach-I had a caesarean section-and, you know, just by that time-whenever you stand up, my stomach was sore-but I was really surprised to see him and I said "Okay, I'll feed him." It was a little shock to have to start feeding the baby and then later I learned that she had made a mistake but in a way it was good because I knew that I might be getting up one, two o'clock, plus five o'clock. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like discovering it really was your baby.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That really did it. That one can happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make you believe (inaudible 12:36).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I'm going to have to start taking care of him. And I wouldn't have learned anything about how to take care of him at all except two days before we left he was rooming in with me and there was a student nurse-she was showing me how to clean everything, his navel and all that type of thing and how to take care of him. Otherwise I really would have been lost. And so I took him home and I started taking care of him and I just learned a real lot and just so many things that I never even dreamed that you'd have to do for a little baby.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like when you think about it now and you think back to when you had him, it was almost like beginning "Who is this kid? What do I do?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is, like, I think now that I was so ignorant at the time. I mean even while I was pregnant, I was just doing so many things. I was running, jumping over things, I was carrying suitcases and shopping bags. If you've had a normal amount of exercise all your life it's not supposed to hurt you. But, I guess in the first two or three months of pregnancy, you're supposed to be really careful. And during the whole pregnancy I was just doing really crazy thing and I could have miscarried, I guess, if something wasn't all right. But, you know, even up to the last minute I was just-I really didn't know about being extra careful and, as I said, having Adrian and now having the whole experience behind me I just realized a whole lot of things. [14:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like you just didn't know, but in a way it's sort of like he just wasn't real enough for you to change anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and Robert and I didn't know what we were going to do and everything. I mean, like the whole experience was just going through it blindly. Like they say, ignorance is bliss. You know, if I had it be my second baby I'd probably be worried a whole lot more and just be trying to do so many more things for the baby and for my health that-I don't know, it's just the whole thing was, you know, kind of a dream. I still think of it that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all hazy and kind of none of it was real?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Until that seventh week, I guess, when it came crashing down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And like now, I just-I keep thinking about that all the time that there is really a little baby in the room with me and he's doing all these things. He's really a person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because in the be-well, I guess during, you know, the first four or five months that Adrian was in the apartment, I just felt like I was doing all these things for a little person, you know. When you're just looking at the baby it's kind of like a wrinkled old man, you know? It's kind of a funny thing to look at because the body and everything are still strange. It's like the fetal look I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was-I just felt I was doing things for little person there. No (inaudible16:18).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost like you were thinking that he had a whole mind and was thinking things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you wonder a lot about that when the baby's first born if he thinks and he knows things. Like even now, I wonder-but I can tell more because Adrian is a lot more active. But I don't think he really has an active remembrance of the past or he knows about the future. It's just right now. Because, well, if he's spanked or something, you know, he forgets about it. I don't really-I don't really think he does remember too much but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're beginning to feel now like you're kind of in touch with the way he thinks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like I can determine in some instances what he's going to do next. I guess that's kind of logical, you know, when you see him and he's going to pull something but it's just-it's really an exciting thing, you know, watching a little person grow.</p>

<p> I'm trying to push-no it was starting all over-I mean I kind of wish he was young again, you know. But I keep reviewing it in my mind. I can see how women always want to have-you know like when their child is growing up I can see how they would want to have another baby because like the whole experience of taking care of this little person, cuddly and soft, it's really nice. But, you know along with that are the other problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the feelings you'd like to recapture from when he was young?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just, you know, how he looked when I brought him home and the way his legs were curled up and how tiny his fingers were and the long nails. Just-I don't know-just the way he'd sleep most of the day (Robertles). Like I said, I was so busy learning I didn't really-I didn't really know or see as I went along. I was just hoping I got through the day and the next day I'd do everything okay to make him comfortable and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you figure you missed some good parts because you were feeling so afraid about keeping him dressed and fed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't-I don't think I really missed them, but I just didn't enjoy them as much. They didn't last as long because I was busy getting ready for something else. But, you know, like I said, I can clearly remember everything. But I know that people-doctors-whoever-say babies grow real fast and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you can't really ever capture it completely at any particular time because it just keeps changing. [19:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was yesterday I was with him and I was going to buy-I saw some little short sets that were real cute and I was thinking of buying him some for summer and I even picked out a couple. But then I put them back because I knew that he would-I wouldn't really know his size in three months and they might be too small or too big and so I put them back. But they were real cute. It's another thing that-you know, I wish he could wear his clothes longer because he grows so fast again and he can only wear them maybe three or four times and they're real cute clothes but then you have to put them away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's another thing that's kind of going at double speed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really feels like he changes almost too fast so you're going to have to really get to latch on to him in a moment and say "This is Adrian and this is me and this is how we are." By the time you do that he's up at the next steps and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think right now because he can sort of-he makes noises and he just he's at-I don't know-I can't say he's at a state. He just likes to be cuddled a lot. He wants to sit on my lap and or put his head back on my shoulder. He can hold his bottle, but sometimes when he's getting tired, I'll hold it for him. I just feel a little closer to him then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must be a really warm feeling when (inaudible 21:05).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's-all your love comes out then, you know, it's really a very content time, I think. And then he's up again (Robertles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you wish you could hold on to those times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. I guess-well, it depends on my mood. If I'm tired I wish he'd go to sleep. But during those moments I do think this is one of the nicer things I'll remember. This is one of the-oh, I guess-situations women talk about, you know, the close attachments of the mother and child when they're younger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really seems precious to you. Almost like it's changing to fast for you. You wish you could hang on to it in a sense. [22:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, pretty soon he'll probably be starting in school (Robertles). I want to keep up with new little books and everything he can't read yet, of course, but just newer ideas, too, because like the workbooks, you know, Dick, Jane and Spot and the other people. You know, they're finding out that the way they're presented to the child over a number of years, it kind of does something to their mind. So they're trying to get more creative books and, you know, just change the whole pattern of music and TV shows more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That a good sign, you'd like him to have those kinds of experiences.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I have to-like I didn't know too much about the other books because, you know, we never had any little kids around and I haven't been in grade school for a long time. So I just hope that I can keep up with him and know what's going on, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like, in a way, being afraid sort of that he'll change too fast and you won't be able to know where he's going to be enough ahead of time to get yourself ready for it. [23:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess maybe it's something, you know, that happens with the first baby, but I think it's something that's just happening in the world, period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just feels like everything is changing too fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or myself. Because you don't have-I guess I've been kind of lazy that way, not keeping up with things too much, or keeping up with them but never going into detail or never really seriously getting interested in it so I knew something about it.[24:03]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way you feel like somehow things are getting away from you. You're not really up on stuff enough for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh Huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it puts kind of a burden on you somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I keep saying to go and, you know, do something. It kind of resorts back to the fact that I told you I was, I don't know, kind of academically lazy. I would do things or never really finish them or something like that. So I'm kind of afraid of that tying in to teaching Adrian things, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? You're afraid that you won't teach enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or I won't finish what I start to do. I'll just give him a taste of little things like books and music and then just drop the whole thing completely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like sort of what you mean about just knowing a little bit about what's happening but never getting into detail. [25:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel sort of lost like you sort of see the tips of things but not really what's going on underneath so much sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you can't stick with them or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I don't know. I never-yeah-I don't know if I-I didn't have the incentive to stay with them or I just went on to something else or I felt if I did stay with it I wouldn't get it or I'd fail or something. I don't know. There were just, you know, a whole lot of things and that. Or maybe, you know, I thought deep down I knew it so why should I even bother finishing it or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of leaves you feeling a little lost right now, like it's all these things swimming around and you sort of feel the edges of them as they swim by or something. And you're just standing there with all this stuff swooping by. [25:57]</p>

<p>PATIENT: An-another thing is that I don't know which one, like music or art, or which one I should start with with him and, you know, if I should go through it at the early ages, you know, start something that's (inaudible 26:13).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of twenty kinds of questions you're asking yourself like "Where should I be? What should I stay in?" and "Should I move out of this into something else?" and just sort of like feeling dislocated like everything is just swimming around with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I want to be the type of parent who introduces his child to a lot of different subjects when he's younger. I mean, do it while he is young.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really want to give him everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if I can give him everything but I-I'd-yeah, I'd like to give him a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you can't figure out if you're going to be able to do it right or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And-I don't know-well-I just-I don't know-I think a lot of times he might have a harder time when he's older and I just want to do everything I can to help him and to see that he's starting okay. It's the-you know-Ch-I think I keep thinking I've told you things before, you know, once when Adrian-he had and infant's disease, nothing serious. But it was a real infant's disease and I told Robert-I wrote him in a letter that Adrian was sick or something. He said "Well, he'd better get used to all these problems because he's just going to have a lot on him as he goes along."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really afraid that he's going to suffer terribly when he gets older.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Going back to what he-Robert wrote, I realize that he's right. But you still don't want to see a little person go through a lot of trouble. Through a lot of bad times. I don't know-he'll probably be a very tough little guy. The way he is now. I think he'll be okay at times but I just like to reassure myself that he will be, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. I guess you sort of figure if you can give him everything you possibly can now, you'll put him in a better position to handle all the pain he's going to have later if it comes. [28:35]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think he's going to suffer so much later?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just-well, I think the thing that he might suffer most about is his father not being around all the time, if he isn't. Or the fact that-you know, like, certain people I was feeling in my family and my mom and dad's the way they are-I mean not-they keep reminding Adrian that he's illegitimate, you know. I just-they -I don't think they'll do it to be mean, but they just bring it up every once in a while. And I think when he learns what it means from outside, it's going to bother him a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think it's going to really be hard on him that you're not married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think, you know, as he's growing up when the other kids talk about their moms and dads and everything and that they're all together, I think if it bothers him that way I think he might have a hard time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you project yourself into later years you always imagine yourself being alone with Adrian. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I-I don't know-well I'm sure Robert will be around and he'll do everything he can to play with Adrian and be the father-type. But I-I don't think it's to the point that we're going to get married or stay together. But-I don't know-I think because of me more than Robert, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's sort of-that's the way you see the future. It's sort of you and Adrian with Robert kind of coming in and out of things. Nobody else really around. Just you and Adrian with you protect-</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean like a husband for me or something? Or just my parents and sisters and stuff?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't have anything really in mind, just this feeling with just you-that you're protecting Adrian by yourself from this cruel world outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I guess so. I don't really-well-I don't know how long my parents are going to live, but just the way my sisters and their husbands are, they're very involved in their work and everything. So I think basically that I'll be the one that will have care of and protect him, I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a sort of sad, scary future in a way, isn't it? As you describe it, I feel...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...for you a kind of emptiness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...as far as-I don't know-just as far as doing things for Adrian or doing them well because I want to do that. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a kind of empty feeling I get as you talk about it. A very close thing with you and Adrian but everything all around being very far away. Somehow a very remote and kind of a hostile (inaudible 31:45).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I gue-I guess maybe, I don't know. I don't think of people hostile but I think when it comes down to it that I'll be the one that will have to take care of him. So now I think about it a lot because you have to if you have a little kid but I don't know-I-I basically see me taking care of him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it seems like you're saying it feels like a really (inaudible32:17) because it's just you and he's going to grow up so fast.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. See, I never-I've never done it before and it's going to be hard for me because I never really had to work hard before as far as money went or just doing things for myself because my parents always took care of everything. Every financial or business-type thing, they've always done it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like you've hardly had a chance to learn how to take care of yourself and now you have...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't think I really did learn how to take care of myself that well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like too much all at once because when you have yourself and a child and nobody else around to help you take care of him...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think-I don't know-for some odd reason I think I'm able to take care of someone else better than I am myself. I mean having Adrian there, he's a person that I can take care of better than myself. I don't know why that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If Adrian needs something you can make yourself do it but when it comes to yourself you can't make yourself stick to it until you take care of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or he's-yeah-he's a person that I can see. I can see everything that's happening to him from a distance. Whereas myself I am right here...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you can't even tell what you need sometimes. But with Adrian when he needs something it really moves you to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I guess because there is someone else there-the other person-whereas just myself (inaudible 34:03). I guess that would kind of feel scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you kind of nervous now? It seems like you're kind of nervous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-I just-the more that I've been talking about it, the more nervous I've been getting. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it a hard thing to talk about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's not really hard. I've just been thinking about it a lot lately. It's not really hard to talk about, but like I said, I just keep-I guess getting-I'm getting more closed in by it. Or just talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just-I feel it more-I think more-I'm thinking more about it now that I am thinking about it. And I'm more worried about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. After you talk about it it's like things you've been worrying about get bigger and realer and when you start sharing you kind of... Are you mostly afraid that you won't be able somehow to meet the enormous demands that you feel on yourself? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's not that-well-tied in with it is just the way things are happening in the world. How people are getting laid off jobs and prices are going up, like the bus rates and the rent rates and everything. And I kind of wonder what everything is going to turn out to be like or where everything is going to be in a little while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way I hear you saying that you have nothing, but you feel you can really hang onto with any (inaudible 36:02).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I don't know what's really going to happen. And that implies kind of an instability. And I've always told-a couple of years ago that I was always (inaudible 36:18), you know, and everything was stable around me like my home life or my parents taking care of everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like being ripped away from a secure little place and everything sort of whizzing by and not being able to see any order in that where you can see where you're going to be and have anything really you can hang onto that will make it all stop moving so fast so you can get a hold on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because last time, or a couple times ago, I told you, I think that I'm kind of living from day-to-day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I still am but now this is-these are-this is one of the times where I'm thinking about the future and everything and I guess this is why it kind of forces me to live from day-to-day because when I do think about it, I'm at a standstill. [37:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like when you look into the future you feel uncertain. You feel Adrian's so scary that you just sort of pull back and you say "Okay, well I'll worry about dinner tonight and tomorrow when I get to it." Just can't stand to think about it, so it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I can think about it but, like you said, because it is so uncertain, you just forget it. Well, not forget it but just come back and think about right now. </p>

<p> I was thinking about getting a job soon. At least a part-time job. But I haven't decided what area. How does it feel? Is that something that would make you feel...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, you know,...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...more stable in some ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...well maybe to be earning a little money. But I-well I guess that's the main reason I'd do it is to have a little money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is money something that you worry about now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this month I have (Chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't-I don't sit up nights thinking about it. But, like if-if I worried-when I-I know I have to move at the end of April and have some-I'll need a month's rent and then another security deposit and I don't know how I'm going to pull it all off because my security deposit that I'll be getting back from the apartment I have now, I guess that'll take a week or two to send back to me and everything. So-and I don't know how I'll get the month's rent unless my social worker says that they take care of it for the (inaudible 39:12).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds in a way to me like you feel like there's a lot of stuff that you have to somehow handle all by yourself without having anybody you can really lean on-anybody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I suppose I want to do it myself so I hate to keep borrowing money from my parents or my older sister. When things really get tight, my dad will help me out. But like I said, I don't really want him to. I think I should start working soon to just help myself and Adrian a little bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it about wanting to do it yourself? What does that mean to you? Feel like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it, you know, it means that I don't have to depend on my dad for money and just-I don't know. I don't like-every once in a while he'll say "Grow up. You have to take care of yourself." Or "You still haven't grown up", whatever way he puts it. But I don't like to have him say it. When all four of my sisters were living at home, my dad was the only male in the family, like I said, he took care of everything for my mom and my sisters. So he's kind of used to it but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if you don't take care of yourself it puts you in a position where he can tell you you're not really doing a good job with your life or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, not so much a good job as that I just can't handle it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, because every once in a while he says-they have-first of all, my parents have a big house, you know, a ten-room house in Elm Park, two stories-every once in a while my dad says "You know, why don't you and Adrian come back and live upstairs. It's sort of like an apartment the way it's closed off, the stairs and out the door and everything. And I just don't want to do it. So I couldn't go back to living with them. But I just have this fear in the back of my mind that if things don't work out financially, dad, one day I might find myself back there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you're in a trial period now trying to prove that you can get along on your own. Almost like feeling afraid that you've failed at your task. You'll have to go back to being a child again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've been doing it for a couple years but I guess throughout all that time I've kind of felt that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really means being an adult somehow. All this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you went back there it would be like admitting that you couldn't be an adult and you had to be their daughter again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have this-I think I told you last time-I just have this fear of being stuck near my parents (Chuckles)-stuck with my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that embarrassing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not embarrassing. It's just-I don't know. I have this fear that I'll be overpowered by my parents and I'll always have to go on doing what they say and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd never really cut loose and get your own life together somehow. You'd always have them saying that you're still a child, you're still fifteen and you're still going to-even if you have this baby-we'll just tell both of you what to do now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you wouldn't really be able to be Adrian's mother so much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think of it that way. Just-I just think of it being under my parents' control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I-that's the thing that bothers me most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like there's lots of (inaudible 43:13).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It always has bothered me. Everything I say and do-well, if they-if my parents say something to my sisters, they can answer back or say something. But I have always had this fear of being controlled by them. So whenever they do say something I get real tense about it and come back with some kind of an answer that just aggravates the whole situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't ignore it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you just can't handle them close or the only safety for you is to be able to live on your own somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. Because when I am back there I keep-I have this feeling that they're going to become real dominant again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They'll kind of gobble you up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that's why when I visit them I can't stay. Well, I can stay overnight but I can't stay two or three days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if we go out with Adrian-because I just have this feeling come over me from all sides, just telling me what to do. [44:18]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that feel like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's a feeling like being bottled-up. Like you said, that was the definition. Like, you know, I see other people can handle it, like ignore their parents or gently tell them that they're going to do something else but, like I said, I start getting really aggravated about it and then I go and blow it and start screaming or acting like a real kid again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how they win sort of, is when you finally-that what you're afraid of, a time when you're feeling like you've slipped back into being a kid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not the kid so much. The part that they're dominating me and I just can't really do what I want and, like you said, be free. [45:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Seems like it's just a constant flow and like you're always having to pull against it even when they're not around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My mom, she calls me every day. And I know she's doing it for my own-well because she's concerned about me but I just have this feeling that she's checking up on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like they just don't trust you to somehow to handle your own life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's trusting me. It's just that there they are again. That's the feeling I get when she calls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, sort of like you felt loose and free of it and then all of a sudden...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it's terrible-I can't even talk to her. I say I'm busy or something. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really takes a lot of energy to sort of handle her without losing something important along the way. I mean, you have to gear yourself up for that every day and each weekend. It seems like that would be a big drain on you somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're a lot to handle. I mean they're good. They've really been good to me and everything. But they're just a lot to handle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just seems that they expect so much of you, like you never really quite make it somehow (inaudible 46:36).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I-well I don't think they think of that or they show that every time they do something. I just-well-we've always been close in a way. Physically we're all, you know, (inaudible 46:53). But like when I told my parents all these things that I felt happened, what I feel they've done to me and how I react whereas-they just don't see where along the line it could have happened. They just don't see it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that leave you feeling like it's not right for you to complain about it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-I don't-I don't-things that I kind of-I tell them and then I just don't talk about it anymore because-well-I am talking to them-it's just that they don't believe it and it doesn't really sink in and everything. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that leave you feeling when they don't believe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just-I don't talk about it any more but I-you know, it's still the way I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I mean is when you try to explain to them the problems that you have with them even though they've tried so hard and been so good to you in so many ways and they just sort of can't hear it. How does that leave you feeling inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I guess kind of hostile that they don't realize that's the way I feel and that's what I think they've done to make it the way I react towards them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's sort of like you're saying that there have been some ways that hurt you in spite of trying hard to be good all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.. I think they went out-they went out of their way to be good and I don't know. It kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like it's important in some ways for you to get them to recognize that even though they tried so hard they really did hurt you in some serious ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's only important at times when-I don't know-when something recalls that past or something that happened then. Like for instance my (Chuckles) first boyfriend-he's everything that a girl could have wanted, plus her parents. At the time my father thought he was a real smart aleck and all this type of thing and so it went along. We dated and we broke up. And the reason that we broke up is because-I don't know, I just-my parents were pressuring me so hard that they thought he was a jerk and he'd never amount to anything and do anything worthwhile and all this-everything. They tortured me with it day and night and they just pounded it into my brain and I kind of repeated the whole thing to him. </p>

<p> We broke up after that and then I just realized that I was my parents' puppet. How could I see another person through their eyes? I'd have to examine the person myself and everything. And I kind of resented my father, especially, because we did break up and I just felt that my parents were the cause of the whole thing and now the boy's parents and my dad's aunt kind of keep in touch and my dad keeps thinking that the boy and I can get in touch again if my father does something-writes to his aunt or something. Or writes to the boy's parents, that type of thing and he doesn't realize that things have changed and I don't really want him to do it now. My father says "Nothing's changed" He doesn't think a couple of years have gone by or anything like that and he still things that he can make everything all right, you know? That's one example.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's actually hard-it's like he really caused you a lot of pain in that and then he acts like nothing ever happened-that he can just do anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or he's trying to make it up and he doesn't realize that he can't do it now. So it was just bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, it's like a double injury. That he's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, yeah, that he's bringing it up now, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he doesn't even-like if he hurt you and he apologized, you know? But it's like a double thing-like he hurt you and then he doesn't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: He didn't apologize.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I mean, it's like a second hurt that he doesn't even take seriously that that was a real thing that he (mussed ph 51.33) with and he can't just make everything all better by arranging things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really kills me because out of a clear, blue sky he'll bring the boy's name into the conversation and everything-like he's still with us or something. And it just really tears me up because he still thinks that he's going to make everything okay again. I don't know if he does it-he brings the boy's name up to tease me or something. I ignore him but, I don't know, it kind of hurts when he brings it up, you know, the name. Because remembering the whole thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a funny thing the way he keeps bringing it up when it hurts so much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost like a terrible kind of insensitivity to how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he-he's the type of person who thinks he and his wife are going to pick out their daughter or their son's mate or something. Because he's really kind of old-fashioned. His parents-they believed in the matchmakers and the whole type of thing like that. Where, you know, you pick out somebody's mate and you see them on their wedding day. That type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From your point of view, it's sort of like nothing that you ever did was good, that your choices were never the right guy and they were all no-good bums.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they weren't no-good bums, but my father though they were because, you know, they didn't do what he wanted to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the only good guys were the guys he was going to find for you and then he would just arrange it and sell you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles) Because my father, he's not satisfied with either my older sister or my younger sisters' husband-husbands. He's always got to find something wrong with them and it's really bad the way he tears them up. But my two sisters were strong enough to say these were the guys that they liked and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Still, it must be hard on them in a way to have to live with your father's picking at them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean the two fellows?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's also on your sisters.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well my sisters just ignore it and let my two brothers-in-law are kind of alienated from my father because he's been such a-I don't know-(Chuckles) I was going to say a real word there... He has been a real stinker about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say that you can't handle your parents in a way a big issue in that is that you can't get it to stop bothering you when your father doesn't like the guys you pick out and doesn't like the way you're living or something and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you wish he...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it doesn't bother me so much at times-well, I guess now I can handle it more, but every once in a while it irks me and I don't really want to hurt my parents. Like I said, that's the main thing that makes me stop and think about the whole thing but my mother, as I said, goes along with my father. She's so confused at times. She'll change her mind back and forth as far as what she thinks about a person. Or like that guy I was talking about. Yeah, that bothers me that she can't really make up her mind, too. [55:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you can't count on her in a way to help you face your father's pressures on you because she might just yield to them any time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In most cases, my mom's always stood up for my sisters and myself and she's-at times she's become so ridiculous about it, created these big stories and everything you just can't believe her. I mean, she'll go overboard. I don't admire her because she never does really stick to the truth or one story because she loves my sisters and everything. I don't know, she's just kind of a whole mix-up there. But at other times-how should I say this-my father, I guess, has kind of intimidated her so much about certain things that she can't really have her own opinion and make up her mind on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like even when she can get clear enough to have an opinion and be on your side it doesn't always really help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or he'll say something about it like it's not good. His opinion is the only one that's good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the thing you really wish you could have is some kind of way that when he starts pulling on you like that or judging you that you could do like your sisters do and just be able to ignore it without feeling so torn up by it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm. I think over the past couple of years I've been getting better but I-I just still go over it in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure it must be very difficult.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, even some of the things that he'll pick on are outrageous. You wouldn't believe them if I told you. But-I have been getting better about it but....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's really hard for you to somehow accept the anger that you have toward him for the things he's hurt you with. Every time you start to think about that you start thinking about how good he is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he doesn't... Can I interrupt here to tell me what time...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is that? Six-thirty?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's five past six. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Is it okay if we stop because I've got to get (inaudible 57:38) by six-thirty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could I just pursue that point for a second?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that one important thing that I keep hearing you saying is that he's hurt you an enormous amount-in a way he keeps hurting you-but he's been so good to you, too, that it puts you in a really hard position. If you start to feel that anger then you feel like you have to be good to him because he's been so good to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is-in that is that my father could hurt anybody because he gets so super picky about things. So I mean if everybody-if my sisters or my mom left him, he could hurt them every minute of the day. He's just like that. I guess, in a sense, I'm just kind of super-sensitive towards people. But I think after that whole big incident with that boy, that was the-that's where the bomb dropped and I realized that if I continued listening to my parents, my dad especially, I'm really going to be in trouble. I'll be doing everything that they want and I won't be happy. So I think after that incident I just kind of changed a little and realized that my parents aren't right about everything. I regretted that whole thing ever since. And so when it-I guess-well-not-well-romance-when it comes to romance or most any other thing, I've just been doing what I want to do or doing what I think will make me happy and not my parents. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you really know now that it's really in your best interests no to listen to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my best interest to really think for myself, not have them do it all for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I don't want to hold you. [59:46]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: My trip to Florida on vacation was stressful in the beginning, to say the least, because it was recital time. That's never the best time of the year for my mom. It was further exacerbated, the stress that she had, which consequently got passed on to me, was that she was missing 15 costumes from the costume company. She was thinking she had to make them because these were her beginning students. You know, with the older girls they understand. Maybe they'll complain but, you know, these little girls don't quite understand.</p>

<p>[00:53.1]</p>

<p>Everything that I did, like after I taught dance class for my mom while she was running to go get fabric, and I ended it — well, I thought I ended it after an hour which generally classes go for, and then I went to go to the store to get soda. When my mom came back for me — because I was waiting there for like 5 or 10 minutes — I was like, oh well, you know. I tried calling my mom. She's not going to be there.</p>

<p>So I go and get soda, and I'm not there when she goes to pick me up and she starts yelling at me. And I'm just like "Well, class ended and I was waiting around for 5 or 10 minutes and I tried calling you on your cell phone. No answer. So what am I supposed to do?" She was ultimately frustrated that I let the — it was an adult dance class, and I had let the adult go out earlier, because she wanted to ask the adult whether she liked the kid's costume. Something like that. So I mean, little instances like that —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she hadn't communicated that to you.</p>

<p>[02:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she hadn't. And when Sassy the cat peed on the — she sprays on things. She's very territorial. This started five years ago when other cats were brought into the house. While she was in the sewing room, she sprayed on the lace that my mom had ironed. It was the day before the show, so I thought my mom was going to kill the cat. She chased it out. But I guess I sort of felt that I could be that Sassy. I could be kicked out of the house, knowing how my mom acts on who I'm dating. She's really nice, but when she's upset, she just loses perspective.</p>

<p>[03:02.8]</p>

<p>We eventually got the costumes because one of the little kids' fathers called up. And tension was also rising because my sister and my mom — my sister does a lot. She's teaching and she commutes two hours to get to the dance studio every Saturday which takes up time, gas and money. So she was always complaining about not getting paid enough, not getting appreciated. Which in one sense, for her teaching, she did do a lot, but for the recital she didn't do anything with the costumes. She didn't share the losses — like my mom spent $900 getting money for costumes, cutting the music.</p>

<p>[03:59.2]</p>

<p>And it's really frustrating because I want to tell my sister "You do a lot teaching, but you're really just not helping out with the show." Eventually I just said nothing and just said "Well, you know." The fact of the matter is she's going to be a counselor, hopefully when she takes her exam in a few weeks, and she's not going to have time to teach dance. So I think that sort of resolved itself.</p>

<p>I talked to my dad. We had a big family falling-out after the first show when all of us went and Tammy stormed off, because I said to my sister "Maybe I'll [find a conference]." I had forgotten my mom was going to pay me for all the work I was doing. I was running rehearsals, I was staying up late helping with the costumes and doing the music. My mom told me she would hire me for coming out, and I sort of forgot that.</p>

<p>[05:10.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that the purpose of the timing of the trip, specifically for you to go to help with the show?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to help and I'd also get a solo. It was also to visit with my family. I don't really know what I was thinking. (chuckles) You know, it was to help out with the show because I know it's tough for my mom. Normally I just like to help out. I forgot I was getting paid because I don't really think about it. I just want to help out, but then paying for the ticket and getting yelled at and getting under all this stress. And so I told my sister "Oh, well" and my sister was like "Are you getting paid for any of this?" and I said "No, I don't think so."</p>

<p>[06:08.4]</p>

<p>And she's like "Well, mom should at least pay for your airplane ticket." Then my sister brought it up with my mom, and my mom thought I was personally assaulting her because I had Tammy pick on her for me. I was like "No, I just — " and Tammy was like "Oh, I'm sorry." It's like, why can't I just — well, my dad later said "Out of all days, why do you have to pick the day when mom didn't get any sleep and this is her production." He's like "There's better days to explain all this." I felt really bad. I told my mom that I don't want to do this if there's so much stress. I later apologized and I'll probably be in <i>The Nutcracker</i> for the next year.</p>

<p>[07:02.7]</p>

<p>It was just — you know, I like spending time with my mom when it's not this stressful time. But I guess one of the things that's absent in my current routine — like in the theater when you're putting on a show, if costumes aren't there, you have to do something. You can't just say "Maybe I'll do it tomorrow." There's all of these deadlines and requirements. If someone is not on stage, that's a big problem. (chuckles) There's not too many subtleties. I guess I'm so used to reading into every subtlety. I'm just not used to that sort of drama. Or at least maybe, I don't know, maybe I've been so into reading into things and personalizing them.</p>

<p>[08:07.0]</p>

<p>I guess I'm still sort of like — like my relationship with my mom is interesting. I mean, especially because even when I first came, not even thinking about the recital, and I told the cats when she was feeding them tuna, I was like "Sassy, you know that you're eating an over-fished fish?" and my mom is like "Oh, that's just a lie that the liberals spew so they can raise the cost of tuna." I'm just like — (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that look translate to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I was just, you know, just like "Okay." So it's just sort of — it's kind of like walking on eggshells, even more so with my sister. (pause)</p>

<p>[09:15.5]</p>

<p>But yeah, I mean, eventually after the recital things were fine. And then Jeremy came out. It's kind of weird because he's like a very routine-oriented person and when that routine — being in my family's house, we have a little bit different routine. We all stay up late. It's really hot outside, so you can't really run in the morning when it's 100 degrees outside. You can't really walk much outside. It's not like there's — you know, being in an urban setting, you can just go to the supermarket, go here, go there. But here you've got to drive 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

<p>[10:02.4]</p>

<p>So I think he did have fun, but he seemed a little distant, and I guess I reacted kind of negatively. I mean, I don't know what's been going on with me and him. Because he was really happy to be there and be reunited, but there's certain things he's been saying here and there that really just irk me. I don't know why. For instance, he'll go off on how beautiful Jane Birkin is, and I'm just sort of like, because he kept going off —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Prompted by?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just sort of like we're talking about style. Or we'll be talking about girls with bangs like this, and he'll be like "Oh, the original person that started that trend was Jane Birkin. She sure was a looker back in the day" and he'll whistle. I mean, he'll do that, I don't know. It doesn't make me feel —</p>

<p>[11:14.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he know that it bothers you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) You know, I don't know if I've mentioned that to him. (pause) I mean, I don't want to seem like one of those — because I did say, you know, "I don't like you calling me 'good girl'" and he's like "Okay, I understand. I didn't mean to demean you. But you know, I think if we can't laugh at ourselves, who can we laugh — what are we really saying?" And I'm just afraid that he would — hearing me say that, I'm afraid he would say something like "Oh well, you should be more confident, and I can't date someone or be with someone that isn't confident."</p>

<p>[12:07.0]</p>

<p>And it's like well, it's not like when he doesn't say something that I fear that I'm ugly, but I just didn't think it was nice. I mean, you know, in a rare when-pigs-fly, I'll mention male ballet dancers. I'm really into this show called <i>Breaking Pointe</i>. It's a documentary on ballet dancers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I actually watched it and thought of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, it's really made me go to dance class more often and work hard. But you know, one of the guys, Ronnie, has this very ripped body and I told that to Jeremy. He's like "Oh, well those guys are probably all gay." And I'm like "Well, not this guy. Not in Ballet West." I mean, that was once in a blue moon. I rarely mention the opposite.</p>

<p>[12:58.3]</p>

<p>Even though it's not a direct — just for example — "I think your friend is really attractive. He's sure a stud." He really doesn't do that with me. It's more like the immaterial, their figures.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not people who are really in your lives.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but in the same sense —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it still makes you feel bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, if you're amongst someone that you find attractive and appreciate, why would you bring up — I don't know. It just doesn't seem like — I just don't understand the motive. I think it just seems thoughtless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder what would happen if you asked what the motive was? To put that into non-threatening language for him, like "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>[14:08.9]</p>

<p>So not really saying that he's wrong to say it, but finding out for yourself what does he mean when he says "So-and-so was really hot back in the day." Because I'm wondering, the context when you first brought it up, could have been talking about style or something you were both kind of interested in. I wonder if there's a potential that the motive is just trying to relate to you, almost, and relate to your interest in fashion and style and things like that. Or is it that he's letting you know that he found so-and-so really attractive? I don't know. But it sounds like something you're wondering too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's interesting because I mean, following the "Jane Birkin being attractive," for some reason I've just been feeling kind of self-conscious. So I would kind of try the Jane Birkin look with the very flat, straight hair.</p>

<p>[15:07.1]</p>

<p>I cut my bangs just last weekend, and I was actually upset. (chuckles) My mom had told me not to do it because she's like "I know it may be in fashion, but it's going to make your cheekbones look bigger than probably what you want" and she was exactly right. And he actually didn't like me looking like that. He's like "Well, you're beautiful in a different way. You don't need to look like her. You're beautiful." It frustrated me because it's like you don't go around and start whistling about me. You don't tell me how pretty I am, but you tell how pretty other — I guess maybe it is his way of when he's looking at fashion or talking about fashion, not to sound gay. Or maybe that's just something that does arise, that there is a pretty girl or like —</p>

<p>[16:08.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he's not necessarily making a comparison to you. It's not that she's pretty and you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) That's what it feels like. But I guess — that's something that my dad mentioned, that I take these things too personally. Like I used to always, I don't know, it seems — I guess maybe it's a defense mechanism because my last boyfriend was aiming everything towards me, blow by blow. I remained aloof to it, but I still absorbed it and it just sort of built up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really affected you even if he wasn't necessarily seeing that effect. And now you're translating his intent to your current boyfriend's intent.</p>

<p>[17:00.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But there will be other times when after I went to dance class I met him. It was like the heat wave last week and there was no air conditioning, and I was just hot and exhausted and felt like I was going to faint. I had my hair kind of coming out of the bun, and he was joking about my hair because it had the poof, trying to say I was sporting the Jersey look.</p>

<p>I shaved in the morning, but it kind of looked like I didn't shave, and he's like "Oh, and look at those armpits." I was like "I was working my ass off in dance class, and I bought you dinner and you are just —" I just thought "Whoa. If I'm going to come out of dance class sweaty because I'm working my butt off and you have a problem with that, maybe we shouldn't meet up." And I was meaning not to be nice so we could — well, that time last Wednesday was so that he could also drop off my luggage because I didn't go home after we got back late at night.</p>

<p>[18:19.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there are some times when those comments were clearly hurtful. Those comments the intent is quite clear, that maybe he's joking around kind of, but still they're hurtful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess maybe I just need to — I mean —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you just need to —?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think maybe I just need to talk to him, but in a sense, it gets me mad when he says something. Like I want — maybe what I want is a little bit of empathy to understand why. Instead of like "Oh, well I was just joking around." Well, you can be joking around but it still — it's just kind of mean. It's not really funny. I mean, who's laughing?</p>

<p>[19:16.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those kinds of comments, making fun of the fact that your hair is falling out of your bun after a dance class, those are kind of comments that a bully would make. Or commenting that it doesn't look like you're freshly shaven. Well, what's the point? The only point is to make you feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's interesting because I noticed that he's still nice and can be loving, but I just noticed there's not as much of being considerate. When we were walking yesterday, I had walked two miles already and had gone to dance class, so we were just going to walk around later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[20:21.7]</p>

<p>He was just walking really really fast. I mean, he said we were going to walk downtown in the beginning, but then it was like "Oh, let's walk down to the commons." I mean, I like walking downtown because of all the shops. Yeah, there are lots of people, but it got me excited and then it was like "Let's do the commons because I like it better. Oh, it's really hot, let's walk by the ocean because there will be a breeze."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like your wishes are being taken into consideration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it didn't help that we were walking on average five miles per hour. We were really walking fast, and after all that exercise earlier I said "Maybe we could slow down near the stores a little bit more."</p>

<p>[21:19.3]</p>

<p>He's like "Oh" and I said "I can understand why you're speeding up because there's lots of people and you don't want to be around them, but you know, maybe we could do that" and he's like "Oh, okay." And then he still kept on walking really really fast. I said that — maybe it's because I'm kind of passive-aggressive about these comments because I said "You know, it's really different. Normally when we go on our walks, we go a lot slower and we stop more. It's more leisurely. Maybe it's because of all the people that you are just walking fast" and he's like "Yeah, I don't like people." And I said "Well, this feels kind of like a death march" and he said "We can end it now." I was like "No, we don't have to end it now."</p>

<p>[22:15.7]</p>

<p>I mean, it's not like he hadn't walked or done exercise earlier. At that point when I said it was a death march, we had walked like four-and-a-half miles already, and that precedes the two miles that we walked around this morning. It's not like I'm not trying to take away exercise. I should have just said that I need to sit down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also being more direct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess being at home, there were no opportunities for me to be direct because —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt you had to be so careful. You said you were walking on eggshells around your mom and your sister.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I guess it really translates like it's annoying to have to be direct or to say these things. Yeah, maybe somebody doesn't want to walk.</p>

<p>[23:17.9]</p>

<p>Finally, eventually, it took me to just sit down on a random stair and he's like "Do you want to go to Starbucks?" and I'm like "I'm not really thirsty" and he's like "Okay, well then let's just keep on walking." I was like "No, I need to sit down" so I sat down, and he sat down next to me. But it felt like I was in defiance just sticking up for myself or putting it in, what I'm interested in or what I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would have happened if you said "I'd like to stop for a little bit"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Probably nothing much. It just seemed like that's not what he wanted to do.</p>

<p>[24:10.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it doesn't sound like it was what he wanted. But it doesn't have to be only what one person wants.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're feeling pretty frustrated with lots of people in your life for not picking up on your signals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not only not picking up on my signals, just being kind of mean and getting away with it. (chuckles) (pause) Yeah. (pause) I guess I am feeling very frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess it's two things really. Because the "being mean" — the mean comments and the hurtful comments or your mom taking out her anxiety about the performance on you, that's sort of one thing. And people being inconsiderate, is I think the word you used. You're not really thinking about how it might affect the other person in both cases. So that's sort of one issue.</p>

<p>[25:16.7]</p>

<p>And the second issue is feeling frustrated that you're not being listened to or having your signals picked up on, and you're not being direct. Both things are kind of going on, it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I guess that's sort of — I guess I have to go back to being more assertive. I don't like telling people what to do, but I guess sometimes you have to tell people your boundaries.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't need to necessarily tell him what to do, but you do have to let them know how what he does makes you feel. And then he can make a choice about how does he want to change his behavior and change what he says in order to create feelings that are more beneficial to the relationship. To let him know how his comments make you feel, and then he gets to make a choice about what he does with that information.</p>

<p>[26:19.5]</p>

<p>But right now, it sounds like he's not really getting all the information. And it would be nice if he could anticipate what some of those types of comments might make you feel, but he's not. So we wish that he would, but he's not, for whatever reason. So you have to kind of educate him about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that's very true. He seems very stuck in his own world. I think — I mean, he is considerate in a sense. (pause) When he's not hot or tired or just feeling peevish.</p>

<p>[27:16.0]</p>

<p>He's nice and he is very thankful when I cook him dinner. I guess that's something that I will feel relieved once I live with him, in the sense that I don't have to carry around my stuff, because that's a huge stress. That's one thing I didn't tell my parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You will when you get together].</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I just sort of — I don't know how to break it to them, and I didn't think that recital time was a good time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your move happens September ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, September 21st. I just sort of realized that if it comes up, I'll just sort of tell them. (chuckles) I guess in my family it's hard to like — well, maybe it's easiest to tell my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my dad is the least judgmental. He can get the most angry over stupid things, but he's the least judgmental.</p>

<p>[28:13.1]</p>

<p>My mom is nice in everyday life, but these big things in life she just sort of loses perspective. You know, I guess that's the sort of frustrating thing I have, where I have to be so un-judgmental and welcoming and understanding of all my family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like you get the same consideration in return.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is very frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, in a sense, that's sort of something I just have to understand. They make choices. I can't change my mom. All I can do is spend less time with them or be less in their lives, which I have done in a sense. I do visit them for three weeks and we have fun, but in terms of what's really going on day-to-day, I don't know if they know.</p>

<p>[29:12.6]</p>

<p>But then again, I don't think they care. (chuckles) So unless there's a really bad problem, I sort of see that maybe it's best to have privacy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have other people in your life that know day-to-day what's going on and can give you support and feedback?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, actually my friends, like Stephanie (sp?), she's a really good friend. My office mate Greg. It's funny because he and I don't see much of each other, but we do talk and he does give feedback. It's interesting having feedback from another man, someone that is also in a committed relationship. It's just interesting. Sometimes I'm annoyed when Greg is in there because I don't want to talk when I'm in the office. Sometimes I just want to fall asleep, like I did today. (chuckles) His girlfriend has come from Europe, so I don't think he'll be in his office, which means I can take my midday 30-minute nap. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[30:23.6]</p>

<p>But, you know, it's just interesting. I do enjoy every now and then being able to relate and talking to Jeremy and his and ours, our joint friends. It's interesting talking to them, being able to relate. Yeah, so I do feel like I do get feedback, and it is nice. I think everyone needs that.</p>

<p>It was interesting because I did tell my mom a lot of feedback, or a lot of things that go on between Jeremy and his family. It's hard for me when Jeremy complains about his family, like is really upset with them. It's hard for me not to get emotionally aroused and start to not like them. Then when I say something mean about his brother, I'm just repeating what Jeremy said, and he'll be like "Oh, that's really mean."</p>

<p>[31:27.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's okay for him to feel it, but not for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I talked to my mom and she did give me good perspective. I still can talk to my mom about quite a bit, just not about things that she would oppose. And I sort of think that everyone opposes something in a sense, so if you talk about everything, you can't tell everyone everything because they're always — people these days get so upset over things. Like whether it's politics, gay marriage, religion. I'm just sort of happy if someone else is happy. And if they're not hurting or attacking me, I don't really feel threatened if they're doing something with their own life. But, you know, I sort of see that everyone else does feel sort of threatened. I guess I try my best to try and relate to them.</p>

<p>[32:25.5]</p>

<p>You know, it sometimes considers a big part of my life or just a little part. And I know with Jennifer, there's very little that we relate on. But she does appreciate how I compliment her hair. (chuckles) And I think me and her hair and her talking about her job, I think that's sort of like, you know —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With some people, it's figuring out what the safe spaces in that relationship are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's sort of what I realized. I know my parents won't disown me, but they won't be — they won't disown me like the boyfriend thing. But it's kind of like when I got my nose piercing and they didn't — well, my dad was going to rip it out but he didn't. But they weren't happy. But then they didn't notice when it was gone. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you take it out for them or for you?</p>

<p>[33:27.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me, cause I thought — well, it was eventually because I got my hair dyed blonde and I was getting over this punk phase. I got to a point where the stud fell out, so it was just kind of like this rusty metal thing in my nose. (chuckles) I'm like, I'm not seeing the pretty sparkly thing. It just seems kind of weird. So I took it out for me. But, I don't know.</p>

<p>I guess my sister goes about things differently. She tries to battle it out so you see her point. It's a lot easier to do things your own way as long as — I guess though you can only go so long. Like my sister, I was trying to warm up that I might be changing addresses. I didn't tell her why. I was like "I don't really like where I'm living." Which, in a sense, my room is very small and I'm tired of living with roommates and I'm excited about living with my boyfriend.</p>

<p>[34:37.2]</p>

<p>But, you know, like she told my grandma that I might be moving, and now grandma wants my new address, and now I have to tell that I'm not moving. Actually, I just won't talk to my grandma. I don't like her. She's never really been in my life, and she never really paid attention to us. But in essence, she always loved us. In terms of safe space, there's maybe like a pinhead of safe space. Even when I said I wanted to be a professional ballet dancer back in the day, when I was 17, she just stared at me and didn't say anything.</p>

<p>[35:28.6]</p>

<p>You know, that didn't happen. I didn't wind up being in this — but another thing that happened when I went to graduate school and was dating a guy, my last boyfriend. When we went, I was like "Oh, can my boyfriend come too?" because I was going to go meet her, and she's like "Oh, you need another room" and I was like "No, no, we can share the same room." And then she told my parents and said that I was shacking up and it was like no, I have my own apartment and yes, that's going on, but that started all of the drama. And then she denied saying anything. (pause)</p>

<p>[36:25.6]</p>

<p>So I sort of don't feel bad for not talking — I guess because I'm bringing it up. I do slightly feel bad, but in a sense I feel like I'm justified. Like somebody is not going to be nice and not someone you can trust, that's not someone — like, I don't honestly love her. I have not really spent time. Love is something that's based on sacrifice. You know, maybe she sacrificed things for my dad, but I don't feel like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think she's —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sacrificed things for me or has been there when I needed to talk to. I mean, I could've called her up, but she doesn't listen. (chuckles) She likes to tell you her own stories.</p>

<p>[37:23.7]</p>

<p>Do you think, because it's kind of like after hearing — I should've said something when my boyfriend said these things. But do you think it would be a bad idea to tell him, because I see him later tonight. He plays his music, and then I'll probably go over to his place. But do you think it's a bad idea to tell him, just out of the blue? I mean, I don't want it to seem like I'm keeping a list.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the likelihood that a situation will reoccur that you could address it in the moment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Well, it could just be — (chuckles) I don't know. It seems like it's sort of random. I could just go to dance and stick my armpits out. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[38:26.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you could recreate the scene. I think it's most effective to be able to give someone feedback in the moment, because then it's happening right there. It's fresh. He remembers what you're talking about. These instances are — you remember them because they affected you emotionally. Is it bad for you to bring it up again? No. You don't need to judge it that way. Will he remember? I don't know. If he doesn't remember making the comments, then the impact of you sharing what your reaction to them was, is lessened because there's not something for him to connect to as much. But he may remember it, and then there's more for him to connect to. And even if he doesn't remember it, if you can bring it up and talk about it in a non-judgmental way, in a non-threatening way, then you've shared something with him. Does he know that you come here?</p>

<p>[39:28.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So one way to bring this up is like "Hey, something I ended up talking about in therapy today" makes it kind of relevant. And you can use that as a way to say "It made me realize that what I felt in the moment was pretty important, and I just wanted to share with you that when you made comments like this the other day, this is how it made me feel." That's a way to sort of give it some relevance so it doesn't feel so out of the blue.</p>

<p>It's not problematic at all for you to go back and share with him how you felt in relation to something he had said. Doing it in the moment gets you a little bit more bang for the buck. But you missed that opportunity. If you feel okay to sort of wait for it to occur again, okay. But it was important enough for you to bring up in here today, and so then maybe it's important enough to go back and share with him, with the emphasis on the idea that you're sharing with him how you felt in reaction to something.</p>

<p>[40:34.9]</p>

<p>Think about it as educating. It's not that you're saying he did something wrong. It's that you're educating him about what the impact was on you. And because he really cares about you, he will care about how those comments make you feel. He might get defensive, which is what I think you end up with when he responds to these things with "You're being too sensitive." That's him feeling defensive, and if there's a way for you to decrease that, more of your message might sink in. By sharing it with him in a way that's like "I just wanted to let you know how it made me feel when this happened," that might lower his defenses a little bit because he's not feeling like you're saying he did something wrong.</p>

<p>[41:21.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That is true. (pause) Yeah. I mean, I guess I'll see how tonight goes, but I think it is, yeah, sort of like something like if it wells up back in my chest like I just feel like I have to say it, then —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's an important signal to listen to. If it's taking up that much space inside of you —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's just interesting. I don't know if it's like I'm letting out frustration because maybe I'm just tired, but I think I did notice something like — I think maybe being at home where I wasn't getting that sort of — you know, my mom, if it wasn't recital time, she's very supportive. And if I walk out with a mask on my face, she'll be like "Ewww, what's on your face?" Or "Why are you breaking out?" It's like, I feel comfortable enough in my own skin.</p>

<p>[42:29.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you should, right? Feel comfortable in your own skin, regardless of what the skin looks like at the moment. That's the important piece. If you're feeling good about yourself, not what direction your bangs go or how much growth there's been since you last shaved. Those are just things that happen to your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess that's the sort of — I think the thing that he appreciates in me is that I'm not very judgmental at all. And I think he says, even when he jokes around — like my car that I used to drive. He'll say "Oh, well that's not a real sports car." You know, it's just like "I know you're trying to be funny, but it's also judgmental."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At your expense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I said something snarky back which I realize that — I said "Oh, at least I could drive it" because it's a manual transmission and he hadn't learned and that's a big stab. He had learned —</p>

<p>[43:39.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You emasculated him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you were feeling defensive. So I think one of the things that you're noticing is that some of the attempts maybe at humor are a little bit immature, and a more mature way to relate to one another is to be direct. So you don't need these indirect jabs in order to create humor because, as you said, who is really laughing here? They don't really feel funny and they just feel a little bit immature. Those are the kinds of comments that other adolescents will laugh at, at another adolescent's expense. But there doesn't need to be room for that in your adult relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that really is something interesting because I really do feel like — I mean, I am becoming an adult and I feel like I'm growing more and more towards being an adult.</p>

<p>[44:33.8]</p>

<p>My tolerance for these little games and these little jokes is just — I mean, you can be funny but I don't see on <i>Mad Men</i> or something, Don Draper never says these stupid little things to Megan. Or like these little jokes are seen as immature, so that's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe that's sort of what this next phase of development is, how to bring some of the interaction and comments and commentary in the relationship, bring it to the adult space because you are both adults.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, I know. I'm older than 25. I can rent a car for cheap now. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can even be on the insurance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that's the thing, the problem with my family and why I've become not so direct is because they'll always see me as a kid. And kids —</p>

<p>[45:30.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you are always your child's parent — your parent's child. But you are an adult child, and in your relationship you are both adults. I think that sounds like where you want to bring the conversation, because the other comments don't feel good. I would imagine that he can go there with you. We should probably stop for today and make an appointment for next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah.</p>

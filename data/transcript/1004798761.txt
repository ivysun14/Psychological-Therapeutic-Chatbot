<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Chet is on vacation until October 3rd. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel a lot better which is (inaudible at 00:00:22). But I do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was at work for like half the day and I'm like "Mm." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just (inaudible at 00:00:36) but I was talking with Jamie this weekend. Who is on a rotation at right now. And –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's in med school? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Her last year. Or starting her last year. So I was talking to her about how—if people ask me how much more school I have it's kind of hard. I'm like, "Well it would be one year if I was going full time. I'm not. It's a vague, (inaudible at 00:01:13) amount of time." I mean (inaudible) it doesn't really make sense for me to take time off from work because I'd have to get loans and eh. So doing it full time. But I had at one point looked at how quickly I could finish if I was full time. [0:01:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:48) laid off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Blah. Blah. And my Mom had completely lost her mind over—I didn't even say I was going to get laid off. I was just kind of like, "If I went full time I would be done in January." And she's like, "You can't just quit your job. You can't do that." She called me back a couple of times to reiterate that this was not happening. And it was really aggravating for a variety of reasons. And so Jamie's first comment was, "Does your Mother know that I'm not working?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my Mom is very [proud of Jamie being in medical] school. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Jamie stayed with my family for several months in high school because Jamie left home. Because her mother was abusive. So my house is one of the places that she stayed. And so Mom was always like, "(inaudible at 00:02:47) interested in Math." [0:02:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's going a heck of a lot longer without a real paycheck than you would be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. And I'm like, "Well of course. You're in medical school. So that's fancy." But my brother was in graduate school. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: For I think five or six years. With loans. I mean (inaudible at 00:03:26) </p>

<p>So although my parents are paying for part of the tuition, which is really awesome, I also kind of resent that I don't get the chance to like just finish school. Like it would be so awesome if I could just not (inaudible at 00:03:52) my crappy job. [0:03:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just be done. I would just be done. That would be really awesome. And there is just no way to talk to my parents about it. They just freak out about how I can't. And I mean I understand they're concerned about debt. And currently I don't have any debt, which is awesome. But it's also because I cut all my credit cards because I was having problems with debt. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And lived in a cheap, cheap apartment for a couple of years so I could do that. And my grandmother ended up paying off the end of my student loans for undergrad. So I understand. It's not like I really want to take on whatever thousand dollars of debt but I also really want to be done. And I don't know. (sighs) [0:05:10]</p>

<p>Like I guess I don't—it's hard because I don't expect them to pay for grad school. Like they did for my undergrad. But I also at this point just really want—I want to at least be able to talk about it. Like would they cosign a loan with me? X,Y,Z. And I don't—I don't know. I don't—(inaudible at 00:05:54)—at the end I'm like, "Why did my brother go to grad school and I can't?" And they haven't answered except—it wasn't even like engineering grad school. So it's not like, "Oh he's being practical." [0:06:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. Environmental science or something right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he finished—he ended the program. He was supposed to get a Ph.D. He ended up with a Bachelor's. Yeah that wasn't engineering. And his master's thesis was about racism in (inaudible at 00:06:32). Which was super interesting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Super cool but not super practical. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'm wondering (inaudible at 00:06:43) my Mom (inaudible) going to medical school. It's like where you getting a job. (inaudible at 00:06:48) school. Doing that thing. Jamie also had the comment that my Mom is really fixated on once I get my degree  it will all be awesome. She really seems to feel like it's super important that I finish it because if I don't bad things will happen. But if I do—she feels like I don't have enough focus or purpose in my life. And so my Mom's like, "If you get that degree then you will have direction." [0:07:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So Jamie's comment was that it's not just the degree it's like I would now have a job identity. So she could say, "My daughter is a manager instead of my daughter who does I.T." And you know. So it's like she (inaudible at 00:08:01) giving me this concrete identity. Like Jamie is a doctor. Or my daughter is a lawyer. Or my son the engineer. And just kind of this idea if I have a concrete work identity then everything will be okay. Which I think is kind of tied up into how our jobs don't work anymore. My Dad stayed at his company for thirty years. [0:08:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We don't do that anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause at 00:08:32] to [00:08:46) Again what you've been showing me but not coming right out and saying is that as you describe it your mother is being completely ridiculous. Kind of all around. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well the hard part is that I do agree she doesn't have to pay for my grad school. I don't—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not the issue. It doesn't make any sense for her to completely freak out about you considering taking a year to finish library school. I mean you can disagree but freak out about something as plausible as—(inaudible at 00:09:48) she can't have a conversation with you about it is ridiculous. [0:09:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't see a way that it's not a pretty big double standard with your brother about all of this. And sure it would help you practically in some ways to get the degree I assume. I mean I only know what you've told me about it but her idea that that would mean you're kind of set in some larger way—</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is the one that confuses me the most actually. [0:10:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean whatever her reasoning is that's kind of ridiculous. Not to mention contradictory to the first thing. I'm not saying that I can't imagine why one in general or she in particular couldn't have reasons, particularly with you being her daughter, why she might think any of these things. I'm not saying I can't imagine somebody thinking that. I'm just saying—at least the way you present it—it doesn't make any real sense. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The part that I feel uncomfortable with is comparing myself to my brother. [0:11:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause at 00:11:46] to [00:11:54). (sighs) I don't know if I can get at it. It's like I feel weird saying, "You supported my brother so you should support me." Or you supported Seth in his master's program. (inaudible at 00:12:18) "You should support mine more fully." Because I feel like—I mean that was before they were retired. So they (inaudible at 00:12:32) income. And I don't know. Like I just feel weird saying, "Why don't you pay for school? For grad school?" [0:12:47] (pause until [00:13:06) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) like I was sort of recommending you should sort of bring any of this up with them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's just more like mentally where I get stuck. I feel like when I think about sort of the double standard, I also think well—I start thinking like, "Well they don't really owe me grad school. And their financial situation is different. Blah, blah, blah. And they've supported me other ways." And the other thing that is also difficult is—and my brother took a really long time in grad school because of his—in part to having a lot of mental health problems. [0:14:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so they supported him through that which is great. And I kind of would expect them to. But I also feel like, "Well I didn't have a psychotic break and disappear for a week so like can I get something too?" Except that it feels really childish and mean. And also it doesn't work that way. Like I didn't have an emergency so give me money. Except that's partially how I feel. And I feel bad because I'm like Seth didn't really want to be—it was not he was having a good time doing that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was horrible. And certainly I don't want to have a psychotic break either. [0:15:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would like the chance to just finish school. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (pause at 00:15:17] to [00:15:35) I'm confused. Are you thinking of asking them for help? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause at 00:15:40] to [00:15:49) So I do get very stressed about trying to conceive of making out a budget. And how much would it cost for my rent and my food and whatever for like a semester for a year. It just feels very intimidating. And I know it doesn't equal my salary. If I wasn't going to work I would be spending less money on some things. Right? Because I would have less time (inaudible at 00:16:29). And it feels very overwhelming. And then I'm like well I really would like someone to help me with this. Or sit down with me and like talk about is this even possible? [0:16:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And normally that would be my parents except that I can't even talk about it hypothetically. I was sort of trying to open up the idea—my Mom looked at my financial aid application for me. And she did my taxes until I graduated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm kind like, "I would like some help with these forms, which I find overwhelming." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what I want more. I guess for me that was kind of like (inaudible at 00:17:27) step one. Like can I just do this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:17:29) </p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that's the kind of support you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like let me—I would love financial support but the thing I would want first is what am I doing. And I feel—I guess I could go to my credit union. I just feel really embarrassed about it. [0:17:44] (pause until [00:17:51) </p>

<p>I don't know. It makes me feel like not a financial adult. (pause at 00:17:54] to [00:18:12) I don't know. I think one reason why I have a hard time is my Mom is being really crazy about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Directly is that I feel conflicted about parts of it. I see some of her points. And I'm like, "Well okay. That's true. Taking on debt sucks. And yep that's true." And internally I feel like, "Well they don't actually owe me money. Mm. And graduating debt free would be awesome." And so I just have this internal argument with my Mom in my head about it. [0:19:11] (pause until [00:19:52) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder when it comes to something like this whether it's very difficult for you to have a viewpoint that's relatively independent of hers. [0:20:07] (pause until [00:20:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:20:20] until [00:20:25) I mean—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels like somehow she's right or probably right or has a lot of credibility. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:20:45) so much experience of her like completely shutting down the concept. When I say, "Well I disagree with that." My Mom is just like, "No!" And it's this huge, no, no, no. And that didn't happen. And it's true that it's sometimes hard to—I guess not—I don't know. Like I am sort of doing that for her a certain way. Yeah I just think— like I start running through all the reasons why maybe I could be wrong. [0:21:29] (pause until [00:21:37) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (pause at 00:21:37] until [00:21:58) I think in these sorts of ways she probably made you very anxious about being an independent adult because when you have your own opinions it means you're really pretty completely separate from her. [0:22:31] (pause until [00:22:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:22:40] until [00:22:47) It's also like—I mean I do agree with her. I guess I'm like a lot of my friends. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my parents and I agree on a lot of core issues like gay stuff and democrats and all these things. That I feel like half my friends are arguing with their families constantly. So it kind of becomes like, "Yeah my Mom and I just agree on stuff." Except when we don't. I guess. And I find it hard to sort of to stick to saying no to her. I mean I have at various times. But I feel like it always ends up being—like I have to do something super dramatic. So then it feels like overkill to me in order to assert that independence. [0:23:59] (pause until [00:24:08)</p>

<p>Like instead of saying no once or—well it's –. An example that happened (inaudible at 00:24:14) for awhile is my Mom had been fussing about my apartment being messy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you didn't let her come over for two years. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was crazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean to me the part that was crazy is that's where I had to go to get her to stop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:35)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Why didn't you stop earlier?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:24:44) And so I feel like that's kind of how we end up resolving conflicts is (inaudible at 00:24:56) like that which is not—it doesn't make sense. It isn't feasible and is really weird. [0:25:07] (pause until [00:25:15) </p>

<p>It's also like not a compromised position. My brother's wife from the outside will also (inaudible at 00:25:32), "Well if you just say no. Just tell her why and just say no." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "You haven't been here long enough to realize where that breaks down." And my Mom is not her Mom. So. It's different. [0:25:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But—(pause at 00:25:56] until [00:26:03) I don't know. I feel like it just –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it must be a little similar when I say something like, "She's being ridiculous." I imagine that must sound sort of—maybe not quite but almost as kind of uninformed as when Ashby says, "Well you could just say no to her." Right? Both sound very foreign and far outside your family. (inaudible) [0:26:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess also—I don't know. When Ashby says, "Well just say no." Like I already tried that. And that's not the issue. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I kind of feel that way when you say she's being ridiculous. I don't know. I'm like, "Well maybe. But that's not the point." But I don't know what the point is. What I'm exactly saying no to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thing that's curious to me is (pause at 00:27:34] until [00:27:45) before I said that you had spent about 10 or 15 minutes pretty clearly showing me how ridiculous she was being. [0:27:57]</p>

<p>And I think with—I don't know—half awareness that that's what you were illustrating (pause at 00:28:07] until [00:28:16) which is the sort of thing that makes me go, "Mmm." You know? (pause at 00:28:22] until [00:28:33) </p>

<p>I guess I really feel like I've become like a bit of the foil here. And stepping in and saying, "You're telling me or you're showing me how she's being ridiculous." Like that's the thing you kind of don't want to say but you're also kind of like laying out. I think. So where I'm going with that is that I think you're probably of two minds about this. And I think you've gotten me to take up one of them. A bit. (chuckles) [0:29:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you're like, "God that's a weird thing." I'm (inaudible at 00:29:17) you know. Like, "Gosh that's a weird thing to say." Like that's just never how we think in my family. Except that I'm pretty sure you were just kind of telling that story. (pause at 00:29:31] until [00:29:37) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels uncomfortable to say it that boldly or baldly]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? Like (pause at 00:29:49] until [00:29:56) –</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess my—like even while I'm feeling my Mom is being really crazy, saying it is just (pause at 00:30:09] until [00:30:18)—I don't know. It makes it too—maybe too concrete or I don't want it to be that way. So I would like –. [0:30:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:35) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:36) (pause until [00:30:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about you're in a pretty impossible situation here? And I think probably often have been with your Mom. I mean to say she's acting crazy or being ridiculous I imagine would feel a little bit like keeping her from coming to your apartment at all for two years. It feels like a pretty extreme step. And yet you're also the one who's having her apartment rearranged in whatever way. Or who is having (inaudible at 00:31:29) think through whether it makes sense to quit work and go to grad school completely rearranged. Or sort of made a mess of or however you want to say it. [0:31:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And—sorry go ahead. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean one of the things I also think about is I could just go to the bank and say, "How much money will you lend me?" And just do it. So my parents think that only whores and sailors get tattoos. And also piercings. They flat out said that. I was like, "Okay." And they're very against them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sometimes I think I kind of want a tattoo. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know that I really want it. And whatever I say, I'm like "My Mom would really freak out." (inaudible at 00:32:40) And stuff like, "You are an adult. You could just go." [0:32:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "Yes. I could." Like I literally can just go do it but doing that would also be taking on an argument with my parents. It's not—there isn't an option of getting a tattoo and not having it be a big shebang. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because I'm interested in maintaining a relationship with them—I do care what they think. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I—it sounds like maybe you still hear me as being a little spoily. And sort of not being clear on that. Or what you just said about wanting to maintain a relationship with them. Or not appreciating how intractable that they can be about things like that. [0:33:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of more an argument I have with myself in my head. If that makes sense. (pause at 00:34:10] until [00:34:17) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm saying is I think you sometimes externalize the argument. I think you may have done it a bit with me today. And I think I aided and abetted you there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I was saying (inaudible at 00:34:36). Um, yeah. (pause at 00:34:43] until [00:34:53) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I mean I do notice myself defending my Mom (inaudible at 00:35:01) reaction to—I don't know. I mean it's not really criticism. It's more like how that's crazy. Like that makes no sense. [0:35:14] (pause until [00:35:24)</p>

<p>But I guess it feels like it could be criticism. Although I feel that way more with my friends. (pause at 00:35:30] until [00:35:42) I also I think I am frustrated with myself for not (pause at 00:35:44] until [00:35:51)—for saying like, "Oh I want to get a tattoo but my parents would freak out." When it's—I mean I want to get a tattoo. And it's not that my parents are preventing me. It's me that's preventing me. If that makes any sense. And I'm kind of putting it more on them than on—. [0:36:13] (pause until [00:36:45).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you doing that? I mean it seems to me like you're—(inaudible at 00:36:49) plausible that it would be a big fight or issue or whatever with them if you got one. And that's why you're not. How is that inordinately putting it on them? [0:37:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess because I feel like (pause at 00:37:14] until [00:37:24) I'm not really—I don't know. It feels like I'm sort of skipping over—I don't know. (pause at 00:37:31] until [00:37:41) Like I'm taking a shortcut on the reasons. I don't want to argue with them. I don't want to (inaudible at 00:37:49) instead of sort of just saying, "Well they don't want me to." [0:37:55] (pause until [00:38:37) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you kind of like to be in the position or are more comfortable in the position in sort of the argument in your head of being the one to defend them. Or (pause at 00:38:55] until [00:39:06) sort of take the issue on yourself. I think that's the more comfortable side than to be angry with them or blame them. Or be sad. [0:39:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. Although actually –. [0:39:31] [End of audio]</p>

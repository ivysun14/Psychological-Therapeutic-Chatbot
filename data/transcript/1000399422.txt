<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, I was thinking that uhm, I was doing something this morning that, I guess I was just wishing I could keep doing. Uhm, (Sigh) because now I'm feeling very sad. And this morning, I don't know, I, you know, in a—, i—, a—, just, I suppose what it was is, I wasn't letting myself think about it being the last day, particularly. </p>
 
<p>But uhm, I also was, if anything, the only way I was thinking about it was thinking more about Nixon, and how he must feel. And, you know, feeling sort of sorry for him. Uhm, you know, (Sigh) sort of thinking, well, in comparison to him, what I'm going through is really a nice experience, and, and nothing, it's not really sad. Whereas for him, it's kind of uhm, well I don't know, I just, I just assume that it must be very sad for him, because he clearly wanted to be President so badly, and he wanted something from being President, or to be a mark in history in a way that, well he will be, but not the way he wanted. And uhm, he's old enough, so he can't think, "Well, I have another chance." </p>
 
<p>And uhm, so it's a separation that must be a v—, a very difficult one for him. And anyway, I kept thinking about that this morning, and it made, you know, having this be the last day for me, much easier. Until this afternoon when I guess I began to think, "Well I'm going to be going through my separation, so I'm not going to think about Nixon anymore." And hmm, (Silence) — </p>
 
<p>I don't know, I, you know, I'm feeling as if, well, I sort of half want to cry, and half don't. And uh, (sniff, sigh, pause, begins crying) well, it isn't that I didn't think I'd want to cry, but I thought it would be all so different, because I (Clears throat) I think I've been thinking that I wouldn't, you know, somehow I wouldn't cry here. And then I'd go home and cry. </p>
 
<p>(Sniff) And I don't know, I was thinking about tonight. Well I'd uhm, things turned out so that I have a lot to do tonight. And I don't know whether I purposely arranged it that way, or whether it really did just turn out that way. But in any case, uhm, (Sniff) when I was thinking about tonight, today, I just knew that I really probably, you know, once I have gone through the actual physical separation, mm, leaving you here, uhm, I just felt sure I probably wouldn't feel like crying anymore. I, before today, I'd been dreading tonight. (Sigh) I don't know, you know, then I might be surprised again, (sniff) mm. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: What did you arrange? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, it's mainly just, I'm not, we had decided not to go to PTN tonight, partly because it's a long trip, and neither of us like doing it at night, since we couldn't get off at least until 7 or 8. Uhm, and so, you know, I still have packing and uhm, well, I was cleaning the house and I pretty well finished that. I just didn't get FSOZ's room done, partly because she didn't want to pick up her toys. I thought, well maybe I'll do it right before she goes to bed. I'm not going to do a heavily thorough job. And the toys have to be picked up then, anyhow. And she'll find it easier. </p>
 
<p>Uhm, and then there are just, you know, all the little odds and ends. It's a kind of evening, though, you know, when I think, I wonder if I've arranged it. We could have decided not to go to PTN, and I, and I could have had everything done. But instead, because of all these little odds and ends, th—, it won't be time for me just to sit down and relax, really. Uhm, and maybe I'd preferred it that way. </p>
 
<p>I think, when I was thinking of going up to PTN, I felt mixed. I don't like the trip, any longer. I find it very tiring, but uhm, you know, on one hand it's always nice to get up there and be there. And uhm, but MSCZ was kind of hesitant, so we both decided not to. And I think I'd been dreading it, because then I'd be sitting in the car, and I wouldn—, I, you know, be bound to be thinking about finishing, I thought. I don't know whether I really would have. But I thought I'd be thinking about it and feeling sad. And you know, I'd be trapped in a car.</p> 
 
<p>I guess I'm wondering, I don't know, it kind of bothers me that, you know, I keep feeling like crying, and that I feel that sad. Uhm, because, you know, I'll feel that sad and then I'll feel, but I know I'm ready. And so, I guess I'm thinking, well if I know I'm ready, then, you know, I don't think I should be feeling so sad, or something like that. (Silence) </p>
 
<p>And I suppose I don't like feeling this sad, partly too, because then it kind of undermines the feeling of (sigh) feeling ready. And uh, well I don't know, just able to cope with things. And mm — (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Yet, ah, you know, it's not pathological to feel sad at uh, separating from someone that you've had an important experience with. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, I don't know, I think again of, uhm, a—, it just seems like the feeling I have right now (sigh) is more uh, or at least I have trouble seeing it in any kind of way other than, you know, feeling very dependent. And, and then I think, but you know, I've been thinking about the sadness I feel when I think about my grandmother, sometimes. And uhm, (sniff) it's not a dependence, really. You know, it's more a missing of her. Because there were times when she was quite important to me. And uhm, and when I feel sadness of thinking of her, you know, there's always the knowledge that, you know, I'm capable of leading my life happily, even though I can feel sad about the fact that she's not in it. But I can't seem to get that kind of, I don't know what it is, distance, or something. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, I'm not dead, yet. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Laughs, Sigh, Pause) I also am thinking about the fact that, th, there was one word you just used, that I didn't either hear, or understand. And I think it's going to bother me if I don't ask. And you said it's not something to feel sad. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Pathological. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Oh. (Pause) Well, I wa—, I think this is what I was, something has been on my mind a lot at night, lately. And sometimes when MSCZ and I have been talking, I think this is what it is, and I think I talked about it here one time. But I'm not sure, because I, another thing I have trouble with, is in anticipating, well, in feeling sad and uhm, you know, it's like as if I'm feeling sad at your coming death, in that it seems kind of final to me, the separation. Uhm, you know, and so then I th— I worry about, well how am I going to feel next fall. And, uh you know, I've put it in different terms, but I think it must be, if I'm feeling sad, then it would seem as if i, it would be on my mind a lot. If I'm feeling this sad then I'm going to miss you so it'll be on my mind a lot. And if it isn't on my mind a lot, then it will mean that I didn't feel very sad. And so I feel as if I'm sort of caught between fearing that I'll be thinking all the time about missing you, which would make me feel very sad, and uh finding out that I don't think about it all the time, which would then sort of, uhm — I don't know, make me feel as if, well the relationship didn't mean anything to me after all or something like that. </p>
 
<p>Uhm, I've had this trouble before when, uh, you know I've pretty well been sure I'm saying good-by to somebody that it's unlikely I'll see again. But, you know, who meant something to me at the time, but I just know because of, you know, going into different situation or — you know I often experienced this I think at camp when I'd leave camp. And I'd have certain needs at camp that, uhm, well they just, you know when I wasn't at camp the people that were important to me at camp just weren't important to me. And I'd always fight that (Sniff). (Pause) </p>
 
<p>I suppose in a way when MSCZ said the other night that he was feeling sad when we were talking about his feeling and my feelings, uh, maybe I was kind of relieved too because he clearly has not gone around thinking about Dr. XBF all the time and feeling sad and uhm — (Pause, Sigh, Pause) </p>
 
<p>Well, and then I w— I just started thinking about, well, you know, I suppose mainly that right now, instead of knowing that I'm ready, I'm, you know, well the feeling of sadness, when I feel it most intensely I feel very dependent and, and not at all ready, but aside from that I know I am. And then I think, well, I think I am, but it, you know it's still — I have so much, I don't know how to put it, you know whether it's, should put it as growing or changing or uhm, experiencing thinking in new ways or whatever. But, you know it's, I'm not — I don't know that it's that I think I'll, m—, you know I reach a point and then I'll never ever change. But uhm, I guess I'm just anticipating some things are going to be pretty hard, that hopefully will get easier and easier. But then I think, well something like last night that could have been difficult was very pleasant. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And, and I also was thinking about, uh, how I was quite short with FSOZ today, but I'm sure it must have been really because I was just getting very anxious about, you know, coming here. I hope so. Because I don't want to have that kind of shortness be a big part of our relationship. Although part of what I was thinking about is, she stopped me sometimes. Sometimes it would just be, I would catch myself from being short although I'd feel impatient. And she would go on being happy-go-lucky and then I'd get myself out of it. 
 
<p>But, particularly near the time when I was waiting for Mrs. RM to come, and I was doing a couple of things and, you know I was just really beginning to work myself into a state, and she was kind of needling me. Which wouldn't have bothered me, I'm sure, at another point, but I got very short with her. And then she just — well I guess I was able to say enough about what was happening so then she was able to, you know, say something about her own feeling. So that it never really got to be a bad situation. Because I guess I said something about, "Well, if you keep doing that you're going to make me very angry, and I'm just going to get angry right now. I'm in that — that kind of thing is just going to make me angry right now." And she said something about — she kept doing it for a while — but she said, "I don't want to make you angry." And, I don't know, it just kind of, the fact she could say that and not sort of dissolve into tears — uhm, which I think would have really (chuckle) made me cross then — helped. (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, you know the old clich退 about the parents and the kids growing up together. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, I just started thinking first that sometimes when I've thought about today I imagined uhm, I found it so hard to imagine being here for a whole, you know, 50 minutes thinking about the last minute which is uhm, has always seemed to me to be the worst uhm — then sometimes I would think, well, it would be so much easier to come and then go, right away (chuckle). You know, sort of say, well, why drag it out? You know, sort of like people who will see somebody off at a train or something and won't wait for the train to come and go. And uhm, and I was thinking about that. And then I started thinking about something I haven't wondered about for quite a while, and that is, if you're still recording these sessions. Which maybe is really my way of wondering if you're going to remember me. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Will I have something of you to remember, you mean? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Uhm. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: And listen to you when you're gone. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Sniff, silence) I don't know. I then started thinking, well, as much as I feel that way, I'm also thinking some of the — well either I hope you've cut the tapes a lot or edited them or else, uhm, you know I, I think some of the stuff on them must be just awful to listen to now. I, you know, just — well I suppose partly because I was a different person, or had different outlooks or attitudes or feelings or something when I started. And I don't think I'd ever want to hear them, just for that. I don't know that I'd want (chuckle) to be reminded. And then I thought of Nixon again. And uhm, not really so much about the tapes, which is so much a part of what's just happened to him. But that, uhm, where we were eating last night they had a television. They put it on when he made his speech. And uhm, I remember I was just sitting there sure at some point he was going to break down and start crying. And I thought, "I won't be able to stand it if he does." (Analyst coughs, silence) </p>
 
<p>I don't know, I was just thinking about too, that I had a strong feeling today, and I'd, didn't get an opportunity to do it uh before coming here. But, when I woke up this morning I had this very strong feeling that I wanted to buy a paper that would have, you know, his full speech so I could read it again. And tha—, I, I don't know whether it was uhm, you know, sort of relive the way he handled something that I was identifying with and, that must have, I was feeling must have been even more difficult for him, or at least as difficult as for me. Uh, what, but it, you know when I was thinking about it just now I think, I did have a feeling as if there'd be some answer in reading that speech, even though I heard the whole speech. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, you know you, you've been hoping I would have a speech for you. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Uhm. (Pause) But I think, uh, at least right now anyway, I'm thinking of, that there's something else in it that I was feeling strongly about. Because uhm, I don't, I would assume he must feel that, th—, you know the fact he had to resign is based on, to a large degree, decisions he made that are his mistakes and nobody else's. And uh, since that's the kind of, you know, just being able to admit making a mistake and then carry on that I find, you know I've always in the past found, very difficult. I guess, I'm wondering, well how did he? And I don't think I'm feeling that there's anything of that in my separating from you. But, but it is something that I have never had to handle since I've thought about the fact that I have had trouble accepting making mistakes. And uhm — (Silence)</p></p>

<p>Well maybe what it really comes down to though is just wondering how he kept himself from crying, because I get back to that and the fact uhm, I did keep being afraid that he was going to. (Pause) And I don't know why, I mean it must be because then I, I just don't want to. And uh, I don't think I really know why. Because I don't think it's embarrassment. Uh, I, I don't know, maybe it's that I was glad he didn't because it was just more dignified, and I'd rather leave in a more dignified way than just going out crying or something but — (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: You know, it sort of strikes me, as it, you began thinking again about Nixon's speech and how you felt and you're worried that he would cry after you were thinking about the recording and what it would mean. And how, you know, in some way it would be a bond between you and me. I would have part of you. Is it possible that you really are wondering how I'm feeling and, do I feel like crying? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I guess maybe. I don't know, I've wondered if you'll miss me. And I suppose that really is all part of that same thing. (Pause) I don't know (voice cracking), it makes me feel sad to even think, well, you know, wonder if you're feeling sad or to think maybe you might be or something. I don't know why. It seems like I should feel glad if I thought you did. (Sniffle, 2-minute silence) </p>
 
<p>Now I was just thinking too that I think I have another feeling about crying not so much now at the very end, but just, uhm, you know feeling sort of annoyed at myself at spending so much of this last time crying or feeling like crying. And then I suppose what I would imagine doing instead is, you know, kind of like establishing some other relationship with you. Because uh, you know if I'm not feeling what I'm really feeling then it would be I would like to, instead of feeling what I'm really feeling and crying, be gay and happy or you know some kind of a different ending, and — I guess it's also, you know when I think of, I thought of it being, well maybe I want to be more dignified or something, but I, I think I really don't want to think that the last image you had of me was, you know, me being, I don't know, just sort of pathetic, crying. And, I, I guess it's kind of like the whole, you know, one whole image that I have tried in the past to project, of being sort of pathetic and helpless and, you know, kind of feel sorry for me kind of thing, and — (Silence)</p> 
 
<p>Now, and then I, then I was thinking of, I suppose one of the things — I don't know if I've said this — when I was being your speech writer before, (analyst coughs) but I've probably wanted you to, you know, say something like, you know, "Call me any time you feel you need to," or something like that. And even though I know I'll know if I need to when I need to, uh, and that you don't have to say anything, I guess I, you know, it's kind of — well I don't know if I'd really want you to say it. But it's one of things I've ima— I have imagined your saying. And uhm, and then I thought, well I don't even know if you'll be here (analyst coughs) next year. Uh, and I haven't asked and, you know, so th—, which would be I suppose fishing for you to say that. Because then I'd think, well, but of course I could find out. If you weren't here I could find out how I could get in touch with you if I thought I had to. And uh, and really when I get down to it I don't anticipate feeling that I have to. (Silence) </p>
 
<p>I guess I'm also, you know, I guess I've tried to talk about it in, in other (sighs) words, but I'm, I'm just thinking again that it just seems after how important you've been to me that it can just abruptly end. I don't know, it just somehow seems, even though I've been thinking about it so much, abrupt. And that it would end in any other way than that one of us died, and, uhm — (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, the other, you know, kind of metaphor that you mentioned was thinking of this as sort of 50 minutes of waiting, uh, to see somebody off on a train. I suppose, you know, your own trip through life. And right now it's time to say, "All aboard." </p>

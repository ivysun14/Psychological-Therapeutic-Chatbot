<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Section 18. Would you believe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: January 11, for our fans out there, Never Never Land. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fans indeed. [Tonight, I turn around, I just—] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Where's the manager?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I had no idea we'd be this far along. I thought it'd be sooner.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Alright, let's drop it in here. Somebody cleaned the house instead of the entry.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it's got a hole in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, in the back (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So be careful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'll drink the rest of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. So we left—where did we leave off last time, some big dramatic annul (ph), I think, didn't they? The voyage? I can't remember what [they was after in total.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't remember exactly where we were right when we ended, but we were getting into the thing about possible homosexual stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your feelings about that and—</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did that rear its ugly head?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, we went— Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did that rear its ugly head? I thought we were—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You reared it!</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles) Yea, I know, after following (ph) what though?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you were talking about that novel, and we went around about that for a long time. And—</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sandy comes out okay, by the way. (inaudible at 0:01:31.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, he does?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, he does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's so good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what happens to him, he really freaks out, and he has to go away for awhile. He takes his bag, and he's alright (ph). (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He comes back and—</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, he really freaks, but he takes it (ph). But what else was there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you were talking about going— Well, you were talking about that girl, the new girl, and about sexual stuff and whether you were going to be able to make it in a sexual relationship. And then we talked about, well, you would explore that. And you were saying that you were afraid to explore the sexual stuff for fear that it would turn out to be homo—that you would turn out to be homosexual, and you'd rather not investigate it at all [and pretend in the end.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Jobless bachelor] (ph), or whatever—I can't remember what your terms were—rather than finding out that the homosexual stuff was factual. You know what I mean (ph)? [0:02:38.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, that's— yea, that's something along those line, I think, there Ann. Yea, I think the difficulty was that I was confused as to what attitude I might take towards that. [An idea I feel I don't get any real emotion] (ph) of how that would—how that would work. Well— Yea, I really don't. I just have to say that it's a revol—it's a revolving development, a revolving—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Emotion.</p>

<p>I don't know, I wonder if I may have overstated that a little bit in reacting. In thinking that my basic—one of the basic emotions that comes to me when I think of a real sexual encounter with a woman: it's one of the strongest elements in this fear. And so— because I think, at least overtly, I haven't gotten any of those kinds of things that you'd normally associate with a—with a homosexual, or something of that kind.</p>

<p>I really think that that's a strong element in it because I get in that kind of situation the strongest— The strongest emotion probably beyond desire or anything else is probably fear, which accounts for the fact that I, chiefly, in those situations like to be drunk or under some drug, or something like that, because that removes the immediacy out of it in a certain way. [0:04:31.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Cuts down on the fear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. And it— I use it as a crutch. That's the classical reason for it. And I think that—come to think of it, most of the times that I— I think that one of the things, when I first started going out with girls—I was drinking right from high school. But, I would normally—even with—even on the first serious thing I did, I was frightened—which is normal, I suppose, at that age. And I used drinking whenever I'd go over her house, or something. I'd figure it out, where her parents' bottle of Ferb (ph) (sp) or something, and drink. So that was a— I always used that as a mechanism to make it easier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To loosen you up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. And it does the job, in my respect; because you can— I invariably have a better time with people when I'm tight then I do then when stone-cold sober. Because when I'm stone-cold sober, there're too many awkward things that are—make it somewhat unpleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead—</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think the thing—on the other hand, I think the thing, which is one of the reasons why I would suspect it early as possible that that could be—the homosexual thing could be kind of my motivation partly, is the simple lack of— I read somewhere, I just maybe misinformed or something; I'd rather hope I am. I read somewhere that the simple lack of having a successful heterosexual relationship says something about your motivation in terms of your sexual orientation. It's as though you're refusing to accept a woman in that case. And it's sort of half baked in my mind now, when I recall it, but it seems to have a certain plausibility if you—like I suppose on assumptions. That is to say that your conscience can direct you that strongly. So, [if not for that] (ph) then it wouldn't be fear at all; it would just be— the thing behind that would have to be, you're refusing to do it, so somehow it disgusts you, I suppose, or you're repugnant to it. [0:06:52.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it disgust you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it doesn't. Really, the thing I—the thing that— Another emotion that I associate with sexuality is an enormous—physically, a sort of a weakening process, a certain innervation, or just a weakening kind of a thing. It's like it takes your breath away, and it takes your will away or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it does to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. And I don't know how that—whether that's suppose to be the right force or not. It certainly doesn't make me feel masterful or confident, or especially enjoyous, or anything else. It's just makes—it just— It's frightening, in a certain sense, because it does have, in a certain way, that power to— I'm sure this is preposterous for somebody my age to be talking about it in this way, but you have to go through those.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go through that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean it sounds a little bit, in my own ears, like the kind of thing that might be said by someone that's much younger. But then in many ways, that's the case. But with me, I am a little bit younger, I think, in my emotional responses. Or emotional responses, you might associate with Hugh Dallas (ph), rather than that of a developed person. So I don't want to oblige you further for having an ear for it (ph). [0:08:30.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But— So those are the—those are the kinds of things that fly around in my head. Some are the kind of feelings I can't figure out (ph). And it's— The other thing that disturbed me about those kinds of things is the sheer difficulty that I would, with some exceptions, have in forming a fairly easy relationship on a social level with a female. I had another thing the other night, which this is probably a bad example—excuse me. But, a friend of mine, we were out drinking, and we stumbled across a sunny fling of his, and we were chatting away. And, the moment she came into the little party, I began to feel a little awkward. Maybe it was because she was a girlfriend of his and then I was a little left out, I think, because they were (inaudible at 0:09:43.6) and so forth. But then he strolled away for a few moments, and then I was back on center stage, and it really—I began to ask really vain old questions and was really like not at all— He's kind of the same. He even got kind of uptight about the same thing. And that's been sort of a ruining pattern too. I don't know what that may or may not mean, but it's part of it. Some of it, I think is part of it. I think it is, I really don't know.</p>

<p>So, I don't know what really further to say except that that those are the kinds of things that I run into with (ph). It's just that I have an enormous amount of difficulty in getting out the basics so that I can really communicate in that respect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea, it sounds like it scares you before communication can begin (ph). [0:11:04.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of the best lines of communication I've had is with this particular friend of mine in another—and I think I've said this before that, that whole thing revolved around—to a certain extent—mutual, but to my point of view, a little less than mutual sharing of certain negative characteristics: the goofing around, the negative aspects of screwing around so much at night when you should be going to bed at a reasonable hour. Staying up and drinking �til hours into the night and then wowowo (ph) about how you worked, and work the next day. And he's criticizing himself for it, and I'm criticizing myself for it, and we're having a great deal of fun doing it. But that really strikes me as an enjoyable thing. It seems sort of harmless when he and I are both laughing at that, such people that are really—really such would-be-confident people, and all that, are indulging in these foibles. And it seems like an immensely funny thing, especially when you elaborate a little bit in some lie or stung at the other, I don't know (ph). [0:12:28.4].</p>

<p>But what it really is, on my part, is it's really sort—it has a very strong negative content. And to me, it really meets a sort of a— By putting myself down in a lot of ways, it's also a refusal, on a real elementary level, to recognize any real responsibilities or any real goals or anything that means very much to me (ph). So it's sort of a cultivation of certain childishness.</p>

<p>So, that's not the kind of a level, ordinarily, that most women would want to relate to. [0:13:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That negative level?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. So if I were to— In some ways, it's kind of typical line that guys will use about "why I'm really having problems" and so and so forth, and all those "I'm sure you've seemed saddened before too." In fact, you've spoken of it, that you sometimes employ this yourself, and then you're expecting the other person to say that—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "wow, you're really lacking" and touch you to their bosom and all that. But, I just think it's really—it's not very attractive, at least in a first instance—on a first getting to know somebody—if they come on with something like that. Finally, somebody will just say, "Well, that's kind of childish. This is ridiculous, going through all this." And it really is in a lot of respects. [0:14:05.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems that you would have to establish some ground to prove yourself on some level before you get into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, right, yea. And then you can—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Build in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of—Instead of—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After the person builds you up (ph), and you don't even know them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, the typical response to it would just be impatience. It's just, personally—it's sort of a silly reaction (ph). So—so you can't really expect that, although, they say, "One of the most things I enjoy most about talking to people, is talking about difficulties that I or they have in dealing with things."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You ever done that with somebody when first meeting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think a little bit. It's difficult for me to do it. It's difficult for me to do very much at all, it appears, without having a couple of drinks. But it's difficult for me because I become very uncertain of my ground. It's shocking that I could really—some other—in so many respects, when I'm thinking of it now, that it would be really interesting to me. But I feel a little bit like, again, this is the kind of thing that you're not really supposed to go into at this point. Occasionally, you have that sort of where you can meet girls and talk on that level. But normally speaking, I find that I, at least—I become sort of uncertain of my reality and sort of hung up whether I should be saying that at all there—very confused in my head as to what exactly I should—it appears that I'm saying (ph); but again (ph) having the—exchanging biology (ph). When both she and you are not expecting very much other than that, I could go on and stay all day (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But as long as she begins to expect more than what's a little expected of you—to either be funny, witty, interesting, or something of that kind—then it's sort of command performance, and it becomes a little bit more difficult to do. [0:16:27.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they know why it feels like the easiest thing, getting that far (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, very, very uncomfortable. Again, particularly, if you're both dealing at current (ph)—if you're— As I mentioned before, sometimes when you're talking with someone—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not one time one on one (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you're talking to someone and they expect something more than just the kind of in place (ph) remarks, then I stand venalities (ph) and don't get into the kinds of things that I could really talk about very well because I'm not certain of how—what— I guess what I'm really saying is that I'm certain that finally they're going to sniff and say this—reject me in any event. If I were to say—I don't know what it might be, "major masturbation strikes me as true or false" or something (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How �bout trying it here for two minutes for us and just try saying something more than getting on to me. Could we try it as a, somehow, practice session of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What would be our—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say something I made up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that— A matter of fact, I find that very difficult too, because we're talking, right now, about things that are unbanal (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true. That's true. [0:17:58.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. And it's that. And so it's difficult for me to play with what I might say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't think that—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That'll be it and— I'm fragile (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm—awe! It still amazes me a little bit how hard conversation is for you, and I think my general thing is just talk, just say things that—</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, I understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: An answer said, (ph) then done!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I overcame the scene a little bit (ph). In these things, if you were—had just met me or something or saw me at a gathering of some kind, it wouldn't occur to you as something I was feeling confident in conversation. I'm really talking about my response to the picture I'm putting forward and how conflicted it gets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about you knowing you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Knowing that you'd—</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I start to go on and on. In a point of fact, it's a superficial level, if I can get somebody going with me, a certain— Well I have. In the past, at least, other people have found that I can be sort of interesting. In fact a girl one time, when she was explaining why she no longer liked me after she married a friend of mine—and it didn't disturb me because I, in fact, never liked her—had really told me that's one of the reasons why she really liked me because of what she took to be an interesting conversational style, or flashy conversational style. [0:19:55.6]</p>

<p>And it really relates in a lot of measure to how I feel about them. About this particular girl, I wasn't defensive very much at all because she didn't live up to what I thought would be a serious— just think of it from a second [etched land] (ph), from the point of view of looks and hair and bearing (ph) and all of that. And I was really just taking her out at a very course level—it was a very course level—to try and win my way in another social group that I wasn't in at the time. So it was really sort of a practice kind of a thing. It became very natural after awhile. I just didn't feel that to her, especially her opinion, that very much, and I thought [that I was] (ph) probably the best thing she'd ever seen anyway. So, it was totally simplified when I thought about her, whenever I thought about her (ph).</p>

<p>So— I never—I don't think I ever really communicated with her; although, I may have in a lot more ways than I think. And maybe I didn't always have this difficulty in this sense. Maybe it's just that this truth (ph) is tightening so much that it's a lot worse now than it ever was in the past. But anyways, though (ph), I mean to say it isn't a matter of just confidence of being able to speak to people—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I still didn't hear your response for what she said though. Your response is that it doesn't count because she's from a second-at chance (ph)? Is that what it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was a little bit pleased to hear her say that because—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea, I didn't hear that part. [0:21:46.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It had, then, a little bit of a conceit for me. It still is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A good thing to know. [However you want to say it] (ph). So what are you saying there (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, it was that she—well she also— Well that was kind of a complicated thing. But—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't need to go into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. But—so anyway, that's what I'm saying that it's not just a matter of feeling that I'm captive at conversing. But I think it's possible that recently, again, because I do— Maybe it's a lot worse now then it was before, where previously I could be a lot—probably a lot— When you're younger you can be a lot more like hurried (ph) about the consequences of the good (ph) thing happening to you. Were a good thing happening to me— Whereas now, if a certain thing happens, it's another sort of nail in a coffin type of arrangement, and it just takes on a lot of significance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels like I'm realizing (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels like time is running out. I've almost done that impression of a little three minute egg timer sitting over there. And you're watching it, and it's two-thirds gone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, to a certain extent, I do feel time is running out. [0:23:18.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that— now that I've reasoned—I think I really do feel under a good deal of stress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like life's [bad without our hand for awhile] (ph), and you add a little pulling in the eye and all those things like that. So there's, I think, a little stress there. And so again, each tale, you worry (ph). Success, or whatever, begins to assume a magnitude that's more, maybe, greater than a more light-hearted approach would give it. But at this point, I don't feel that any of those things are especially light-hearted. So that's—maybe that's why I feel that way, particularly here, in regarding time to (inaudible at 0:24:13.8). I don't know. I just feel totally unsure of my grounds (inaudible). And I'm thinking about all those things, and I'm going "yea."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea, it feels like you're different—that that's a hell of a lot different than talking to somebody in the office. It doesn't feel like another person; it feels like another test, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, that I found that the opposite of the situation is psychologically easier for me then, like, emotionally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right, that's what I'm saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. Well because—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if it was somebody in the office you're talking at, to somebody on the street—or whatever—it sounds like it's easier than if they're female.</p>

<p>PATIENT: True. That's quite true. I'm just at the point where, kind of, the pressure gets the chance, well, you just tend to clutch out—and so—and would rather leave the scene of that kind of a difficulty than continue to pursue it. Even with this girl I'm taking out now, I took her out the first time, and I went to— And I've done this—used this same tactic before; apparently, it's sort of unconscious because I've repeated, now, on a couple of occasions. But, you know, you're coming on very strong, and I want to go out with this chick, "why don't we do this?" or "why don't we do that?" And as I get a little tighter, it becomes more and more, sort of, aggressive. And so she finally thinks that I may at any moment to get close to her. [0:25:47.9]</p>

<p>And so I really try and get my hooks in, somewhat, rather than trying to play it more delve-in-ear (ph) and coolish. At this point in time, I guess I'm not really capable of doing because, again, these things become more and more important to you. So— And I've used that technique before, so I'm attaching a great deal of significance to those things. I want to definitely have her response. And I try to get a firmer response out of her by being pretty flattering—or implicitly, especially flattering—if that's possible, and as the night wears down, my capacities become more and more degenerated. But— So that seems to be the idea behind it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's happening specifically with that girl that you're talking about last week (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she went through a— Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you still seeing her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. I think that—I think that— I don't know what she thinks. But my reaction was that— First of all, I've made a couple of errors re-asking her questions that I already asked her—not that same night—but already touched on previously, but she picked me up on it real sharply. [0:27:30.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then you already said that before one time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She said, "You already said something about war (ph). There was a lot in the conversation where somewhere we could have just stopped." And I said, "Well�" I know what it was. I asked her what her favorite movie was, and she said, "You already asked me what that was." And I said, "Well what did you say?" And she told me, but she picked up on it a little bit. And so then I began to think Oh, crush (ph)! She thinks I'm using her as a functional (ph)—which, of course I really am, and therefore she's right. And I really don't like her at all; I'm just using her as a stepping stone. And she deserves better than that in some support (ph). Well— And then I began to pressure her, which are two entirely different kinds stories (ph): one is a very geoecology (ph) type place, and the other is where we were expecting to [seem someone firm] (ph). And the other place was a much hippier type of place folks seem (ph) so— And I begin to pressure her, I think, a little bit too tightly. She's very quiet. And I said, "Which of these two places do you prefer the most?" And she just said, "Well, I don't think very much of either one. I don't think of either one as special." Or, "Neither one is especially stronger," or something like that. And I think I was asking her other questions trying to get her to her clear herself. She was actually, rather, bland in a lot of ways and not especially talkative. So— But then, she did begin to go into some little mirrors (ph) about some Matwork (ph) movie or book, or something, and pointing out that she didn't like it or something. And I took over the mix (ph) because I'd said, like before, "I do." And she was like saying "I don't like that kind of thing." And she said it rather positively. And I can't think whether we were talking about some specific—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like there's been a lot of wrestling. [0:29:37.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like there's been a lot of wrestling then: you "yes" and she "no", and you "no" and she "yes."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, there was, a little bit. And then, again, I guess I was just trying to force her hand a little bit to get her to—to be a little bit more—to come on a little bit stronger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you consider saying anything like, "Hey, you're awfully quiet there a little bit. What's that about?" Try to feel what's going on (ph).Would you consider saying that a little bit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, but not to that extent. We only went out like two or three times at this point. Well, and also, she's not exactly that kind.— I asked her one time— She's from Virginia, she's from a little town in Virginia and—Dansville, for the record, Las Dreary, Dansville. So she's from Dansville, and I said, "What do you miss most about not being in Virginia?" And she said, "Well�" "What do you like most out here in New York out Virginia?" And she said, "Well, things are a lot simpler in Danville." And she said it very sweetly though. And actually, she is a little bit that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is a little bit what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's—I think that she's a sort of simple person. I mean that in the best sense. And she's not— it wouldn't be her style to go through a neurotic agonizing with me or with herself or with anybody else saying "oh, I did this" or "I did that." She's an awfully shell (ph). And it was just like— She wouldn't be critical, especially when it just wouldn't be her favorite thing (ph). So— But, maybe part of the reaction I was hearing further was the result of this thing about I'm not really sure if I like her. Again, she's just sort of there. I know she'll go out with me because she doesn't really know that many people. I could show her a nice time if I wanted to (ph) or on all those cases. So she's just sort of there, and I know that she's available. And I hope to be able to use her as a re-entry vehicle, in a certain way. And maybe that really shows, I don't know. [0:32:03.6]</p>

<p>I mean, I can see how it would be really horrible if she's not that convinced that she's a beautiful girl and who would want her, and why my kind of person that goes around people that drinks a lot, and there's much ado, and they're all kind of tight in a circle and all that—at least just to be heard, really—would go out with her who's really as much as I say, a quiet or simpler kind of persona that would be quiet happy having a cup of coffee with her at GB's or something, (inaudible), I don't know. And she could resent it. She could wonder, (inaudible) I don't know what he's doing this for. (inaudible) And then he's done this bout (ph) of asking the questions twice. Maybe she'd find that a little insulting. So— (Laughter) Going to her (ph), "What did you say again? Oh, yea. Oh, yea, you did tell me that." So, I don't know. I mean, that's really specifically the reason why I am going out with her, because she was there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good to see a good man. Good laugh at yourself (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughter) Well it's— I could see how that could be true, that's all. But as I say—I mean, her attitude, I could see how that could be her attitude. But my attitude is that, I just draw on the wind (ph). I'm just not ready to take on more forward-able (ph) creatures. And then, if they are forward-able (ph) and good-looking and rather vivacious (ph), I have to compete (ph) with the rest of the circle. And I just don't have the emotional equipment. When you get in a social situation, at a party or something, I decide like well, I'm done at this point (ph). I mean, I just whew!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't compete with the rest of the guys, and anything incriminating (ph) would be devoured?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything incriminating (ph) would be devoured? [0:34:12.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not devoured—not devoured, but I just wouldn't come off well, and I'd just shrink up. I'd hate myself for not having the best result (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's still the kind of situation in which you want to make a go (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. I guess it is. I hadn't thought of that intention (ph), at least certainly at times (ph), but yea. I guess so. It's a conspicuous consumption, I guess, when it comes down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, having a good-looking chippy (ph) on your arms is for the competitive satisfaction it gives you because of your peers. And it's recognized as a, perhaps, not a very warm-going motive (ph). And I didn't recognize that as I said that— that I—that was true. So I guess that still is a strong element. And it's a false element, I suppose (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? (ph) I mean, I don't know what you're going to get out of it. So you play in a game and you win it in terms of good image, and the rest of the guys aren't. Have you got what you want? Would you want it (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I've got it because I've got a good image in there eyes, and I can go ahead without a good image in my own eyes (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just would— I can't see you going about it in that manner. I mean, it seems like the only way you're going to have a good image in anybody else's eyes is to [deal with it from it within] (ph) and do good with yourself; It'll show. But it's kind of hard to get emptiness (ph) there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: True. Well right, I can't get deny the values that are supposedly going to make me happy from the dictates of other people and quite directly from their view of going in, which has got to be the ultimate in the other directed person, I suppose. Is that the phrase you use? [0:36:35.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean that's got to be, I suppose, pretty much the definition of it. And I can see an ideal sense that that's not so, or rather, that may be a dead-end kind of a view—a dead end for me—because I find that I have a good image in their eyes and still at many wars (ph)with myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you going to do (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, anyways, it's interesting to me that (inaudible) — But I accept that that view of things. It's so ingrained in me in a certain way—in a certain specific way, I suppose, about who I go out with that I find it difficult to conceive it in any other terms so it could be dealt with. Because I do—on other levels—I am very much a man of private destination myself. But, for some reason, my sexual orientation or success or whatever, is bound up in the approval of my flaws (ph) in some fashion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea, which makes it a lot harder to achieve sexual success, because you're trying to make it with somebody you don't even—well, I just see very little guarantee with somebody with somebody who would "fit" in that group. It's a relative few than what you really want. I mean you've talked about your ultimate goal is to be with somebody and be happy with somebody—with a girl—woman—and build some kind of life and have some kind of intimacy, and that just is not found at the root of intimacy and love. [0:38:25.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea I know it doesn't. I can't argue with it, but it was a spontaneous giveaway. I mean, that apparently is pretty strong in my attitude.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea, yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess I'm getting at somewhere, I suppose, too (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you want me to— I'd like to spell out a little bit more what I see, and that is that you have two different goals, and they're in conflict with each other. And as a result, one's variant (ph) of getting the other. When you have that goal of having that intimate relationship, and you have that goal of being, okay, sharp, you've got to decide (ph). And that means having a certain kind of date, having a certain kind of monologue. And yet, you don't know if you can make it at all with that kind of girl. I mean, that scares the **** out of you is what it sounds like, which is nowhere in getting into what you want in an individual—over there—which means that playing this whole game, which is a very time-consuming, totaled kind of activity, it sounds like, leaves you blind, kind of, of reaching that other goal. So it's a matter of choosing, which goal do you want? Which goal are you going to put your time and energy into getting? [0:40:07.4]</p>

<p>(Silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea well—</p>

<p>(Silence)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I can't—I can't decide. What I'm really trying to think about now is what—just sort of ramification. Turning that—</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Think a lot's going on (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I can just see—that it's— Well I don't have to go into it. It's just that it's a personal reverie (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a personal what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A reverie, that's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well— I don't know—I don't know what— I don't know what kind of furthest response I can make because I accept that alternative that you suggest to be [the sort of basic and alone.] (ph) The thing is that you think it's worthwhile, or if you can consider to make—consider it worthwhile to, sort of like, make a conscience, deliberate effort in that regard. [0:42:12.2]</p>

<p>For example, let's take its most—to take it to a logical extreme, you might—you might— Well, for example, the kind of girl I'm currently seeing, maybe she would prefer to go to— Let's say she did have a cup of coffee at GB's, so that even though at this point, it would make me feel uncomfortable because I'd always have this idea in my head that this isn't the way you're suppose to act sort of thing; this isn't the way my class has been brought up to handle this thing. To make a conscience effort to fight that kind of an impulse and say, "Well regardless, what I really want to do is just cultivate this person and do things to make her feel comfortable." And you think that kind of thing of a thing using some force (ph) will really work? You see what I mean? There's that— Maybe that doesn't make much sense (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll be right back, (inaudible). [0:43:24.0]</p>

<p>(Silence)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:44:16.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who is it? Did you say "thank you very much"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, my next client knew that I was seeing four people in a row and thought we'd better have a cup of coffee in between clients. So he ordered coffee from a (inaudible). That was room service with coffee.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's very nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that about takes up all our time. We can do all this next time (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really feel bad. Why do we always end in the middle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No we're at the end; I think I know what your answer is, possibly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's my response?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your response is going to be that, yes (chuckles) that it would be worthwhile. But you've forgotten the question. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I haven't—no I haven't forgotten the question, that it would not be worthwhile because it's force?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's very hard. It's like a forced thing. It's either one extreme or the other. It's either forcing her to be in your world or forcing you to be in her world, you know what I'm saying? And either way, it's a forcing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either way you described is a forcing thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about finding another girl who you could be comfortable in her world, and you making some kind of world where you could both be comfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, ideally that'll be terrific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or finding something with this girl where you can find something that isn't going to be quite as uncomfortable for you in forced GB's coffee.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea. Right, I think that maybe that's true that, in a certain way, if you're low in spontaneity for the thing, it really sort of does it. And maybe that was part of what she was responding negatively to, also, the fact that there was— maybe she could detect in my attitude a certain lack of spontaneity and a certain going by route in a certain way. But I don't know, we'll see. Maybe she'll work out after all. [0:46:43.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe. And I think on Tuesday night, we're going to do the two in this week, finish up next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thursday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could do it earlier. I'd prefer to do it, like, 6:00 Tuesday night if we do it Thursday night. And don't feel pressured that you have to do it. We can—you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yea, I'd rather wait �til Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to wait �til Tuesday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then we'll see what's left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [0:47:21.0]</p>

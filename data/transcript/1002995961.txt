<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:00:03.4) what are you going to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to get up and I going to spot my water on my face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'm going to be like, okay, I need to get my (inaudible - 0:00:11.9) on the situation, I will be back, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'm going to leave hopefully, you know, the cold air will hit me in my mouth and � (inaudible - 0:00:27.8). And then I mean is my next step like just repeating those things to myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Physical sensation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going to (inaudible - 0:00:38.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lose my control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:00:42.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is not, you know, this is not real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have control of it, I'm going to calm down. You focus, you be focusing on the physical sensation but (inaudible - 0:00:51.0) your thoughts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah, I like that, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So then, you know like, I'll just, I'll start moving then � I think that's really good because being reminded of like the really physical things, I think you're right because I have always found that like running or like having sex or something like that is more able to like get me out of that mind set.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also the other reason why  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - your emotions, your behavior, I think they are collected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's why when you're emotionally upset you feel it physically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you're not able to kick in automatic what you're thinking, usually we kick in automatic what you're thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. (inaudible - 0:01:32.5). That really does, that really makes sense actually.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. And so then once I get my physical back, you know like, I, I stop breathing heavily and that kind of thing  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - is that when I start? I mean is that a good time to start thinking again or like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're talking (inaudible - 0:01:54.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or (inaudible - 0:01:58.6) do right now? You find what your rationale thinking is (inaudible - 0:02:06.2). Okay. And if you find (inaudible - 0:02:07.2) you're going to stop, going to rationale, you know, (inaudible - 0:02:12.5) rationale thoughts. (inaudible - 0:02:17.9) go back and talk. (inaudible - 0:02:21.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I like that role.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because it's not helping anybody. It's just not helping you, I don't think it's a good (inaudible - 0:02:29.7) to help you (inaudible - 0:02:32.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I agree, I agree. No, I think that's really, really a good idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Because for some reason when I get in that (inaudible - 0:02:42.4) I just feel like (inaudible - 0:02:44.0). And that's so wrong because I'm not in a productive frame of mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible - 0:02:49.5) yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's not the only path we're going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just an option.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you're use to doing one reason I've learned (inaudible - 0:02:58.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (inaudible - 0:03:00.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:03:06.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really have looked at, it's sensible but to stop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:03:16.6) just over minor things, you know, like I start freaking out a little bit (inaudible - 0:03:21.9). So I really like that one and also I really like, I'm not perfect  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - but, you know, and don't like to say (inaudible - 0:03:37.2) but like, I'm not perfect but that's okay, I'm still darn good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you (inaudible - 0:03:46.5) that now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Much more so then when I started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, yeah like it's funny, you know, I was filling out this form today and I would like to see my answers changing or  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and so it talked about like I feel like I'm worthless or stuff like that and I know a couple of weeks ago like I was the same way frequently, you know, almost always and now I'm like, you know, (inaudible - 0:04:12.1). But a lot of times I'm like you did that really well or, you know like it's becoming much more balanced and just much more like real I feel like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good. (inaudible - 0:04:24.0) the same?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:04:26.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And once your limit you feel (inaudible - 0:04:29.6). That's good, that's really good. Actually, (inaudible - 0:04:39.9) what works for you and whatever that sticks in your mind and use that tool as a reminder. (inaudible - 0:04:45.2) to stop it (inaudible - 0:04:47.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's almost kind of funny like, it makes me stop taking myself so fricking seriously. Oh my God, you're actually having to tell yourself like stop (inaudible - 0:04:59.7). It's just kind of looked funny to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good (inaudible - 0:05:04.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I'm (inaudible - 0:05:05.6) like, okay, you can control your thought like you know (inaudible - 0:05:09.6). People take that a little too seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:05:14.1). Because when you're laughing at something (inaudible - 0:05:21.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so now like sometimes when I do feel a little scared I recognize all those negative feelings, I recognize how irrational they are and why, why was I believing this thing that doesn't really make sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. And I also like (inaudible - 0:05:40.9) how you said you realize that the (inaudible - 0:05:42.7) was imperfect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's good too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it is and I mean it's phenomenal that like finally I'm getting that. It's so, I mean I've always felt like I've fully known that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just would not allow myself to (inaudible - 0:06:00.6), you know I just feel like sometimes I'm such an idealist, I'm not there to be something for (inaudible - 0:06:04.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's (inaudible - 0:06:05.3) not that thing like it's going to be perfect and so I kind of feel like that was my last refuge like that was my last like delusion that I could have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so now I'm just realizing that like it's a real thing, it's like real tangible thing that's going to have flaws and going to have, you know like, imperfections.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really powerful and so I've seen how that makes it perfect, like I've really started using (inaudible - 0:06:34.4) and particularly at least not driving me crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt like, you know that's kind of lovable because you know like even if it's not like good it's like still an imperfection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm like okay with it, it's like it comes along with this person I love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know so it's not like throwing out the whole (inaudible - 0:06:55.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. Wow, that's a big shift in your thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is and it's really, it's really empowering.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If nothing is perfect then there's no way I should expect myself to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible - 0:07:12.8) what's the fun in that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, yeah, it wouldn't be like I don't know I was thinking of this weird analogy but the love, the idea of love I had before was kind of like a Botox version of love (inaudible - 0:07:30.9). It's just like to me it looked good but it's not real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like I don't know like that's one way I think about it and it kind of like amuses me too because, you know it's so fake and it can't last. You know there's a (inaudible - 0:07:44.3) that work Botox like can't smile or  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - you probably can't tell the difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I feel like that version of love, like if it describes you by the universe it doesn't mean anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know those fairy tales and love stories are (inaudible - 0:07:57.7). Like I mean (inaudible - 0:08:06.2). Culture (inaudible - 0:08:10.6). But they are just a snapshot if you really look at it like a love story (inaudible - 0:08:16.5) your whole life, you wouldn't be so perfect, right? No, it's too human in your relationship with each other, like boundaries are usually (inaudible - 0:08:23.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:08:25.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's very good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:08:30.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:08:33.1). Or take cold shower.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And dealing with the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I really like the, I do not talk when you're in panic mode, like I really like that. Don't talk when in panic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:09:00.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think is, yeah, I think any couples, you know when you're like (inaudible - 0:09:08.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:09:18.5). Yeah, I really like those.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm really glad like that we're kind of addressing this because I do feel like I'm making so much progress like the normal feeling and so like now being able to walk into a room without (inaudible - 0:09:46.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm able to feel really empowering.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, definitely. (inaudible - 0:09:54.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just more strong emotion. (inaudible - 0:10:00.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's focus on the physical symptoms.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really like and I like (inaudible - 0:10:05.7) it's all connected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like then if I'm able to break any part of the cycle then I can break the cycle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Absolutely. Okay. So first (inaudible - 0:10:15.6) situation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Only because (inaudible - 0:10:20.6). And I actually haven't felt that way like in the past like  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ever since that, that switch went off  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I haven't really felt that desire.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like and to be honest even though I was feeling those things  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I feel like no matter how irrational I get there is still some rationale boundaries I'm not capable of crossing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And especially with this one I think I'm going to be able to throw it out, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:10:59.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not you're, I mean (inaudible - 0:11:01.0)  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - but it's not like your like (inaudible - 0:11:03.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know I mean I think that, I think this is really like really good and I want to do stuff like, because when I do get really (inaudible - 0:11:15.3) like. Like once, I did this one time and I just, I was sorry with myself because I did it because (inaudible - 0:11:22.5) just because like  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - my emotions � and I don't want to doing stuff like that (inaudible - 0:11:29.6) that's like (inaudible - 0:11:31.9) it was the sound and the breaking and the, you know like it kind of snapped me out of a shell almost, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I want a constructive way to, I don't want to (inaudible - 0:11:44.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Constructive way like bring myself to attention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah I feel (inaudible - 0:11:51.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that you tell before (inaudible - 0:12:01.6) just (inaudible - 0:12:04.3). But he knows what he needs to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah, I think that's really good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Instead of just walking out in anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:12:14.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're clear of what's happening here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I really like that. I really like that I'm excited.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean hopefully I won't even have to get to the part (inaudible - 0:12:28.0) but if I get even �</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think you need to get to the point because you know what you're (inaudible - 0:12:35.), you're going to get to the point, yeah you are. You have to learn it now. Try different things now. I agree, yeah. (inaudible - 0:12:45.3) to get yourself there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No honestly if I, if I even start feeling like, feeling like this from a few things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you feel that physical symptom (inaudible - 0:12:55.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, this is good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And honestly like I do, I really want to thank you because it's so much of a change how I was feeling a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes like you know (inaudible - 0:13:11.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can do it but it just helps (inaudible - 0:13:16.5) to keep you uncomfortable and kind of (inaudible - 0:13:19.7), that kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And help with that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is (inaudible - 0:13:23.3) having to come back and report to you like yeah I did try this and this is how it worked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I huge so thank you.</p>

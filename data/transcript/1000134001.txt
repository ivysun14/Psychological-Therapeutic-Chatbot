<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where are we right now? Is this a better place to start?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I'm not ... so busy today and doing, the last couple of days I've been pretty rattled.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you rattled right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm trying to get myself in order because I am in a harrowing, harrowing day. I had a, I don't know I guess you don't really want to talk too much about, you know, experiences. In fact, I wasn't going to be relieved and have to bring this up but I did have experiences that might be of some sort of interest, I don't know. On Thursday, to give you an idea, where I was at Thursday one of these things that sort of a that depressed me, you know, with cause I'm going to say. It started out with the normal routine of having a drink with a friend of mine and it went on and on and on at ad nauseam, and we left there, you know, at 9:30 at night finally. (inaudible - 0:01:39.2) really drunk and I went back to my building and I don't really know what the point of this story is especially but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the point of your telling me then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I, the point is I want to give you a more of an idea of what, how I'm reacting now as to things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what kind of, what a bad scene it is I suppose, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I went back to the building and there was this woman I know who lived on one of the other floors there below me and I suppose that I was there about 10 o'clock and he's about 45 or 48 and she's divorced and a bit dissipated herself. (inaudible - 0:02:26.7) answering the door and she wasn't there but she left her door open and in my enthusiasm I went into her apartment, stumbled around for awhile and finally, finally just went to bed in her bed after having taken off most of my clothes and strewing them about in her living room. So I think she came back about 3:30 or something and I had seen her before, of course, and she jumped right in, you know. And I suppose I was still a little asleep really and we razzed about a little bit for awhile and I didn't even know why I was, what I was doing (inaudible - 0:03:16.2) 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you remember it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was asleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you remember it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember just awakening, the thing I remember was I was punching at her and like moaning, groaning so and so forth and feeling her next to me and so now I awoke and I realized that what it was she was in the process of taking off the rest of her clothing. So I left from the bed and made some fairly (inaudible - 0:03:48.3) remarks for that time of morning and left. Pulled on my, my drawers and the rest of my clothing and went upstairs. So for the remainder of the, this happened on Thursday night, so for the remainder I went to work finally about 11 o'clock Friday. For the remainder of the weekend I became a recluse because I was suffering from, you know, remembering what had happened. It was such an enormous guilt feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were your feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was feeling that it was, and this is probably why I want, one of the points (inaudible - 0:04:24.5), there was such an enormously pathetic performance, you know, on my part. I felt like a real child getting into a bed and then finally later on she came back and fleeing the scene. And something similar to that has happened before with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's talk ... with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was your reaction this time when you left?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My reaction was well I did it again, you know, when I felt I was so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What specifically?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hear your feelings were ah, I did it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's right, no, no. When she, when I awoke, you know, I ... see I didn't even realize when I awoke and I was, you know, kissing her and so and so forth, that's why I awoke what I ended up doing. And then I realized that it was her or something and I became, you know, I thought well I can't just stay here I've got to go. I immediately jumped up and ... she let go of me for a moment and I jumped up went to the wash room, she probably thought I was going to come back but I didn't I said I got to go. And then I was thinking well it's 4 o'clock in the morning (inaudible - 0:05:54.2). But the way I thought about it later was that, you know, this is one of the things that has caused me to come here and talk with you seeing that these kind of things happening to me. And I was really doing that and it was a completely naï¿½ve expression on my part because I was so stiff, I wasn't blind but, you know, there were gaps in my memory. But I was so stiff that (inaudible - 0:06:20.7) found her door open. You know, she does that all the time or what exactly she's all about. But, and so I had gone in there I thought this is so pathetic here I am with this 45 year old she's very nearly an alcoholic herself I think woman and I didn't go back to the apartment specifically so that, maybe she called the next day or something and I didn't want to hear from her. So I just went home for the weekend and completely hibernated for the entire time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to have to face that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, god no. I mean the feeling of not remorse but so much as shame, you know, is really physical. I mean to the point where all of a sudden you'll just be sitting there and you start, you know, the thought comes back to you. And I suppose if in someway could be presented as kind of a dashing, screwy sophomore thing to do but it isn't, it really isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel like a sophomoric thing in your mind at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no it's just that sex made it extremely pathetic kind of a thing and that's why it strikes me that I must be really very desperate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are interested in her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're also saying like that in her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More example of your not knowing what you were doing -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - or what you got yourself into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And more then that look how you got yourself out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And more then anything else ... well, the fact that if I had the, the fact that I'm such chicken shit in a way too about because after all I clearly meant to couple with the woman in some manner, shape or form and then I awoke and I wasn't drunk enough. I don't think I have ever really had an interesting sexually session with a girl when I wasn't at least at a little bit beyond the state of being high (inaudible - 0:08:33.8). And so that's the only way I can finally bring myself to relax enough to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why what else happens if you're not that sick?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens if you're not that sick?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel extremely self-conscious and certain that the thing is going to result in some kind of failure on my part so I just wouldn't, I would rather not expose myself to that situation just let it go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:09:03.5) pleasure to find out -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - how inactivate you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then if you're drunk, you're drunk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you're drunk they can't -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Complain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But, you know, the thing is the only time when that didn't happen I recall it as a beacon and this again is one of the reasons why I think that I'm so nervous about my, my final development, is the only time that I have been able to really have any kind of a sexual experience when I haven't been drunk is I found a girl that I don't respect at all. Not respect at all I shouldn't say that, but that I felt I'm not worried (inaudible - 0:09:41.7). Two of them, one of them was I felt dear towards her because she was such a real unintelligent nice, nice girl but, you know, (inaudible - 0:09:55.1) socially as I am sexually and somehow -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and that all stopped. So I didn't feel nervous about her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other one was an incredibly ugly girl who I had a (inaudible - 0:10:06.4) weekend session with and didn't have any difficulties with them. I never consummated our little specifically because I was nervous about it. Forget it, it was a (inaudible - 0:10:22.1) situation. So that's the kind of situation I'm in and that's what makes me so very nervous about it. Now, as far as I you and I are concerned talking about it, I don't know if these are the kinds of things that we want to discuss in detail to determine how I felt at the time and why I felt that way. Or if you prefer to talk about a more strictly or what really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want to talk about tonight? What's weighing more heavily?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I wanted to find out, I guess I'm coming here asking too many questions, but what I want to find out is why all of this is occurring. The (inaudible - 0:11:05.5) of my development aren't so obscured or unusual but yet my mental development is going seriously, you know, array I feel and there's some reason why this is. Now either you could look at it specifically -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Frankly I think that why is the wrong question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you could know why and not change it in the least. Why is an interesting intellectual support.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And knowing how it happens  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and how you feel now and how it changes seems much more relevant then understanding the dynamics that went to make it what it was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. Okay. And in what fashion can we talk about how in these kind of situations? Because these are the things that (inaudible - 0:11:53.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It sounds like you want to talk about approaching a woman. Is there a specific  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - woman that you want to talk about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or do you want  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - to mention one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, what  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do your feelings or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, we could talk about how those things go wrong I suppose. I don't know how far we can get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you think of a specific time that's fairly vivid in your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can generalize, I can generalize.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want you to generalize. Can we think specific, to a specific time to start off with? Can you remember a specific incident with a girl where you wanted to have some kind of sexual encounter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes. I can think of several. I can think of  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's start with one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you're giving ... should I edit the ones that I think are the most significant?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want you to edit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or should I just speak of one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That occurs to me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me what happened with you to make kind of an outline of what happened between the two of you and at each step how that made you feel inside.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some have been so long ago I don't really remember that clearly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hun?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some of them have been so long ago I don't really remember that clearly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I suggest you take a recent one if you can. And I image you don't have too many recent ones or that  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can recall one  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - because you don't let yourself get into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can recall one that happened that was very illicit because it was with the girlfriend of my best friend, Mr. Fitzy. This is, I know you don't want me to tell stories but this is interesting and it is interesting in the way I reacted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were out at his house and I didn't have a date and he was with another friend of his who was very tall and (inaudible - 0:14:31.6) character.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And a beautiful lady friend who he subsequently married. And so these people are West Side as I would say, West Side Irish people (inaudible - 0:14:44.3) have parties the way I like to have parties. They like to play Charades and sing songs, things like that. My best thing, so I usually  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's your best thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I'm uncomfortable. Well, I just don't that's my idea of a party is having an interesting talk or witty talk or trying to make witty talk, just prattling on. But their idea they do a little step and they sing and they play Charades and we, so we started to play Charades and I'm really not into Charades also to kind of play the game I make a fool of myself. In fact, most parlor games I do. But that one in particular because you have to stand up in front of a number and they were making up the filthy things (inaudible - 0:15:26.1) number one pretty gross. And even then, but even if it weren't so the idea behind it is very embarrassing, you have to stand up and make a fool of yourself in front of a number of people and I got paralyzed (inaudible - 0:15:44.1). So it was my friend's girlfriend, who is a nice girl, and I was making a great fool of myself. I couldn't even, you know, even a simple Charades I was supposed to do, I couldn't do it. I would sit there and I think oh I can't think of anything that I end up embarrassing all of them. And it was horrible and she was laughing, she thought it was hilarious and I was really, I mean it was a really humiliating experience for me especially with the particular characters because they were hey let's do this and (inaudible - 0:16:11.6) some really crude joke.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what was your  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my feeling was that I'm such a shy retiring little flower I hated myself because I couldn't, couldn't get into their spirit of the thing, you know, for that moment and demonstrate my mastery of that game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what happened to you inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of them. So what happened to me inside I curled up, you know, I couldn't do anything at all and I really made a fool of myself and really inept because they give me a fairly simple one and I couldn't dream up any kind of a pantomime to give them the idea of what I was trying to do. And then they also  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me what it felt like to be curled up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, I felt like a goof and there was, well a goof. I felt like a child again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel very much on display?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, sure, sure. I was on display and on display in the worse possible fashion and I felt the incompetence of a child next to these people who were so self-confident and so assure of themselves that they could do these crude, goofy things. And I felt like I was really a shy little flower and I just wasn't equal to the situation with these people and it infuriated me because they are not really all that formable (inaudible - 0:17:27.2). And so I went through all of this business and it was horrible, so that incident was horrible. And I thought this was really horrible I'm here without a date, here these other two people with dates and I'm standing there the butt of this whole joke, and obviously a fifth wheel. And I'm doing very badly at this and I'm not being funny and the whole thing is awful. So finally the, my friend's mother, threw us out of the house (inaudible - 0:17:54.3). So we all go back and he got into a fight with her, put him in a bad mood.</p>

<p>So all of a sudden I notice that his girlfriend started keying on me for some reason, I don't know why. I've known her for very well for a long time, we were a roommate together she was over (inaudible - 0:18:05.2). And she started to key on me and it was really, we drove back to the apartment, he lived on the West Side and we both drove back downtown and she was (inaudible - 0:18:18.3) putting him down. And he was all upset because he got in a fight with his mother and it come out badly and it was kind of a goofy little spat like that and then we left. There was no shouting or screaming with it. And so he was all on edge as a result of that and uncommunicative and she was sort of putting him down and inviting me to laugh at him, it was really strange, you know. And it was a very difficult thing to do because I loved her attention and I wanted to get into a kind of a groove with her about and I felt attracted to her and she's an attractive girl, but I didn't want to I couldn't be obvious about with him sitting (inaudible - 0:18:56.7).</p>

<p>So we got back to the apartment and we decided to have a couple more drinks and I knew exactly what was going to happen at that point. He finally said well, I'm going to go to bed. So she and I sat up and we drank all night, she told me her life story and all that. And I knew what was going on and  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What was going on is that she was making a pass at me and I was, again a very passive role, she was, it was her cue not mine, I was completely confused as to why she would do it after I made such an unattractive fool of myself. Maybe she did it because her heart just went out to me or something, I mean she saw that the cards were stacking, she thought she knew me well enough  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to accept it isn't it as being any good reason? It feels like it had to have been negative a thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well that's what I'm feeling right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you quickly accept the fact just for a minute that she might have liked you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I know she likes me but I think she wouldn't have made, she wouldn't have been encouraging if she didn't like me but I think the reason why she liked me probably, I don't think I was all attractive or anything at that point, I can't think of any other reason except that particular reason. Unless, I don't know, unless that's the only thing that I can see. So as I say we sat up a good part of the night telling her story and she has got a very confused story and that she's an interesting girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't go into her story.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. And so anyway  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Side tracked weren't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that fit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I kind of figure he was thinking about her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel to be side tracked from telling your story?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How does it feel to be side tracked from telling my story?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About her life? Weren't you going to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you don't want me to say that maybe?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, weren't you going to go into telling me her life story?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just a trifle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:20:57.9). Anyway, so I'm just saying that we (inaudible - 0:21:04.3). And, oh we analyzed the cause of why Alan reacted so badly and then we went to his mother understanding what was necessary for him to  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - (inaudible - 0:21:13.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Skip that part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So then we talked about her and she told me all about herself. And I told her a little bit about myself (inaudible - 0:21:25.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dawn was breaking over the lake. And so all of a sudden I knew what was going to happen and she ... I think we started to dance, I think that's what happened and we started to dance and so I finally kissed her, you know, and it was very nice. She was very (inaudible - 0:21:46.9) with that point anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was very warm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very warm, a passionate lady and that was, you know, as I was, again it's kind of a pathetic scene in a way. As I was kissing her (inaudible - 0:22:04.3) and I told her this I said and she was very nice, my leg started to, right leg started to tremble so and I couldn't stand on it. Of course, I knew that my friend was sleeping with an ex-girlfriend (inaudible - 0:22:20.2). I knew what we were doing, I knew it was just a really bad show but I also knew that I was attracted to her and that she was attracted to me and I knew that I wanted to kiss her any more, you know. And (inaudible - 0:22:35.2) and all that going on. So, well so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your desire went out to the point where you kissed her and then  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but the thing was  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - physical reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the thing was I was going to back off because she would have at that point, as I say she was a little stiff, she would have fallen on the floor we could have had at it right on the floor (inaudible - 0:22:55.8) some big degrading scene. And I was thinking right then how am I going to cool this off a little bit, she was telling me she loved me and all that, I loved it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was great you could have just eaten it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you really felt that the price was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But, so and well, the long and short of it is but then finally we made noise, I bumped the recorder player or she bumped into a lamp or something so there we were finally embracing and Mr. Fitzy walked out. In the clear light of dawn, it's just us there and he didn't say a word he said I, he wasn't a man and he just turned (inaudible - 0:23:40.9). So I immediately and she immediately said Alan, Alan and she just went over to the side and began to cry or something and I went (inaudible - 0:23:51.0) and said don't worry about he misunderstand or we both probably very stiff and he said I don't want to hear about it. So I don't know what happened (inaudible - 0:24:02.6) it was a very bad scene and he broke up with her after that. And they like get back together again.</p>

<p>But this is, the thing about it was, you see, and actually I do have a little history of doing this with other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With other guys?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Peoples' girlfriends because</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it feels easier?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel easier because you see in the initial talks with them you don't have to come across very much you just, you know, they can take you or leave you. But after you're around them for awhile, they get to know you a little bit better and began to get on your wave length a little bit more and then they begin to respond to you a little bit more. And I'm always ready to make a pass at one of these girls. And another friend of mine I had similar circumstances  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel so tense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, it's relaxed it's very relaxing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then if  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no pressure on you to demonstrate anything it seems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and if they do respond that's great  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Terrific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and if they don't it's only your friend's girl?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yep. So it's the best of all possible worlds for a cheap, shy guy like me, but I mean that's a bad shot. But let me explain something else that happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do feel really bad about yourself for doing that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do, I mean the guy is my best friend, it only happened because, you know, of my difficulties.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your what difficulties?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My difficulty with women. If I was an ordinary, you know, straight shooting guy I would go out and get my own chick, you know, but I don't know (inaudible - 0:25:35.8). But this happened again with another friend of mine. On an occasion when we were smoking marijuana, I was out double dating, this is classic and I don't know whether marijuana brings out (inaudible - 0:25:47.1) by alcohol. But anyway we were smoking marijuana, this girl I was out with on a double date, who I had been very aggressive with earlier because I saw that she had an edge to it and I was trying to keep things reasonably even between us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She had an edge to her, what does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She had an aggressive edge to her, she was looking at me as I was looking at her and there were all kinds of little messages going on about  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was very receptive?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, on the contrary to what she, her whole idea was do I approve of you and she was letting me know that she was judging so I just came on a little stronger then I ordinarily would. I didn't care about she wasn't that attractive to me, I could see right away. And except that she is suppose to be some kind of in the social world (inaudible - 0:26:29.1) something, but I didn't give damn, you know, so I was just going to come on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could care less?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wasn't and I just didn't dig her that much so I wasn't going to get upset whether she liked me. So, but what was funny was that we went back to these peoples' apartment and we smoked some marijuana and I always get very introverted when I smoke marijuana. And we smoked it and I became completely introverted but enormously aware of my other friend's girlfriend who was also very attractive and who also had a little response to me. I was obsessed with her, he was, I was on one and I didn't say a word to anybody. They had the record player was here and I was listening to it and I could, every time she moved she twisted her nose I could see it out of the, when I was (inaudible - 0:27:13.5) down here but I just knew what she was doing. The other girl was up in the front and acting out some kind of weird thing that she had going on and she would dart her eyes over at me all the time, I don't know if you are familiar with it but sometimes it seems like you become very much more aware of the vibration that they send and you're absolutely certain that these are valid these sensations that you get are conceivable. And I was feeling that she was throwing things at me like she was (inaudible - 0:27:42.5) a lot of secure but she was also very aggressive, you know, she was a big sexual thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of like a lady, I'm here make a move. And so I was (inaudible - 0:27:52.7) right inside, except that was a (inaudible - 0:27:55.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:27:55.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's just absolutely no way. When that happens forget it I'm completely ruined, there was nothing I was going to do. So she was and I couldn't even say anything I became so enormously self-conscience with the result of this whole peculiar thing that I couldn't even get out a word because if I even, if I start to think I was going to say something I was sure I was going to be enormously rejected. I mean this is what is going on emotionally. Yet, my friend was very glib and very funny and witty (inaudible - 0:28:26.2) and very self-confident, I was convinced that anything I would say would be a gap and faux pas and sound very foolish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But on the contrary?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't say anything and probably on the contrary it wouldn't have been. But see they were, when (inaudible - 0:28:41.3) again I get very serious and they somehow are able to do it and remain flippant and funny and I just  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel badly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just tune out (inaudible - 0:28:51.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It puts you on a different wave length.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, entirely. And you're not so screwed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And both of those situations you put yourself down for being (inaudible - 0:28:59.7)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I can't deal with these people you see. I can't deal I completely opted out of the situation where I was blowing grass (inaudible - 0:29:07.4) situation. I should have opted out of that, shouldn't have played the game at all. They dragged me into it against my best judgment. The point I want to make  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But notice what you do in both of these situations because you're different you decide your, because you're different or odd man out you decide that means you're really odd and that isn't necessarily so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because your reaction as an introverted one doesn't mean that you're any less  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - of a person, any less.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right it isn't the kind of person I want to be though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of person do you want to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mentioned to you before about one of the reasons why the fantasy of being in politics, for example, is appealing is the idea of (inaudible - 0:29:53.9) dealing with people and have (inaudible - 0:29:55.2) with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know what, you don't sound interested in that right now. I mean you said (inaudible - 0:30:02.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I said that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interest in it, when you were saying it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I said that for that reason because I figured the moment I said politics you would know what I was going to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't want to  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - (inaudible - 0:30:19.2). But, again, you know, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But your idea of being effective with people is being an extroverted optimistic outgoing singing with up with the boys.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not quite that crude but something on that line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And more aggressive with women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More aggressive with women and more aggressive period. But, the thing that just, the thing that struck me so strangely again was that this girl who I really think is attractive, we went home, we got in the car and I sat next to her and I was just saying, you know, really insane, she was doing something with her hair, I was going to jump out of the car window, I just can't. She was really affecting me that strongly. And I don't think that I made it obvious, chomping at the bite or scaring her looking out the window and I finally said something in case they thought I was agitated, I said I'm lost I don't know where we are, ho, ho, ho (inaudible - 0:31:24.8). And she said something well don't worry about it (inaudible - 0:31:29.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt like she didn't know what she was saying but you like it anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was a message, a nice little message. And she was responding to me there was no question about it, you know, because she did, she threw back her hair and she run her hand through it and then look over at me rather provocatively. And finally it got to the point where my friend, where she was sitting, as I got out of the car, this is a mean little triumph on my part, but as I got out of the car  -</p>

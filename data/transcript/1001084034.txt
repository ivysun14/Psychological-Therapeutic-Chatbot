<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're a new patient, [PATIENT NAME].  Tell me a little about yourself and what brings you in today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm [AGE].  And, uh, I was referred to you by my psychologist, who believes that I am struggling with a little bit of mild depression.  Um, I feel I'm pretty good, especially after a meeting with her, and I tend to disagree with her.  I'm not thrilled on getting on medication, um, but, uh, you know, if my doctor thinks that's what's best for me.  That's what I'm gonna do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long have you been seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just a little over two months, I believe.  I'm really bad with dates, especially with all the craziness that has been going on past couple months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many sessions would you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, six to eight, maybe.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So you had a chance to get to know each other?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you mentioned the craziness.  What kind of craziness is going on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, like just job, uh.  We completely restructured.  And my boss got, um, led out of the offices, and then that led to twenty percent of our staff being, um, uh, you know, losing their jobs, too.  So I was kind of on the fence wondering if I was next and that alone, my other new coworkers same thing with them.  We were just, uh, really concerned about whether or not we were gonna lose our jobs.  So that went on for a couple of months, and now things seem to kind of, um, a little down.  But during that time right before that happened, uh, my parents were going through, um, or trying to go through divorce, and my dad was hospitalized.  I think the he was hospitalized, um, and, uh, for, um, mood disorders.  For what they think is bipolar or, um, manic depression.  So that was really hard to see him going through that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So the stress of getting divorced sent him over the edge so to speak?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm. I think it is actually what started the divorce to be honest.  So</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah, just the other way around.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How was he when you were growing up with your dad, up and down?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Up and down, up and down.  We lived in [DEIDENTIFIED].  And he worked, um, in news there, [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So very stressful job for him, but a cool job too.  And, uh, my mom just didn't want to raise my brother and I in the city anymore and wanted us to be closer to home, which was, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  And so she, uh, was able to get a job transfer.  And ever since then things have been kinda down hill for my dad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Plus your dad moved to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now it looks like they live in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, they live in [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  So, uh, they, after they realized my brother and I were never coming home again, they moved to [DEIDENTIFIED].  So, um, but yeah it's been a struggle.  They've been up and down.  And, um, but, you know, they love each other, and so they work things out.  But dad, dad's always been I think either depressed or, um, depressed is probably the best thing for him. He had some anger issues. Um, had trouble keeping jobs, um, and, uh, always kinda felt superior to people, so has a bit of superiority complex.  Um, so, you know, life kinda had to be perfect.  And, um, you know, if I got all A's and only got like a ninety one, it just wasn't good enough type of thing.  So, um, that was a bit stressful.  And he, he claims he doesn't remember acting like that, so, um, we're kinda dealing with a lot of things.  But he, um, he ended up, uh, pretty much losing our house, um, which caused my parents to try to go through a divorce the first time.  And, um, he tried to get back on his feet again.  He's also been diagnosed with, um, I believe ADD.  And so, um, I don't know if I really believe that's what it is.  I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but I know my dad pretty well.  And, um, I don't think that he necessarily lacks the concentration.  I think he just lacks the will to do things.  So in any event it's just been like a really hard thing, battle to see, you know, this man that I put on a pedestal just completely fall apart.  And at that time along with everything changing at work and being fearful of losing my job and not knowing what is, you know, happening to me.  I just lost it.  So got really stressed, started having, um, what I believe were like panic attacks or anxiety attacks, um, but I've since stopped drinking caffeine and that had actually stopped the attacks.  I hadn't had one since then, so, um, I don't know what that's all about.  But, uh, I think those attacks kinda, just the timing of it all, has to somehow be interconnected together.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have any of these issues growing up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Depression, anxiety</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Depression, yeah.  Yeah, yep, I have had some depressions.  I have been on and off medication for a couple of years, um, and, uh, I just, I really think I can do this without medication.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which meds were you on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've taken Prozac, Wellbutrin, and [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did any of them ever help?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  If anything they made me, I think more depressed.  Because I would, I didn't really have the will to go out and do anything.  I felt very, um, lethargic and, um, you know, I think maybe it helped me a little bit, but in the end I feel like I've done better without the drugs.  So that's why I'm hesitant to get back on these, especially after seeing, basically what ended up sending my dad into the hospital was a mix of medications, um, he wanted to kill himself, and his [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said that, you know, obviously he has some mood disorders.  But he, they believe he was taking more medications, wrong dosages, and the mixtures of the two just really sent him just over the edge.  I just don't want to have to deal with that again.  I've, but I'm open to it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, you know, I wouldn't be here if I wasn't so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  Have you ever had any bipolar symptoms yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not that I'm aware of.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It would be the opposite of depressed, say about, even a short period where your thoughts were racing. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Felt almost like you had a lot of energy.  Didn't sleep very well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sleep is never a problem.  Um, I get easily excited, but that's usually when I have like an idea.  I work in a creative industry, so we're constantly bouncing things off of each other.  So it's easy to get excited about someone else's idea, or it's easy to get excited about your own.  So that's, you know, a period I don't know, I mean it would be a short period of time</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like, you know, ten minutes or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does that ever lead to bad impulsivity, where you do something, and it was like, God, what was I thinking when I spent money I didn't really have."</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or stopped work or went on a vacation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing that impulsive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some kind of misbehavior?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, the only time when I've had, you know, a God what was I thinking moment, is after I've been drinking, you know, heavily one night or something with some friends, and just feel like an idiot the next day for God knows what, you know, but that's the only thing that ever made me feel like, oh, what did I</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How often do you drink a lot to that point?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I didn't to that point, I did when I was in college, um, and occasionally I get, you know, loopy with my friends, but it's not like a persistent thing.  It's nothing that I do every weekend.  Um, I'm trying to lose some weight, and so I'm trying to just clean myself of everything.  So not trying to drink, trying to avoid it as much as I can and, um, you know, start a healthier living.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you in a relationship right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When was the last time you were in a relationship?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A real relationship, probably about five years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean by relationship?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, steady.  Something that's steady.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just been avoiding being in a relationship or </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, you know, I don't know that it's a conscious effort, um, I think I have, you know, problems with self image.  I'm really struggling with my weight, and so, um, that makes me uncomfortable.  And doesn't really, you know, it's hard for me to be around like, the thought of getting naked in front of somebody is just gross to me.  Cause I think that would just, they would never talk to me again so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Rate yourself.  How do you see yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty face.  Fat body.  But confident at work, um, you know, successful in that area just not successful in the love area.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  How much overweight do you think you are?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Forty, fifty pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that realistic?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For my doctor it is, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you done any dieting </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or Weight Watchers?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything.  I could tell you all the, all the diets there are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How tall are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 5'1</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 174.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So they want you to be what in the 120s, 130s?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's the most you've ever weighed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's the least?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One, oh, probably, like 125ish.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you've been 50 pounds heavier since your ideal weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It says you put on ten pounds in the last few months too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  It's something that fluctuates with me a lot.  Like I can lose weight easily, and then gain it right back.  Um, I did the Atkins and dropped like 35 pounds, and a year later it's back on plus some.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about exercise?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Getting into more so than I, I've exercised more in the last two weeks, than I have  probably all year long.  Um, so I'm feeling, you know, more confident about that.  And it is helping me, um,</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm struggling because, you know, I get on the scale and notice that nothing's changing, so that's a little bit disheartening.  But as far as like the stress levels and things like that at work, I believe the exercise helping, is helping that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And why did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] so strongly believe you needed medicine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think she [INAUDIBLE].  I mean I tend to agree with her.  I'm, I'm mildly depressed, but I'm not so overly depressed that I think I need a huge dosage of medication</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I think she, the way that she said is that, um, she believes that if I were on medication just to kinda help, like level me out.  That I would be more successful in, you know, my exercise and diet  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I expect that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, same, same brown [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where?  Yeah, she's got the [INAUDIBLE].  I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  She's a good therapist.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, medicine wouldn't be mandatory actually.  I mean we don't make it hardly ever mandatory, but certainly not in your case.  I looked at some the scores that you did on the test we gave you, plus our, you know, my assessment, um.  So we wouldn't pin you in either direction.  It will probably be helpful to be on something, A because a lot of what you're saying is a little bit on the glass is half empty</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Rather than half full.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A little pessimistic</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We'd want to give you every advantage to do well.  Exercise is gonna be huge. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Self image is huge.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Maybe you sell yourself a little short 'cause you seem</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I definitely do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I definitely do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your higher functioning will appear a lot better than you think that you do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you probably have this wall around you that you don't let people into very well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do.  When it comes to friends no problem, I have an abundance of friends.  But when it comes to guys, not so very much. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what if a guy shows interest and wants to get to know you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I knit pick him.  It, you know, strangely enough I knit pick it.  So like I've got amongst on the beginnings of dating somebody right now, but it's a long distance type of thing.  And it's somebody that we've known since high school, and so I haven't seen him in a while.  And we're getting together in three weeks.  So I'm like trying to get this weight off.  I think that's been the push -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For the exercise.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You need something. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean it's good, you know, and then, um, but I'm already giving myself reasons why not to get involved with him.  So, you know, but they're reasons that I've always known.  I mean he's a fun guy, you know, but, um, I'm already giving myself reason to not give him a chance</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good defense.  So if it doesn't work out, you're not hurt too much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then again medicine as [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said could be the motivating factor.  But certainly think about something that doesn't cause any weight issues.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, definitely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, of course, we do that anyway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In my case especially.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's a chance, we'll have to see, that the medicine will helps us also to get to know your diagnosis.  If med, antidepressants don't work, we might be dealing with something that's different like bipolar, you could have a mild form of that.  You'll probably need something to give you more impedance, also maybe to control your weight and appetite, as well, so you kinda double the, Wellbutrin is one of them.  You've tried that.  Another one I like is Cymbalta.  We'll probably try that one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's actually what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said.  Is that a new, is that a new one?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a pretty new one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] told me</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a little bit like Wellbutrin.  It's a very good one.  And then, of course, you gotta still work with her in therapy, and then, you know, if you conquer your weight issues, your self image issues.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And just life's stress issues, and then you probably won't need medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm trying not to need them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Happens as a lifetime thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like I said you scored in the mildly depressed range, so there's something really going on, and you even said you were sad.  The first question is the most important I feel sad, so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you feel sad,</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, most -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At your age with everything that you've got going on, that's not normally usual.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Only [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now, I want to make sure though that the drugs that I'm gonna take don't make me feel like, not high, that's not the word I'm looking for, but</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Change your mind state?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No absolutely not.  You won't even barely know that their effecting you, um </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a lot like, I feel real emotion, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh totally, </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They won't numb you.  They're really just adjuncts.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's almost like taking vitamins, I always say. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, the best idea would be you don't really feel like you're taking anything.  It doesn't alter who you are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B>  Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  It just gives you more serotonin, more norepinephrine which will keep chemicals in the brain, and it gives you motivation.  It makes things more optimistic as we say.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you can start to say, I can do this.  I'm not so bad look at me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, you know, you got more going for you for most of the population by far. So that's something you got to realize.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thanks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There are people that have more things, but a lot more people that have less and do more with less, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> True, true, true.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to see that and, you know, you're your own biggest critic probably.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am, most definitely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's something you have to work on.  That's something that maybe [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] can help you with.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she's working on it with me for sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, life's not about perfection, unless you want to be Ken and Barbie, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not a very good idea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, you just want to have a normal, happy life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Everyone's got flaws and things and, you know. The things you got are at least conquerable, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can't change your height.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can't change your level of intelligence.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> True.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can't change your basic personality, but</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So most of the stuff you have is changeable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm usually a pretty positive person.  It's just the past couple of months has just been yuck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, just really going a muck.  But talking to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] has been helpful, and, you know,</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I definitely see like good happening but</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How'd you get referred to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I actually, I was talking to my parents during all this, and I just said, you know, I need to kinda talk to someone who's not family and not friends.  And so I just looked up on the provider list, saw couple names, researched them, Googled them and, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] seem to have the most, um, back, the longest background in her profession out of everybody, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did she refer you here or did the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Same research?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she referred me to three people, and I chose you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah, who were the other ones?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember their names actually, but, um, you're a good guy to Google.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I am.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep, apparently you're one of the best guys in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, I haven't Googled myself in a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, um, yeah, you should check it out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I always hear people say that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's true.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll have to do that.  But I do hear that people Google that we have students and they Google us.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a lot you can find right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it's a good resource.  I mean it's kinda an encyclopedia or something, telling you what you need.  We do it for work all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, do you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what do you do for [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm a production coordinator there.  So I work with all the original programming and, um, work with like outside production companies to develop documentaries and keep them in mind.  I worked with their budgets and</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you like what you do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I love what I do.  I couldn't be happier with that.  Well, I could be happier if they'd give me the damn promotion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But other than that, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where'd you go to school?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went to [DEIDENTIFIED], the oldest.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oldest.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then there's college junior level, what does that mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I made it to my junior year in college and then left.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you didn't finish?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you plan to go back and finish or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't really need to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh.  Not in my line of work that I'm doing.  It would be nice to, but it's nothing that's, you know, mandatory.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was your first job out of college?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was what you call a comptroller, which is like accounting for [INAUDIBLE] in town.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How'd you get with [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got with [DEIDENTIFIED] because, um, everyone in my, well not everyone, but the majority of the people in my family and family friends are in the entertainment business on some level.  And, um, I always wanted to get involved in that, but just kinda avoided it I think.  But unconsciously wanted to get involved in it, but unconsciously avoided it too.  Um, and so, uh, I ran into an old family friend who was looking for an assistant.  And I wanted to get out of [DEIDENTIFIED], and she lived in, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I took the job down there and moved down there for three years, and worked for turner and just worked my way up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  I'm going to stop at this point.  Thanks, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's warm out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's weird. I wasn't prepared for it. I'm fine. It's just like I've been so used to it being cold and rainy and nasty. It feels like it's been the longest week ever for some reason. Not for some reason, I think it's just I've just been so busy at work. A lot of things I've been procrastinating on or had been putting other things before, I got done, so that's good. There's just so much work right now between the thousands of events that we're having—plus trying to hire a new events assistant. I finally got around to narrowing down my selections and . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of applicants?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Doing this for the third year in a row has been the biggest headache of my life. It's just an effort. I narrowed down five applicants and sent the e-mails asking them to come in for first-time interviews. One of the applicants is this guy, Ethan, who's been our temp the last three times this has happened; and so he's applied. He would actually like the position. He's not a perfect match, but we'll see. [00:01:19] A couple of people in the office have already been like, "That would be great," and then a couple of other people have been like, "Yeah, he's kind of weird." So I don't know. I'm interested to see how he interviews. So one of them is him, one of them said she already found a job, so there are three others—one guy, one girl plus another girl. My friend, Sandra, whose wedding I did, her sister who is a couple of years younger than us applied for the position. I told her about it because Sandra had told me she was looking for work. If she gets this job, their family owes me their life. I planned one daughter's wedding and got the other this amazing job, so we'll see. Anyway, I have four interviews—two on Tuesday and two on Wednesday next week. It's going to be hard because coming back from the long weekend or whatever, but I really just wanted to get them done so that we can plan second interview and have somebody, hopefully by November. [00:02:10] Mindy didn't get there last year; we didn't end up hiring her, the same time frame. We had one person who then said she didn't want the job anymore. Mindy didn't end up coming until mid-November, so I'm trying to avoid that. Plus we have a couple of conferences that I'm planning and I feel like I'm juggling so many balls at work that it's just made for a really long week and then the weather really didn't help anything. Every day was dragging like, "Why is it only 2:00?" every day. Now I'm gone for the weekend from work. I'm going to Chicago. The plan was always to go to Chicago for this weekend for the long weekend because some family is in town. My dad is going and Tracy is going and Jesse is going and I think Michael might be going, but I don't know. He's a wreck. [00:03:12] I guess we're having shabbat at my uncle and aunt's house tonight, and that's at 6:00 because now the sun is setting earlier. Isn't that freaking crazy? So I left work and just told them. I was going to leave at one and then I forgot about this appointment so I was like, "No, I'm just going to leave at 11:45. Call it a weekend." My boss was like, "Okay," so that's cool. I'm lucky I have flexibility at this job. So I'll be leaving here and heading to Chicago after I get gas. It should be fun. It's going to be a lot. I'm getting there tonight and going straight to dinner. Meanwhile apparently my aunt didn't know that I was coming. My cousin was like, "My mom doesn't know you're coming," and I'm like, "What?" Then she's like, "Is Christopher (sp?) coming, too?" talking about my father. I was like, "I thought Christopher made this plan," so then I call my dad. I'm like, "Why doesn't she know I'm coming? Does she know we're coming?" [00:04:11] He's all angry and he's like, "I don't know what the fuck is going on. I don't want to communicate with my brother and now I've got to call him. I told him I'd pay for half the food. I don't know what the hell is going on. Why doesn't he tell her?" I'm like, "Okay. Whatever. You deal with that."—my cousin and her live in the area and I'm going back there anyway so I'm staying with Amanda for the weekend because they have a room there, it's just easier and I want to see my goddaughter, her daughter and everything. I don't know where they live, probably not close by, which is where Amanda is at. My cousin and Joseph have been wanting to do a brunch because she wants to use some of their platters and shit that they got at her registry, (both laugh) but it's all sitting in the basement at her parents' house. Apparently it's been this big ordeal on how to figure out how to get the platters. [00:05:09] She's like, "Oh, my God. Can you drive me and Joseph back? Are you going back? Can you drive us back and bring the platters?" and I'm like, "Sure." She's like, "Yes. Now I'm going to do the brunch this weekend on Sunday. It's perfect because you're here." I'm like, "Alright." [00:05:22] I drive up and then Saturday I was like we would try to meet up in the city with the people and then tonight it's just immediate family. So Saturday we might do something there. Saturday night Amanda wants to go out for a drink because she's been breast feeding and she is dying for a drink, so she'll just pump and pump and be done with it, so I told her I'd go out with her. I'll try to see a couple of other friends. Then Sunday my cousin is having this brunch and then I'll probably leave. Monday I hope I can get out by mid-afternoon so I'm not back so late, but it's just going to be I have to pack it all in. I have to see my grandmother. I have to pack it all in because typically when I go it's Saturday to Sunday afternoon. It's like I'm there 24 hours basically, so I can only see one person. This time around I'm there the whole weekend and I'm going to try to make my rounds. People are like, "It's so hard," but it's not. I'm like, "Yeah, I know." [00:06:21] It's a lot of schlepping around for me though (chuckles), because I want to see people. It's just so difficult because I obviously have my priority people, which are family and Amanda and babies, so it makes it hard to see other people; but I still want to. Anyway, that's my story for this weekend. It should be fun. My roommate, I think—first of all, I just want to say that I still have bronchitis kind of. I'm still coughing. I feel better. I'm still a little bit stuffed up, but not as much. I've gone through a whole package of Mucinex and I've been using the inhaler and stuff, but I'm so tired of coughing. It's just like—enough already. I'm going to just keep using the inhaler and stuff and, if by next week I'm still coughing enough that it bothers me, then I'm going to go back to the doctor. [00:07:24] It's just annoying. It's just like, "Uggh." I was just thinking about that, how much I was coughing. It really has nothing to do with anything. What I was going to say—oh, my roommate. I've been noticing some fruit flies. Oh, I just remembered. Anyway, I was like, "Maybe it's my trash, so I took my trash out and there were still fruit flies. Then I'm thinking that it's her room. She has a couple of plants in there, so maybe these plants are attracting the fruit flies, or maybe it's the fact that I think she leaves dishes in her room after she's eaten off of them. That's really, really gross. I'm sorry, but we're not in a college dorm room. Go put them in the sink to soak or get paper plates. This is gross. [00:08:25] The other night I woke up at five to hear the cat playing with a bag and was like, "What are they getting into?" I thought they were getting into the cat food. She had gotten take-out and somehow forgot and left it on the kitchen table. It was in the take-out boxes and stuff—left it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not in the frig? [00:08:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I put it in the frig because I'm not going to throw away somebody else's food. I made sure to tell her the next day like P.S. that bag of food was out all night. She still ate it the next day. I was like, "Alright. Whatever. To each his own. If you have a parasite that's your business." Then I was washing the dishes. I'm a culprit of leaving dishes in the sink sometimes a few days longer than they should. I really need to stop the habit, especially with winter coming. I've had mouse problems in the past. They like dirty-smelling water or whatever. Fine. I washed the dishes this morning because I was leaving and I'm noticing there are some utensils missing. [00:09:27] One of the plates she had washed and put in the dish rack to dry had food stuck to it still. I'm like, "Wait. How old are you? How many years have you been washing dishes?" so I rewashed that. The only thing I can deduce are that the missing dishes are in her room with crusty food on them attracting bugs. I sent out a G-chat to her today. I really hope it didn't come off as too passive-aggressive, but I wanted to let her know that, first of all, I'm going away for the weekend so that she has the option of Franklin (sp?) coming over twice a day whenever his schedule permits to feed the cat, or she can feed them if she would preferred that. She said she's going to be out of the house most of the weekend, so that Franklin—but I did want to give her the option. But that's fine. So, okay. I wanted to tell her that and I'm like, "Also . . ." This is how I phrased it, "Also, I wanted to tell you that—I forgot about this. I thought of it the other day when I woke up and I was freezing cold and was reminded of the mouse problem that we've had the past couple of winters. They come every year and they spray with the foam and they set up a little poison. Sometimes they still sneak in. They don't have a fighting chance in this house anyways because of [Dads] (ph), but I just want to eliminate all possibility of them getting it, so I just want us both to be conscious of the following:" [00:10:42] I was like, "First of all, I need to be better about not leaving dishes in the sink." I made sure to point out that I'm not saying you're disgusting, even though you are. I was just saying, "So, a couple of things. Making sure counters are wiped down, being conscious of crumbs on the floor in the kitchen, if you eat in your room and the living room, be conscious of leaving crumbs and dishes there," so at least she's getting this hint. Like, "Hint, hint. Your dishes are under your dirty underwear from yesterday. Put them in the sink." Then I was like, "I hope she doesn't think [I'm bad]. (ph)" Then she wrote back. She was like, "Okay, cool. Yeah. That's good. I would pity the mouse that gets in here with those two on the prowl, so I'll make sure to try to not let that happen," so that's great. [00:11:30] Last night I came home. I went out to dinner with a friend of mine and then I came home. I walked in and I'm like, (sniffs) "Oh, what is that smell? It smells." First of all, she constantly leaves lights on. Leaves the living room light on, like you're done in the living room and the light's on. Kitchen light—same thing. Really annoying. I see her shoes by the door and I'm like, "Maybe she has stinky feet. None of my business." Then I walk by her room and it's just this musty, dirty, hippy smell coming out of her room. [00:12:12] There is really nothing I can say about that. I'm not her mother. I can't tell her to clean her room, so I was hoping that at least telling her about the food stuff will at least keep the house clean in the general sense. She doesn't like fragrances. She's allergic to fragrances, but I Febreeze the shit out of the hallway. I was like, "I don't care. It stinks. I'm putting Air Effects in this air in the hallway." That's fine, but that was on my mind and I thought of it. [00:12:44]</p>

<p>The other thing. Franklin's been this week, whatever. We've talked and seen each other a couple of times and it's been fine. He's being all extra lovey-dovey and it feels a little bit overbearing at some times. It's like, "Miss you. Miss you." And I'm like, "I just talked to you. How could you miss me? Okay." But then he gets sad if I don't say, "I miss you, too." It's this whole thing that we've always got going, right? Our issues are there, fine. Here is the issue that I started thinking about and getting really upset about yesterday. I obsessively torture myself by checking out this girl on his fucking Facebook profile every day. I just can't help myself. I'm like, "Okay, I'll just see what she's posted." Then I find myself looking through pictures, but I find that more pictures are showing up from the past and I will go through every single one of those pictures to see what Franklin commented on them or if he liked them or whatever. Not only is it unhealthy because it's that I'm obsessing, but then it got me started thinking about how will I ever be able to get over this. Then it gets me thinking about the details of the conversation that I read between them on Facebook and how this whole thing started and how upset that gets me. [00:14:07] Then I think about much mystery—like I feel like this whole situation is still shrouded in because I don't understand why she said, "Oh, you humiliated me and hurt Trina. You lied about your relationship." I still don't understand that, so it gets me thinking about that. Then I start thinking about all the other girls I felt uncomfortable with him texting with over the years, whether or not it was inappropriate. Then I start thinking about the other girls that were inappropriate and it did get to an inappropriate point, and I literally—this is an every-day thing. I mean, okay. I knew the question of . . . [00:14:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling kind of anxious and alone. I have the impression this is a bit true with me physically, but also probably in general, that you really wanting to be kind of taken care of and reassured and supported. I mean, you're so busy and you've got all these things you're trying to do and you're—not so stressed out, but it's hectic. All of these things to worry about and a lot of these things you're doing on your own and these ways you're having to accommodate other people's schedules and stick up for yourself in certain ways. Look out for things at the apartment and deal with a new roommate and blah, blah, blah—all this stuff. You sound sort of like on your own there's a lot of that and a little worried about whether you're handling it all in the right way. There is a lot of responsibility involved in a lot of it and I imagine that something you miss from being with Franklin is feeling, at times, being pretty well taken care of and reassured. I guess I have the sense that you may be also looking, which is fine, for that from me at the moment as well. [00:16:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe. (sighs) Yes, it's hectic. There is a lot that I'm doing and taking care of. I'm having some financial difficulties right now because, first of all, I've been "therapizing" myself by doing a little shopping, going out with friends and having drinks, having some nice dinners, not really grocery shopping, so eating out a little bit more—that kind of stuff that I felt, "Fine." I really haven't done that much of it, but I guess I'm just trying to figure out my way. Okay, there's that. Then I had to do a bunch of more repairs on my car, so I'm in a kind of a tight money situation right now. [00:17:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. I forgot to add—the thing about "alone" is that it sounds like it's taking a whack at your confidence and effectiveness, and so you're feeling comparative and competitive and wanting to be reassured about that, too. You get into sort of a state where you start worrying about it. Like, "Is she pretty? Is she doing this? Is she doing that? If I were prettier, if I were doing this, if I were doing that, if I had done this . . . " It sounds like you really get rolling on that. [00:18:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Big time. Big time. I'm fixated on it. And then if I say anything to Franklin about it, it's just kind of like, "I don't understand. Why don't you just block her on Facebook? Why is it even . . ?" I mean, he does reassure me. We've had the conversation of being like, "I don't get it. Is she pretty or is she rich or is she skinnier or is she healthier?" I don't know. We've had that conversation and it's been like, "Trina, I don't think anybody is as beautiful as you are. I would never . . ." All this stuff that he does . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow that doesn't fix everything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does not. It's very nice, but it doesn't help me. (chuckles) And I want to say that to him because it's like, "Wow, that sucks," because what else is he going to say at this point except maybe some stuff that he's not telling the truth about? But I can't ask him to tell the truth anymore because I've already said that and he either is or isn't. [00:19:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, he did and it put a dent in your confidence. This isn't something that we've talked about a lot, so I don't know how much it's something that you worry about anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My confidence?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, your confidence in how you look. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I don't that much, but this particular situation has made me—more than I think I have. Other situations of him talking to women that I was uncomfortable with or felt like, "Why are you talking to her?" have also made me feel like, "Am I not as pretty?" Or what does this person have that I don't? It's to a point, though, that it is obsessive; like obsessive, compulsively checking this girl's profile. I don't even know what's wrong with me. [00:19:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like hours a day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you said obsessive I just . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like at least once a day. Like, "Oh, what's Betty up to today? Any more pictures? What's she been doing?" And the fact that she's Jewish doesn't help the situation. I don't know. Maybe it's because it feels even more like, "Okay. So you've found a prettier Jew?" or something. And then she's posting about Yom Kippur. Her postings are similar to me. I feel like . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like sometimes she's more of a competitor being or something? She was a competitor from your own tribe?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Something. Right. Or something. I don't know. Something like that, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like—obviously it isn't—but almost as if it were some of your friends, close to home? [00:21:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly. Exactly. I don't know. I guess I'm like, "You couldn't find somebody that wasn't a Jew, Franklin? You already have a Jew. Come on." (sniggers) I don't know. I'm fixated on it. But then I think that the bigger thing for me is what it brings up is—is this an indication that I will literally never be able to get over this? Like never be able to get over it. And then I've gone to the worry of will I even be able to get over this girl if me and Franklin break up? Will I still be checking this poor girl? Probably not. Then I worry about that, too. (chuckles) But, yeah, it has taken a stab of my confidence, regardless of how much he reassures me or everybody reassures me that who cares about this girl? She's just a piece in his little game or whatever. It has shaken me because then I look and I'm like, "Oh, she's prettier. She's richer. She has a nicer car." I don't know. I don't even know. [00:22:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you think these things are true? I wasn't quite sure how [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:19) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is true. I can tell that much from her—like she's a little Jap—she's completely like Mercedes, Porsche, big mansion with pool, Hermè.es bracelets, Chanel bags, Louis Vuiton duffels, all that crap, you know? Apartment shopping at Bloomingdale's. Who shops for their furniture at Bloomingdale's? Really. So that stuff is true. I don't know if she's prettier, but I think that because of this situation I'm looking at her that way or being like, "She has more money to afford these nicer clothes and these nicer hairstyles." [00:23:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've made her out to be, whatever the reality may or may not be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. I really want to stop, but I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it's driving you nuts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's driving me insane. I look at a picture and then I look at her profile. She put up a while ago—I was searching through her old pictures that showed up somehow and I was like, "Oh, good. More pictures to obsess over." She put up a picture of her shirtless back after she's done—there's something called cupping or something, some fucking holistic something—sorry. It makes me angry. Something you do with holistic healing. I don't fucking care. She does all sorts of shit that she puts on her Facebook page like, "I just had acupuncture." [00:23:46] Anyway, her whole back was covered in these little suction marks. Whatever. I don't care. Franklin commented on it from before, like when they were having their little affair. I don't fucking know. Just something like, "Oh, that looks like that hurts," and it enraged me because I'm like, "Don't fucking look at people's pictures of their naked backs and then comment on it. Don't give them the attention they're clearly seeking. Like fuck you." I get so enraged about it. I've talked about this with him like, "Franklin, don't add to the attention that they're clearly already looking to get. I don't care who they are or what you think they're commenting on, please don't." So it enraged me. Then, again, I just go through this cycle of thinking about the messages and thinking about what I don't know and what they actually said and what the pictures they sent were. It's just getting me upset and hurt all over again. This is every day. Then I can never get over this. Oh, my God. Is he telling the truth? And it's a huge issue for me right now. [00:24:58] How do I learn how to stop? I've literally blocked this girl on Facebook so I wouldn't check her shit, and then unblocked her so I could check it again. Then I was talking with my friend, Pat, the other day and we were talking about maybe I should just stop the Facebook. First of all, I can't. I'm kind of addicted. Secondly, it's the main way I stay in contact with so many people and stay updated on family's lives and pictures. I really don't want to because of this bullshit. But this issue with thinking about Betty and I don't even know if she exists in his life anymore and hope not, but somehow she's still very present in mine and it just makes me feel bad every time I look at her shit. (chuckles) [00:25:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds similar to me to the way that you could kind of let Franklin push you around in arguments or discussions. Or sort of turn your point of view around so that it seemed like he was right and kind of would forget for a while where you were coming from. You know what I'm referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like that, in that you're sort of a little angry at yourself. You're doing these things that make you feel less than, one down, inferior, crummy about yourself, less grown up in a way—something like that—less appealing, less wild. In both instances it's really something that you do. It's not exactly what the other person is doing. Certainly the situation is sort of [ ]. (inaudible at 00:27:14) Franklin does like to bully you in conversations and does sometimes try to get you to see things in very different ways. I'm not saying you don't have help from the two of them, but it's like you have a pretty active role in it in a similar way in both instances. [00:27:38] It sounds strange to say, but something about not wanting to be grown up is sort of the impression that I have that it relates to. Clearly, you're completely grown up in a variety of ways. I understand. You work, you do all the things grownups do, but now that I'm thinking about it, it gives me the impression of—not exactly that you're afraid or intimidated about being grown up or afraid of the responsibility as sometimes people are. It feels more to me like it goes together with being looked out for or taken care of, stuff like that, that contributes to your sort of seeing Franklin or Betty as having more or having more going on or knowing something better, even though consciously you see it as being quite different from that. My impression is that you don't have a lot of respect for her or for Franklin when he's bullying you or when you step back and the more I think about it, you're usually much surer of your own point of view than his. In the moment, clearly it can work the other way, so there's some way you kind of give something over. I sort of feel it in here a little bit, as well, where it feels like you grant the things that I say or I look at things with a degree of authority or knowingness or even "grownupness" that you kind of don't feel yourself to have as much. I mean I hope now and then I have something worthwhile to say, but it seems like there's something else. [00:31:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think sometimes I feel like I don't know the grownup way to approach my feelings about things, so then I do look for advice from you, from other people—I think more from you because my friends are my friends, or they're my same age or whatever. This is different. This is therapy. You do this for a job. You are helping me. [00:31:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you don't know about how to deal with your feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like whatever things I bring up and then feel like when you say something it's like, "Oh, yeah. That's right," because I feel confused. Like feelings about how to deal with Franklin and not check this girl's Facebook page every day and think about it, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So it's kind of probably in the nature of bringing in situations that you're having trouble handling that inevitably then you're going to feel less like you know what's going on or what to do about it; whereas if you brought in how to plan an event at work, the feel would be very different because, obviously, you would be the one who would know and I would not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:32:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My confidence is shaken from this whole situation. How could it not be? This is our relationship with the various things that have happened. That's clear. I feel like I'm dealing with that a little bit better in the sense that I know that I really ultimately don't have anything to feel less confident about. I feel like I'm an attractive person. I feel like I'm smart. I'm successful. I have a great personality. I know all these things and I'm not sitting home crying like, "Ohhh. I'm ugly." Whatever. Maybe I have drama about my clothing and what to wear and stuff, but that's something I can work on. That's more external than internal. I don't have issues—maybe I feel like I could be in better shape, but okay, so I'll start working out or I'll continue with my diet. That's stuff I learned to deal with. I had worse confidence issues when I was younger and didn't know how to remind myself that I am beautiful and have nothing to worry about. [00:34:05] (client's phone rings) Here's my uncle calling me, being like, "What do you mean? Nobody's coming. We don't have any plans. What are you talking about?" Probably he's going to yell and tell me what an asshole my father is. I can deal with that later. (pause) But I think that aside from the feeling less confident when I look at this girl's things and think about the whole situation, I'm more concerned with how I'm not sure I'll ever be able to get over the whole situation. Will I ever be able to be with a man who allows these conversations that I read to happen? Am I ever going to be able to get over it? That's what I think it brings up more than anything for me and makes me feel sad about. [00:35:08] (pause) Will I ever really be able to get over it. Then, of course, the other thoughts that come into play in that regard are will he ever really not do something like this again? Just thinking how characteristic it is in terms of his behavior throughout our relationship in terms of handling friendships or conversations with other women. I feel like I've gone off on way too many tangents today. I don't even know. (chuckles) My main issue was the obsessive-compulsive checking Betty's Facebook and then reliving the entire situation and experience. That's the biggest thing that is nagging at me because then I get angry with him without him even saying anything, doing anything, or being near me. He could be sending me love letters all day, but if I check this, my mind starts going and then I start thinking about the thing. I'm automatically infuriated with him like, "You fucking asshole, piece-of-shit loser. How could you ever risk the best thing you've ever had?" And then I get that way. I really don't know how to stop. I really don't know how to get over this, how to get past it and stop wanting to see what she's up to and stop reading into her cryptic posts that are clear cries for attention, but maybe have to do with maybe Franklin messaged her. Obsessing. [00:37:01] I really need to not do that. But then, yes, my confidence does come into play because then I start thinking about how much more she has than me. She has more money, blah, blah, blah. Then regardless of Franklin, I start feeling bad about myself. Even if it has nothing to do with him thinking that she's prettier than me, I then start thinking like . . . I don't know. I don't say any of this to Franklin because it's just not going to get me anywhere. Then I come back to . . . last night it was . . . Obviously nobody can tell you to end the relationship, that's it. She's like, "You're trying to get over what happened and see if you can work things out; but then if things don't work out, you're going to have to get over him all over again like—slash—from beginning, so why not just start getting over him now?" I understand her point and I've already thought about if this really doesn't work out, it's literally going to be like we're breaking up again. I'm not ready to do that yet, so here I am.

<p>THERAPIST: I think your confidence may be more mixed or more variable than what you're saying. There is this sort of "when push comes to shove" factor that maybe when you're sitting home by yourself with a cool head, in general you feel great about yourself in lots of ways. That's terrific. But when you're looking at Betty's Facebook page or imagining—I'm being pretty general—what attracted Franklin to her? Why wasn't he just looking at me? Not if there is some stuff like that that seems to keep occupying you. It's kind of like the difference between being at some distance from a conversation with Franklin and knowing he was wrong or full of shit and the way he's always right and being in the heat of the moment in the conversation with him, where you were seeing it more like he was—clearly kicking yourself later for having done that. I think I'm pretty clear about how frustrating this is that you can't stop yourself from looking at her page which ultimately makes you feel worse. And how this may just be the question of even if he didn't change and you both want to get back together, could you trust him and feel confident and you can both move beyond that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:41:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I don't know. I guess it isn't clear to me at the moment how to understand or not feel bad. The other thought I had is that these are kind of divided how you've been in a way about the issue with what happened between the two of them and his communicating with other women at all where it seemed to me where you were minimizing or in denial about all of that for a while, and now being also sort of stuck on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:43:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I've put together is that maybe it really, really sucks. Maybe this is a terrible blow to your confidence in general or not. This is the guy you love and have been with and wanted to marry, and look what the fuck he did. I'm sure it hurts you really deeply that he did that, and makes you feel really crummy about yourself and in some moments really inadequate and maybe for a while you looked away from it because you really didn't want to see it because it hurt so bad. Maybe now it's also hard to get in touch with how bad that actually really feels and this is like a painful and not very successful way of trying to get ahold of how much it hurts, what happened. We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's continue this conversation next week.</p>

Solution-Focused Brief Counseling<br>
Kelly Transcript</b></p></center><br>

<center><P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P></center>

<P>The client in this session is a 10-year-old boy.</P>

<P>His symptoms are as follows: he worries about his family members' health to the extent that it interferes with his ability to be successful in school. </P>

<P>One of the features of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy is that it enables the process to be brief. Thus, there was no diagnosis in this case. The two sessions were conducted around 1998.</P>

<P>This transcript contains an extra educational feature. Headings appear throughout the transcripts to indicate steps and key themes in the therapeutic process.</P><br>

<center><P><B>SESSION #2</B></P></center>

<center><P><B>STEP 1 - IDENTIFYING WHAT'S BETTER OR DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS MEETING</B></P></center>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Well, tell me Kelly what is better or different?</P>

<P>Kelly: One thing better is that my teacher has this note thing at first I was goofing around and stuff and so far two days in a row and going on three and today, I have been better doing my work and listening more.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Is that right?</P>

<P>Kelly: Uh-huh.</P><br>

<center><P><B>STEP 2 - ELICIT, AMPLIFY AND REINFORCE WHAT'S BETTER, START OVER</B></P></center>

<P><B>Elicit - Detailing Specific Behaviors</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Doing work and listening. Tell me about what do you mean better on your work what does that mean?</P>

<P>Kelly: Like doing better on work and listening. Doing stuff she tells us right away.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Follow directions you mean? OK</P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: How did that happen? How did that happen?</P>

<P>Kelly: It was sort of started a couple days ago couple days after counseling. It just started.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Just like that. Just a couple of days.</P>

<P>Kelly: Like a miracle. (smiling)</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: My guess is you made it happen. You did something different. What is it that you did Kelly?</P>

<P>Kelly: I don't know. It just happened. Just like (snapped his fingers) there I am.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So what did you do when you did that what did it look like? What would your teacher say, Kelly, is doing his work. Because he is doing this, when he wasn't doing that before.</P>

<P>Kelly: I'm not goofing around. I'm not talking when we are doing test or anything.</P><br>

<P><B>Reframing from the Absence of Something to the Presence of Something</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So instead of talking you are doing what</P>

<P>Kelly: I'm doing more work than I was doing.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Ok so, there is no talking and no goofing.</P>

<P>Kelly: Nope ....and no.... like that.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Boy, that is different. Uh?</P>

<P>Kelly: A lot.</P><br>

<P><B>Reframing from the Absence of Something to the Presence of Something</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: A lot different. Is that right? A lot different. So instead of acting silly what are you doing? What would that look like?</P>

<P>Kelly: I'm focusing on my work.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Focusing on your work. So you are focusing on your work. So you were able to put all your energies at your work. Take all that other stuff out of your mind. </P>

<P>Kelly: I forgot about it so far.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You forget about the other stuff and just stay on the work. That's new? Isn't that new?</P>

<P>Kelly: During the day it feels good after doing that and not worrying. It feels real good.</P>


<P>Dr. Sklare: It feels good. Is that right? I bet it does feel good. You've got to be proud </P>

<P>of yourself.</P>

<P>Kelly: I am.</P><br>

<P><B>Reinforce - Cheerleading</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You should be. Yeah. So you can do it. You are capable. Right? You can do it. That is amazing. That's amazing. That you are really strong enough to do that. Super.</P>

<P>Kelly: That is that miracle we were talking about.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You made it happen. You made that miracle happen.</P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P><br>

<P><B>Mindmapping</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: That is fantastic. So you were able to focus right on that work. Is there something you do or say or think to make that happen?</P>

<P>Kelly: I just think of sugar plums and stuff and those pictures that I had.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Oh, those pictures. You started thinking about those pictures and it gets you moving in that direction those pictures.</P><br>

<P><B>Start Over - Elicit</B></P>


<P>Kelly: I'm not arguing as much with my Mom as much as I did about my clothes and stuff.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: We talked about that getting dressed in the morning.</P>

<P>Kelly: I picked out my clothes today.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So you pick out your clothes and avoid arguments that way. </P>

<P>Kelly: Uh-hmm.</P><br>

<P><B>Amplify - Question that exposes reciprocal effects</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: How did your Mom react to you when you did that?</P>

<P>Kelly: She didn't yell at me.</P><br>

<P><B>Reframing from the Absence of Something to the Presence of Something</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Instead of yelling what did she do?</P>

<P>Kelly: Nothing just acts happy and stuff. Glad that I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.</P><br>

<P><B>Question that exposes reciprocal effects</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Okay. So your Mom acts glad and happy. When you see her act glad and happy what do you do in return?</P>

<P>Kelly: Help her.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: And, what do you do to help her.</P>

<P>Kelly: When we go to the grocery and she says her back is hurting. When we go to the grocery, come back and after we are done, me and my brother take them all up to the house.</P><br>

<P><B>Reinforce - Cheerleading</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Okay. So you are more willing to do that because she is happy to you. So, it is like one thing leads to another. Gosh, you started it all by getting your clothes ready and that stuff. Acting more grown up it sounds like to me taking responsibility for yourself.</P>

<P>Kelly: Mostly getting my clothes ready at night before I go to bed and I have them out when I wake up.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Is that new?</P>

<P>Kelly: Sort of. Mostly, I've only done it a couple of times.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: But, you are doing it regularly now? Oh, so that is new then. What is new about it is that you are doing it all the time. Getting your clothes ready the night before.</P>

<P>Kelly: Like last night. I had one of these (jacket). I bought one of these and we had to take it back because it had a split sleeve, but before I did that the night I had it, I laid these out, (pants) this out (jacket), my shirt out, my shoes and socks out. I was the first one to get ready in the whole house. Mostly, I'm the last one.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Now you are the first one. So you have figured out ways to get yourself ready. Get your clothes ready lay your stuff out the night before and get yourself...</P>

<P>Kelly: Organized.</P><br>

<P><B>Reinforce - Cheerleading</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Organized. I'm impressed. That is really neat, Kelly. A whole bunch of things have happened to you. Haven't they, since we met.</P>

<P>Kelly: Since last time.</P><br>

<P><B>Amplify - Question that exposes reciprocal effects</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Since a week ago. Let me get back to one thing I forgot to ask you about. You said in school things are different to. You're doing your work, your listening, following directions, focusing on your work. How have your teachers been? What would your teacher say? If she came in here and said, "Gosh, Kelly is different. Something happened to him. Some miracle has happened to him? What would she tell me? If the teacher was sitting here and said you should see Kelly.</P>

<P>Kelly: She probably would tell you that,,. Another toughie question.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: I know, yeah, I ask them.</P>

<P>Kelly: Um, she would probably say that I'm focusing on all this stuff and more stuff. Now, she don't call my name out every day. Today she only called it out once because I was talking to somebody on a hard question on the science test.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So she doesn't have to call you out much</P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P><br>

<P><B>Detailing Specific Behaviors</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: How is your teacher reacting to you with of all these changes? What is she doing differently? What is she doing as a result of you doing your work, listening, following directions, not talking or goofing around or acting silly. What do you notice different about her?</P>

<P>Kelly: That is a tough one.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Yeah. What have you noticed?</P>

<P>Kelly: I noticed that she is watching me more because she is surprised how I'm doing stuff. Probably watching me because she wants me to set an example.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Oh, so she is seeing you as being someone who can set an example for other people Pointing you out as, "be like Kelly."</P>

<P>Kelly: Uh-hmm.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Real well behaved. And, so, when she sees that, how is she behaving toward you? What have you noticed? Has she done anything different?</P>

<P>Kelly: No, just surprised</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Surprised. So, when she is surprised what does she do when she is surprised?</P>

<P>Kelly: She is like joy. So happy.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So she is real happy for you as a result of that.</P>

<P>Kelly: Uh-hmm.</P><br>

<P><B>Start Over - Elicit</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Gosh, neat, what else has better?</P>

<P>Kelly: More stuff. I know that. I'm not getting up as much like at midnight or something and getting in my Dad's bed. I'm sleeping mostly all night.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You were worried. Remember you said you were worried.</P>

<P>Kelly: I forgot about that. One time a couple of nights ago or two days ago, I slept all night at my Dad's. I always sleep all night at my Mom's. Unless I wake up and wake her up, but I don't do that anymore I just stay there and fall back asleep.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: So, you slept through the night at your Dad's without getting up and worrying? Really, you did that? How did you do it?</P>

<P>Kelly: It just happened. (giggling)</P><br>

<P><B>Getting student to accept ownership</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Nooooo, I don't think so. I think you did something, Kelly. You did something.</P>

<P>Kelly: I forget all about the bad things and it seemed like it just happened.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: How did you do that? How did you forget about the bad things? What did you replace that with?</P>

<P>Kelly: Happy thoughts.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: How did you do that?</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Tough question?</P>

<P>Kelly: How did I do it? I probably did that by thinking happy thoughts and forgetting about all the stuff that happened. I forgot about my Mom having the car crash. Today I didn't know about it. I just forgot.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You just let it go.</P>

<P>Kelly: It flew away.</P><br>

<P><B>Mindmapping</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Flew away. You made it go away, didn't you? You made it go away. How did you make it go away?</P>

<P>Kelly: I just , I wanted to make it go away so I just did.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Something took its place.</P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: What took it's place? </P>

<P>Kelly: Happy thoughts.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: What kind of happy thoughts? About what?</P>

<P>Kelly: Toughie, toughie, toughie, toughie. What was the question?</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: What replaced those sad thoughts or bad things, with happy thoughts? What kind of happy thoughts did you have?</P>

<P>Kelly: Probably, sugar plums or me or something, dancing and having joy in my head and happy thoughts and paying attention that's all.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You paying attention.</P>

<P>Kelly: Seems like it just happened. Seems like a miracle happen</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Sounds like it did. Sounds like it did happen.</P>

<P>Kelly: It did two days ago and nights.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Especially when you slept through the night so that is another thing I tell you Kelly, I'm really impressed .</P>

<P>Kelly: So am I (laughing).</P><br>

<P><B>Cheerleading</B></P><br>

<center><P><B>STEP 3 SCALING - REINFORCING SUCCESS AND ASSESSING SCALING RATINGS</B></P></center>

<P>Dr. Sklare: I'm really impressed and I think you have the answers and you are on the road to getting yourself together because I knew you were concerned about those thoughts because you weren't able to study or focus or concentrate. And, you like it and you really feel good about it at the end of the day. That is really neat. What number are you at right now between 1 and 10?</P>

<P>Kelly: Nine</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Nine! nine, a nine </P>

<P>Kelly: Probably a nine.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Boy that's a huge jump. </P>

<P>Kelly: First it was six or seven.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You were a six. You were saying to yourself it's not worth why worry.</P>

<P>Kelly: I think I'm at nine now because I'm doing a lot better. A lot.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: A lot better, a lot better with...</P>

<P>Kelly: Work doing what I'm suppose to.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: The reason you are a nine is because you are doing what you are suppose to be doing and you're doing your work. </P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P><br>

<P><B>Increased scale rating question</B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Okay, what should you have to do to get to a ten?</P>

<P>Kelly: Probably have to do a couple more better stuff than I am now. Like, better better better, like great. Way up there.</P><br>

<P><B>Detailing Specific Behaviors </B></P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Okay, give me an example of what you mean. What would you see yourself doing that would say, "I am here I am a ten if I'm doing this?"</P>

<P>Kelly: I know I'm at a ten if I get bored or something in playtime sometime we go outside so I bring something to read. Being a ten, if do a lot more stuff than I am doing now and doing all this other stuff more than I am now.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: What would the stuff be?</P>

<P>Kelly: Probably clean my hamster's cage out more. To help my Dad. Feed the cats. Feed the dog. When I can, I'll mow the grass. Don't let the dog get on the couch.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: If you keep progressing like you are progressing will you be satisfied with counseling we've had in here? </P>

<P>Kelly: Uh-hmm.</P><br>


<center><P><B>STEP 4 - CONCLUDING THE SESSION AND PROVIDING A MESSAGE</B></P></center>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Kelly, I want to write you a message. You are indeed an amazing young man to make a miracle come true. That takes a lot of hard work</P>

<P>Kelly: Courage.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Courage, yes. Work and courage. Your teacher has been happy with the new Kelly who is focused on work rather than talking, goofing around and acting silly being more focused. It has led to her being a lot happier with you and not calling your name like she did before. You really like the results of this new behavior.</P>

<P>Kelly: Yeah.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: You really like it. Cause you know you can do it. You have proven to yourself you can do it. Being able to sleep through the night at your Dad' s, picking out your clothes and laying them out, forgetting about bad things and replacing them with happy thoughts show you have what it takes to make good things happen for yourself in reaching a nine. Because of your desire to do better in school and at home, I want you to continue doing what you are doing that has been working for you that will get you to a ten. Keep it up.</P>

<P>Kelly: Okay.</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: I think you can.</P>

<P>Kelly: May I have a copy of this?</P>

<P>Dr. Sklare: Okay.</P>

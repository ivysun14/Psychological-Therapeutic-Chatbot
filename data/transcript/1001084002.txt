<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how did this happen?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, well, on [DATE] like he spent the night the night before and we, I don't know, he came, he left his friend's birthday, like this girl's birthday party to come hang out with me.  And I was like, yknow, it really bothers me 'cause like we've been going to all these birthday parties.  And when it was my birthday party, like my birthday period, he didn't spend my birthday with me, but he'll want to go hang out with all these other girls on their birthdays and guys on their birthdays.  Like I got mad at him, I was like [NAME OTHER], yknow, which we've been trying to communicate, I told him, yknow, we need to communicate better when we start yelling and getting loud with each other.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You actually told him this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not yelled at him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I told him on the phone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Without yelling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I did.  And he was not yelling back which was good.  And I was like, he's like, and then, yknow, if he did start to get loud then I was like, [NAME OTHER], this is what I'm talking about, you're not communicating well. You're getting loud on something that you don't want to hear, and that's not acceptable. And he quit that because in the process of getting loud like that you're making me get loud and then I'm trying to keep my cool.  And it's not fair. It's not how we need to communicate.  We need to talk right and appropriate to each other.  And like I've like, I guess, I made him feel guilty because, uh, of him wanting to go to some girl's birthday party for her birthday.  It's not even like, it was like a twenty first or anything, it was the [AGE] birthday.  And last time I went to a birthday was the time he went to a club and danced with a Spanish girl and made me so mad and started to go home with her and everything.  So I was like I don't want you going.  And then finally he like kinda hung up on me and then acted like he was gonna go and then I called him because I got, I was just like why'd you hang up on me?  He's like I'm almost to your house.  And I'm like what?  And he's like, yeah.  I want to make you happy.  And I was like really?  So he comes over, we hang out, we cuddle, and I'm like I want to take a picture.  He's like [PATIENT NAME], I'm too tired to take a picture right now because he went to this party, oh yeah he went to this party like a couple days before or two days before and he called me at like three thirty in the morning, at two thirty in the morning something about, [PATIENT NAME], come get me, I'm drunk, please come get me, I don't want to drive.  And I come to get him and he's at some girl's house and this, that, and the other.  And the next day I like see a picture of this girl that I hate sitting on his lap on her My Space.  And I wanted to kill her.  I was so mad. I was like, oh my God, this girl is a hoe, she does stuff like that on purpose.  She knows it makes me mad.  And he was drunk, and he doesn't remember.  And, um, she like put the quote on like love you more than anything.  Oh my God.  And so like I was like I want a picture.  He's like, he goes no, not tonight.  He's like do you really want to start a fight?  I said I'm just asking you.  I'm like come on, like why is this such a big problem?  He said we'll do it in the morning.  I was like what if I forget, and he's like you forget, oh yeah, right.  And then sure enough, I woke up and he was running late to work.  I said let's take a picture real quick.  And he was like, he kinda like, he didn't grab my face, but he put his hands on my face and he was looking at me, this, [PATIENT NAME], do you really want to start a fight?  And I was like I'm not trying to start a fight.  You clearly said to me last night, yeah, remind me in the morning we'll take a picture.  And he's like, uh.  And like we're goin outside, he started to get loud, and then he said something nasty.  He was like you know what I don't want to take a picture with you, because I don't want my friends still knowing that we're hanging out and this, that, and the other.  And they don't like you.  And I know all you're gonna do is put it on My Space and blah, blah, blah.  And I almost punched him in the face.  Instead of punching him in the face, I punched my car, not my car, but my other car that I had.  And my hand's still swollen by that on [DATE].  And I was like about to punch him in the face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is the [DATE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. The morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or [DATE]? The morning of the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The morning of the [DATE].  And I was so mad.  I was like, oh my God, and then he goes.  That's like the first time I ever did something like that, crazy like, upsetting.  I was very upset at what he had to say.  And I couldn't believe I reacted like, after I did that I was like oh my God, what did I just do?  Why did I just punch the car?  I'm glad I didn't punch him in the face because I know he probably would have retaliated even though he didn't want to.  He's just split second like that and he would have done something if I did punch him in the face.  And he like, I started walking away after I did it and he's like running late to work and he like drove up into a parking spot and he goes get in the car now, I'm taking you to a freaking psycho hospital.  I said fuck you, get outta here.  I'm pissed.  You do not want to mess with me right now.  I am liable to punch you in your face, so leave. So like right now.  And he left.  And then he called me like a couple hours later talking about, yknow, I'm mad I had to be like that.  And I was like I'm disappointed that, yknow, you had the nerve to say stuff like that.  Like are you serious?  Like I just can't believe you told me that the reason why you didn't want to take a picture with me is because you don't want your friends to know that we're hanging out and they don't like me.  And I was like that is messed up.  And he was like I only said it to piss you off.  And I was like that's great, [NAME OTHER], 'cause you really did piss me off.  And I was about to punch you in your face, and thank god I punched my car instead because I would have hurt you.  See how hard I punched my car.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you dent the car?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  I was like do you see how hard I punched the car?  Yes, I punched it twice. And I punched like a punching bag before with that hand and hurt it before but he was like I'm sorry.  And I was like what are you doing tonight?  And I was like it's [DATE], I really wanted to do something fun like [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.  He's like oh I'm gonna get drunk with my boys.  All right.  I ditched my friends to hang out with you last night.  I was like we didn't really hang out.  There's a difference between hanging out and chilling, like sleeping because you come over, you eat food and then you pass out.  And that's all you do.  I was like that's not fair.  That's not hanging out and spending time with me, that's just sleeping with me.  Like that's not what I want.  And I said that's a nice thing, like a couple nights after that too he came over.  And I was like you didn't spend time with me, you just slept with me.  And, um, and then like my friend [NAME OTHER] called me and she's dating his best friend or one of his best friends, and they invited me over to [DEIDENTIFIED], he lives out in [DEIDENTIFIED] too.  They invited me over for a barbecue.  They're like come on over mama, we'll feed you.  I was like all right.  And I came over.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What'd they call you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My friend called me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Come on over.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Mama.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, mama.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] said I want you fat and pregnant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was like all right, I'm excited because me and her have been beefing kinda because she was mad that I wanted to try and make it work with him.  She was like you're gonna ruin our friendship and we've been best friends since second grade.  Like we've been each other's, since second grade.  I didn't even have a boyfriend in second grade, we had second grade class together.  Like we go way back.  And she was mad that I wanted to, she's like you're gonna choose him over me.  I said, [NAME OTHER], why would you give me that ultimatum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What does she not like about him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't like it because she has seen him at the club when he did that whole thing.  She's the one who told me he did that. And she just doesn't like him because of the way he acts towards me.  And she thinks he's too mature for me and I'm wasting my time.  And I'm like, well, that's your opinion.  Thank you for your opinion.  Please let me deal with the consequences of my actions.  If I'm gonna get hurt, then I'm gonna get hurt.  Be there.  If you don't want to hear what I have to say, then I won't talk to you about it.  Yknow, I'd like to be able to talk to you about it, but if it's gonna cause a problem then let's not talk about it.  So that was the last time we fought.  Then she called me and she's like I wanted to see if you wanted to come out, yknow.  I came over and then they wanted to party and go to the party and get drunk and they kinda like, I don't think they wanted me to come, so I kinda left and I called [NAME OTHER] and well I actually went to get minutes at the gas station first.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To get what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Minutes for my cell, it's prepaid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I, um, I saw all these cars parked on the side of the road. I was like I figured it was like this spot where people were gonna [DEIDENTIFIED].  Everybody's like out of their cars and parked instead of around the parking lot.  I got minutes, came back out, [DEIDENTIFIED] everywhere like across the way and like, and it was like cool [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow, and I was like, [NAME OTHER], I called him, I was like please come meet up with me.  He's like where are you, I was like where are you at?  He's like I'm at Giant, so you're right across the street from me.  He's like what?  I was like, yeah, I'm at the 7-11 and he's like oh really?  And I was like, yeah.  I was like come [DEIDENTIFIED] with me and he's like no, I'm not going to.  I was like, what, like you're right across the street, come hang out for five minutes before you go back to your friend's house.  Yknow, just spend some time with me, he was just like no and all this stuff being nasty.  And then he put me in a bad mood. I sat there and [DEIDENTIFIED] and I kept trying to get a hold of him and he kept hanging, like ignoring the call 'cause he hung up on me and I hate when people hang up on me.  It makes me so angry.  So angry. So I like cussed him out.  So when I did get a hold of him, I was like [NAME OTHER], come see me right now.  Like, oh my God.  Then, then I was, and he hung up on me again and I left him a nasty message saying, yknow, you told me you don't want to be my enemy but that's all you do is do things to make me want to be your enemy and not want to talk to you and be nasty to you and this, that, and the other.  And I can't even remember exactly everything I said.  But I was so stressed.  And another thing I said I go, [NAME OTHER], yknow, one day you're gonna look at our daughter when she gets old and remember that you were such an asshole to her mother when she was pregnant with her.  And you're gonna remember that for the rest of your life.  And you're gonna hate yourself because of it.  And I sent him that message and I was pissed.  And sure enough the next day he called me, he like called me later that night and I had my phone ringer off and I wish, I wanted to talk to him again after I sent that message.  And then he didn't answer.  And so I was like, and he called me the next morning, I was like hello and I was like, yknow, like what.  Okay.  We've been hanging out ever since then.  He's been wanting to spend time with me and hang out with me and he came over to my house and we watched a movie together and he's like, yknow [PATIENT NAME], I'm sorry, like I know I've been an asshole and, I don't even know exactly what he said.  But he was just being nice.  And ever since then we've been hanging out every day and he's been asking me to hang out with him and, yknow, wanting to spend time with me.  Like last night like I started a job, by the way, I started last week was my second week.  I usually have to be there at twelve to five, but I told them I had this appointment I couldn't change it because you were busy for the next three months in the morning.  I was like I've gotta keep this appointment, can I go?  They're like okay.  All right.  I was like thanks.  But, yknow, it kind of helps if he works seven to three and I work twelve to five, so then he still has time to hang out with this friends now. So like he can hang out with his friends after work and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We hung out Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  And then last night too he came and said he wanted to spend the night with me.  Like every night we've been doing things with each other.  But not every day.  We separate for a couple hours and then I come back over or he came over to my house.  And like last night he called me, I was getting aggravated 'cause he called me early, like when I got off, like when he like got back from the DMV because he had to get his license, but he called me [PATIENT NAME] I need help, what do I get, what do I take to the DMV with me.  Because he had an out of state license that had been expired.  And he needed to get a [DEIDENTIFIED] license and all this stuff.  And I was like take a proof of residency, your birth certificate, your social, you might have to take this test.  I even gave him the manual that I had.  And he was like I love you.  And then he's been saying that a lot lately too, like every time he calls me like I love you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You still have the manual?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  The what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The manual?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he has it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but you still had it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  My mom had gotten it because she wanted to read over it 'cause my brother got in trouble in June, something about.  And [INAUDIBLE].  What?  So I was like actually my mom just got one.  He was like really?  I was like yeah.  And like, so I went and got it and like, I don't know, he made me [INAUDIBLE].  I've just been really satisfied with how he's been acting lately.  And if we do start getting loud with each other we like take a second and we like look away from each other, we breathe and we look at each other and we're like are we really trying to start a fight, I'm like I'm not trying to start a fight, I'm just trying to talk to you.  So just calm down, let's just talk about this rationally and not freak out because, yknow, sometimes if he doesn't want to hear something I have to say he'll freak out.  And I tell him that.  And he's like, yknow, he's like psycho [NAME OTHER].  And I'm like I don't like that.  Like the other day, like Sunday like I was going to take him to his friend's house that I hate, but, yknow, I was gonna take him there and cause its right next to the DMV and then we started to watch a movie and then we like sort of cried at the end of the movie together.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What movie, on TV you watched?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. HBO.  It's called Life Support like about AIDS based on a true story, a true woman.  And at the end it made me cry and then I'm like crying on his chest and then I look up, I see him go like this, and I'm like are you crying too, and he's like.  I'm like [NAME OTHER] I love you.  He's like I love you too.  And he like squeezed me and I was like ah baby.  It's so cute.  And he was supposed to like go to his friend's house.  He was like wanna sleep over?  I was like okay.  What about your friend?  He was like I don't care.  And I was like all right.  So we watched two documentaries on TV before we went to bed, like of, of Iraq.  And like surgery ER's and craziness, whoa [INAUDIBLE] but we watched that together too.  I was like [NAME OTHER] I'm so glad you didn't go to Iraq.  If you looked like that, I don't know if I could deal with it, I feel so bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And these were Americans wounded?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  They kept saying Iraqis but they weren't terrorists or anything.  Like people that got bombed by [INAUDIBLE] and stuff.  People's legs getting amputated, oh, some of that made me sick.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You see them all the time.  I go to [DEIDENTIFIED], I live near there.  I go in the clinic or the gym there.  I was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service for my first career.  Really sad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's remarkable though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, the people that are over there have a lot of like, yknow, courage and strength to deal with stuff like that because and a strong stomach.  [INAUDIBLE] in person, like TV it's really different than looking at it right there.  It's like oh my God.  Whoa.  That's gross.  But I don't know, like even last night like he called me and he goes [PATIENT NAME] I really want to see you 'cause he wanted me to come over to his house and I was like, I called him when I was done hanging out with my friend because she wanted me to pick up her son after I got off work.  She couldn't pick him up, she didn't have her car.  So I went and did that and then we end up, her son was like can we watch a movie and we watched a movie and [NAME OTHER] called me and he was like hi baby, and I was like hi.  He's like what are you doing?  I was like I'm watching a movie with my friend and her son.  He was like well, do you want to spend the night?  And I was like I guess I could do that.  And he's like okay.  And then I was like where are you?  He's like I'm at my house I'm gonna go out in [DEIDENTIFIED] for a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You went out to what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], that's where he works.  And his friends are at.  So I was like all right.  And I was thinking, yknow, probably by the time the movie was done he'd be going home, but he was out chilling with his friends forever and I was like getting frustrated it's getting late, I've got an appointment in the morning, are you trying to hang out or not and he's like I'm in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm like, yknow, we're sitting around right now and I'm trying to do something.  And I was like okay, well, whatever.  And he called me back and he's like I want to see you and I was like [NAME OTHER] it's too late, I don't want to drive all the way out there.  You're already like halfway to my house, why don't you come to my house and hang out.  And he's like I don't know.  And he's like I don't have a lot of gas.  And I was like, yknow, I'll even put a couple dollars in your gas I have to fill up my car anyways.  And he's like you know what, I was like, he's like I guess I'm just going to have to go to my house.  And I was like I'm gonna be so lonely 'cause we've been hanging out the past couple of nights, cuddling, and everything.  Usually he never cuddles with me.  Usually he's just like on his side of the bed, I'm on my side of the bed.  And he's like I know, do you really think I want to go home?  No, I don't want to go home.  He was like then come over and he's like I'm coming.  I'm coming over.  So he came over and we ate all my leftover rice, 'cause I was hungry and he's hungry.  And then we went to bed.  And then he cuddled with me all night.  And then he woke up.  And he went to work.  And then I made breakfast and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get hot at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In my basement its so cold.  So cold 'cause there's a fan blowing on me and everything.  It was very relaxed and I was happy.  When he woke up and he was walking out the door, he's like I love you baby.  And like when we were laying in bed once the alarm went off 'cause it goes off fifteen to twenty minutes early, I was like, he has like recuperate before he gets up.  And, um, I was like come here, give me your hand.  Like he felt the baby kick and I'm like she's kicking your ass.  She's like punching.  His hand was like and I like looked at him and he looked at me.  And he's smiling and I'm smiling, I'm like -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Has he ever done that before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He did it like once before but never like, she never like kicked like that much and that hard.  And then we both like, just, and then he kinda like grabbed me and hugged me and was like holding my belly.  And it was so cute.  I was so happy. I was like I love you [NAME OTHER] and he was like I love you too, baby.  I'm so happy.  I was just a happy little camper.  And yknow what, to be honest, I really feel that the baby knows that I've been happy this past weekend too.  [INAUDIBLE] 'cause usually I'm crying and upset.  [INAUDIBLE] And he's been like you and the baby have been happy and eating, I've been writing down everything I eat.  I got weighed the other day, last weekend, last week, and they like the baby's almost two pounds, I'm like I thought she said one pound some ounces and then I like asked somebody how many ounce where in an pound and they were like 16 and I was like oh, okay, she's almost two pounds.  I thought she was only like less than one and a half pounds.  It's like whoa.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like things are going well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Well, just hopefully you can continue to monitor self monitor or whatever and that would be great, yknow.  Comments [INAUDIBLE] are getting loud or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I try so hard.  There are times that yknow we can't stop it, but, yknow, like, and then I like we separate or we hang up the phone when it's happening and we call each other back and he's like are you calmed down, are you calmed down and we're like all right, let's talk about this.  Let's not freak out because it pisses me off. And he's like it pisses me off too.  And I'm like well then let's stop.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like you've been working on that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We have.  And it makes me so happy because he's been wanting to hang out with me.  Cuddle with me because we never cuddled before.  Like maybe occasionally, but now it's actually like all night he's cuddling with me or I'll cuddle with him and we both love it and he's not being all like huh about it.  Okay.</p>

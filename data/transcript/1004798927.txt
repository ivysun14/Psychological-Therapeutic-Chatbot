<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do people use these for like a textbook or something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're trying to make a catalog of sessions that people—for training purposes -people can go look into sessions for-. You know they're looking for content. They're looking for a particular therapeutic style or something. To get an idea of what people actually sound like. So they are transcribing them so it can also be written and read rather than just listened to. I think the exact format might not be totally known until they have the catalog of what they're trying to make. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So right now the company is trying to gather data and have tons of sessions of transcribed so they can see what to make of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they will, once they're done—the purpose is for training so they're not going to be published. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. That's pretty cool. I was just curious. [00:00:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess I kind of want to start by thanking you. I mean I know I sent you a brief e-mail but I want to acknowledge sort of what you have written. And I know we haven't really processed that experience in here and you did your work on that before seeing me. On your own. But I just want to acknowledge kind of your bravery in writing it, your bravery in sharing it with somebody else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And acknowledge what you've been through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah it kind of took me awhile to find it actually on my computer because I had been kind of searching through it and I get distracted and stuff. But I actually reread it before I sent it which was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually I avoid doing that. And it was not that bad. Because I've reread it before and it was really bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I started crying and it was really sort of uncomfortable. And then this time even though I didn't remember some of the specific things like when I was reading the thing that I turned in—I don't know. And of course I picked out some grammar mistakes and was like -. [00:02:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't notice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But I did that. So that was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The fact that you were focusing on your editing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:13) Yeah. Yeah so that was a much better experience than I've had before rereading it. Because I have before. Usually around like a year or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So yeah. That was different. That was good I think. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm glad that you feel like you've healed from it sounds like. Such a disorienting and scary experience to have lived through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I usually—I think the reason I sort of was thinking about was because I have this thing where I don't sleep in the dark. And I know that's like I'm three years old. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: More like you're someone who was traumatized. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's why I didn't really put that together until I started thinking about—after I read it I was like, "Why can't I just turn the lights off?" And I was like, "It's terrifying." Oh well that's why. So I sort of put that together when I sent that because—I don't know. I just don't—in college I slept with night-light to not be completely embarrassed. And now that I have my own place I sort of just sleep with the light on. Which is weird but I can't—I don't know. [00:03:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's how you sleep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sleeping is important. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And I mean I think part of it was because it happened in the dark.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I didn't like sleeping in the dark to begin with. Like it was just something that—I like being able to see when I open my eyes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway. That sort of had been on my mind too. And I'm trying to see if I can maybe change that a little bit. So it would be nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you find it difficult to sleep with the light on too? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think it's just it's different because I guess I don't really have a like, "Okay now. It's time to go to sleep" ritual. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it just sort of happens. And now that I have to—now that I'm doing overnights and stuff I have be a little bit more conscious of like, "Okay I must go to sleep within these two hours." (chuckles) [00:04:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so then -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have that cue that so many people use. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. So then that's been a little bit different I guess. A little bit. It wasn't really a problem before. It's not really a huge problem now it's just something that I sort of became aware of. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well I know one of the reasons that you started thinking this is you brought up the idea of dating. And how does maybe some of your hesitancy about a relationship get traced back to some of this stuff? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if part of that too—I mean just the judgements you make about yourself. Like, "Oh I'm like a three year old." </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sharing that with someone new and kind of figuring out how do you tell you someone that you sleep with the light on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what do you want to explain about maybe why? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see some of those ideas coming up for you because most people anticipate that you're going to turn the lights off to go to sleep. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And I think that it might actually be easier with someone there. Just because like, "Oh what is that noise?" Someone else can do something about it too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. It is something that I don't want to totally—I don't know. But anyway. It's sort of been coming—there has been like a lot this week. These two weeks have just been so disorienting. I've just been like everywhere. And I think maybe it's because classes started this week. Especially this week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been everywhere in your head or you've been everywhere physically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. Yeah. Both. And I've been everywhere from like crying alone in my bed to super-excited about the explosion in chemistry class. Or like—because they made something explode. There was a huge fireball. It was enormous. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So it was really cool. But so I've been just everywhere. And it's been so disorienting. And I have—I'm trying to organize myself in terms of "Oh I have a homework problem due whenever. And I have to go to class on this day." So just even like logistically organizing myself which I'm usually pretty good at has been kind of difficult. [00:06:10]</p>

<p>Because the classes have—they're not hard. There is so much to do for them. Like for divinity school it was sort of just like, "Read this book. We'll talk about next week." But this is like, "Okay. You have to do problems three through seven on page -." Like it's just very detailed stuff. And I'm not very good at that. And there is a lot of volume of things to do. And then work has been stressful too because there is a new hire. And she is usually on after my overnights. And so I've been having to stay a couple of hours after my overnight, which already twelve hours long. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because—and so she's actually not going to be staying because she can't -. Like I was trying to help her as much as I could but she just can't really do it I guess. I don't know. And so if she's not going to be around anymore so it will be a new hire. [00:07:05]</p>

<p>And then this previous hire who I have been spending so much time working with—who is also kind of struggling—like she might be fired if she doesn't improve in the next week or two. So it's all of—it makes me feel like I'm responsible for them because I'm technically their manager. So I'm supposed to be there and helping them and stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a say in the hire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I e-mailed them. And I was like, "Look. Can I please help with the interview? Because the last two hires that you guys have made are not (inaudible at 00:07:33)." And I mean I've done a lot of interviewing before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have experience doing that. So I asked them. They said that they would let me interview. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah because if you're going to feel responsible for them maybe you should get some input into someone that might be a better fit than what they're finding. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. And so hopefully that will be a little bit better in the next two weeks. But then there is also—every month there is something different. So like this month is (inaudible at 00:08:00) so I have to drive to review people for two hours every single (inaudible). And then all this stuff with at home with Julia that got worse but then got better. But then with Tim it has stayed the same. And I'm just sort of -. [00:08:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are (inaudible at 00:08:15). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. I'm sorry. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. Let's see if we can—maybe one of the things that we can do today is kind of help you get a handle on where things go and how to flop them so you don't feel so all over the place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And so up and down. Usually when I've been depressed before—okay. At least it's consistent. (laughs) And now I'm like yelling in the car about how excited I am about chemistry and how like fun it is. And how many people are in the class which is crazy. </p>

<p>But then just being like really stressed out and sort of—actually earlier this week I was so stressed out that I didn't even know where to start. It was one of those—like finals. Like finals level stress where you're like, "Oh my God. I have seven papers to write and they're all due tomorrow. Where do I start?" Sort of thing. So yeah. [00:09:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So we just need to give you a template. And figure out really what's important and how to balance it so that you feel like you know how to navigate through it. You know where to start. You know what you need to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I don't know what that means. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's actually put it on paper. (inaudible at 00:09:30) visual. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) picture of it? I took a picture of my calendar earlier today which is like really nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then I had the new assignment and then I have all these things too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:09:50) color codes. It makes it easier to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's just slot out your week or maybe let's start with the weekend because you'll probably do some work over the weekend. [00:10:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's just slot out Saturday through Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you have to—we'll give you blocks of time. Things that are eaten up from shifts or plans that you already have. And you'll look at what time you have left and slot the things into places they need to go to give you an idea of how to get through what you need to get through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (inaudible at 00:10:29) So today is what? Friday? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Today is Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Today I have work starting at seven until seven a.m. But I'm going in early to do a review. Tomorrow I have work starting at seven depending on who is working. I might go in early to do a review.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long does that take when you go in early to do a review? [00:11:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it takes me two hours to get there. Except on the weekends. So it takes me two hours to get there today and it takes me an hour and a half tomorrow. I have to be there at seven so I usually leave by five. But since I want to be there at five I'm leaving at three. Or when I get out of here. (chuckles) </p>

<p>And then Sunday I'm working again seven. And Monday I have a problem set due I think. I think. I'm pretty sure. I have a problem set due Monday night at like six thirty during my first section meeting. And Tuesday I have Physics. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's sort of Physics six to nine. Wednesday. I may have Wednesday off. I don't remember. It's in my calendar. [00:11:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can look. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the other thing. Since the girl isn't going to be with us anymore I'm going to have to pick up all of her shifts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not all of them but most of them. Which are on Wednesdays. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is no one else to pick up her shifts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesdays are really hard to schedule. And it's apparently part of my—this is the first fun thing I've scheduled in like two months. My friend Leonard is sleeping over. Like on the couch. (chuckles) But he's sleeping over. So that's on Wednesday. And Thursday I have Chemistry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I know you put down that you were working. So now block back the commute time because from five to seven or like today going in at three thirty just because we should know what hours you're playing with. So block off the commute time to and then the commute time from. Like when do you actually arrive back at the house? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh like nine a.m. [00:13:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that time gets blocked off. (pause at 00:13:03] until [00:13:09) And then can you block off when you actually sleep? Or what your nighttime or sleep time is on those days? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah until the alarm goes off to tell me to go back to work. (laughs) On the weekends that's why I schedule it so close together. So that it's all over with and I have the rest of the week to do life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So nine to maybe say like two to take a shower and go to sleep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's five hours. Usually I get like six. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not a ton of sleep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No wonder it's hard to sort through things when you're pretty sleep deprived. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. But so usually sometimes what I do is—well I've started doing this recently which I find really helpful. Is I'll drive home in the morning. I'll change and take a shower and do what I need to do and then I'll immediately drive back and then sleep in the car until work starts. And there is like a safe parking lot and stuff which is really nice. And it's actually much more restful. [00:14:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you just stay there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you stay there? Because you're basically driving home to shower and drive back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I should probably maybe take a change of clothes at some point if I'm really tired. Maybe I could -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they have a room where you could—I mean I know a lot of time hospitals will have a room where doctors sleep during overnights. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure I could find a place to sleep. Yeah there is a chair I can sleep in for sure. I mean I'm sleeping in a chair anyway right? In my car. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess. It doesn't sound like a great plan. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Yeah. I guess I'm also just frustrated about- there is all this other stuff that I have to do too. I just dealt with all this health care stuff today. So like I sent in a payment one day late and so that means I have to wait until October for my insurance to actually happen. [00:14:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ugh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course last month—I was supposed to be uninsured for one month. And so I was like, "Okay. I can go for one month without dying." Like I can do it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the month your asthma (inaudible at 00:15:10) up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Right. Exactly. And so now I'm worried that I'm going—that my heart's going to stop or something. (laughs) (inaudible at 00:15:17) So I had to do that. Well I did that. But I don't know why that still feels like it's on my mind. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because now you're uninsured for September. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe yeah. Well okay. But anyway. It's just all these different -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you have a lot floating around. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then there is volunteering I'm trying to do. But then when?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well and I think that's kind of the purpose of making you sit down and put it all out in front of you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:15:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when is a very good question. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday during the day? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you said you have problems that are due Monday? [00:16:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday night. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when—you need to sleep though Monday because aren't you working Sunday night? So when are you going to do that problem set? </p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long does a problem set take? Or is this the first one you're doing so we'll find out? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I have no idea. But that's for chemistry? It is for chemistry. Okay. Yeah I don't know how long it will take. But sometimes we get a lull between like four and five thirty. And the doctor was sort of—because I worked with pretty much the same doctor every time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was like, "Oh. You should bring your math in or something." So I might do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good chunk of time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's like three, about like five hours. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you were able to get work done during a shift when you have that chunk of time. [00:17:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. This is—it sounds like -. To me when I was in college I was busier than this. Like I was much busier than this. Like I hardly slept busy. And it wasn't that hard. It wasn't like this mentally taxing. You know what I mean? Like before it was just like, "Well all I have to do is just figure out when." And like scheduling was the hardest part of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it's sort of keeping—I have like all this emotional attachment to all this stuff. It's so weird. Like running errands. Like all I can think about when I'm running errands—like I had to go get my oil changed the other day because I'm driving 8000 miles a day. So I wanted to get an oil change. I'm like, "Wow this took like three hours out of my life." Actually I took a nap and that was nice. But going there and driving back I was like, "Wow this is what my life is turning into. Running errands." [00:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean for you? What are you attaching to it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what my mom used to do. Growing up. That's what my mom used to do. And my mom worked for my dad. And she was always busy and doing things. And was—I don't know. (chuckles) I know it's part of growing up. I know that—and I've always wanted responsibilities. That's never been something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you not like about what your mom used to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean she—I think it was just that that's—I feel bad. You know? But it seems like that's all that she did was run errands. And I don't mean to say that judgmentally. You know? I don't know even know why I thought about this. (chuckles) [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel about it? You don't have to apologize for what you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel bad about it. I feel really guilty thinking about it like that. That's sort of like all she did. And I think it was because it was all she could do because she didn't finish a degree. And my dad didn't let her do stuff. And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did he not let her do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do any—like get a job. She never had a job. And so she always ran errands or worked with my dad who never acknowledged that she did anything. He always—basically it was like, "You don't do anything. All you do is stay home with the kids. How could this be hard?" when she would complain about like "I'm busy all the time. What do you want me to do?" And that just seems like a trap. (laughs) It makes me feel really constricted. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the ways that she seemed constricted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) Anyway. Yeah. (pause [00:20:06] until [00:20:14) Yeah it's very like—I think that's why I really appreciate -. Like I have this one day off so I have one day to sleep and then I have a day off which never happens. And so I was like I'm going to go to the city to see my friend for the day. And I did. And I think that was last week. I just drove to the city and saw her for the day and came back that night. And so doing things like that and having the freedom to do stuff like that is really important to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah to be spontaneous. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I can't do that now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So slotting out a schedule is the opposite of being spontaneous. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And I mean even just as a kid I was not good with routine. Like routine to me is like constricting or trapping. Like I need to have—even if it's like fake variety. Even if one day my shift is from one to three and the next day it's from five to seven. [00:21:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Something about that. I just don't want it to be monotonous. And I feel like—I didn't realize why. (pause at 00:21:18] until [00:21:25) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how is what you're doing different from the position that your mom found herself in? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I mean it's really different. I'm doing it on my own. Right? No one is telling me to do it. And I'm not doing it because I don't have anything that I can't do—you know what I mean? Like my mom said she's really proud of me because of all the degrees and stuff. To me that's like, "Okay. Well it's a degree." But to her it's like, "I never did that." You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and options. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might not have a lot of time flexibility right now but you're building in options for yourself. [00:22:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Maybe long term. Maybe I'm just not good at seeing things long term. Yeah I don't know. It makes a lot more sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it helps to understand sort of why this feels like there is a lot tied up in each thing. Because it's not just running errands it's seeing similarities in the here and now and maybe planning a different future. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's not that I think that like my mom's life sucks or whatever. That's not what it is. You know? I think that she (inaudible at 00:22:49). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As a kid when you were watching her have her life it seems like there were times when you did think that. I mean you're very angry at your dad for his infidelity. She seemed kind of trapped in the situation. [00:23:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she's always said that it was—that she stayed together for so long because of us. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. That seemed very trapped. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And so to me it's like, "Oh I contributed to that." Like maybe not on purpose. Like I don't blame myself or anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's still like a -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She felt your existence made it important for them to be together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I tried to explain to her—even when they were together—I was like, "Look. No. Don't do that." And she wouldn't listen. But anyway. (pause at 00:23:38] until [00:23:43) Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. It makes sense. (sighs) So okay that makes a lot of sense for the errands and the scheduling but it's so strange that I've always depended so heavily on things like a calendar. And literally if my phone dies I have nothing. Like I need to find a computer or do something to print out my schedule for the day. So that's maybe the opposite of that. It sucks. (chuckles) Yeah. But anyway. [00:24:26] (pause until [00:24:36) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a place to build in freedom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. So I make the schedule for work. So I was trying to figure out a way to give myself the weekends. Or at least a day of the weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe like Monday or Sunday. But I just got my section assignment earlier today for Monday. So that means I can't work Monday. The only day I could work regularly would be Wednesday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Other than weekends. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can't really give yourself—can you work less? [00:25:13] (pause until [00:25:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. No. I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of the job responsibility or because of money or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of the above. Yeah. Everything. I mean I'm not making that much to begin with. (laughs) So. Yeah I don't know. Maybe I think it might be better once I have—like I've always found it really helpful when people—when I'm studying with people. And I always do this for other people too. Like, "Hey you know we have that problem set due next week" Even just something like that makes my life so much easier. Even though I remember. I'm like, "I've started working." or like, "Oh yeah. I'm going to do it tomorrow." </p>

<p>Or whatever. Something about that makes it really present for me. Does that make sense? I don't know. So there is—sections are only going to be like fifteen people. (inaudible at 00:26:07) I've tried—there is like a message board or whatever for the physics class. And I've responded to one of the messages being like, "Hey like let's start a study group." So hopefully I can do that and that might be helpful. Especially being with other people. I think that's another thing I hate about being so busy is that I'm alone a lot of the time. [00:26:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So you can schedule things in to meet these other people and get some stuff done. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean so I spend two hours alone in the car driving to work. And work alone. I mean with the doctor but really my job is alone. And then I drive home alone. I sleep. So. Anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it sounds like you can be pretty isolated. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But and then Julia tries to do stuff with me and I'm like, "No I-." I don't know how many times I've told her I work Friday through Sunday night. Friday through Sunday night. And then actually I was kind of upset at her—I think it was earlier today. She is sort of—I don't know. I think it might be just like my stubbornness but she said something along the lines like—oh because I told her I wasn't—I was feeling kind of sad these couple days or whatever. And she was like, "Oh so are you feeling better about work?" [00:27:36]</p>

<p>Like she immediately associated that with work. And I was like, "No. No. It's not work." She always says, "Well can't you not work nights?" And I'm like, "No I cannot not work nights. I can not work all nights. I cannot not work nights because the emergency department is twenty-four hours a day. And we have to be there twenty four hours a day. So that wouldn't be fair to make everyone else work all the nights." And she always says that and I've explained that to her so many times. And it just seems like she's kind of like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being kind of dismissive maybe of what you're doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. And I thought of sort of telling her that but I think it was like via (inaudible at 00:28:15) chat or something. So it was like, "Okay. Well." Anyway. And then Tim's girlfriend came over last night. Oh they're officially dating. [00:28:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's been really strange for me. Because even like understanding it and like listening to what I'm thinking and why I have such a huge problem. I still—I can't—it's like a gut feeling kind of thing. I just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she still in the other relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Tim at one point, when we were cleaning the kitchen, he said something along the lines of "So guys. So Trisha broke up with her boyfriend. And I just wanted to make sure that if -" How did he say? He said something about "I just wanted to make sure that she can—that we would make her feel welcome here." Because I think that he obviously he knew some of the tension. So it was kind of directed at me but everyone else was there. [00:29:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had other people expressed unease? Or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah. So I thought that was kind of crappy that that was clearly directed at me. (inaudible at 00:29:39)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it wasn't said in private. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But it was also I guess more comfortable. Like that would have been a really uncomfortable conversation to have in person. Or privately. I don't know. Either way I would've found something to be angry about. So. And so I was like okay well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're angry at him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Well sort of. I think of him and it makes me—like I'm so angry. It makes me so angry because I think of—like relationship wise I equate him to my dad's new wife or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like even just saying that makes me feel so gross. It makes me feel icky. And really uncomfortable. [00:30:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So rather than—he was thinking, "Okay so now we're legitimate and we're not hurting anyone." And for you there is still a lot of hurt that has happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is very present. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And that's not his fault. And that's not any of my business and I still I can't—it makes me really uncomfortable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:49) It's really personal. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I've even thought of explaining it to him. But then I don't know what that would accomplish because I'd still feel the same way. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's not going to end his relationship. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's not what I would want him to do either because I really believe that it's not my business. (chuckles) Like it's not just something that I think you would say to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it's any of my—I don't know. So I really want to make her feel welcome. Or I would want ideally—that would be something that I would want to feel. But -. [00:31:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I—but I've been really confused as to what to do because—I mean I know that I don't have to be her friend if I don't want to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't. But I do have to be vaguely not rude. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what would—what is your interaction with her like? Or how -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't look her in the eye. (chuckles) I can't—I don't—and she knows it. I felt really badly. I tried when she walked into the room. I was like—I looked at her. And she didn't look at me because she knows. You know? And so—and then she sat next to me because it was like the open spot or whatever. And she sat almost on someone else's lap. (chuckles) Like to sit far away—you know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, "Wow! This body language is so like representative." (laughs) And then that person left and so Tim sat down. And they started PDA-ing which to me is like—I already am really uncomfortable with PDA-ing. Like with anyone. [00:32:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it is. Like holding hands is my threshold for PDA-ing. (chuckles) And so that was just like really uncomfortable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well sitting in the room with you. That seems like a lot of people would be uncomfortable with that. And I understand that yours is probably amplified by the fact that you're uncomfortable with that relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were sort of pretending you weren't there? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well so it was like pretty much the whole house minus someone else. We were all together. Yeah. So everyone was kind of joking around or whatever. And I tried to make like really annoying political commentary. Like funny jokes. It was (inaudible at 00:33:18). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The DNC. Yeah. I was like, "Wow. Joe Biden, you have so many teeth." (laughs) Like not actual political commentary. (laughs) Just like his teeth are really bright. There are a lot of them. But it was just really awkward. [00:33:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Yeah it sounds like a hard situation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know what to do. I was like—because it seems like what am I supposed to do? Should I just go out of my way and try and spend a lot of time with her and see if I can get over it? Or like move?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's look for your third option. There is something in between moving or hiding in your room every time she comes over and trying to become her best friend. Do you think you could challenge yourself to take one step of saying hello? And then letting yourself be scarce if that's much more comfortable. But I think taking one step of saying hello and using her name which makes it feel more direct and personalized. [00:34:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And showing her that just because you're really uncomfortable with the relationship doesn't mean that you hate her as an individual. And she may be feeling like, "She hates me." Or "She dislikes me." Or it sounds like that's the response you're—trying to avoid you or sitting far away from you. That's kind of what you're getting back. Maybe. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So—</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know that that's what I'm putting out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Right. And I think there is a difference between—you don't really know her as a person. You're really uncomfortable with the situation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so I think challenging yourself maybe just to say hello and acknowledge her in a personal way. And then giving yourself a break from it. And then trying that the next time. That's striking someplace in between moving out and being best friends. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that what's happening is that I sort of—I hear what my mom would say. [00:35:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I hear what I think. So for me I think it's none of my business. I sort of—it's like there are two—and it's almost -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. What would your mom say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would be outraged. She would be like, "Move out!" Like now. Yesterday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "Go sleep in a hotel." So and it's not just what my mom would say. I think it's also like going back to the whole cultural thing. This is I think one of those places where I definitely feel the split. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would a woman in your culture do? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's an undignified, illegitimate relationship. And so you have nothing to do with it. And have nothing to do with the people involved with it. And totally lock them out of your life. I think American me is more like, "Well you know. Relationships are ambiguous." I don't know what was happening with her and her boyfriend before they were—before they broke up or whatever. [00:36:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Tim seemed to go out of his way to let me know that they broke up and make me feel more comfortable about it. And like I acknowledge that but then I still have feelings from the other stuff. And I can't really let go of either one. I feel like I'm confused but not really. I know. And am conflicted and that's what really weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that that's where—I didn't really realize that until today. Because I mean there is no way I would tell my mom about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because if I did—and I thought about it. But if I told my mom about it and then stayed. My mom would be like "Why are you still living there?" So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. So that doesn't feel quite right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And usually I think the weird thing about it for me is that usually that very conservative (inaudible at 00:37:28) is usually like (inaudible). [00:37:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there is some piece of it that resonates with the culturally split you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if there is a way to honor both pieces? Is there a way to honor the side of you that says it's not an accepted relationship and I want nothing to do with it and honor the more Americanized side that says well it's not my relationship it's not for me to say? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How can you honor both parts? Because they're both very real parts of you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think—yeah. I mean I try to listen to conservative, where I grew up me as little as possible. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. It's not all bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. It has been. (chuckles) Or mostly. I don't know. So I think that's sort of like a larger conversation maybe we can have some other time. [00:38:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. We still have time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can avoid it if you want. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you do have time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine. Yeah I don't know. This isn't the first time that this sort of—usually it's not as visceral. (chuckles) I think that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah it's talking to you pretty loudly right now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think it's never really happened like that before. Like in college the first time I smoked pot I was like, "Oh my family they would say (inaudible at 00:39:08)." Which is like a really terrible word for someone who smokes pot. But then -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just means like pot smoker but it's sort of like derogatory. Or very common. Or like—I don't know. Just like bad. Dismissive. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has a real negative connotation to it. [00:39:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But American me was like, "Oh you know let's try for the experience and whatever." And then religion student me was like "Hey. People do this everyday for a religious experience. It might be interesting. "</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There was curiosity as opposed to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. All these very real parts of you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But it was so easy to just say "Oh well. I don't care if someone disapproves." Who cares?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're really surprised by how strongly this message really hits home for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not a message that you dismiss and say "Ah that's conservative and not really me." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. And I think that that's kind of freaky because that's never happened before first of all. And it's not something that I feel like I have control over which is also—you know what I mean? When she's over I can't help my feeling this way. [00:40:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I can try to say hello. That sounds like such a petty, small thing that I should be able to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It means a lot. Sometimes what seems small on the outside when we connect it to what it really means for us it's really big. Because it's not just saying hello to her. It's somehow reconciling the part of you that thinks this is an illegitimate relationship and I'm not going to show support for it in any way. I shouldn't show support for it in any way. That's the strong message that you are hearing. And so doing that, saying hello to her, means that you are directly contradicting this message that you really, actually agree with. [00:41:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well but I also feel like a hypocrite too because I've also—this has been my fight with my dad my whole life. Like literally since I was thirteen, fourteen. This is what I've been fighting about with my dad. And to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it feels like condoning this thing that you've been fighting against. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It feels like if I somehow become friendly towards her then it's like saying "Oh it's okay that all this other shit has happened in my past." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. So it's okay that this other woman had a relationship with my mom's husband. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. And I don't think that but I also -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel like that's what you would be saying by opening yourself up to this person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. And I know that that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So can you disapprove of someone's choices but not excommunicate the person? [00:42:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean that's also something that I've been thinking about. And I was talking about it with Charlene recently. I don't think I ever was taught to or was spurred on to forgive. And so I have a really hard time with that. Like to me if someone does something—like this whole Julia situation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's locked away in the "this is what happened in the past" (inaudible at 00:42:58). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not the exact details of "Well this has been going on. Seven whatever." But don't go there with Julia. Don't talk about relationships with Julia if it can be avoided at all costs. You know what I mean? So and that's sort of—it's also—it's like the same thing when Phil would talk about all these people to me. I was like "Oh mental note. Don't tell anything personal to Phil." [00:43:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like that same thing. You know what I mean? So anyway. It's sort of all—I don't know. It's all connected I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you were to acknowledge this woman, what would it mean for you? (pause at 00:43:47] until [00:43:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would mean that I was wrong for the whole time. And that my dad was right. And you know that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty consequential meaning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if it meant something different? What if you created a new meaning that opening up to this person means that you are giving peace in the household, peace in your relationship with Tim a chance? Your roommate relationship. You're allowed to create a meaning that works for you. I think you can hold onto the protection that you feel for your mom and still create peace in the household. And finding a more peaceful way to live. [00:44:57]</p>

<p>I know that's not what it feels like kind of instinctually. But part of what we do to live in our world and especially where you navigate two cultures—part of being able to be bicultural is creating your own meaning because sometimes the two things don't always jive. A lot of the time they don't jive together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe creating meaning for yourself. This is what it means for me when I do this. That might not translate to what it means for somebody else. It might not even translate for what it means for you in another situation. But you can create meaning for yourself. In this particular situation this is what it means when I am friendly to this person. And it only has to make sense to you. You don't have to justify it to anyone else. It doesn't need to carry over. It's about creating meaning that allows you to live your life in a way that feels comfortable. [00:45:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might want to toy with some stuff in your head. Kind of thinking about what it feels like and then what you want it to be. Until you find something that works. Because moving out and hiding don't work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) Apparently. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we wrap up there for today? I think we need to try to pick a time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something that fits in that schedule. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:46:26) not working. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:46:27] [end of audio]</p>

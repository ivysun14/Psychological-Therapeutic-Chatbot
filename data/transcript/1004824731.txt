<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm actually doing pretty well. I went to—I actually—I had done the sleep study, but today I got my consultation and they said, that—oh, what they saw that there were no real problems. Like there was no -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sort of suggestion of narcolepsy. I mean, maybe some things like kicking my legs a bit, which is an artifact—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —of my antidepressant, but they said it didn't really wake me up and so I sort of thought to myself, I was like, "Well, I know I'm really tired so maybe I just need to get more sleep." And more -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much are you sleeping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, last night I made it anywhere between seven and eight hours. So she suggested, you know, maybe nine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I got—I realized that maybe, you know—it was actually really comforting to know that my urges to take naps, they may be strong, but they're not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I felt with more power to overcome them—because I know I should be—you know, shouldn't be taking them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:01:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there's nothing physiologically, at least with the way I slept there, that—I mean, maybe I just need a lot of sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she also suggested to get my iron tested -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you knew that was low, at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I—that definitely might be another reason to get it checked out. And yeah, it was just interesting because like, you know, I—I was actually really happy to know that I—I mean, I guess sometimes I can make excuses for myself. And I was falling asleep and I do get really tired with, you know, six hours of sleep -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And that's just not enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's—it's hard for me to believe because like I know at one point in my life I could function with six, with five -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like yeah, I would be like really sleepy while I was driving, but I guess, you know, as I've gotten older, maybe that's (laughs) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, and I guess maybe lack of sleep catches up to me. So—but yeah. And it was actually—another surprising thing happened. I went to the—because my—because Jeremy, he was best man for his friend's wedding and his ex-girlfriend was invited. So I went to the hair salon and that's why -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, that's why I wanted to have my hair looking nice. I've never met his ex-girlfriend. I've read—I don't know if I've told you, but I found her online diary and I had read all of her diary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:02:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe about -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does Jeremy know that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. He actually—it was when we first started dating and I saw the—the blogs on his history. And so you know, of course, while he was like brushing his teeth, I checked it out. And I thought, "Oh!" (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I never—I had never like—I sort of realized that if I know a person—like I don't really snoop on my friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like—you know, I don't even really look at their Facebook profiles unless -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they have a nice picture or something. But when I don't know the story, when I am curious—I didn't know who broke up with who, I didn't know what she was like, how I compared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether you—you know, just—I wanted some sort of comparison when I didn't have my own sort of experience with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —him and he seemed like wavering. So anyway, I did decide to read it -throughout her whole entire journal. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:03:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, I still feel a little creepy for doing that but you know it did—it did—it did provide some sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —relief at the time when I did read it and now she doesn't write in it anymore. Rarely she does, like once—once—once every six months, so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's nothing. But—so I was really nervous, but she actually—she wound up not going to the wedding. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She flaked. and it was interesting, because like she had talked to Jeremy about like—like she was like, "Oh, you know, who am I going to talk to at the wedding? And who am I going to hang out with?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, Jeremy was like, "You can hang out with me—with me and Janet." And it's just—it's funny because she actually—because I was ready for a showdown, and—not like a mean thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how girls do that. I don't know. It wound up she didn't even come. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like she's a threat to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) not a threat. I just feel like sometimes it feels good to have a comparison, to be better than someone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I mean, I wouldn't really say like—I mean, in one sense like she did—like when Jeremy and I were dating for a year, she had mailed him a birthday present of this gourmet maple syrup. I got really pissed off about that. I mean, I don't know. I shouldn't be. I mean, they were friends. But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —she's kind of—well, I'm—her and Jeremy were together for years. And now, like, you know, he's reassured -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, I really—she's not really a threat now, but she's more like a curiosity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean, it's sort of like what—sometimes people watch reality shows and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —slightly it's to feel better about yourself, you know, in a sense. And yeah, I guess maybe I do—maybe there is some sort of jealousy because I know that her and Jeremy had—yeah -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a history.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —yeah, they do have a history and a connection, and like I don't fear like—I know Jeremy is totally—actually I found out via later just asking him—like he said it was a mutual breakup -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but then when I—when he was referring to it, he said he broke up with Lori. So I realized that, you know, he does not have romantic feelings. But it's more or less sometimes I feel like she would—like if unleashed upon Jeremy, she would attack. But, you know, I mean, she's—she's had dinners with Jeremy before -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —post-breakup and coincidentally, I was not there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:06:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was actually in Florida, so that's when she always decides to show up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know. Sometimes I do compare myself to Christina and like—because that's like Jeremy's sister-in-law. I guess, because—yeah, I guess maybe I do feel threatened. I mean, I do kind of slightly feel like threatened of Christina like—you know, maybe I—and it was really interesting, because like I feel the same sort of threatened like when the ballet girls come into -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so in the dance system, they separated us into intermediate group and an advanced group. And before it was just—they were like, "Come to whatever class you feel, you know, qualified for."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this year they decided to have this sort of strong division, and I got placed in intermediate, and I was upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then—you know, when asked what was the reason is because they want—some of the advanced girls complained that they were being slowed down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now the advanced girls come to the intermediate class because they have guest teachers -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —from the Local Ballet. And I just get really upset, because it's like—you know, in one sense, like I do have better technique than them, and in another sense, they're in a higher level than me, so it makes me angry that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, I actually like that they're in the class, because it raises the level of the intermediate. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:07:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because often the intermediate is too slow for me. I guess the advanced, you know, would be a challenge in terms of sometimes I just don't think that quickly. But you know, in terms of—and you know, I guess—I just feel every time like they come into class is when I go, "Cachoo, cachoo," like, you know, not punch them, but maybe do a battement onto them (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or just not look where I'm battementing or kicking. You know, and I—I just—I get so angry, and I talk to my mom about it. And she's like, "Well, why don't you talk to the teacher, you know, on what you need to work on to advance?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, and I explained that there are more modern dance—they're more into modern dance, cleaner lines rather than the classical little, you know, wrist flicks -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and my mom's like, "You know, you're just going to have to watch that, every time you want to do a little classical sort of flare thing."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:08:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Well, no, I like that." I was like, "That's what I like about dance. That's my favorite part is to be delicate and"—you know, I (pause) you know, and another thing is that the advanced ballet class is all the way on the other side of town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's like a whole like mile away from the subway station, and you know, I—that's quite a voyage as opposed to the intermediate class is right at—right across from the center. So I mean, there's a lot of—but I am—want to be like placed—I want them to say like, "I'm sorry for being unfair, I'm sorry for giving the school ballet girls this double standard that they can" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, they get to take as many classes as they want and intermediates can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, sure I could take a beginning, yeah, but, the advanced girls could also take a beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that's the—it's like I feel like they're taking -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the distinction between the School ballet girls or that you can take at your level and below?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's most of the advanced girls are in the School Ballet Company. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the girls that aren't in the School Ballet Company that are in advanced just take advanced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing is, is that you can, of course, always take below you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I could take beginning and the girls that are in advanced could take any sort of—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —could take any class they want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and I do feel blessed that—you know, there's—like I live 10 minutes—10 minutes from a serious—or a 10 minute walk from a serious ballet school, which I go to once or twice a week. And you know, they're really nice there and I really like—like they're really like fair. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess maybe that's why—what I don't like is this unfairness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What feels unfair about it? That they can come in and take intermediate class or that you got placed where you don't feel like you belong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both (laughs). I—yeah that I—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I gave these both (inaudible) -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. Both of them. No, I think that's the—yeah, yeah. Well, the fact—yeah. The fact that I got placed where I was based upon what their—their audition was and I guess maybe what they were looking for. And I guess, you know, I—the previous intermediate teacher told me I should try the advanced and I guess, you know, they didn't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I've never known these teachers before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:11:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—but yeah, both of those seemed unfair. And like I just get very angry at the end of dance class when—there's one girl in the Tuesday intermediate class. I don't know if she's—like she's pretty good. She's also very good. And I don't know if she's just an intermediate, or if she's an intermediate advanced, or like she's also in the advanced class. And then I just get very angry because I think that she's in the advanced -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I think that's not fair because I think that I'm as good as her, and then it's like I don't know like—you know, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you missing by not being in the advanced classes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for one thing, the advanced classes, they do a little bit more complicated steps. And second, this sort of air of superiority. I mean, sometimes it does get boring working on very basic steps -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and like I'd like to do more complicated steps, like when I go over to the other Ballet, we work on—like, I mean, it's a—it's an enthusiastic group of adults of, you know, of even broader levels, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —then is at School, and you know, like everyone—there's some advanced steps, there's some easy steps, and it's just sort of a good combination of like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, maybe you won't be able to do everything, but at least you can try it, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:12:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I sort of felt like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't feel like you're being challenged?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't feel like—and I guess because when I was a youngster, I was kind of ignored in dance because I had low arches, and I guess if you have like—if you have low arches, then you have to compensate with flexibility or you have to compensate with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —your parents donating money. But both of those things are not things that I had. I had little jumps, and I guess I did have sort of—later I developed like personality—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and like stage presence, but you know, I guess I just get so—I guess it's sort of like an old wound that, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —this sort of unfairness because you're not anatomically -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sort of what we like. I mean maybe people feel that now when I'm in the intermediate and a lot of the, you know, male guest speakers—or the guest teachers are like, "Oh, you have very good legs, very" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, I guess that—you know, I can understand that maybe other people are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —thinking, "What's with that girl?" So I can understand that, but I guess I feel like—I mean, I'm seriously like this is the first time in a long time that I've really, honestly worked in ballet and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so I think that I'm really improving and it—it just—it's—and I know that if I wasn't placed in a sort of—I—I think it's unfair -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sort of situation, then maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:14:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or gone and delved so deeply into dance. Nevertheless, it still puts me in a sour mood whenever I walk into that class with the teacher that said that I didn't belong in advanced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—and I remember at the audition I asked, "Now what—what—what do I need to work on?" And they were like well—just this sort of vague answer. But my mom said, "Why don't you ask your teacher?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I guess I—she was like, "Well, you can't do it and then start—break down in tears," and I'm afraid that that would happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it is something that's very—I—I—I don't know. I just get very upset about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does the placement mean to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I was really like—I felt like, you know, you're not good enough. And especially because like, you know, I—I'm put into class with people that have taken dance for maybe not as long. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:15:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or haven't been—stayed current with it or maybe have just taken three years of beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I—it's like, well, I—I thought I was better than—than that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's why I just feel sort of like insulted or I mean—well, I guess it's the common problem of like you think you're better—like it—it—it's sort of like—I mean, there's—there's two set of thoughts. Like, there's the possibility that they don't think you're good as you are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or you think you're better than you actually are. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So both are equally sort of upsetting (laughs). And I would prefer the former rather than the latter, and I would—you know, I would -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so subjective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is very subjective.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I would imagine there was a range in each class, too, so—I mean, like the most advanced student in the intermediate and the least advanced student in the intermediate is probably—there's probably a bigger—bigger range there than between some of the people in intermediate and advanced, or beginning and advanced. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or people that are right on the edges.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's really hard to know what exactly the conversation was when placing people, how blurred those lines are. [00:16:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think—yeah, I mean—yeah, in terms of like the advanced, some of their advanced girls have like been in Local Ballet, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I mean, you know, it's—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a pretty high tier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a high tier. And—but you know, I said—I always talk to Jeremy about this, and he's like, "Well, you're going to be in dance, you know, for the rest of your life, so you can, you know, enjoy it for what it is." I guess, you know—but I realize that dance—it's—it's a little different than like say piano than -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, your bones and your muscles are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, I look at the young girls and I'm like, "Wow, they're just bouncing so high and they're just so bendy."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like a cripple. Not like a cripple, but just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There—there—there's—there is a time limit in nature of it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can be involved in some way for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not in this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I already can't go on point because of my bike accident which is continually causing—you know, sort of kind of pain during dance. I sort of feel like it's kind of just like a creaky joint—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that just sort of is an artifact of a bike accident.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:17:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, I can never wear those special pointe shoes anymore and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a factor in the placement?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so, because, no, I was just on flat shoe. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I wanted to do the ballet company, it would.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—but yeah. Yeah, I—I mean—I think—yeah, I just think that—yeah, I was in—there's just—maybe I don't know what they're looking for and I think that maybe if I talked to them. But like I said, because the classes are so far away -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't even know if you really want to be in -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I just want -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want the option.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. And so I don't know whether to leave like a feedback thing, because I realize that—because they always ask for feedback at the end of the semester. And I mean, I can say that the auditions were kind of embarrassing because, like, in terms of like—they didn't really have us wear numbers and like during the middle of the audition, someone walked up to me and talked to me, and it was like, "Oh, you know, what's your name?" And so I thought they wanted my name to consider for say the advanced -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —class, not to like knock me off of the advanced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sort of tier. And I think I got really embarrassed because I was like, you know, whenever you get called out and it's not for a good reason, it's always like, people know, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess I could have told—could have had an idea, but I mean, I guess I just feel embarrassed and like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I get mad at those girls because also they're very cliquey. I mean, it—you know, when I was at the auditions, it really felt like high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of like all the girls, they were talking and it—I mean, it was just like—felt like the—you're it or you're not it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or—I was just like well—I mean, they just have such an air of—but then maybe I do. And then I start worrying about maybe I'm a phony. I mean, when class normally starts I'm—I'm normally sweating and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I start forgetting -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but—but yeah, that's sort of been like a big sort of thing. And—but one thing I like is that Jeremy and I have really sort of made amends on sort of our expectations, because I was trying to be like home all the time to cook dinner, and like—you know, like I would feel like he was getting cold and didn't appreciate because—that I went to dance or like—you know, and I was—I really felt like there was some animosity between him because he—like, I wasn't home to cook dinner -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or like because I was at dance -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or I was, you know, doing homework. And I think now he actually really appreciates the nights alone. [00:20:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you talk about your expectations? Or is it just—seem to settle into a pattern? What's—how did it change?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just sort of settled—well, I mean I—I told him that—I was like, "Oh, you should check—check—you know, check in with your friends, and you know, I—I want to make sure that you're"—because I sort of saw that—I mean, we were getting in sort of all these fights maybe—not all the fights, but kind of tiffs and angered moments about politics -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and it sort of dawned upon me that, you know, I'm not the best person to talk about politics because I'm still trying to sort it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't like talking about it because it's very emotional issue for me. But I'm sure Jeremy's friends have lots to say about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like, you know, he probably—because Jeremy just sort—you know, would just sort of wait at home, and maybe felt lonely or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, and like he wasn't getting loved or attention, and so then, I just sort of—I brought it to his attention—you know, I told him that, I was like, you know, "You should really start seeing your friends because I think that will help you—you know, you'll feel a lot more nourished in life and it will give us"—because I also noticed that I was getting frustrated, like we were just spending all this time together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like we wouldn't have anything to talk about -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because like we would have 30 minutes of breakfast together, then we would come home and have like a whole hour dinner, and then just spend all night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:22:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I—I really enjoy having dinner with him, and, you know, spending time with him, but I just realized like, you know, like—it's just like—I couldn't deal all the time with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it—were you spending a lot more time together living together than you had -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —than when you were staying at his place a lot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because normally I would come like two nights a week and then for the weekend, which is sort of like what we do now -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because like—actually, it was really fun last night because he took me to dance and then he met his friends for a wine and cheese event, and then he joined me back later for sushi. And it was like a really good time because he got to talk -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, he got to go do his thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You went and did your thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was like—and—and—and now he's like craving—like he's like, "Can you do it—can you make sure that we go to the Square once—once a week?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "I really want to make this possible" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because—because he really likes the place. And, you know, I think it's a good time for him now to have one-on-one time with his friends. Like they talked a lot about politics.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm so glad I wasn't there. And you know, I'm like—yeah, I was like really—you know, I really like how it's going and I think that—I mean, I'm starting to get used to going to dance, whether I like it or not in the beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I—I think if I were just left to my natural state I'd be a couch potato. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:23:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do like after I do dance, I always do feel better. You know, so I've started to get into where -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many classes are you taking a week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I did three classes this week. I do between two and three. And I like three and I want to try four. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to—I don't know. I don't think I will—next week I probably won't be able to do four because my class is in the Square on Tuesday, and that's when Hurricane Sandy comes, and I don't want to take the bus on—amongst all of the rain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends if it even comes, but—I wanted to try four just, you know, because there is a class on Sunday -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I already did Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, so—I mean, just to try it out to see like if my body can handle it or schedule-wise. But you know, sit is nice to exercise and how that sort of—being really enthusiastic about something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —other than school. And actually my research—I've been working on my presentation and it's for a new sort of project and it's actually—I found myself like reading over 100 pages. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like over -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of material. [00:24:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know it is. And it's like—and you know, by doing this presentation, I'm like—I mean, I'm going very pokey at it. I don't know why I—I go so pokey, but I guess it's because like any time you put something up on a screen, like, you know, or on a presentation, you're—they're sort of like—for every sentence on a presentation, there's like a whole sort of page of depth you have to know about that, you know, and it's—you know, so there's a little bit of that. But you know, I mean, it's actually really interesting, and I actually found that I like to have—instead of sort of doing blind theory, not knowing what it's even for, I like having a project that is actually physically motivated, like by experiment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's really fun to show pictures and like say, "This is what was found, for reals (laughs). It's actually possible."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but I was having some, you know doubts about whether I'd finish. You know, I don't know whose deadline it is for me to finish in a year. It seemed like a lot—like, I want to finish in a year, and I think the sooner the better. But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whose deadline is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was my mom's deadline. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I talked to Jeremy about it, and he's like, "You know, I'm fine with it." But then I also—then I got upset because after we went to the wedding and then like it was a seven-hour car ride home, and so like I—I didn't really feel like doing my work, I didn't really feel like crocheting. So I was looking at my phone, and I was looking at wedding sites.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Oh, Jeremy, look at this one. Oh, well this one looks nice." And he's like, "Well, don't worry about it. We have a long time to think about it." And I was like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your gut reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like long time? I thought there was a year deadline for things (laughs). And then I just sort of forgot about it because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is a long time worthy to you? Do—do you know what he meant by that, or does it—does it feel like a long way away for him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it seems like a long, long way—I don't know, we never talked about it. He just said, "Well, you know, you'll have lots of—you know, you'll have lots of time to think about that later. You should finish" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, focus on the task you have at hand. And I was just like crump, crump, crump, crump.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like you get angry when I do my school work -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —and become anti-social. Actually—but, you know, I think he's actually he's even chilled out about that, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think for me doing work—like last night, I had—I had stayed at home pretty much all day, because I was like I would justify, "Ok, it's a lot easier to take a nap." [00:27:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I know that I'm not supposed to be napping so I should go into my office, but, you know, I was just doing my work in the kitchen. And he was sitting there looking at cast iron pans at the island, too. You know, it was going to—I was like, "Oh, this is nice. I can do my work, and like there's—I like my—my co-worker." I referred to him as my co-worker, and he convinced me that—somehow he involved politics with my molecules (laughs). He said that classical mechanics was the party of no versus quantum mechanics, which would let anything happen. And I actually thought that was funny (laughs). It's funny I—because like—actually, I got mad at him when he was telling his friends that I was going to re—vote for either Romney or Johnson. I mean, I probably am going to vote for Gary Johnson because I like to support the little guys. And you know, I read what Gary Johnson's about and you know I like some of his ideas, or I feel like—well, in one sense it's—it's kind of like, well, I really don't feel a strong affinity for either of the candidates and Gary Johnson seems like—well, I like his ideas. I don't know if they're so practical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:28:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would like to get just—at least show some support. But like anyway—like his friends that are very—I like—I like them. And I normally just listen to their politics. But I like to remain politically anonymous to everyone so that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I don't want anyone to challenge my views because my views—I'm still like—you know, I haven't even—I mean, you know if—if someone would ask me, "Oh, why do you believe in the free market?" Well, I could say, "Well, if (inaudible), it makes sense, so"—you know, just the sort of—it seems to be the most fair to me. But it's not based on like in 1992 this happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in Sweden they don't have an absolutely free market and their economy is this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:29:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's not really based on facts, it's based on theories and sort of personal sort of—what I believe in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that less legitimate somehow than if you had a list of facts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, a lot of—a lot of people would say so, because it's more sort of like a religion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, like if someone asked me to like battle with them about religion, I wouldn't want to have that conversation either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Plenty of people vote on those lines. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes the lines that you want to vote on less legitimate than the lines that his friends want to vote on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if they're legitimate or not, but I know that if they wanted to engage me in a debate -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, like I just—you know, I—I wouldn't have anything to really say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I could listen to what they had to tell me, but it's just like I—I would just feel uncomfortable in sort of a discussion that wasn't like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, I was like someone—if I asked them about like (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you know, I started to say, "What do you think about, you know, localized—the theory of localization? And do you think there's any room for any research sort of in there?" I mean, if I asked them and started grilling them about physics and about entanglement, and you know, it—you know, it—I just wouldn't do that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because I would feel uncomfortable -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —speaking actually more like I was lecturing. And I—I just feel like a lot of times people—I mean, I guess people like to preach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:31:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Preach what they believe in, and—and I think that's great for people that want to listen or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Signed up to go to the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —the sermon. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yes, I know. But I don't always want to sign up and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you—is it that you feel like he's kind of signed you up by expressing -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —your view, and you don't feel like you can say, "Yeah, that's my view, but I'd rather not talk about it?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's the thing, is that I don't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I don't want to be—like I guess, you know, like I've been combated before about like Christianity being in physics -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, like, "Why do you believe in God?" Well, I just do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know—and did you know this, did you know that? And I was like just by me saying I believe in God, I'm instantly called—well, you're going to be—or well, maybe I dig myself into it because—or trend—I dig myself into some—I used to, at least. I don't use—some of these battles, "Oh, there's Christians, they're so like hypocritical, and blah, blah, blah." And you know I—I feel personally offended.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm not so much surrounded by people like that, but I used to be like, when I was an undergrad, a lot of the older graduate students would laugh about, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —what Christians thought. And I didn't think it was very nice. I mean, you know, maybe those Christians that are very—you were (inaudible) vocal aren't being very nice either. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:32:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, it's—it's like, "Well, I'm not like that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, the same with like politics, if someone—people often generalize—I know my mom and dad generalize about the left, that you know, they're just free, free looters and they're not working very hard and they just want to take away your money, and you know, they're just bleeding hearts. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, they're just all different sorts of people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So it sounds like—it comes back to that central theme that we've hit upon before of whether or not you feel like you have the right to—to sort of stake your claim and be able to assert your voice, even if what asserting your voice means at that time is giving yourself permission or taking permission to not talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not feel like you have to answer questions just because they're posed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to defend your choice just because someone's asked you to. In this case, using your voice gives kind of—asserting what you feel like are safe boundaries for the conversation might mean setting a boundary that says, "I'm not sharing that with you."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. [00:33:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not all asked questions need to be answered. You—you have the right to say no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not going to talk about this. And it sounds like you don't—it's hard for you to take that and if you don't—if nobody had sort of outed you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —maybe nobody asked, but since Jeremy sort of shared some information about what you might do, or who you were thinking about voting for, now you feel—you don't have to—you're entitled to your vote just like anyone else is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And people vote for lots of different reasons. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes it's—a lot of people vote based entirely on their felt morals. Those are just beliefs that you have -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and you don't know why you have them. Sometimes it's gut instinct. Some people vote based on the economy, and some people vote based on religious view. I mean, it—there's no—there's no essay part that says, "Why are you voting the way you're voting?" [00:34:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). Yeah, that is true. Yeah, I guess I just need to get better at saying that, "You know, that's an interesting view, but I just don't feel like debating it." It's just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. That's a—that's a beautiful way to respond.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're not—you know, two things are important to you. One, it sounds like being respectful of other people's views, even if they're not being respectful of yours. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's—and that response just does that for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thing, it sounds like it's important to not—not giving a lot of room to be, you know, questioned, interviewed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I always, yeah, I just—you know, I'm not a very good—I don't really think quickly on my feet, so that's another thing, like—and so then like I'll say something stupid and then I just feel like even more ridiculous and embarrassed and enflared that they engaged me and—I guess maybe the best sort of thing would be just me saying, you know, "I just don't feel like talking about this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:36:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's interesting, because I think that sort of hits me—I think a lot of times like I try and be nice -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, by a lot of times giving people not a freedom, but sometimes I just need to learn how to—I guess, I wouldn't say so much stick up for myself, but just sort of set boundaries. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think setting boundaries is a big piece of allowing you to feel comfortable -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —in—in social situations like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I also see that with my family. Normally, I really didn't set any boundaries -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I just let people—you know, either take advantage of me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or just own me, or like—and you know, my sister asked me, well, why did I do it? And I think, well, because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I just—it sort of makes sense to me to just always try and love your family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and it seems like—from what you've shared about your family, that it was a particularly hard environment to try and set up strong boundaries. You weren't encouraged -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —to have a—a boundary. And it also seems like when—times when boundaries have been set, they have felt like not loving boundaries, when your parents basically excommunicated you for a boyfriend choice. It's a really—it's a strong boundary -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —but it's also not a very—it didn't feel loving to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. [00:37:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And boundaries don't have to feel that way. It doesn't need to be an angry separation, but that's what it has been.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's either been no boundary and that feels—you know, that feels loving and supportive, even if sometimes not good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or it's been such a harsh separation, a cut-off, really -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —that it doesn't feel—it didn't necessarily feel safe for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What the rules really were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's very true. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Having some experience with a boundary doesn't necessarily feel like a disconnect, but rather, you know, some—some sort of limits -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and not such a—not such a strong wall.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess the iron curtain is a lot worse than -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —a lot worse than an actual curtain (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, no, I think that's the—I mean, I guess that's the thing is like boundaries can often seem limiting to me, but then I sort of realize that I sort of need to set up my own boundaries.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sometimes limits are very—a lot of times when people talk about boundaries, they think about cells as an image. [00:38:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how some cells have those semi-permanent—semi-permeable membranes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some stuff gets through and sometimes stuff -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For you, that might be a good image or sort of metaphor -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —about the boundaries, because it's not that nothing can get through, it's not that love can't be felt through the boundary. But it just means that some things are off limits and they're not good for the cell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or there's—the cell can only take on so much salt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then—there's a word for that right? So then that might help you to sort of think about how to make it some stuff does flow, but it doesn't mean it's all or nothing -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —getting through or being left out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that is actually a good way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's probably the extent of my hard science.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). No, that's actually probably the extent of my—my biology (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I always have avoided biology. It's too much memorization. But yeah, I guess, yeah, I think that is something that I do need to—you know, I think that as a parent, which—you know, with my sort of teaching experience in the past, it was I didn't really set up a solid boundary. [00:39:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I—because I wanted to be that teacher that was always there for them -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I mean, I guess boundaries are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It kind of felt resentful sometimes when they took advantage of you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —always there. No matter where or when or how long you had to wait.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's hard to—it—you know, it seems like—you know, it's interesting, you know, because one of the instructors for the summer school when I was tutoring, I would be like, "Oh, can I see the answers so that I can help instruct a student better?" And he's like, "No, that would be unfair."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Well, what a—I was like I wasn't trying to be unfair." I got—I was just thinking this to myself, and then—I realized, you know, he has to be sort of a hard ass because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, if he was unfair it would be like—it would get all over and then, you know, that would be—it was just—that was his boundary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's very good at up-keeping his boundaries. [00:40:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lesson to be learned (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't we stop there. You can keep that in mind in the coming week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we are meeting again next week, same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[00:00:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was supposed to be out of town, but I didn't get out of town, so. Too many things preventing us from getting out, you know, right away so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like too many things you had to do here? Or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, nothing important, just things you know. So, we're hoping to go probably in two weeks, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know if it was delayed, like you were going to go, just not...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, oh gosh. (sigh) Um, I think I've probably told you this, but my in general, not that I especially have a whole lot of energy, but my energy is way down. Like, I'm having a really hard time, (pause) having the energy to do much of anything lately. And, it's getting to be kind of sad because it's like, you know, it's driving my spouse crazy cuz it's like, part of it's energy, part of it's pain. Sometimes I need him to drive me in the morning into work. It's been more often than not, I've been needing him to drive me in, which is expensive and a pain for him. But you know, it's just like I come home and I pretty much get into bed and I, unless I have to go to the bathroom, I don't get out of bed. [00:01:23]</p>

<p>Like I do, ev, ev, I have everything brought to me or I bring it to bed with me, while I stay there and I camp out for most of the day you know? I sleep and you know, get things done from there, that's about it you know, and I just, I don't know how much it is physical, how much it is emotional, I don't know what you know? It's just really frustrating. [ 00:01:45]</p>

<p>It just, (pause) I do measure myself against other people that I know, and I know that's wrong you know, but, it's, it's one of those things where you know, when I have people in my social circle who get four or five hours of sleep a night, and they're pretty ok, it's really frustrating cuz it's like, "Yep, uh, ten is not quite enough". I really would like longer than that, so, which is abnormal. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And totally unfair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So... that's kind of (pause), it's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Especially when people are like, "Oh, so what do you do with all your free time like, when you're not working". And I'm like, "I sleep".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, sometimes I even get the laundry done, you know? And they're like are you cooking? And it's like, no. I haven't really cooked anything in a long time. I mean yeah, I occasionally microwave things but, no. It's really like, and, I'm just getting so frustrated cuz I'm just (pause) I know there isn't a good answer to it, it just it is what it is, you know? And, (long pause) I feel like there really isn't really a good way to, to get past it you know? [00:03:18]</p>

<p>I, I'm, I am one of those people that are completely, my body is com, not completely, very immune to stimulants. Like, I can take a couple of No Dose, and then go take a nap. Even as a child I had friends that weren't allowed to eat coffee ice cream because it would get them over stimulated as children. I've, no amount of caffeine does anything one way or the other. Like if I don't eat, if I don't drink anything that's caffeinated, I don't get like a caffeine hangover, that kind of thing, so. [00:03:50]</p>

<p>Um, you know I've played around with B supplements, unfortunately like, being, when you have (inaudible at 00:03:59), your body it's an autoimmune disease where your body killed the part of your (inaudible at 00:04:03) B12, so all of it comes injectable to me now. And so, um, I don't, I'm starting to suspect though I don't really have any good way to determine that maybe I'm not absorbing other things that I'm eating too. But there isn't, without sounding like a crazy person, and it's really hard to really do that, so. I mean, they give you blood tests, but it's a little bit different than your absorption rates or that kind of stuff, or what's going on. So. [00:04:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, your doctor getting a good picture of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I don't want to hear about how my blood pressure has all the sudden gone up and I don't want to hear about how I need to lose fifty pounds again. I've already heard it twice and it makes me not want to go back. So, I, I, I'm, I'm very well aware of this fact. You know? [00:04:52]</p>

<p>And so, I... am sort of in this weird like, limbo of like, just being like, exhausted and annoyed and, just kind of sick of the world you know? (pause) And, not really sure what to do about it, you know?</p>

<p>[00:05:18 ] (pause) [00:05:35]</p>

<p>I know a good bit of it is just that I can't do anything about it, I just have to accept it. But, you know, it's really hard because I feel like my life is just passing me by awfully fast. You spend a certain amount of your, your, your time asleep or just even your waking time being very, um, not just unproductive, but also like you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not very functional?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very functional. It really, really makes you feel like crap you know? So.</p>

<p>[00:06:04] (pause) [00:06:16]</p>

<p>But, in other good news, and this is stupid. I hate, I hate the fact that whenever I do something and I procrastinate, I get rewarded for it. I hate that. Um, in the past in grad school especially, whenever I had to write certain, I did a lot of studies along with researching and science, um, along with it, just because Brown has a partnership with the Princeton, who beat out Dartmouth for the number one spot for research. History and research for them, but they're number one, they're actually, of all the, I mean not that Princeton is not good for anything, but this is one of the things they're really good for. So, I was able to take grad school level classes there, um, without having a philosophy background or whatever. But, I have a lot of science and so I took some classes there, and I also took, in general took like, there is different um, you know, (inaudible at 00:07:13) is behind artificial intelligence at Brown. So, I had wrote a lot of papers about this and what the idea of knowing and things like that, and the problem that I had was, I put them off to the last minute and I did them in the middle of the night, and I'd be sleepy and so I'd have this wonderful (pause) I don't know how to explain this. The, the type of writing that I had was very lofty, very withdrawn, academic. And, they, I, would always love them. [00:07:40] you know? It was very, it was, almost like you're reading Olivia or something like that. It was very dramatic and every, every professor loved it. I would do much better on papers that I did in the middle of the night, last minute because I'd panic.</p>

<p>Well, anyways, as for today. We're supposed to be doing a lot of video training, um, for the past six weeks. I think I told you I was afraid because I don't have a video camera etc. So, um, I ended up taking a lot of um, so yesterday was supposed to be the day that we were supposed to air the stuff that we did. Still don't have a video camera. However, I do have a tremendous amount of time lapse photography. Um, and so I made some video of that. Um, no, six weeks of work. Everybody is supposed to be working really hard on this. I did in less than two and I was considered, not just by myself, but other people to be one of the greatest ones of the group. [00:08:45]</p>

<p>People who do this for a living. People do this for a living, they're like, "Wow, you have an amazing eye, look at this timing, this and that". I'm just thinking to myself, "Why is this happening?" Why am I being rewarded for this last minute stuff? You know? I mean there's a difference between walking away from a problem because you're not paying attention to it and you get that insight? That's different than like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Putting it off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Putting it off. I was doing it at four in the morning yesterday, you know, throwing something together, um, that even though it was shorter than most peoples, everybody thought, "Wow it was so", you know, there was no voiceover, there was nothing just, it was basically you know, things related to that, you know, and it just got me really frustrated. Cuz I'm like, "Wait a second". I was really thinking that I was going to come in last but, not really last but... [00:09:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, managers were talking about it, they were like, "Oh my God, it was amazing", and this and that, and I don't like the fact that I'm being rewarded for this lackadaisical behavior. But at the same time I really didn't have anything so it's like, it was an insight at like the middle of the night and then getting back up at like four or five in the morning to get it done so I could be there by seven a.m. to show them this. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>I feel like, angry and guilty at the same time? I don't think it's that I'm especially genius like when I put things off to the last minute, but I don't really get it. You know? I don't really get why I'm being rewarded for it, and I don't like the fact that because I'm being rewarded for it, it some... Now in this situation not as much, but putting things off to the last minute then, becomes a lot more attractive?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because you know, you know, I think I get you know, mediocre work for something that I put real work into it, but if I come with something last minute for some reason it's considered genius you know? I don't really get it, and I'm kind of frustrated and angry at myself and at others. Why can't I you know, I don't know why it is that I can't come up with this short, sweet, poignant, genius, maybe a couple weeks ahead of time? Or, is it the fact that I would be overworking something by over thinking it? The Photoshop effect of the longer you spend in Photoshop the less it looks like a human being? It's totally true. [00:11:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Cuz you spend, and one more thing, and one more thing and then you lose all perspective and next thing you know, people don't actually have pores and although you don't think about it, it looks very strange. So, it's really, it's kind of, a lot of things like I said that are just really... (pause) [00:11:36]</p>

<p>I know these are supposed to be flukes that happen sometimes, but why do they happen a lot with me? You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And should I let it? I mean should I be upset by the fact that wow, you know, I shouldn't be putting things off to the last minute?</p>

<p>[00:11:53 ] (pause) [00:12:03]</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>[00:12:05 ] (clears throat and pause) [00:12:21]</p>

<p>Like it's, sort of a, I'm the only person in the world probably that does something really well and beats herself up over it. Because, I shouldn't have done that well on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess part of what you're frustrated with is your work ethic and it not being appropriately rewarded sort of punished?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also just like, not even just work ethic because some of it is work, but even like work ethic for that makes sense like in terms of calculations and like that. But it seems like it's also like, the fear of something, strikes genius. I'm not very good at being creative on my own. If you stick me in a situation, say, "Hey what would you like to do for this or that?" I usually get completely frozen. But, not frozen, I mean I'm not as good as people think I would be at coming up with things on the spot that are super creative. [00:13:22]</p>

<p>Like, at one meeting they had, they wanted us to make a collage of things that embody us as a team with a bunch of magazines. I'm like really? Ok, I don't really feel this. Everyone else was really getting into it and I'm like, give me like a couple of days to think about this and maybe. So, I'm more of a time delay person, but this kind of stuff of being in the middle of the night fear for some reason really does, for some reason work. And I don't like that you know? [00:13:53]</p>

<p>It's not good for my body, it's not good for my mentality, I get very upset about the whole thing, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's not the way you should be working? Or other things too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I stay up late, the fact that I'm like, "Oh my God, oh my God am I gonna get this done?" I mean you cannot put things off to the last minute, what if you fail and screw up you know? How am I gonna predict that I'm going to do six weeks worth of work in two hours? It was only two hours because I had to spend a lot of time like, getting things that were not supposed to work to work properly you know? It's not supposed to be that way. [00:14:32]</p>

<p>Video editing, to get three minutes worth of good video is usually about forty man hours. Like, really. And, (exhale), I don't know. I can't rely on it. I'm not just angry at myself about the work ethic. I can't rely on myself to do that. [00:14:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, if I put together what you're upset about, lying around and working in this way and how you're talking about it I sort of think of you as being like and researcher trapped in a radically bohemian lifestyle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's weird. Because, I do, I mean I am around a lot of radically bohemian people you know? And so, I guess I have to really sometimes be able to do weird things like that. I think I have to be put under the gun to do something, but I don't know. And on top of it I was a little bit uncomfortable because I could, I mean I like being praised, I really like being praised but I felt like this is one of those things that you know, this is not what I should be praised about you know? [00:15:52]</p>

<p>I mean I could hear like around the corner, one of the managers talking to the other one, it's like, "And then, and then there was the tunnel and there's the tunnel and all the sudden you can see the city lit up at night, it was amazing". And I was, didn't want to like butt in and be like, "It's not that amazing, it involves like patience and a tripod", but, you know? [00:16:12]</p>

<p>And it's not like I was comparing myself to other people's works in terms of like, "Oh it was inferior to that". It was, everything everyone did because it was supposed to be something that you found meaningful, it was very open ended? It wasn't like, oh yeah, (inaudible at 00:16:28) It really just felt, I don't know; felt weird. [00:16:34 ]</p>

<p>You know, I've always felt like I've, you know, been different, but it doesn't bother me all that much. It's ok to be different, that's who I am you know? But, I guess the thing is that I'm concerned that because I do this well, and this kind of being under the gun does create really fantastic things, that if I do this, if I, one of these days I'm going to get myself into trouble doing it. Does that make sense? [00:17:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I understand what you mean. Um, I'm not so sure it's necessarily true, but maybe you're not quite who you thought in this way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah maybe. I mean part of it is sleep deprived. Being sleep deprived does tend to, like I said I tend to have these amazingly lofty like tones in what I write and um, you know, that kind of thing. Or you know, I guess maybe, I don't know, it's very weird. [00:17:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, uh...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been told all my life that I am not an artist and that's ok. And I've been at peace with that. Just the other day I was telling a story about that to people that I'm working with because they're artists and they're really really worried you know, that they can't be researchers. I was teaching them to do something, basically teaching them how to keep a spreadsheet for their finances. And they're like is that ok? And I'm like "I'm a reseacher, I'm comfortable with numbers". And they're like oh wow and this and that, and it's like I've always felt really bad that I can't be a researcher and I said, "No, be a good artist so you can eventually keep a researcher employed". [00:18:28]</p>

<p>Because one of the most wonderful things I've ever had told to me was by my dad, is, um, at, I don't know if I've ever told this story yet. I was in um, I was in Europe, pretty darn young, I had to be seven, eight, nine, something like that. And I remember specifically because you're at one of the places that they had all the sculptures, that being very very disturbed by the fact that by that age, you know, during the classical period, people were already copying works of art. I mean at that age of seven, eight, nine you were already apprenticed, and you were already copying, like learning by copying the masters. This and that, and I couldn't draw a darn thing, I couldn't sculpt anything, I was miserable at the cello. I was not gifted at all, and I remember being pretty upset about this and talking with my dad about it, and he said basically that the world has plenty of artists and there were not nearly enough patrons. And he made a big deal about pointing out to me how, you know, that I can love art, but you know I could be a patron. And talking about the deMedici family and things like that. It felt so weird to say it in that way, but it was you know? And there are people who are very shrewd and understanding, like trained in finance but love the arts. [00:19:51]</p>

<p>Now, mind you we also later on had another conversation with the prince but that was later on in life. But I was perfectly ok with that. You know, I had no talent. And when I say this, I'm not defacing myself. I really don't, usually have talent so it's very off putting when I do something well you know? [00:20:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, maybe under conditions where you're sort of thinking or your associations are a little looser like when you haven't slept enough or you're under the pressure of a deadline, you're more creative than you thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it was also radically different that anybody else. Like, it, it, in it's own way it is very much me, because maybe I don't have film, but you know, taking a bunch, literally hundreds of thousands of still pictures that were taken over an evening and turning it into a movie is an engineering feat more than art, it just turned out to be beautiful. [00:21:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like you know, the opera house of like, the one that is in Sydney is beautiful but it's actually more of an engineering feat than it's beautiful. Shouldn't, it's very hard for it to be standing, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>So, um, but I just feel like maybe there's pressure to maybe do be able to do that again. It's like I don't know when that's going to happen. I've had total flukes of genius, but then people are like, "Oh well you're really good at this, why don't you do that again?"</p>

<p>I don't know how I did it. I have no, I have no insight into my process, I'm not a trained artist. I can teach people how to video edit like you wouldn't believe and if someone comes in and says, "Oh my audio isn't matching up with my video, why is this happening?" Or whatever, I can fix the problem, but I don't have the eye to fix what is usually aesthetic.</p>

<p>And, so, um, I guess that's part of the reason why because then there's the pressure of what am I going to do next time you know? So, it's always, it's hard for me, you know? [00:22:05]</p>

<p>Because they always think, once you do something really really amazing then they're like wow, what are they going to ask me to do next time you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen if you enjoyed this a little bit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I enjoyed it. But, I was more upset about the fact that I didn't, you know, that I could have done it better faster you know? (sigh) I like having things done beforehand. I try to be early for appointments. I try to have things, I like to pack, even if I can't pack the physical items before I go on vacation, I like to have a virtual list of exactly what I want to have. That way you know, whenever I can I can pack things. I like to be prepared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When things come together because of serendipity, and I don't understand why, I worry that I'm going to be asked to recreate that again and I don't know how, you know? So the process itself sometimes can be fun but it's really, I was more comfortable not having talent. [00:23:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, the expectations are lower.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well not just lower, but also just being like, "Ok, you know what, that is something that I just cannot do" You know? Um and that's, by doing, by setting it off like that, I'm not necessarily debasing the thing that it is, it just happens to be something that I wasn't gifted with you know? And that was ok, but if I did it once or twice, but most of the time failed, then that's to me harder to deal with you know? Having moderate success as opposed to being like, ok, well, you know. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>That and because well, then I have the pressure of I have to compose a piece of music in six weeks. And so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For my job, that's what they're doing is they're, they call it a press gang. The concept is that too many of us have decided that we are uncomfortable with certain pieces of software and so they wanted to make sure that everybody has a certain amount of bootcamp related skills that, so that everybody um, so that we have a baseline of something that everybody does as opposed to so many specialties. [00:24:41]</p>

<p>We've got a couple of people, we actually have somebody, one of the guys that I work with that's won an Emmy for his video editing. Um, you know, we've got a couple of people that are professional you know, in print that's what they do. We've got a couple of people who do, you know audio, but the problem is that at any given time we're not all there? And so, my boss, who I adore and I think this is wonderful that she's doing this; she's paying us every six weeks to accomplish something so that we can be able, at least be comfortable enough to wing it for a little bit, for an hour you know? And so,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:25:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup, and that was another great failure of mine too. You know? I work in a creative field, I'm called a creative, but I'm not very creative, not like that. Like, I'm not the bohemian; you know Toulouse kind of type you know? I, you know, I, I, enjoy Bach, I understand it mathematically, but that doesn't mean I can necessarily reproduce it you know? So, it's stressful. Because now I have got to produce something that is musical. You know? I, already had a lot of anxiety about being bad at playing the cello or bad at playing the piano you know? [00:26:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you worried about disappointing people, who might expect something from you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Maybe, part of it is the fact that you know, I'm just, I'm not always that good at these things you know? (pause) In this world they use two phrases a lot. Um, one of them is, um you know, basically there's a difference between quality and taste? There are things that could be made exceptionally well that have taste levels that are considered to be not so great? And then there are things that are um, and you know, the idea of being able to, not actually just taste but also um, the phrase often that is used is curate. Um, I'm good at curating, I can take things that are existing and make them into something else. I can evolve them into something else. I am not so good at the actual creation of something. You know, I can, and so it's something that I, it's something that I've been so bad at all of my life that I've had professionals in my life tell me, "Just don't bother", you know? And so, I have a little bit of anxiety about it you know? More than a little bit of anxiety about it. [00:27:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm confused cuz like on one hand you are saying you have high expectations for yourself, on the other hand...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I'm willing to hang out with creative types I have to let myself be open to being criticized. Part of the reason why I felt comfortable about not being good at things is because the fact that I understood that that was my limitation and that's ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when I've been around creative types, then I can get some pretty negative feedback about like, you know, you have no idea of perspective</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, like one was why you'd want to use something in a minor key, or do you know what I mean? I have to let myself...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to open yourself up to that, not being part of things with them. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, and um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It puts you at a kind of risk you weren't at before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, on top of it um, you know, I'm not necessarily ready for it you know? I come from a family of musicians, let me assure you I am not talented you know? [00:28:51]</p>

<p>It's kind of like I said it's very, and I've always felt confident about my choices you know? So. (pause) I mean by identity is in that I can see what I like and be able to say this is something that I find beautiful, this something that I really love, not necessarily that my identity isn't, I don't necessarily feel comfortable saying "Ok, I want to create this" you know? (pause) And it's kind of hard you know? [00:29:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is some of it also that you're used to being like very competent and very good at the things that you're trying to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should probably explain that a lot of it is the fact that I know that over the years, understanding now in hindsight was actually due to physical determents? The reason why I was very poor at cello, now we know is due to joint, I mean early onset juvenile arthritis. Not only do your hands hurt, anything like that happens, you're not practicing enough. Or when you don't have the kind of rhythm that you should be having, you don't practice enough. I spent a lot of time practicing and I never got it never. And so like, you know, you spend time with a professional and they're like, yet, you're, we've been together for two years and you're exactly at the same place you started? That's hard to hear you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're in a high school art class and the teacher offers to like get you into a study hall instead? That's hard to hear you know? [00:30:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course, absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, it wasn't like in a, you're worthless, it was just like the, this is a better you know, better use of your time. And it seems that I kind of you know, I'm getting it. I'm not very good at these things. And so, I guess it, the big thing for me is that, um, you know I have to, I'm not even sure if I could pull. I mean I have been doing things with video for awhile now so I understood that I could pull it off at the last minute. Music? Heck if I know, you know? If I'm going to be able to do this in six weeks. So, it's daunting. [00:31:35]</p>

<p>And I don't have to be the best at everything, I'm ok with coming in, at you know, at the gentleman's C across the board. I just don't want to suck at it, you know? At the very least I don't want to seem like I'm not making an effort, you know?</p>

<p>At the company we are very much pro, like creation, like oh you're supposed to be excited you're going to make your own music and this and that. What if you don't want to? What if you just want to buy somebody else's music. Well, maybe that makes me a sheep, you know what I mean? That's fine. I don't know. [00:32:26]</p>

<p>I made the joke about the fact that like, that like I'd be happy because we're supposed to rotate out who's taking what. Although I am going to be teaching composite graphic design, um, like doing like special effects for video um, I had originally made the joke that I was going to teach people how to IKEA hack, which is buy something perfectly normal from IKEA and turn it to something else, which is usually with paint and saws and things like that. And they're like, yeah really funny Debbie, but no. Like, yep, I can see a table and turn it into something else if you'd like, I can turn it into a sliding door. I may not be able to physically do it anymore, but I can tell people how to do it. But it's, it's hard you know? [00:33:07]</p>

<p>And I think that I have all the respect in the world for doing this for us? But I think it's stressing the hell out of me. You know, especially cuz I did so well the first one, now what am I supposed to do? (pause) I zoned out for six weeks while someone was talking and did my own thing, and did wonderfully. What am I going to do when that happens next time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it might suck?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might suck, and I also might zone out and not learn anything, again. So, I learned it, just differently than they were trying to teach it to me, you know? (pause) (inhale) I don't know. So. That's been sort of uh, on my head lately because I feel exhausted thinking about that too. But that's not the big thing, I mean everything is exhausting, but that's you know, it's stressful. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you feel out of your element and out of kilter with that kind of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and don't get me wrong, I'm kind of a glutton for punishment, there are things that I am not good at and I do keep trying anyways. But, it is, I just feel like right now, it's not the time for me to be caught, I mean every six weeks dumped into the deep end over and over again you know? I'm looking forward to when my six weeks come up to teach because that way at least I won't be dumped into the deep end for six weeks you know? I can hit the brake by just teaching the class. So. [00:34:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you'll teach?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm teaching the graphical special effects, it's like when you see like in, um, like movies and things like that when they show explosions and things like that, basically it's modeling of particles. It's very scientific, it looks beautiful, it's very scientific. Let's say oh, well, do you have a particle, this particle has these types of characteristics, I want it to go through this many angles and I want it to have this much gravity, these kinds of things. So, it's, to me, it made perfect sense the first time I learned it, cuz it, just like you know, very simple. So, but I'm going to be the one teaching that and everyone is like very impressed that I'm the teacher but, it just you know, it's not as hard as it seems. So. [00:35:52]</p>

<p>(pause) It's a matter of understanding you know, procedures. And dreaming things up right, so. But, (pause) it's, I don't know, sometimes it's, I understand being out of my element is good and that if I'm not uncomfortable, that I'm not growing, blah blah blah. But every six weeks? Come on. This is, this is, I mean yes I understand it's good for us but it's getting a little exhausting. And we've only done one of them, so. And that was one I was familiar with. [00:36:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah, there's certainly a lot of pressure, a lot expectations for something you don't really feel that comfortable with at a time when you're not feeling comfortable with yourself in any way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:36:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like analyzing numbers. I sort of, that's sort of how I deal with things. Um, when I'm in uncomfortable situations? (phone ringing) Oh wow, it rang. Cool, it's not anybody I care about. Um, I (exhale) it's very easy for me to do this, it's something I've sort of done all my life is that if I'm in a situation where I'm uncomfortable it's easier for me to default to that. I had a customer the other day that was very creepy, and so, instead of, I realized that I really didn't want to know anymore about his life, at all. He makes balloon animals for children for a living, that's all he does. [00:37:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he just, and something about it, I had already got tipped off about it by somebody else, they asked me if I'd take him as a favor. I'm like ok, well everyone is different, sometimes some people like people that are, it's no big deal. And so, and then I was like no, this guy is really creepy. And so, I really didn't want to like help him like do videos, I didn't really want to be like, cuz I didn't want to see any more balloon animal videos, this and that. So I'm like, why don't I show you like about how to find the, you know analytic stuff for your site. And see like, ok, what's, you know, the ages of the people that are coming to this are, this and that. It was easier for me to do that because it was something I was very comfortable with and I didn't have to like really get to know the person at all? [00:38:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't normally do that, normally I'm like oh show me your pictures. You know? But if it's something that I really don't want to like interface with somebody about then, I do that you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, uh, you're more comfortable and more familiar...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can be more, more business like, I don't have to like, you know, if, I can, I feel like I can hold a person at arm's length you know? I don't have to answer any more questions like, you know, um like, oh are you seeing anybody? Like, this, I mean this is like really creepy. You know that kind of stuff you know? That you get... [00:39:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Inappropriate stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even inappropriate sometimes, I mean a lot of times you ask, these things come up you know because you are helping somebody like edit their pictures of like, you know, of like weddings or this or that you know? They ask questions like that and for the most part I don't mind the majority of my customers knowing about my life. Half the little old ladies want to meet Mr. Debra; I have no idea why they want to meet my husband. But you know, and, I don't mind divulging about my personal life because it's part of how they bond with us, you know in terms of that? But when I need to like completely like hold people at arm's length you know, it's like, you know, it's the whole thing that I get, default to things that are very cut and dry and very much like, um, you know, there's one way to do it and that's it. And I don't have to talk about personal things at all, it's much, to me it's much easier. You know? And I mean it is a little bit of a defense mechanism but I don't really let it kick in unless people are really really creepy you know? [00:40:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and like your way of coping with stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so, sometimes you just have to do that because it's like the only thing that works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, it's um, for the most part though I really do enjoy helping people edit their videos and helping them do this, I just don't want to talk to them you know? My life doesn't really lend itself to doing much, I mean I'm not going out there and, and, wanting to create very many things because my life is kind of bleak you know? And, you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>I know that there are many, many people that are creative natures who take these times where they're depressed and make these really magnificent works of art, but to be honest I really don't fucking want to like think about it overly much? I don't want to have a blue period like Picasso, I just don't give a damn, I just want to get past it you know? I don't want to embrace the depression or the sorrow of my life, I just want to just run through it and get there you know? [00:41:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, um, yeah probably like uh, you're not particularly looking to kind of come to grips to things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, like really sort out your depression, you want to be done with it and feeling better and back to normal and be able to do stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's not that I try to pretend it doesn't exist, I just don't really feel like expressing my grief via art you know? It's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My, I mean from what you said, it's not even all that comfortable to express your grief via words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't, it's boring, I mean really what am I going to do for art, like show like my room? Like there's not like, I'm not like the person who like you know, it, it, these slices of life that people are experiencing, they're not there for me you know? I'm educated enough to know that these things are out there, but, and I can cite different works of art but you know what, I don't have anything that's really all that stirring about my life you know? That I want to write poetry about like, you know, about the fact that my dishwasher breaks or anything. These are not like, you know what I mean, they're, nothing special. [00:42:51]</p>

<p>You know? And I don't want to have an extraordinary depression such that I want to you know, compose music about it or anything like that. I don't want to you know? I just want to be done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And be better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I just, and I'm not trying to run away from it and I'm not trying to deny it, I just don't really want to spend that much time mulling over it either you know? I deal with enough people in my life that are like, you know their lives are completely wrapped up in the things that are wrong with them, I just want to keep going. So. I don't know. (sigh)</p>

<p>I just, I mean yes it's true for the words too to be honest, I mean, yes it's true describing it in words to be honest they're really not that great words. They're not, there's nothing really profound and I've said everything that I have needed to say about most of, not that I'm saying I'm not coming in anymore, but, it just, (sigh). [00:44:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, is it like sometimes it's just being sick and tired of it, although there is that it sounds like it's uh, like, just not wanting to do well, not wanting to get wrapped up in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's that too, but it's also just being, like, I'm just interested in my own life, come on. I mean, how in the world am I gonna just focus on making something up based upon my own life if I don't even want to live in it myself you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) Yeah, you would be completely fed up with this kind of life even if it weren't your own, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So, I certainly wouldn't read about it, let's put it that way. You know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you imagine that it bores me, or that I find it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never really considered it one way or the other, I just, (inhale) I am...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really bores you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it bores me. Yep. I just, I don't know, I don't necessarily know, with some of my friends I worry about it, but no, not necessarily, I really have not given that much thought to it. It's more of uh, I don't know. [00:45:46]</p>

<p>There's a difference between being self conscious about things that I'm exp, you know things that I'm interested in and not wanting to talk to people about it, this is more like, I am just really disinterested in it too you know? But I have to put up with it because it's actually my life you know? So. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you're, I mean, you're stuck with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know? I'm it is not as exciting enough to make like for a Steinbeck novel or anybody's story you know? Um, I have promised my dad that I'm writing down some of the more funny parts of my life so that I could eventually publish a memoir, which I am going to try to do. But, those things are not sad usually, they're mostly just amusing things or weird things. But for the most part I mean I guess yes my life's a little weird but it's because of the fact that you know, my life is so boring that when I walk around Dartmouth and I find out that somebody has a model of Stonehenge in the backyard, to me I get really excited and other people are like, yeah, yeah it's weird. [00:47:02]</p>

<p>I'm like, this is, this is like the highlight of my week as I'm taking pictures of somebody's house that has Stonehenge in the backyard you know? So. Um, cuz I have to find these things to cheer me up and try to you know, occupy me you know? I have to find these strange little slices of life cuz otherwise it's, I don't think it's really escapism so much as I gotta find something bright tied to something you know? So, that's kind of like what I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean it's like this in a way is how you sort of struggle with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have got to make lemonade with all these lemons somehow. And so, I, you know, I find things that are funny or amusing or weird you know and that way it distracts me from the fact that I'm unhappy because being unhappy there's things that I can't change. There's no way in the world I'm changing Hanover zoning laws in the period of time I'm here. There's no way I'm going to change you know, whatever.</p>

<p>I've always loved to go up against the system, like I was raised, like with how to do it. There's certain things I cannot do, like the way we recycle cardboard is not one of them you know? Yeah. [00:48:30]</p>

<p>I'll remember next week to bring pictures of the death threats from all my cardboard. Yeah. That's the big thing about it, it does, put a note in the cardboard, saying next time you don't use the cardboard right, I'm going to make you eat the cardboard, you don't fold the cardboard right. So, I decided to laugh at it, I mean what else am I supposed to say you know? They're very funny about the cardboard so. Yeah.</p>

<p>Actually if you have a second, I think I do have a picture of the cardboard. I've been taking pictures of the things that are weird. (inaudible at 00:49:22) very threatening thing about the cardboard. This will make me feel better to actually show this to somebody. Not because of (pause) [00:49:34]</p>

<p>THRERAPIST: Only in Hanover.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So, I have to laugh at it, otherwise...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I'm able to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Eco-terrorism.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to laugh otherwise I'll cry about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I will see you Thursday.</p>

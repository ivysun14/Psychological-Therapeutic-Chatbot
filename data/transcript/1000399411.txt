<p>PATIENT:  (Silence, sigh) Uhm, well, I'm thinking about something that did seem clear to me yesterday after I left here.  And uhm, you know, I mean, a feeling.  And I've been trying to figure out exactly what's involved in it.  But then, I started thinking about just the fact that today was the last day FEN would be here while I'm here.  And uhm, you know, I was thinking w—, that it, that day that she had in e—, in essence, said good-by to me, I was finding it easier.  But of course at that point, I knew I'd seen her for a few more days.  And today, I was  kind of uhm, well, wondering how I'd find it.  Uhm, I don't know whether I was dreading it or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>But in any case — and then it — Mrs RM was a b—, little late for the, o, one of the rare times.  So I was a little bit late and I was afraid I would have missed her.  But then, as it turned out, there were a lot of people in the office saying good-by to, you know, I, not just to FEN, but there are a number of people, I guess, who are leaving.  Uhm, and so it was just one of the things, where we had really said good by, so nothing more was said.  And I was just as glad.</p>

<p>But also thinking that it wasn't quite so uhm, well, easy, I guess, or I don't know, I, I began to think of the good-bys that I had said at school this year, too.  And uhm, I'm not, I don't know exactly what I'm thinking, except it must have to do with uh, you know, at school too, but there were a number of people that really uhm, that didn't enter my life in any kind of meaningful way, partly because I didn't let them.  Uhm, and maybe partly because they just wouldn't have anyhow.</p>

<p>And near the end of school (Sigh) you know, it was almost like, and I know this has happened to me before, when the end is in sight, then I allow myself to be more open with somebody than I do at any other time.  And, so I was feeling sort of sorry about some of the good-bys.  I didn't like to think of it as final.  And when I think about it now, it just seems kind of strange that all year, uhm, you know, they, they didn't really touch on my life.  Uhm, and then, you know, why would I feel that way at the very end.  And it seems like it's a little bit different with FEN, because I've seen her every day for so many years.  And in a way, she's touched more on my life than these people I said good-by to at school, even though I suppose you could say, well, I've seen her much less time.</p>

<p>Uhm, I, I guess I'm just wondering, you know, how much do I, I don't know what it is, because, because now, it's as if some of these people at school, I mean, I know they existed and it isn't that I can't remember them, or anything.  But the emotional uhm, content, or, you know, the feeling I had when I was saying good-by, is no longer there.  And I'll probably never see some of them again, and uhm, you know, I won't be that sorry.  If I did, it would be nice, but I won't be that sorry.  And there isn't that feeling anymore.  And I, I guess I was wondering, well, what led me to, sort of, create something that wasn't there.  Why couldn't I just say good by, uhm, feeling what the relationship had really been.</p>

<p>And uhm, I guess maybe I'm wondering too, am I somehow thinking of FEN being more important to me, or uhm, I suppose I'm wondering how much I'll miss seeing her, or something like that, too.  But (Pause) I think maybe part of, partly what, I guess what it was, because I was thinking about somebody, I think it was FLJ, who said that she hated good-bys.  And i—, I mean, she wasn't the only one.  Everybody was sort of saying it.  But she said it in a way that, you know, it was very clear that she didn't like them, and that she could make them quite quick.  And th—, sh—, she was not going to agonize over them, or, you know, put herself through something she didn't like.</p>

<p>And uh, I realized at that time, that my tendency was to, I didn't like them but I a—, so I didn't want them to happen, so I'd keep trying to prolong it.  And in a way, it made it worse.  Or in a way, it made it more meaningless.  And uh, you know, when I was thinking about not having said anything further to FEN today, I was kind of glad.  And I was thinking of what FLJ had said, and you know, sort of feeling what I imagined she felt about good-bys.  Uhm, which was sort of a new feeling, I don't know.</p>

<p>I, I guess maybe it means that I can uhm, face the final aspect of it in a way that, before I just wouldn't accept.  So, I'd make up all so—, you know, little pretenses, well, we'll have to get together, and we'll call, and you know, FEN did it, to an extent.  But uhm, but even when she had said that, I was a—, you know, I thought it was nice of her to say it, but my reaction was, well I know I won't, unless I really need help.  And then, if I really need help, I hope I will.  Uhm, you know, I didn't pretend to myself, oh yes, I'll call and see how everybody is.  And you know, that kind of thing.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, but the thing that uhm, seemed clear, I don't know, clear to me, in a way, I guess, or, just, I was thinking of it differently than I thought of yesterday.  When I was going home you know I guess I was still thinking about, how am I going to feel the last day here, and uh, how much time is left, and uhm, you know, that kind of a thing.  And well, the summer, y, you know, I, I suppose for a long time I was thinking, after the summer b—, or, you know, certainly after school ended, as uh, you know, so many weeks left until I finish here.  And that was always, you know, I, I almost couldn't think beyond that point.</p>

<p>And uhm, that was always the most upsetting thought I could come up with.  And yesterday I realized that I can easily accept now, n—, well, I don't know how easily, but uhm, I can accept, you know, in 2 weeks I'll stop coming here.  Uhm, (Sigh) and I know it's final.  But now what I've done, I suppose I haven't really accepted the finality, because now what I've done is I've pushed the feeling of panic along to the fall.</p>

<p>And I've had this before, and I've talked about is as, you know, will I be able to handle working with MME?  And do I like doing it?  Am I going to get caught in some kind of a trap that I've made for myself?  And that kind of thing.  And I do—, I don't know, except that at this point, I don't feel panicked about thinking about August 9th.  But I do feel panicked about thinking that, I only have 3 weeks in PTN, then I have to come back and immediately start school.</p>

<p>And uh, yesterday, I was thinking of it as maybe I'm feeling panic there, because I'm used to having a summer, you know, some point in the summer when I don't see you.  But then in the fall, I've always been used to coming back.  And this year I won't, and that's where I'll really begin to feel it.</p>

<p>Uhm, you know, if there's anything to feel.  And uhm, I, I guess I was just wondering if that was why I had this panic, because I, and I've h, had this before, but you know, I've never quite not felt so pani—, I mean, I've never quite had the clear feeling of being ready for the 9th, as I did yesterday.  But then to be so panicked at the thought of coming back to school.  And uh, you know, so yesterday, when this happened, I immediately started thinking, well, of course I can handle this, and I can handle that.  Uhm, and I suppose that calmed me down a little bit.</p>

<p>But that panic feeling, uhm, well, it's just something I can't quite figure out.  I don't know if it means that I really don't know whether I can take care of myself.  And therefore it would mean I question how much uhm, well, coming here has helped.  Or, you know, I don't know exactly what, but, anyway, I'm questioning whether I continue on my own.  And uh, whether it's a, just a feeling, a reaction to the fact I'm going to be doing something I don't like.  Or uhm, (Sigh) that I haven't quite come to terms with, or, or just what it is.</p>

<p>And also I, you know, I sometimes think, well, could it be that I'm remembering how I felt the first 2 years of working here.  And since I'm working at the same place, there's not enough change so I could think of it as being something different.  A, and so I'm remembering how I felt those 2 years, and, and then the panic is, will I feel that way again, and you know, because that's all I can imagine.  And then if I do, how awful, because I won't be coming here.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know (Sigh) the next thing I got onto, I do—, trying to figure out how I got onto this.  I mean, I, I was thinking about school, so I know, but I started thinking about a change in schedule.  The scheduling of things has bothered me both years, and I haven't been able to work out anything, even to this point, that I, you know, for even thinking of changes from last year for next year.  There's no solution that I'm happy with, because of the different restrictions on me.  Because of the different classes using the roof, and the different uhm, you know, classes the kindergarten has involving different teachers.</p>

<p>And uhm, I just thought of something that I can imagine I'll be told no, but I never even tried suggesting this before.  Because if, if I could get this changed, it would be the solution for me, I think.  You know, I haven't ever had it that way, so I don't know for sure.  But it's the best solution that I have thought of up to this date, for next year.  And uhm, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it before.  I guess I just thought, well, I can think of why they'd say no, so they'll say no, so there's no point in even mentioning it.  Or, I mean, I never even really thought of it as a possibility that might just be said no to.  Uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so here you are telling me you feel panicked at the prospect of the fall.  And then you tell me you have a new thought.  That it solves certain kinds of problems.  As though you're saying, if you can think, maybe you'll make it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, w, when I, you know, calmed myself down yesterday, after having that panic feeling again, which I keep getting if I ever think of how long I'll be in PTN, and then what I'll be immediately coming back to.  Uhm, (Sigh) I, you know, that is one way I've thought about it.  I've thought about it, if I can think so I know what I want to do, and uhm, you know, can be relaxed, as a result, because I'll know what I'm about with MME, that would certainly help.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking of one thing that we talked about for awhile, when I was still meeting with MME, of, you know, my sense of having prerogatives, or not.  Uhm, I don't know, I was trying to remember there was something — and I think it was the feeling of whether or not I have any prerogatives — that I remember I was saying, well why can't I feel that way ahead of time, so I don't get into a situation, instead of feeling that way as I look back on it.  And you, at the time, had just said, "Well, you haven't had very much practice feeling that way."</p>

<p>And when I was thinking about, you know, all this, I was wondering was that it.  Well, I, I don't know if it even matters.  But you know, still feeling well, have I had enough practice at this point so I can do it on my own.  Because I know certainly at that time, you were helping me see some things that I wasn't seeing immediately on my own.  And uhm, n—, so I guess I'm wondering, can I think on my own, without you?  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, then I was thinking about uhm, you know, I guess something else I did on my own.  Uhm, that is, seems to be a change for the better, or, you know, at least a slight change.  Uhm, because I was supposed to be taking care of FYHZ today, after FSO was finished with her doctor's appointment.  And I had thought, well I can pick FYHZ up on the way home, because we had a choice of 2 buses we could take.  And one would, we could go by FYHZ's house.</p>

<p>And uh, so when I called to say that we could do this, if that would be agreeable, FYSI was saying she was just about to call me, because she was going to take FYHZ somewhere.  And then she thought FYHZ would have to rest when she got back, so that FYHZ wouldn't be able to come over until around 2:00.  Which really, you know, I didn't say much, because uhm, I knew we were doing something, although we weren't doing it that late in the morning, the hour that the girls would get together, wasn't going to be that much different than usual.</p>

<p>And so I felt kind of annoyed, because uhm, FYSI knows that I've been hesitant to have children with Mrs RM yet.  Because Mrs RM has been a little bit hesitant.  And, but anyway, I said okay, because I sort of, knowing, usually FYHZ doesn't take a rest.  So I thought, well there would be, probably get there earlier than that.</p>

<p>And so anyway, we were waiting around, and uhm, I was doing some things at home.  But FSOZ was very much in a mood of waiting, so she was being very pesty, and I couldn't get anything done.  And there was, there were a number of things I wanted to do that I couldn't do until either FYHZ got there, and I took them with me, or I just wasn't going to be able to do at all.  And uhm, (Sigh) and you know, just this waiting, and not knowing when they'd come, or anything.</p>

<p>And then I thought, well, oh, and then I, I'd already asked if somebody could come to play with FSOZ tomorrow morning, couldn't come.  So I just thought, well if they're not doing anything, tomorrow would be just so much better, it seems to me at this point, to have FYHZ come tomorrow.  So I called and asked if that would be all right to change.  And FYSI said again, I was just about to call you.  FYHZ's really tired, and she's going to have to rest, so she wouldn't be able to come over for quite awhile.  And so she seemed to like the idea.</p>

<p>And then I also, we had planned to take FSOZ somewhere in the latter part of the afternoon.  And I think in the past, I would have not said anything, and then just sort of mentioned that — I don't know, but somehow last minute indicated I h—, you know, could only keep FYHZ for so long, or something like that.  But I just matter-of-factly announced that we were going to be doing that in the afternoon, so I would want FYHZ to come in the morning, if she came.  And not have it go on, you know, not have her come so late that there was no time.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, it was just something I don't think, I would probably not in the past, have even called and changed the day.  I would have sat there stewing, and uh, feeling more annoyed at how messed up the plans got.  And then, you know, I don't think, even if I had done it, I, I wonder if I would have, in such a matter of fact way, mentioned the limitations on our time, on the day I was asking somebody over.  Uhm, (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So uh, in addition to being able to learn about money, and the car, and think, and ask questions, you can also make decisions.  All without a penis.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh) But I think what, you know, and then I think back to this feeling I have about next year, uhm, part of what I think is really part of this panic, is uhm, am I strong enough to continue this, when I'm up against somebody who has a penis?  And I suppose I'm still seeing it, as you know, some kind of a uhm, competition, or something.  You know, I used the word, up against.  I don't think of working with.</p>

<p>But uhm, (Sigh) and then the other part of it is just simply, I have not taught, feeling the way I do now, because it wa—, it's only recently that I've really admitted a lot of these things, or come to terms with a lot of these things.  Enough so that it seems as if it really would change how I would teach, or you know, so often it would seem as if I believed in one thing, and I would act in other ways as a teacher.  You know, I wouldn't even be acting as a teacher sometimes.  And so, it seems like it's 2 things that I don't, I just don't know.  Bec—, I can't, you know, remember myself as I would like next year to go.  Because it's never happened.  And so I don't know how I'll be as a teacher next year.</p>

<p>Uhm, and you know, so then I'll think, well, so it would be so much easier to have a female assistant, so I wouldn't have this added difficulty that I imagine will be a difficulty.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, why do you imagine there would be difficulty still, do you think?  What about what you call being up against?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I think it, you know, when I think of MME, I think, well maybe if he just were more uhm, I don't know, or less forceful, or something.  He's, he's thought a lot about this field, you know, for the limited experience he's had.  And he's very interested, and he's very ambitious.  Uhm, so that he, he is very forceful, and h, he's probably a form—, at least a decisive person, anyway.  And uh, I don't know, somehow, it just seems as if the fact I've had all these years of experience really mean nothing.  A, and it's as if we both know the same amount, and will I think and use what I know to reach any kind of decisions when we disagree.</p>

<p>Uhm, because I am assuming that there are going to be times when we disagree.  Or that he's going to want to do things that I just know, from experience, won't work.  And some of it maybe I'll step back, because i—, you know, it's probably the best way for him to find out.  But in some cases, I won't be able to step back, uhm, a, and also in this particular school, there are certain things that I know you just can't do, or won't work.  And uhm, you know, how much I'll be able to be decisive and firm about it.  And uhm, against his forceful personality.  I don't know, or enthusiasm.  Sometimes I think of it as enthusiasm, but it's more than that.</p>

<p>Uhm, and Mrs BBF kept talking about it in terms of the fact that this year, he's been working in business and in a position where he's used to making decisions, and where his decisions are followed.  I don't know, uh you know, who else makes decisions along with him.  A—, he's not the only one, I'm sure.  But uhm, he's had a high position, and uhm, so she feels this is what's happening.  He's just bringing, you know, this kind of way of thinking, to the school.  And, you know, it's just an assumption on his part, well, that he has these prerogatives, (Laughs) sometimes when he is uh, well, you know, perhaps coming on a bit too strong for the situation.  And where he, you know, maybe should be aware that he's coming on a bit too strong.  Uhm, but it bowls me over.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You're afraid you won't be able to tell him.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  You know, for instance I wasn't even able to really think.  Well, it was not his place to come around after school, the way he did.  Uhm, and uh, it wasn't until FSL and Mrs BBF both were talking about how, it had really been inappropriate, and he shouldn't have done it, and he should have known, or you know, something like that, that I began to even think about that.</p>

<p>And when I felt absolutely torn between uhm, you know, the things I had to, and FLMZ, who was waiting for me to direct her, although there were certain things she knew, and you know, I never really held her up that much.  But you know, I had the feeling I could have.  And you know, I didn't know how much time he wanted to take, and yet I wasn't able just to say to him, you know, look, I just can't give you very much time, right now.</p>

<p>And also I think I assume a knowledge he doesn't have, too, because he talks well.  Uhm, and perhaps he wants to convey knowing more than he knows.  I don't know quite what his feeling is about that, h—, whether he feels any need to, or not.  But uhm, (Sigh) because I think well, I had known exactly, when he had asked if he could come, I had 1 reason why I thought it would be a good idea.  And that was, just that before everything were put away, he could see what we had, so during the summer, since he seemed like this type who would be thinking about it, during the summer he'd know what he was thinking about.</p>

<p>And uh, but he clearly either had other ideas in mind, or else, didn't understand that that was all I had in mind, and then that was all he should do.  Since he'd asked to come, I think he had other things in mind.  And I wasn't able just to, you know, keep myself on the line of, this is all I thought was necessary and valuable.</p>

<p>And uhm, so I, I, I mean, it just all comes down to, you know, feeling he's so forceful and strong and certain, or at least gives the impression of being completely certain of what his decisions are and where he's going, and what he's thinking .</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, sounds like the Kool-Aid acid test.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well this uh, that (Laughs) leads me to something else, because uhm, I don't precisely know what you're referring to, although I, I was guessing.  My first reaction was just, putting it, anything in those terms uhm, made it, my whole feeling seem kind of ridiculous, as if I'm so weak, or something.  But uhm, then I, then I start thinking, but I really don't know what that test is.</p>

<p>All I could think of is the Coke, well the proof of how strong Coke is.  If you put a nail in, or something, I mean, it's something that used to be talked about a lot.  How it would be eaten away.  And so that's what I start thinking.  I think, well I really don't know what it is.  Should I admit it or not?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I'm not even sure I know.  I was really referring to this whole aura that Tom Wolfe used to write about a lot.  That's the way you describe MME, uh, hyper, coming on so strong.  And, you know, really putting everybody, not just you (Laughs) through the mill.</p>

<p>But then, the other side of it that I, you know, am not sure about.  Well, because I would assume he would affect Mrs BBF this way, so I don't feel her reacting this way is at all valid, you know, for me to judge my reactions by.  And uhm, and then I just think, well you know, women generally would be, perhaps inclined to react this way, if they've never worked with a man before in this field.  And uhm, (Sniff) and it's o—, but, but it is true.  It's only if I hear everybody saying this that then I begin to think it's not just me having a personal problem, but maybe it is MME being a bit too strong.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Beca—, I'm just thinking about something else he did that uhm, I don't know how much I thought about this at the time.  Because I was interested, you know, at the time I, my feeling was, I want to know everything I can know about him.  Because then I'll know more what he's thinking, so I can react accordingly, which is, you know, now I'm thinking the wrong way to approach it.  But I'm wondering if I'll be able to stop myself, because that's such a habit I've had in the past, of you know, trying to outguess other people who I feel are stronger than me, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>And uhm, he brought in a report he had to do on his student teaching, wh—, it wasn't exactly, I, well, it wasn't exactly student teaching, either, because he was, I've forgotten the name of the field exactly he was in, but uhm, the teaching worked into that.  And, so in a way, he was student teaching, in a way he wasn't.  He wasn't part of an education department.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then he brought in a couple of other things.  We started talking about drugs, at one point.  Because there'd been a number of children that I've had since I've worked at the school, that have been on drugs, for various reasons.  And he had done a study on that.  So I was, I was really interested.  But then he happened to have right there uhm, I don't know if he had the report too, but he had a letter that summarized what he found in the report he'd written.  And, so he produced that.</p>

<p>And he didn't seem overly eager to produce that, at first.  But when I showed interest, he did.  But the other report, he did seem eager to produce.  You know, again, it was like he was selling him se—, h—, you know, a salesman.  Uhm, you know, selling his goods, or, selling his knowledge of the field, or, you know, his potential, or something.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, just in, I think there was even one other thing.  And then had a couple of books that he'd come across, that he liked, and he wanted to show me.  Well, that was reasonable.  But the other things, uhm, you know, before we'd had any conversation where he would say, well I have this, would you be interested?  It did just seem, you know, when I think about it now, it seemed very strange, and very you know, kind of pushing himself.  But I didn't think that at the time.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, and then I was thinking about another thing that uhm, you know, in connection with thinking about next year, that was on my mind.  Because it's how uhm, I have found approaching the beginning days works best.  And particularly, you know, the way, after thinking about how these 2 years have gone, how I'd, I think I'm coming to a complete decision that this is the best way for me, in any case, as a teacher.  Uhm, and, and it's you know, mainly to be just observant, and to be you know, start out quite slowly.</p>

<p>And uhm, he might find that not at all hard to do.  But I imagine that he'll want to jump in with both feet going, and that I'll, I wonder, you know, how strong I'm going to be able to be in saying it's much better to observe, first, get to know them, find out what they're interests are, you know, all, that whole thing.  Uhm, and maybe it won't be he'll say, well I want to do this, or let's do that, but I, I think I'm just assuming that I'll be feeling a pressure from him that's unspoken, you know, to be more involved, be doing more.</p>

<p>And uhm — (Silence) And I think I'm bothered too, you know, w, when I think of all this, I think, well, uhm, you know, I could easily become over critical of him, too.  But I think, if I could be strong enough, you know, so that I'm not just well, being really bowled over by him in whatever it is, his forcefulness, or aggressiveness, or whatever it is, uhm, you know, I think in the end, that he could be a very interesting person to work with, just because of his interests.</p>

<p>And uhm, well I, I, y—, I don't know, I just feel as if, you know, it's really up to me, because I'm the one with the experience.  And he doesn't even know at this point i, if it is just his being overly uhm, forceful, or something.  You know, it might not be something he even knows about himself, yet.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess it's also because I've been wondering how much, uh, I blame FLMZ for things that happened, and, you know, will I have a tendency to blame him.  And, you know, when it really comes down to it, uhm, I think the more I blame somebody else, it's because I'm feeling I'm not being what I want to be.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Maybe part of the trouble is too, I was thinking of it in t—, sort of 2 different ways.  But one was just, you know, the fact that I really am feeling I want to get out of there faster next year, and not just sort of hang around.  And at some point, you know, I had said that I hoped he would have some time to give after the class left, that uhm, I hadn't had that before.  And it was something that I would find more helpful.  And he said well, you'll probably find it hard to get me to leave, or something that you know, indicated again, his interest would keep him really at it.  And so that now when I think about it, I think a—, well, will his interests pull me in in a such a way that I won't be able to say, well, I'm going, and let him do whatever he wants to do.  You know, feel sort of, I have to be there too, if he's there.  Which is, you know, not true.</p>

<p>But uhm, and then just in general, you know, how much interest he's going to be bringing to it.  I feel a certain pulling away, that I want to have other things be more important to me, or at least, more important than they've been before.  So, you know, school will become less.  And I think it's probably a good thing, but then I'm wondering, well, if he's there feeling it's so important to him, will that kind of pull me back in, you know, so that I make things less important, like MSCZ and FSO, and whatever else could be more important to me.  And uhm,</p>

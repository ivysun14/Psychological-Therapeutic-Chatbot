<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT...voice-mails. Like I can see my missed calls so I can call people back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right, right. Yeah you should have like ringtones where you can have, have for certain numbers it says, "Voice-mail is full." (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. That would be nice. Maybe that's, that's how I'm going to make my big money, I can invent that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) [Spend all my future] (ph) now, right? Oh man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad that worked out. Do you guys talk much on the phone or just schedule?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We schedule. We didn't really like get into details or anything, so, but she sounded really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. I, I have heard really wonderful things about her actually. I have some senior colleagues who have worked with her a bit and said she was great and then sort of by chance I happened to be talking to some other people that she's worked with recently and really, some like nurses at the Hospital where she did her training and also works. And they're like, "Oh, she's awesome." I hope she's good for you. 00:00:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she sounded like really friendly and calm and nice. That's like the woman I worked with before it was like stressful and had like the vocal version of like the eagle eye always on you. (laughs) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wasn't pleasant?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: No, she was a very stressful person. So, that will be nice to have and they have a normal doctor visit and just to prescribe something to try for migraines. So, which is similar to the metrixline I was on, but there's supposedly a less drowsy version [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that it like prevented them from happening. Its main benefit was preventing them from lasting for more than one day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's still a benefit. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, so yeah. (laughs) [00:00:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think we talked about it last week only the time before that, but I think we were talking about the problems that the Wellbutrin caused. Does that hypothesis still seem to hold up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah and it's, I mean I think it's, you know, only the most extreme things. Like I definitely had mild versions of these symptoms myself, but the extremity and frequency was definitely increased by the Wellbutrin a lot (laughs). I actually, actually since I, since it got out of my system I haven't experienced any visual or aural hallucinations, so that's nice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Sounds like an understatement. Had you been having a lot of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I started to have a few before I started taking it which is why I started taking it again. But then it was like all day every day I was having them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what were you seeing and hearing?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: I would hear music that wasn't there, like a man singing with a guitar and it would be triggered by ambient noise. Like it was really cold that week so I had my space heater on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would turn the noise of the space heater into like a man with a guitar and then I would turn the space heater off and it would be gone. And the thing was I liked to have ambient noise because of the ringing in my ears, so even if I don't have, even if it's hot I turn on a white noise machine so I can't hear the ringing in my ears as loudly. And it would just turn that noise into like weird shit. [00:00:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would see sort of these weird like light patterns. Sometimes like the static on a TV and I see that even without the Wellbutrin, but the Wellbutrin made it happen like all the time. So there would like purple static or like weird shapes and like metamorphisizing light block shapes. (pause) And some people have auras sometimes. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible] has helped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah it's definitely, I've had a lot more energy since I made that discovery actually. Not as much energy as I would in an ideal world. It just made me feel a lot more positive about the future. And about my ability to be in a situation that involves other people (laughs) now that I'm not as afraid that these people say to me can trigger those intense hallucinations that I was having. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Had that worked? People saying things to you just amplified the stuff you were talking about or would you have different sorts of reactions to people saying things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would definitely have reactions triggered by people saying things. Like, in two of my classes, I have these two classes where we talked a lot about like self-presentation through art and whenever they would use keywords related to that I would see purple. And so there are different like topics that would inevitably call up hallucinations. And when people said things that were sort of critical things sometimes that would trigger this sort of like intense wave of dizziness and nausea and static in my vision. So, I mean, people were like directly sort of threatening my ability to function.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And some of the things we talked about here would cause light hallucinations. Like you would get an aura and the wall or the chair would suddenly become very separate and have weird light properties. (long pause) [00:00:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that like for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean it was like some other part of myself was highlighting that the topic was important. I mean it was never like, it never seemed like you were creating this hallucination it was always like this other thing in me [inaudible] that people did. So, I had mixed feelings about it when it would happen because it was related to topics that one hand I guess it's helpful to get clues about what this other personality wants me to think about and focus on. And on the other hand it was disorienting and weird (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very disconcerting I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And there were sort of things when like my colleagues would say things that stressed me out or certain topics would come up in class that sort of upset me, the dizziness and nausea, like that was never constructive in the way that the hallucinations were. Because it's like, ok yeah this is upsetting and then like I didn't need that. I don't need to like feel like I'm going to like fall over or vomit (laughs). [That was very stressful] (ph). [00:00:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Do you feel that way being here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes when we're talking about some of the trauma things, like early on when I hadn't really talked about them a lot with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like when you actually had to report what happened?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, so it's hard because all of these things were so common for certain periods that it's hard to, when the point when they happen more than others, except I knew they happened more when others were around than when I was alone because when I was alone, I mean I didn't have control over what I would think about because I had this other personality just throwing things at me all the time. But, I still felt like I had more control than a completely different person who like, who knows what anyone can say at any given moment. Except I sort of know that you probably aren't going to say any like totally jerkish thing that [inaudible] (laughs) unlike my colleagues. (laughs) But, I don't come in here like, oh god what's he going to say today? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, that's probably a good thing. I don't think you could stay here long, I hope not if I have. [00:00:09]</p>

<p><br>
 CLIENT: Yeah (laughs), yeah. (pause) (sighs) Yeah, I actually stayed up all night finishing this book which just came out, The Vanishers by Heidi Julavits, which, it came out two weeks ago. It's funny because it has like this cover that makes it look like total chick lit (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's literary fiction and she's the editor of this sort of literary journal, The Believer. And it's really bad, gives her sort of cred to have a cover like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something like [McSweeny's] (ph)?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yeah, it's sort of their like newer sister [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I love that she can have a cover for this, oh wait, like the sperm book and get away with it. But, it's, it was crazy. I wasn't supposed to be reading it yesterday. I ordered all these new books which I also wasn't supposed to be spending all this money on new books. Lots of things wrong here, but I'm just going to read a little bit each day like a responsible person. But then, (laughs) but then, so it's a book about two psychics, a mentaler, and a student. And when the mentaler gets jealous of his student's abilities and psychically attacks her and like sets something that makes her really sick and she has physical and mental symptoms and needs to take all of these drugs and go to all of these doctors. And no...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [To heal her?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From the attack?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like no one knows what's wrong with her and people think she's just like faking it. People are like, "Well just snap out of it." And it just felt so familiar (laughs). I feel like there's been a period of a few years that I've been looking for a book that had a character I could relate to and I just haven't been able to find any characters that I could relate to in any books. Like a lot of time I can relate to the narrator or the narrative voice more often. A lot of straight narratives I can't relate to, but weirdly third person narrators who are more artful and you know, like stream of consciousness narration which is very colored by the third person narrator I can relate to. But, there's, there's something more</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in an embodied character?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's sort of interesting looking for an embodied character I can relate to and like this is the first one (laughs). So I couldn't stop reading it. I kept trying to do other things and say like in a hour I'll get a break to read a little bit more, but I just like read it instead.</p>

<p>[00:00:13] And it was, it was such a strange experience. For one thing just seeing somebody who is in the same sort of place, that's sort of rare both in my life and in the books I read. And, like experiencing her feeling of just total failure was painful because she has to take a leave of absence from the psychic school because she's so sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that really hit close to home and just felt that, felt so painful and then I go back and forth between being able to construct a world view in which things are sort of ok right now because I'm working on my novel and working on getting better and like that's alright. And a worldview in which I totally failed and I never know like, you know either one could sort of pop up in a given moment, of course the negative one is always more likely to overtake me because negative things are more powerful than positive things. And reading this sort of brought me back to a, it sort of just shattered me, kind of the delusion that things are ok right now. Because, you know in terms of the like actual circumstances of my life, if I thought about it from the perspective of like me a few years ago, they would not be ok. I would not be ok with it. So, you know, that was frustrating at first because it brought back to the feeling of failure at the same time that it was comforting to find someone to relate to.</p>

<p>[00:00:14] But, the main theme of the novel is actually mother-daughter type relationships and the main character's mother committed suicide when she was a month old. And so she's always looking for mother figures in like her psychic mentor and in the people she investigates later on. And, I mean, you know I never have the problem of feeling like there's an absence mother figure. It's like, I think there's like a too present mother figure who I'm still afraid of trying to come up with a relationship it seems where like, like the power's somewhat equally divided. But, I mean I see myself in a world in which someone is dealing with these issues and the role of the mother is so prevalent in all of it and it got me thinking about my relationship with my mom even though I sort, it hasn't been something I've thought about a lot in relation to my general state. And, I don't know, I fell asleep after it, I was going to like write in my journal, but I was so tired. I used to be able to pull all-nighters all the time and now I can't stay up past four, like four is just when I absolutely cannot stay up any longer. It's sort of disappointing. It makes me feel old (laughs). (pause) But, I guess I was disturbed because this character sort of pushes away anyone who wants to be a mother figure and even, you know, friends and it was just too familiar, too much like what I do. So that made me very uncomfortable reading it. (pause) (sighs) And, I don't know, I have an e-mail from my mom that I need to respond to which doesn't say anything stressful. But, I don't know if I mentioned this because we had so much to talk about the other week, but she called one day and was like, "Just so you know I just want to let you know," she was blaming me about something. "When my friends ask what, you know, when are you going back to school? In the fall? And I'm always like oh, you know, she hopes to probably as long as she can get these health issues resolved," and they always like press about the health issues and she says, "I don't know, like migraines and getting sick a lot," and stuff like that. And then she said, "And they never believe me, they always like see through it and they give me these skeptical looks and say things like 'oh well, you know that's an awfully great opportunity to pass up,' and just, you know, I thought you should know that people don't buy that story and people think you flunked out." And I was like, who, who thinks that? And who says that? And she's like, "Oh, everybody. My coworkers, my dance friends, family," which just made me so depressed. And it was a weird thing to do because she packaged it as though she was telling me what everyone really thought that I might not know they thought, but I should be prepared to find out what they think, which his sort of the worst, I even tried to like tell myself people weren't thinking. [00:00:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then to be told that actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just the sort of thing you worried people were thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I spend a lot of time worrying about what people were thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I'd sort of managed to say like, well, I just won't think about them. But then that changed that. So I've been avoiding her ever since that conversation because it really got to me. And you would like to be able to say, well it doesn't change the fact that I shouldn't think about what others, what conclusions others are coming to because that doesn't really affect my life that much. But, it's hard to actually put that in action. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, you're saying like, I might say that you should just try not to worry about what other people are thinking about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not like you, like particularly you, just logic and common wisdom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, sort of having confirmed that my worst fears are true, like someone telling me it's definitive was really a whoa. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure it sounds like it was. [00:00:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and, and after she said that she tells me about the new diet that she and my dad are on. They've always been really healthy, but they're nutritarians most of the time which means like you eat 90 percent like fresh fruits and vegetables and 10 percent other stuff. And they'll go out to eat with friends sometimes, but they don't want to be like totally socially ostracized but they're trying to do this for most meals. And they've found this health guru, Todd Robbins, and they've been trying to get me to try some of his foods and stuff, but I don't like them. They're too healthy for me (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Pretty bad bland tasting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I like eating pretty clean vegetables, but I like putting fat on vegetables and then eating them (laughs) and Todd Robbins doesn't like you to put fat on your vegetables (laughs), he wants you to just eat the vegetables.</p>

<p><br>
 THERAPIST: (laughs) I see, like no salad dressing?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: They use dressings, but they have like nut bases. And the thing is like, yeah nuts have fat in them, but it's not the same as oil. It's like taking the matter away from the fat. I mean it's like no wonder I've gained 25 pounds in the last six months. But, I mean I honestly think my diet isn't terrible because I do make an effort to include vegetables in it, even if I put fat on them first. But, I think my parents disagree. And, and they were saying to me like, "You should just consult with Dr. Robbins, like it's really expensive so we'll pay for it because it would be worth it and, you know, it's just like if you could just control, even if you only get help with your migraines think what a difference that could make in your life." And they implication there being that I need help with the other things too although she knows better than to say that; she knows that would make me angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not doing a very good job of not making you angry though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, she's trying, but it's like she just can't help herself. When she says these things (sighs), I don't know that it's, she like sat down and thought to herself if I think this is a good idea. It's like she just lost her ability to not say these things to me after repressing it for weeks or something. [00:00:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you say there's a kind of anxious and almost desperate quality to the way she sort of tries to get you to do these things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean she tries to act otherwise, but I mean it's unfortunate. Like, I know her too well and I can see what she's trying to hide and I mean, in this particular conversation she didn't hide it very well because she said to me like, my response to this was, I think it's a waste of money to pay someone hundreds of dollars for me to have someone tell me to eat more vegetables. And, and she was like, "Well, you know [inaudible] you might be able to have like tailored plans for eating. He's not necessarily going to tell you to eat more vegetables." And then she says something like, "You know, like whenever you're ready to consider this we are, we are ready to, to help you.'' That wasn't the exact phrase, but it made it seem like they were the victims of my close mindedness in a way, which is bizarre. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like, (long pause) in a similar vein to if you were like, I don't know, had a broken ankle and refusing to see a doctor and they were suggesting somebody could go see a, sort of like, well, you know like you get over your close mindedness about going to see someone who could just clearly help your ankle and like diagnose it and put a case on it, x-ray it. Like, when you, when you've sort of come back to reason and common sense give us a call. Like that?<br>
 <br>
 CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but not even like, there would be something almost dismissive in that and this just like, you know, "We're suffering so much because, you know you're suffering and you won't let us help you."<br></p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my suffering makes them suffer and I am not exploring my options and trying hard enough. It's like I wasn't taking this seriously enough. (long pause) And I think I'm sort of sensitive about that (laughs), that I'm being told that I'm like not trying hard enough. So, I've been trying hard and I think there are always more things you can do with anything or try. I'm being sort of exhausted with trying and being told you're not trying hard enough sort of [inaudible at 00:00:27] at me. (pause) So after that conversation I was just like mad at her for a few different reasons. I haven't really been able to recover. And I have been avoiding her and she called a couple of weeks ago and I was just sort of cold and gave one word answers and then she sent me an e-mail, like "if you don't want to talk you can just say you're busy or you don't want to talk, like, I don't want to bother you." And I told dad that it was sort of immature to be extendedly rude to your mom. Like it would be more mature to say I don't want to talk rather than just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you feel, it sounds to me like you feel pretty defenseless against her in some ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean it's frustrating on two levels. One, like I know that she genuinely loves me and wants the best for me and like I don't think there are like weird ulterior motives or, I don't know. Like I know this is coming from a genuine place. And second, I feel like I owe her, like being nice to her at the very least because she really did like try very hard to be a good mother and put a lot of thought on how best to raise me and spent so much time with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I guess I'm kind of hearing you tell me that, you know when you say, you know this is how I felt in a good place and to me a good place and that she has done a lot for you or tried to do all she can. You know, like you're implying that you feel very guilty framing her as being so destructive to you and it kind of makes you feel better to remind yourself of the good things she's done, that she cares. I guess I'm kind of reading into what you're saying, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't think she's been very destructive. I think destructive is too strong a word. I just think she's bad at understanding important things that are sensitive for me right now and avoiding those things. And, I mean, it goes to her upbringing. You know, my grandfather was very like rough with them and was very hard on his kids, like they didn't have enough money growing up so they grew up always a little short on food when she was really young. And before meals he would say to the kids, "root hog or die,'' in his southern accent. In other words like, like they were pigs in a trough trying to eat enough food so they didn't get left out (laughs) and starve to death.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like eat like hogs or you'll die?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I mean, you know she grew up in this poor southern Christian environment that wasn't geared towards like being sensitive to people's particular, particular abnormalities. And I just feel like being an intelligent person who thinks about how things work I should be able to engineer a good relationship between us and it feels like I'm not trying hard enough. (long pause) [00:00:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (long pause) Again, that sort of inclines me to think that she makes you look pretty helpless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, she does better than to make me feel helpless.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I keep saying things like this and you keep telling me why, (pause) why that is wrong. (laughs) I really might be going on the same thing. But, I feel like maybe there's something else going one. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible] I, I think I'm sort of definitely stuck in this regard. There're like different pieces that I haven't been able to put together, to fit together yet. Because on the one hand, like I recognize that she sometimes says things that really upset me and it's a very small percentage of the time, but you know something a mother says is like ten times more impactful than something most people say (laughs). So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like (pause) you keep, it seems, it sounds to me like you're efforts in talking about her are like kind of ways you, you should be able to have more control over this or how you react to her or should be sturdier in things on how she treats you. And I keep pointing to how vulnerable it sounds to how you feel with her and I like, you keep moving away from that pretty quickly or telling me it's not so. And, then it could be that I'm just wrong in what I'm saying in, that happens a lot (laughs). Also, it has a feel to me of you trying to like distance yourself from the vulnerability to her. I keep saying it feels to me like what you have. You kind of like keep pushing me back and pushing back this idea about the extent of her to tower over you, which I guess that makes it the other book, but yeah. [00:00:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah I think I still do feel guilty like saying negative things about her. And I think there's sort of an ideal thing that happens when you become and adult where, I mean it's like a later life version of what Melanie Kriner talks about with recognizing the mother as the good breast and the bad breast, sometimes bad, sometimes not. It's like something like that is supposed to happen in your 20's where you see your parents as people with flaws.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you stop splitting them and you achieve a depressive position.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you see them as more balanced in a [inaudible] sort of way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That's supposed to happen and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It happens very inconsistently or with (pause) like, it's quite variant in the ways doesn't happen for most of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it's hard for me to gain it to that degree that it's happened because I sort of recognize that to have a healthy adult relationship with my parents I need to change the way in which I view them. And I know that have certainly a lot, but I don't know if I've achieved the depressive position yet (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the idea that I know what I'm supposed to do and perhaps have failed to do it bothers me. Because like what's the point of reading all these books and knowing how these processes work if I can't even do them? Obviously like if, you know academics would all be very healthy happy people if that were the way things worked and they're obviously not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Probably myself and my colleagues would be all out of jobs (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) You'd probably go to the library instead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:00:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause), I guess I repeated to you, but I see that fantasy of how much control you feel you should have over this through the exercise of you intellect as (pause) symptomatic of the kind of helplessness that you feel. Am I, is that making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I, I guess I suspect you feel, yeah I mean so that here with me now in addition to obviously in much bigger ways, your like, actual mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I agree. You could push me something that I'll eventually feel guilty about saying. (long pause) But I'm still not clear about whether I should feel guilty about saying it or not. Or whether I, what I say, it's still not clear to me exactly how I feel about this. (long pause). I mean I think we've all seen models of people blaming their parents in sort of unfair and unkind and unhelpful ways. I think it's easy to see that as a powerful counter example. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably should. [00:00:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) I mean something seems very depressing about being critical, too critical of and angry towards someone who loves you and wants the best of you and has spent their life trying to make that happen and has made that the centerpiece of their life. To a degree that was almost, you know I almost wish she had kept up with her other interests more; tried less hard to be the best mother to me. It puts a certain amount of pressure on me as a daughter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes it does. I mean, (pause) in describing to me how much sort of nudging and pushing of various kinds you've felt from her about things she's wanted you to do and you're also describing the way that she frames it. (pause) I don't think I've ever heard you describe the point that she's made or something that she's wanted you to do in a way that suggests that it was actually up for discussion between you. I'm not saying she's never done that, but I'm saying you've never talked about her that way here where, you know, she said, "Well, you know gosh it seems like this would be good for you, but what do you think, or is that all right, or you know, what do you have to say about it?" Or, "my opinion is this, but," at least the way you've described it to she tells you how it is and what's best. [00:00:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's funny because I don't think she's one of those people that, some people just always think they're right and think like that God gave her the gift of reason and no else and she's not one of those people. She feels responsible to think things through to come up with the best solution and give that to me. And because just not because of her superior neurosis it's like she thinks like she's being helpful and giving me the gift of her effort, but it doesn't make it much...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of the feeling is a type of worry, more so than like arrogance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, she's a pathological person who tries as hard as she can with whatever she's doing no matter what it is. Like she just has to give it her best effort and like thoroughly think it through and, I mean, no corners are ever cut. Like she's just so thoroughly honest, like they wouldn't even sign a lease to, that had one provision that wasn't true that the [inaudible]. You know this is just made for show. Everyone finds that, they refused to sign the lease of the house they wanted because it would have been dishonest even though it didn't matter. And there's some connection between honesty and singular truth that seems to me not to be essential, but to her somehow is. Like there has to be a best answer. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems like to me that you kind of have to deal with a burden of an ambiguity on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I should not deal with it and just do the right thing (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, I'm not sure that's the role you generally live in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean having read a bunch of deconstructionist theory (laughs) it's impossible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I kind of suspect it goes back to (laughs) maybe I could be wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, even if I wanted to read the stuff in the first place (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p><br>
 THERAPIST: But we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p><br>
 CLIENT: I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you then. Take care.</p>

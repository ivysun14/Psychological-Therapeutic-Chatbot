<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hey, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You doing good then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess I'm doing fine.  I didn't end up bringing that picture, I just figured that uh, I don't know, I was thinking that maybe on some things like, I should just like, I don't know, get over them almost.  Like I, I don't know how that, I don't know, I was thinking I should just be able to not sit there and like dwell on something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The way to get over those memories is not to push them away, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The way to get over the memories is just to go back and remember them, and then confront them, and feel the same feelings you had back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The fears and, that's what you have to do, so if, if you could have the memories and talk about what those memories are then the feelings will come.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are the memories you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now, like not really any of them, I really hadn't thought about, I really had thought about it, and, uh, I don't know, until I came back here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it hasn't been, like on your mind, or bothering you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't, I don't know, I don't know how that happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because last time it seems like —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was like, disturbing to you, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, I had, I had trouble, I, I definitely —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did something trigger it?  Did some —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm not sure.  But that time that I came in here, that definitely uh, I had definitely had a, a flashback, only, I told you it was almost the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whole night.  Yeah, so I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But since then it hasn't recurred?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I'm actually, like today I've been like a little bit of, just trouble getting to sleep real well last night, I ended up not getting sleep until 7:00 in the morning, it was just a bad night to sleep, I'm not sure why I had it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What was on your mind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trying to get to sleep, or actually, getting up, I had to get up early today and wake up, it's stupid, but like I went shopping all day yesterday, I had to go shopping with my girlfriend yesterday to go get some shoes, okay?  It's like that was kind of boring, you know?  And then like I had to end up getting up early this morning to go do the same thing, and like, I don't know, I just couldn't sleep, I was like this is going to be so boring.  I know, it's kind of lame, but that's what happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So just the anticipation of it being boring disturbed you enough that you couldn't sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of, it was just like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it possible that it was something like you didn't want to do, but you felt compelled to do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably like that.  That's more like it was, I was kind of like sucked in the situation, so I mean, I want to go out through it like, to see one of my friends last night, so I was out until like, you know 2:00 in the morning, but I mean, that's not that late really, I, maybe it is, I don't know, but I came back, I just couldn't sleep, I was like this is going to suck tomorrow —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you really didn't want to do it, but you felt forced into it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess you could say I felt forced into it, sometimes I just have to do things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well she, she reciprocates though —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, that's what I mean, like that's why I don't want to like sit here and like complain about it, you know, but at the same time, like yeah, like I don't know why I couldn't, so like, I'm, I'm just a little like, I guess like, not totally there, like I only got like two or three hours of sleep last night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well what's been on your mind then if, if the flashbacks haven't occurred, what, what thoughts have you had, or feelings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, um, I don't know, like I, I came to the conclusion and realized that I really don't have anything to do for three years, like as far as school is concerned.  Yeah, I uh, did, have I come in here and told you about my plan to become paramedic, or a firefighter, or any of that at all?  Like I started to, you now, speak to people and get enrolled in courses for like the semester after I graduate, become a paramedic and I still have to finish this bachelor degree at [DEIDENTIFIED] so I have a whole another semester at [DEIDENTIFIED], right, so I have six months to do that, and then a whole another year of paramedic classes.  So, you know, getting out of college, I'm not going to, you know, necessarily get straight to what I want to do, so I just kind of realized I had three more years of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I found, yeah, I found what I wanted to do, but unfortunately it was at the end of my bachelor's, like degree of which, I guess it's not bad, to get a, uh, degree, you know, for than like, that's actually pretty good, it, it, it actually like, I'm proud of that accomplishment, but I just kind of sit there and was like, wow, I have three more years that like I don't get to start my career, you know, I was kind of, I was kind of  looking forward to like, figuring out like, I thought when I had my idea for a career I would be able to start it, but now it's like, at least I know what career I want to take, it's, now it's waiting o get there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What made you certain that this is like the career?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, well, probably, like I've always wanted to do something with emer, emergency medicine, always.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, I don't really have like the money and I don't really necessarily want to become like an emergency room physician or a physician so I figured like, I kind of just want to like, I don't know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about a nurse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Live the dream, well, you know, like with the time, with the time I was thinking maybe with the time that I have like free, as a firefighter, like, I might be making too much money but at the same time, like I'm not really like, I don't like to get a lot of stuff, I'm not like real, trying to get materials, that's just how I am, but so like with that money I save maybe I could end up, you know, getting a nursing degree while I'm a fire fighter and a paramedic.  So I mean, like, I think that would be, uh, a real great help for people and you know, as a firefighter and a career to be a nurse that's also a paramedic, you know, that goes out and does things, you know, that, that does, excuse me, but like goes out and like someone is injured in a, a car wreck, you know, and, and a nurse on site would be pretty nice, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See the benefit of nursing is you know, first of all I think, any career would be greater.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Than a paramedic, also I think you can have more options as to what you want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the nursing capacity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really want to be a firefighter though.  Like, like a firefighter is what I want to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See what I know about firefighting is that sometimes you have to get into departments and you need to know people to be able to get into departments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Its not, it, it, see nursing, there are jobs everywhere —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they're actually giving bonuses you know, to people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the job, uh, uh, availability is greater, firefighters and paramedics, I, did you research how easy it is to get jobs in that field, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's pretty tough, I know, because I have a friend —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a friend who is, who has been trying to become a firefighter for years, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he can't do it because he can't get into the departments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I mean they only hire like every 10 years or what not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's kind of why I want to be a paramedic, it's because like, I'll have a bachelor's degree and I mean, that's not, definitely firefighting that won't guarantee me a job, because like, you know, uh, academics doesn't necessarily have that much to do with school, but like I'll have a bachelor's degree and I'll be a, a paramedic too, which is, which is something that like a lot of fire departments are actually look, looking for is paramedics, because like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wonder if you can do both, I mean, get a paramedic and a nursing license at the same time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm saying, like I want to, I want to be able to, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they have a good, [DEIDENTIFIED] has great nursing program —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But out where you are, there's a [DEIDENTIFIED], also has a —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's where I was going to get my paramedics —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Certificate from, was from there, yeah.  And I was thinking like, if I could just, lay a job, like I do have some pretty good connections, like my girlfriend's uncle is a, some form of a battalion chief or something in the city of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he's a firefighter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like he's like, he has like some pretty good connections there and like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I do know a lot of people who are firefighters that, because I've always stayed in contact with him, because I kind of was talking always about doing this, but like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you talk to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I definitely have, and like he's definitely like, he's like, okay, you're in this bachelor's program, like that's great and everything, but he's like you got to become a paramedic now a days, you just have to become one, and like a lot of firefighters are like, or fire houses are looking for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's kind of what I want to do, like, I don't want to necessarily to just be a firefighter, I would like to be like be like the firehouse's paramedic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's kind of what I want to do, but like I'm stuck at this point, you're right, it's hard to become one, like some places, like in [DEIDENTIFIED] every ten years they hire —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So like it's three years until I'm eligible and then, who knows, you could, I could have like my paramedics degree, and like two or three fire science associates degrees that go with that.  I could have all that and a bachelor's degree and just be sitting around waiting, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but the connections from what I understand make a tremendous difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Although I don't really know if you want to work in [DEIDENTIFIED], that's a rough place to work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's kind of where I would want to work, to be honest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, that's like where I, either there —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You would have to live there, you wouldn't want one of the suburban —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I would rather live like in the city and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do, do some work there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's hard, that's hard work, I wouldn't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely, I wouldn't, I wouldn't doubt it whatsoever.  Like I kind of want to, I don't know, I would like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a bit of challenge, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm young, so I feel like I have a like bigger enough to, to like, it's going to tough, like I, I have no doubt in my mind that like, working in [DEIDENTIFIED] would hard, not only physically to deal with things, but like that's a big city, who knows how much stuff goes on there, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I, I'm feeling that if I'm young I might be able to have like the vigor to handle all that, and then like once I get older, like, in ten years or something like that, after working in the city, like maybe move back out to the suburbs —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have experienced all that, paid my dues, you know, done the hard, like I won't say the hard stuff, it's all hard, but like, you know, get my experience when I'm young, kind of do that, so I'm still trying to figure that with firefighting, but like that, that's what I want to do, it's just like now, it's just like, all right, I got to, you know, I got to be smart about what I'm doing, you know, you know, definitely stay, stay out of trouble, that's one thing, you know what I'm saying, like, I'm definitely like, I don't think I'm a trouble maker, but like, got to be smart if you're going to be a firefighter, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you're not boxing anymore, so that's a plus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus, you're still doing the bartending, where you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you haven't had, getting into trouble with it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No I, definitely don't, in a way, like, like, I'm actually going to probably get to, like not, I'm probably going to stop doing that because I can't really catch like, I can't afford to catching any sort of like a legal case, like at all, like I don't want to deal with, you know, who, who threw the first punch even if you did the first thing, you know what I'm saying?  Like just dealing with the law is not fun, so, I don't need that.  I just want to get, keep straight laced right now and just get on, so like I'm preset, like as far as that's concerned.  Like, you know, I got a stable a girlfriend so I think that will help me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is really the first time in your life I think, that you had stable, isn't it, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well in high school, like the other day I was thinking about it like, I mean like in high school I had a lot of girlfriends and then in, you're right, stable as far as that, and then like when I went to college it, was just like,  I don't know, you could say, [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had different girls but, yeah —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's all it was —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's different about her?  What makes her —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, like, I just like, I don't know, who knows why people fall in love or whatever, like, it just happened, it's kind of what it is, so I'm, I'm fine with it, I definitely fine with and happy —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're serious about her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Definitely yeah, like that's, that's my girl, like that's probably going to be my girl for a while so, I'm not really going —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you, just out of curiosity, remember we talked about [NAME OTHER], and about that other girl —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were going to set him up, I talked to him about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And your parents were away for a weekend —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we talked about having a barbecue, but it never happened, did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, I didn't have the barbecue, um, it turns out that girl actually, she has a boyfriend now —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So [NAME OTHER] missed his chance, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well was he disappointed, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I don't, I guess —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because he said he liked her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, he did meet her a few times, I don't know, like I don't know what to do about that, like, the dude that this, this girl is dating will sit here and just like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you know him too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's cool, he's all right, he's an all right guy, but I mean, I'm just like, oh, her name is [NAME OTHER], I'm just like, oh, [NAME OTHER] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?  Let's see, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was like why are you going with that guy, whatever, just let her do her thing, but uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, [NAME OTHER] is somebody that you have to kind of push a little bit —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's so shy, I mean —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and he's leaving to go to school again soon, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he made the decision to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so like I think that, that, like I, that I [INAUDIBLE] a barbecue, like a going away barbecue would be really cool to do for him, you know what I'm saying, like being his brother, and like my family would be there, and make sure we get like, if I do that now, I can get a hold of some of his friends like, you know, a lot of his friends work full time, you know, like 40, 50 hours a week, so like maybe like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so if I can get a hold of them now, I would be like, look, come over in a couple weeks, you know, say bye to [NAME OTHER], that would be —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That would be pretty cool with me, maybe we should do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a surprise party for him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, you know, because he's leaving, and like, it's going to be kind of tough —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not until August though, I think right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's going to be kinds of tough, because we have to try to act like, my mom wants me to drive down there once a week, uh, once a month, excuse me, and stay down there with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just to make sure he's okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because he's going o be living by himself, and he hasn't done that before, and like, I don't mind doing that, but that's going to be tough, like as a far as like the drive and my car is like getting it's getting old, and that's a long trip, so, you know, I want to go down there, I love, I love [DEIDENTIFIED], oh my god, every time I go down there, I love, I love, every time I go down here it's something like, it's just so cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you go alone, or with your girlfriend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would probably go, I would probably take [NAME OTHER] with me, because like, it's a really cool, it's a cool place, like why wouldn't I take her there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, unless she has something going on back in town.  Like shoe shopping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you seem like [LAUGHING], you got frustrated with that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You seem, you seem in a good place, you seem confident, you feel like you have a direction, and, maybe we should just wait and  see what surfaces in terms of those memories.  I, you know, like I said, they're there somewhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But um, they're not pushing or anything, I don't know if we should try to push to uncover them, I mean —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not having any episodes of panic, or anxiety, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, sometimes like I, I do like, get like, like kind of like, like, I don't know, like almost like worked up, like I haven't had like a, a real panic attack in a while.  Like I had one, well, I can't, maybe like, it, it was a couple months ago, and I had when I was just laying bed and like, I just like, my chest was really tight, you know, like it's hard for me to breath and my heart was pounding, I just like had like this feeling of like, I, I don't know, like something was like, almost like on the other side of the door that could just like, snatch me up and take me away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, it was just like a full blown panic attack that I had, so like that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long, was that before I saw you last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was probably a couple months before the last time I saw you, I mean, yeah, just kind of thinking about it makes me nervous because I didn't know what was going on, and then uh, that was tough, but like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But recently nothing wrong with you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean, that's what I'm saying, like I had that, and then like this thing that happened the other night, where like, I couldn't sleep, I was having these flashbacks, it's like, these don't happen that often, but when they do they're just like, like, actually becomes really violent, sort of, kind of like scares me, disturbs me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, so like, I don't know when they're going to come, and they're not regular, but I guess like I'm trying right now in my mind to like confront, like, confront them, like I know it's probably going to happen again.  Like, you know, I, I know it's probably going to happen again, it's just like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well the question is do we wait for it recur, and then try to deal with what's, what's internal —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do we try to understand what's causing those memories to surface?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you know, you said you know, all the surgeries and things as a child —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you think back to that, is there a lot of fears, a lot of pain, in what you remember —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or you try not to think to it, and then —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well really, like for, like, like, that's what I, what I do, like I, I'm really truly like, disconnected from it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the best way I can put it, just like disconnected from it but like sometimes what happens is like, I've been disconnected from these feelings for so long, that when like, I really go back and remember like, this what happened like when I, remembered what I really felt like and how much pain I really was in, like it was like overwhelming, you know?  So, like for so long I can think about it right now and be like, well that really sucked, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But like that's kind of how I, I lean towards it but like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When it comes back and I like think about the feelings —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you want to keep it at an arms length, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about the medicine, does that help in terms of preventing those memories or feelings when they surfaced?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I don't know if, if medication, if, if medication does it, I mean, I don't, I don't know, man, like a panic attack sometimes, they come like in, they'll come in batches, sometimes it will be spread out, like, they're really random, they really are so random that like, I just try to like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you're on more medicine now than you've been before, so, I mean, have you had any since you've been on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was, I was taking everything when I had this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're still on the Depakote, you use the Depakote?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm still on the Depakote, well, I mean, now, I've been kind of slipping on, on my medicine, I left it at my house, like a while ago, and then I just, didn't necessarily get right back on taking it, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many days did you, did you miss everything or just —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I missed, I missed, pretty much everything —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For how many days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Man, it could have been a week.  Yeah, it could —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And did this with no problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no problems or anything, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess for like that week, I kind of was like a little, I was kind of depressed but like, I, I'm all right as far as like not being like too depressed, but at the same time, like, uh, I don't know, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it makes me wonder if we could reduce the dose a little bit if you were off for a week, and there's no —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Serious episodes, uh, no paranoid thinking, nothing like that, so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm not really —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not, high, on high doses of that, I don't think —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, on pretty much everything, like, like, from like I can tell like, they're pretty small pills and everything, so I don't think I'm taking like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depakote is twice a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Once, 500 mg and at night, so I'm taking —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or in the morning, excuse me, I used to take it at night like a long time ago, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But yeah, like, um, I guess that, that's what's going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But which ones could we lower?  The Vyvanse we can't lower.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but this —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depakote, well we could try 250, but, what else?  The Sero, Abilify, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm taking Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ten mg, so I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That one we might be able to cut in half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You think?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We can go to 5 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And then I'm taking uh, the Wellbutrin, 300 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, why don't we try going to five of the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you have the tens, and you can break them in half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I have 20s, and then I can break those —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, 20s.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I believe that it's 20s that I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many do you have left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, a lot, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot, okay.  You can't break those in quarters.  Um, well, you can do it every other day, like take 10 every other day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like I, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless that's too confusing for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I can handle, I can handle doing that definitely, it's just that like, some days too, like some days like, I don't know, everybody has this shit, and that like, not every, I don't know if everybody has it but like, I don't know, some days I'll feel like I, I need to take my medicine, other days, like I don't.  That's not a good habit to get into, whatsoever.  I totally know that, but like, I don't know, some days I do take it, and like I still have, uh, I don't know like, I think I'm getting , I think I'm getting a look at, cope a lot of like the depression that I have right now, but like at the same time, like, I don't know, like, why, why I even struggle with depression, like what's, it's probably like what's the question that keeps on through my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well part of it is, is genetics, and you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it probably really is [INAUDIBLE], that's what frustrates me about it so much, is that like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean the only way we'll know is if you're consistent, and you know, for a period of time, maybe you just try to be consistent for a period of time and see —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With medicine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, with the medicine, because you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I, like oh, man, I was consistent for a long time until just very recently, like I started slipping on that and messing up, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean, yeah.  I don't know, it frustrates me about depression, I had to accept that, that like, I don't feel like, like the problem that I had with it is like I don't feel like I have anything to be depressed about but I still am, so like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes me like mad, and depressed in myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's part of your chemistry, it's not something you can control, it's part of your chemistry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And makes you feel that way.  So when you think about it, with, with the medicine you're much better, I mean, you don't have self destructive thoughts anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, I mean you're living, you're, you're enjoying your life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I guess I enjoy my life, like as much as I possibly can, you know, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you enjoy the relationship with the girlfriend, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You thinking about doing a barbecue for your brother, I mean, you know, you're, you're involved with things —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're looking forward to the paramedic program.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am, I mean like yeah, I guess, maybe I'm not really depressed as I think, but, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you do to substitute for the boxing in terms of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I train, I train a fighter now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like my friend, yeah, she'll —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we talked about maybe another sport that you would get interested in, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you wanted me to start swimming, I'm telling you —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Swimming is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, like I would, I'm actually probably going to go swimming today at the [DEIDENTIFIED] with my, with my friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, why don't you get into swimming, swimming is wonderful exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The best natural antidepressant is aerobic exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I 'm telling you, when I used to box I felt really good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but I meant like, about like swimming —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know you don't want me to box though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you do that, because at [DEIDENTIFIED] they have got the pool access over the summer don't they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They have an indoor pool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They have two of them up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, why don't you get into swimming laps?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Man I want to, something else that happens.  Let me tell you, the, the one thing that, the worse problem that I have, is that like sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and like I won't even want to get out of bed, that's my problem.  But like once I get out, if I get out, man, I'm good, you know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what does it depend on the day before?  Does it have to do with not taking your medicine, or is it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don' t think, I, I have no idea, like actually well, it, well, maybe it does because I  some days if I don't have the, if I don't have my Vyvanse with me, like I'll just be like dragging all day, you know, because like at this point in my life I've taken that for like 5 years, but like, some days I'm just tell you like, even if I do have like my Vyvanse and everything, I just don't really want t do anything, and like, it's not like, that's not how I want to be, to be honest, like, that's something that I'm going to just have to just confront and work on, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But does it have to do say, with the night before, missing your medication?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't have to take anything at night, I don't take any medicines at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is everything —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did take one, a couple, a couple maybe a week ago and so I had to take a, a Seroquel at night, it like put me to sleep like, to go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just then leave it though, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's how I've, I've had those for a long time, like those —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or maybe part of that feeling is, is the lack of proper sleep at night when you feel so bad in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I think it's that, and like I, I, there's a lot of things that I, that I could do —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would be curious, why don't we keep the medicine the same, and you, you have a bunch of the Abilify, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I mean like it's work, like everything at least is like decent, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm saying like, I'm, I'm getting —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't we, why don't you try to get some within a regular basis, and if you do, maybe we'll start looking at tapering, you know, the Abilify next time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll go from 10 to 5.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, do you need a refill on anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not, let me come back and like check, because I have all my medicines at, there at my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well we only met, we, we met like two weeks ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to do two weeks, or do you want to go longer than two weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I think you have enough for two weeks, I know, because they, I gave you a prescription —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm going to have to come back in two weeks because of like, yeah, my medicine and everything.  I'll, I'll come back in two weeks, I think I'm making like, as far as what's happened, like, since the last time I've come here, like, I think some like things are working out well, I would like to just, keep up with you, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I'm saying, just get through this thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let's do that next time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I appreciate it.</p>

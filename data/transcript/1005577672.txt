<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You shouldn't have to bend over and, you know, touch the dirty doorstop. Just use your foot if it's too far in. (pause) Today I'm a little anxious. I imagine that's the coming down on the Prozac. I don't really see anything else that's changed other than my behavior, you know, the anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (pause) [00:01:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is completely ridiculous. You know, it's not like I'm anxious over things I should be anxious about. (pause) It didn't help writing a birthday card. It was Marcia's birthday on Wednesday and I got her a bamboo plant. I wasn't going to get her anything but Paige said you should get her flowers or a plant the day of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which was a good call. (laughs) She really liked that. And then I'm taking her out to dinner tonight. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I figured I had to get her something tonight as well. In fact, I was going to get her something tonight and Wednesday, and [give a gift] (ph) Wednesday. Paige had suggested the whole dog bed, gate, you know, to make the dog comfortable at my apartment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which originally I thought was a really good idea. But then I'm like, you know, she's too stressed out about the whole thing. I don't even want to bring it up, you know, in that context. It's her birthday and, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is she stressed out about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's stressed out about the dog - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - coming over because the dog broke out, you know. So the gate kind of is a solution to that but it's not a, I don't know, as a birthday present that's - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. So then, you know, all the money I dropped on, you know, the bamboo. I think it cost more to deliver these things than to actually pay for the plant. Not quite, but it's close. And so I ended up getting her, you know, some sun stuff from the Mary Kay lady. Like sun block and after sun and whatever ladies put on their skin from the sun. So I don't know if she'll like it or not. You know, the Mary Kay people have their preferences or whatever. [00:03:38]</p>

<p>But I also, she put in a bottle of bubbles. It's in a little pail with a little shovel, and this little stuffed puppy dog. I slipped in about twenty dollars' worth of scratch tickets. She likes scratch tickets. (laughs) And some vodka nips. (laughs) So, you know, I've got to get a card too. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I just like write on it, "Happy Birthday, Cameron." You know? Can I get away with that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have no idea. You don't study this stuff in psych school. (pause) Are you trying to figure out whether you should answer the question or not, or trying to figure out what the answer to the question is? [00:04:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I know I'm not going to answer the question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) (sigh) (laughs) Micah would give me an answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I bet she would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it would probably be the exact opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what are you going to do? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well. (long pause) I don't know. (pause) [00:06:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just a birthday card. You know? I haven't even gotten it yet. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes you kind of uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I want to, you know, I don't know, not fuck it up. It's part of my anxiety. You know? (pause) What's fucked up is I have a closing at three o'clock in Watertown that I - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Oh, that's funny. Is that where you're meeting her. Oh yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll take her to the Big Bubba's BBQ (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, in Andover? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. Well you can walk there. It's, you know, I live there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's my favorite restaurant so it just kind of works out perfectly. [00:07:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the reality is that it probably doesn't make a difference what I do. You know? But that's not going to stop me from, you know, being anxious over it. Like the scratch tickets. She's going to love the scratch tickets. You know? But did I get too many? You know? You know, I don't know what's appropriate. So -  (pause) I have no anxiety whatsoever about the nips, the bubbles or the little doggie. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Are you sure about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or the pail and the shovel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's kind of like a summer theme going on there. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The sun stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure how the scratch tickets fit in. But, you know, nips for the beach, bubbles, sun stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pail and bucket.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stuffed dog. (sigh) (long pause) I've been thinking about the whole kid introduction thing. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I asked my lawyer and she was no help. She was like, "You know, when you decide to get married." I'm like, "Well she doesn't want to get married. You know? Ever." (inaudible at 00:10:18) That's what she says, but still, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like she's like, "Well then just keep it separate. Separate lives." I was like, "Are you kidding me?" You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she does this from her own personal experience instead of like experience with clients really. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just her kids got divorced or whatever so she's got like the grandparent perspective of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just like, you know, I'm not doing that. And that's like a weird -  It also, for example, you know, Saturday night we went to a friend of hers down at Burnley. And her family, it was like her brother and sister, was at the brother's house. And she's like really close with the family. She dated one of the brothers in the family who has now passed away. But it's like, you know. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>Arya's like, "Yeah, she should have the last name Anderson (ph)." She's like, "Yeah, she's a Anderson (ph)." You know? So I sent them an e-mail. You know, you've got to work the friends, right? So, you know, I thanked him for having me over, whatever. And he's like, "Hey, you've got to - "You know, he's got kids. He's like, you know, "You've got to bring the kids down for a barbecue and the pool," or whatever. So it's like there's an expectation beyond just her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know. And it's been like two years that the kids have had to adjust to me not living at home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. (coughing) And, I mean, I feel to a large part that, you know, now is too soon for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know why I'm thinking about it. It just, you know. Probably because I want to talk to Jess about it and, you know, get her take on it. You know? (pause) I mean, you're backing me, but I know that doesn't matter. (laughs) [00:12:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's right. You're going to be accountable for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just didn't understand. Oh, with my backing - You mean, in other words, you'll tell Jess that I said whatever you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 00:12:41). (laughs) Well just about, you know, I can do whatever I want. But it's true. (pause) There are just too many things that -  I mean, number one, I think that puts an added stress on me to juggle, you know, time with each, you know. Especially since Ian and Lucille aren't exactly at an age. Ian gets his time but I've got to have like Lucille directed time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't understand because it's like I go over there and it's like, well I'm over there, you know, I've really got to kind of give Lucille her - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - you know. But this is way too complicated and stupid, if you ask me. I mean, it doesn't make sense. You know, it's like, well they're young kids. But it's like, yeah, I don't know. I mean, is there really some potential psychological damage because -  You know? </p>

<p>It's not like I'm going to, you know, make out in front of the kid or anything like that or, you know. Not intentionally. (laughs) Not sober. (laughs) But, you know, like I'm taking Ian to a game on Sunday. [00:14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And there's a bunch of people who are coming out and tailgating. And why would that be something that I would have to pick and choose who I want to go to that with when I should be able to take both. (pause) And Ian is going to see texts and he's going to see phone calls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What test?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A text message.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, your phone has this feature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've had a long week haven't you. Heat's getting to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because twice now you've had an audio, audible dysfunction. Or maybe it could be my mumbling. I'm a mumbler. So - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause) [00:15:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my phone's on. (pause) Yeah the realtor is pissed about the closing being in Watertown. And he's like, "How did you let them schedule it in Watertown?" I'm like, "I didn't care." I said, "The only thing I cared about is that they were going to be able to get the wire out for the payoff today."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if it's easier for them to do that by having the closing in their office, filing the documents electronically, sending out the wire - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - then to me there's no difference from Rotterdam to get back to Andover - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Than from Watertown.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - than from Watertown to get back to Andover. It's the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. So I didn't care. (laughs) And he's like, "You asshole." (laughs) Because he lives in Haverford. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where's that? That's north.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's north of Augusta (ph). So he's got to go from Watertown.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, probably getting back into Manchester, not a big deal. But getting back to Haverford - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - a pain in the ass. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But from Rotterdam to Haverford, no problem. (laughs) [00:16:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he's like (laughs), he calls me up and he's like, "I'm leaving the keys to the house with the registry in Rotterdam. I'm leaving the smoke certificate in the registry in Rotterdam." (laughs) It's like, "If they want it, they're coming to Rotterdam." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Listen, it's at three. We're not going to be there more than fifteen minutes. You know? Here's the deed, sign a few documents, you get your check, I get my check, give them the seller's check and go." And they're morons too. Oh my God. They're fighting with me over stupid stuff. You know?</p>

<p>Because her name when she brought the property was "Bamford" and it's now "Morris." So you've got to do "Lucy Morris, formerly known as Lucy R. Bamford," because she's holding title in "Bamford" but she's now "Morris." So she's going to sign it "Lucy Morris." They want me to have her sign it "Lucy Morris, formerly known as Lucy R. Bamford." [00:17:13]</p>

<p>I said to him, but that's not her signature. You know, this is a signature which, in the state of Massachusetts, is whatever you intend to be bound by. She could put an "X" and that's good enough. I don't have to call the registry. I said, "They're not even going to look at her signature. They're going to see there's a signature there and they're going to accept it because there's a notary. There's an acknowledgement. That's what the whole purpose is."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I saw this person put ink on paper and say, 'Yeah, I did this voluntarily.'" I'm like, "How many years have you been out of school." "Well, let me ask," you know, "accountant Heston who graduated school in 2004, he's got five closings today, I think he should know." "I don't know." </p>

<p>And because they had a problem in land court where they're very particular about how the document states a/k/a's and formerly known as because, you know, you just can't write it on. Everything's got to be typed on. But the signature doesn't have to say that. [00:18:14]</p>

<p>So I'm like, "Yeah." I'm like, "No. This is the deed you get." I'll type on there on the signature line "formerly known as," whatever. And I did that for that. But it still doesn't make a difference. She's Lucy Morris and that's how she signed the document. It states at top that she was formerly known as. That's enough. There's no reason to put that recorded (inaudible at 00:18:38) that document. </p>

<p>And he's like, "Well, if they reject it." I'm like, "If they reject it, fine. I'll get you a new one." It'll cost my client thirteen hundred bucks, I thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they reject it again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because we wouldn't be able to wire out the funds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We wouldn't be able to get a new deed signed in time. So, it's stupid. Now watch, the Rotterdam registry is going to reject it. And I wasn't even, I was just like, "No, you're wrong."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just, you know, I didn't say, "You're wrong," but I said, "That's just not how it works." You know? (pause) I'm going to get paid. [00:19:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is good because I've got all these estimated taxes. I've got a bunch of money sitting in my account but I have a feeling it's going to stay there this weekend. (laughs) You've got to eat, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: June mortgage payment coming up. (laughs) (pause) I didn't work out on Wednesday. Tuesday night I was nauseous. Was it Tuesday night? Thursday night. Wednesday I was nauseous and didn't do my workout, but I still went out. Yeah, Tuesday night I went out to Handball and got sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh. [You were nauseous?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I felt really nauseous. Yeah, very nauseous. Which I was like, "Is this withdrawal or is this, you know, dehydration?" And I figured it was probably a little of both. [00:20:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And so I got there, I laid down for a little bit, tried throwing the disk, and even just throwing the disk I got just too nauseous to stand up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I hung out for a while and then biked home. And then I missed handball yesterday because I just had to work because I overslept. I slept until like ten thirty because I went out Wednesday night with a buddy who was like, you know, "Let's just go out for a few drinks in your neighborhood." You know? "I've got to leave by like eleven, eleven thirty." We closed the bank. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, one thirty or whatever, I don't know. Then he came back to my place and I made pasta at like two in the morning. So he overslept surprisingly and I overslept as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then Wednesday, which I had nothing to do, no work, nothing, I was slammed yesterday. I left the office at like six thirty, seven. [00:21:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had to go up to Brantford (ph) to get the little pail, the little bucket.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was weird, but I guess that means I've got stuff to do. (long pause) Marcia has said a couple of times -  [00:23:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - at least when she's come over that I'm, you know, kind of nervous or anxious - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT:  - or whatever, when she first gets there. Which I haven't noticed but she's picking up on something. She kind of thinks it's funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you certainly sound - </p>

<p>CLIENT: When I go meet her somewhere she doesn't pick it up or sense it or I'm not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you may kind of assume that people are often like kind of going to be dicks to each other. Or just do what they want regardless of the other person. I think. Like that, you know, this is your place, you feel a little bit on the spot if Marcia's over. And maybe you are nervous because you have some worry that she's going to say something, or she's going to be critical. [00:24:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm always worried about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the same thing that happens with, you know. Like she's like, "Well, where are we going?" And I was like, "Big Bubba's BBQ." And I was like, "Oh, I shouldn't have texted that, I should have - " You know, I don't know what I should have done. You know? I guess I'm expecting some, you know. But instead it was, "Oh, awesome. I heard that place was good. I'm looking forward to it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never get the critical. You know, it's usually something the opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, I guess that's kind of like figuring out what to say on the card too or the things in the present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. (pause) That's how Jess trained me because she was critical of everything, initially.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's just that. I mean, that may be part of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why can't I blame Jess?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go ahead. [00:25:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can be probably critical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but why should that affect how I think about other people?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you might assume they're going to be the same way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm. (pause) Well I'm trying not to be like critical or negative with Marcia. I'm trying to say nice things and complimentary things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? You know, even like the whole like the "douche bag" comment. You know? I was joking but I, you know, I guess go too far sometimes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not being critical though. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Calling her friends "douche bags?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughs) I immediately, you know, set out joking. You know? [00:26:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess, you know, you see that I come across, sort of like (laughs) "Your friends are douche bags." It's probably something I should have told her first and she would probably hit me. She tried to hit me once, I'm not really sure why. She's not sure either. She was just like *bumph*. (sound of hitting) </p>

<p>She said she's a black belt in karate or whatever. So I've challenged her several times and she has not stepped up. So we'll see. She's threatened me many times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's five feet tall. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:27:51). I don't have long enough arms to do that, but I can do that to Ian. He peels away though. You know, he doesn't -  </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It shows he's not that sort of bull mentality. You know? Some kids just keep going forward. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like Lucille would probably keep going forward. You know? She doesn't know any better. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm smiling because that's also what you try to do to me all the time. (laughs) Yeah. (pause) [00:28:58]</p>

<p>(tapping sounds)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When I have thing to say. Not all the time, often. (pause)</p>

<p>(tapping sounds)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it's often because it feels as though I'm - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Being critical?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Exactly. I think it's something that you - </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can't take criticism? Or I just don't want to be criticized because I can't take criticism.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels to you like what I'm saying is a criticism although it isn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's because my Mom criticized me when I was a kid. Is that why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I don't know. I mean at the moment what we were talking about is how - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want to be able to blame my Mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - with people, like you anticipate criticism or you become critical. It may be your Mom's fault. I mean, you be right. It seems plausible. I don't know. (pause) Yes? [00:30:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. How long have I been coming here? Shouldn't you have figured that out by now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You never talk about, I mean, you talk about your Mom very rarely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I thought it was sort of central to figuring it out, I'd ask. But you bring her up very rarely. (pause) I guess, again, though you want to turn around and blame her because it feels like I'm sitting here blaming you. Which I'm not aware that I'm doing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not taking responsibility for something and I'm pushing it off on someone else. You're not aware that you're doing that or I'm not aware? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think I'm being critical of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Probably true. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not trying like (inaudible 00:31:45) yourself or -  (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't mean you won't. (laughs) Maybe not intentional. Once again, that's my Mom's fault. (laughs) (pause) I had a blind put up in my office. I'm like, I've got to move forward with being more, you know. It's like you walk by my office and you just see this shit in the back part of it. You know? And you can't make privacy for clients.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And people are walking by waving to me and, you know. (pause) I've only been there a year. The sun comes through the windows and I can't see my computer. [00:32:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really hot. You know? So there probably should be blinds. Of course I like to put them on myself, but I'm not good at that stuff. Next is to get the name changed on the door, fix my website, which I've already set up a project to create a new page and I never responded except the time I was busy. And I gave them something that week and they finally took the project off the schedule and, "When you're ready let us know." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or let your rep know. (sound of an e-mail) It was interesting, I was just up in my mortgage brokers office dropping off a package and a check. And the guy who owns the business who, you know, has his own lawyers or whatever, was on the phone. [00:33:56]</p>

<p>And as I'm walking in just like this, you know, he's finishes talking. He's talking to a woman who is buying a condo. And he writes down her name, number, to call her by 4:45, and this is like 4:15. And so he just basically handed me one of his deals just because I was right there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it made me think I've got to find more reasons to just go up there other than, you know. (pause) Yeah, the beginning of July is going to be busy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A couple before the fourth or fifth I'm going to be out of town. (inaudible at 00:34:48), so I'm going to convince him he doesn't need me to be there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Great. (long pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you have no sort of guidelines as far as when Marcia should meet the kinds or at least Ian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. (pause) I guess - </p>

<p>CLIENT: He sees my Mom is remarried, he sees my Dad is remarried. You know? [00:36:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, look, there are sort of a few considerations. One is, you may already do this but I don't know, but you probably want to make sure, or like as best you can tell, that she's going to be around a while. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well that's why I don't want to do it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, if you were dating somebody for three weeks, you know, and you had no idea where it was going, I kind of wouldn't do that. And, you know, the other thing is to think about how you think it's going to affect them. In other words -  (pause) I just had another thought, but I'll finish this thought and then get to that one.</p>

<p>You know, think about them individually. Like how do you think it would affect them to meet her? Are they going to -  Would it upset them? You know, probably think about things like, yeah, Ian will be upset if he gets less time just you and him. You know? [00:37:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If she's around a lot and so it's not just you and him, but it's always you and him and her. Like that could be tough for him. And similarly for Lucille. And, I guess, is Ian going to worry that there's some other way, you know, she's going to have a lot of your time and pull you away from him. Like, are you going to be around as much? And stuff like that.</p>

<p>So, you know, I guess I would just sort of think about it from their point of view and imagine, what are they going to be worried about? What's going to upset them about it? You know, I - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, would they be concerned about the time if they did know or if they didn't know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well if they didn't know they wouldn't be. But, I guess, that is more along the lines of if you do introduce her to them or you tell them about her. You know, I would (inaudible 00:38:33) say, "Look, you might be worried that blah, blah, blah, but, you know, don't worry about it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because Lucille, you know, it's like I don't see the whole replacing Mommy thing because Lucille's never seen that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, she was months old when I left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's been two years for Ian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And Lucille really doesn't know anything else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm not worried about Lucille really at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? She doesn't come over. You know, I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? At least not now. So for her it probably will be completely normal. You know? I don't know. I should at least get Jess's, number one, what she's told Ian about the divorce.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, what her thoughts are. [00:39:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I haven't heard any, I mean sometimes kids also have a fantasy that their parents are really going to get back together. And it's a way of not kind of accepting that they're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I haven't heard you say anything like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he used to ask if I could sleep over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? He doesn't ask anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's would be unlike Jess to not sit down and explain something to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, you can ask him too if he's upset about it. What do you think about it? Maybe he'll say, "Oh, no. Daddy will be happy." I mean, you never know what he'll say. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean how do I even, you know, describe it to Ian. I mean, he doesn't know what dating is or any of that stuff. You know? (pause) [00:40:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Daddy's got a lady friend that he sees naked. (laughs) (pause) I mean I just see him completely ignoring me and going, "Yep. Uh huh. Can I use your phone? Watch TV. Get a juice box."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell him anyway. It may look like they're ignoring you, but it doesn't mean they actually are ignoring you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've read that somewhere. Do you think I should tell him now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not necessarily. (pause) [00:42:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh my God, it's almost going to be two months in a couple of weeks. (laughs) (pause) (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually, I do think you can probably blame your Mom for a lot of that stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No! (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As I think about it a little bit more, in that I think, you know, the way you kind of say people will be critical of each other and sort of a little mean even, and just out for themselves basically. I don't have the sense that she's necessarily critical or mean, but the way you describe it kind of comes across as like it's kind of all about her. You know? [00:43:12]</p>

<p>Even when it looks like it's supposed to be about you it's actually kind of about, you know, her. And that seems like maybe just a couple of doors down. So, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Three doors down?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe. We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I should work on a card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Thanks.</p>

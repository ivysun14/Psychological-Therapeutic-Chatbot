<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, Pause, Sigh) Well, a couple of things are on my mind that I, I don't know, I just feel that I have to uhm, get them out of the way before I can get back to where I was yesterday.  Uhm, and I don't know how much of it's concerned with the fact that uhm, I did finally decide on the girl who had come twice this week, interviewing for the job.  I mean, first she'd come just interviewing, then I wanted her to be with FSO so I could see how she was with the child.  And uhm, everything, she was there when I got home today, and everything that happened since then, would indicate to me that it's going to be fine.  But I think I'm just feeling very nervous about starting out on an unknown.</p>

<p>And uhm, FSO wanted to go to the park this afternoon, it was so nice.  I took them to a park, a, and it actually was one that we don't usually go to, but FSO's been dying to go to.  And so nobody was there that I know, and I don't know, so there I left FSO sort of in an unknown situation.  Uhm, I, a, and I don't know, I just, I, I suppose it's just mainly because she hasn't been with us very long yet — her name is FTM — uhm, well that's kind of on my mind.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking about another thing that might be because of uh, feelings (Sigh) coming out of what we're talking about here.  Uh, probably is more than out of starting with FTM, but, and, and it might literally be, too, because we're having a parents' meeting next week, and Mrs BBF wants us all to have exhibits, and I have the usual feeling of pressure that people are going to be looking over my room, and I want it to be a certain way that I always get, before any of these types of things, and I always have.  I think in a way I'm controlling it better now, or maybe I'm not feeling it so strongly.  But I still do feel it and it's partly that.</p>

<p>But then uh, today I was feeling very much, because it's next Wednesday, that I, there's certain things I want to do, and of course I didn't do them all.  And then, I hurried home, because I was on the late side, and I knew FTM would be waiting.  And there are a lot things I want to talk about with her, and show her, and so forth.  And of course I haven't done all that yet either, but it's all on my mind.</p>

<p>And uhm, before I left home, well, during the time that I was working after school, and then on my way home, and then when I was with FTM, an awful lot of things kept occurring to me that I must do this weekend.  And it's one reason why I brought the thing I carry stuff to school in.  Not that I needed much of it to come down here, but I just couldn't, we were leaving in a hurry, and I couldn't even think, well what do I need, so I just grabbed the whole thing.  Because I hadn't finished on the way home things I wanted to do in connection with school, because I have to write out a list of things for the girl, the aide that I have now, the uh, para-educable girl.</p>

<p>And uhm, and th—, and that was another thing, that I have to make a list for her.  She's had a few days to observe, and now we're structuring exactly what she's to do.  And uhm, but yet when I started on the subway, and there I was, now I had some time, and I could do some of all these things that I was thinking I had to do.  And, and it wasn't that I was at a loss of something to do, but I was thinking about, well what is it I have to do, where, what are all these things that I was just feeling so much pressure about?  And I couldn't, I mean, I could think of enough to keep me busy, but I couldn't think of enough to have made me feel such terrific pressure.</p>

<p>And uhm, so then I got the feeling, well, I've forgotten what I have to do, and I'm going to remember it too late.  But uhm, I don't know, then I, then I was thinking, but it's the feeling of forgetting, and uhm, or losing, which makes me then think, w—, it's a state of mind that I'm getting into as a result of things we've been talking about here, and not so much a result of really having a lot of things.  I mean, I do have a number of things that are unusual to remember and think about.  But uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, I think I'm feeling the usual tensions with somebody new starting with FSO, of uh, you know, just what will her relationship be?  Will I be replaced, and you know, feelings of that sort that I always feel.  And also, just will she be good with FSO, and do things the way I would like.  And you know, and i, in fact, replace me, the way I want to be replaced.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I don't know whether with this girl in particular, I'm feeling more pressure of sort of, I don't know exactly what I mean.  She's in a way very much what I wanted, because she's somebody who's  just taking a year off from what she'll be doing with her own life to come to PKW, and then she needs a job, and she's not afraid of work, and, and has the attitude, you do work, and so forth.  And this is a good way for her to have a job, eat, have some money, and yet, have time off, and so forth.  And uhm, in may ways she's not exactly from the u—,  same background as I am, but similar.  I mean, she considers she wants to be educated, and her mother's a teacher, as it turns out.  And I don't know, just, in many ways she's, her ref—, her frame of reference is very familiar.</p>

<p>And so, uhm, I, I think I almost have the feeling that at home I can't do certain things that otherwise, I mean, I can't use, for instance, "Oh I'm so busy.  I have so much work to do," because she knows what kind of work a teacher would have, since her mother's a teacher.  And, and not that I would be using it so much with her.  But just somehow, you know, kind of a whole uhm, I guess, role I play.  And it's not even that MSCZ is taken in by it either.  I, I don't know quite what it is, except somehow I have this feeling she's going to see through me if I try to uhm, pretend I'm something I'm not. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose, what it gets down to, is uhm, well with FDO, things were enough different, that it was very clear what, you know, sort of the separation uhm, that would be desirable.  And when she would be in her own room, or, you know, when she would be with us, and so forth.  And with this girl, it won't be so clear.  And then I think, maybe I'm just getting the feeling I can't, that she'll see through me because I won't be able to maintain a pretense of a kind of marriage that I don't have.  (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>Or, I, I, I don't know, it's even uhm, you know, th, that signs of my own insecurities, and things I do to make myself feel better, even if they're not necessary, will be very clear.  And then, what kind of authority will I have?  Because she seems to be quite well-adjusted, and I suppose that gives me even more of a feeling.  I like it on the one hand.  It makes me feel better about her being with FSO, but uhm, (Stomach growls, Sniff, 2-minute silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>I'm not sure about this, but, I mean, I'm inclined to think about FTM in a way that I'm realizing, you know, except for there are a number of things when I'm home with her I've got to remember to talk about with her.  And there's certainly no point in thinking of them here.  And I think I have a feeling of a temptation of wanting, or letting her — I think I've already said this too — come between MSCZ and me.  Uhm, and that maybe this is part of the feelings I'm having today, of, that are, I don't know, somehow I'm just feeling under some kind of pressure that I'm not able completely to define.</p>

<p>And uhm, and I, I, it just seems right now anyway, partly because of my inclination to think of her here, too, that I can just see at home, you know, instead of confronting more what's going on between MSCZ and me, and dealing with it.  To just kind of let situations arise, so FTM is there, and then I don't have to face things, because uhm, she's there to, sort of a buffer, or you know, keeping MSCZ and me apart.  (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, that's your plan.  But why do you want to uh, carry it out?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Uhm, well I can't think of any reason, except that it's a way, another way for me to attempt to keep things as they are.  (Pause) Or at least I think that's what's bothering me about it.  Uhm, because I can see how I won't do the things that are necessary for me to change, if, if I do do that.  And (Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>But it's also getting mixed up in, into just my o—, my own difficulty in directing people.  I mean I can be bossy and opinionated and all kinds of other things.  But when it comes down to, I am in the position to direct somebody, I have trouble.  And because then it involves being direct with them, and saying what I want.  And I, I think that's why I have trouble.  Anyway, I think that's getting mixed up into this too.  And uhm, deciding exactly what relationship I want with her, and want us to have as a family, on top of these other things.  Or maybe because of them, I, I don't know exactly.  But —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   In any case, you said you wanted to get these matters out of the way so you could get back to the issues of yesterday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Well, it's something I wasn't even thinking —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) And you're not getting back.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  (Pause) Because the way I, I start thinking, and I guess this is how I think it would work at home, too, is uhm, I keep thinking, well I've got to get this all out of the way, before I can get back.  And then of course, this can just go on forever, in the way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Except, it can't.  Eventually we'll both die.  Well, but the point is, it really can't go on forever, no matter how much you might like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence, Sigh) Well I'm thinking about the fact that, hearing you say that, uhm, I, I immediately started thinking, but I'd been feeling lately that I don't want to come forever.  Except, I began also finding that I could not imagine as well as I have been able to, or I did for awhile, not coming.  And I'm, I'm sort of back where I was awhile back, when I couldn't imagine not coming.</p>

<p>Uhm, (Pause) and it was almost like my attitude today, when I think about it, because I, I guess partly, I'm guessing this partly because I have such trouble right now, imagining not coming, a, and thinking of the feelings of pressure I had today, that I was looking at coming here today, you know, aside from being with you, which is so much of it, but just as a, escape from my problems, rather than coming to face them.  It was more to get away from them, in a, you know, sort of, I don't know whether it's in feeling that you take them over, as much as just sort of I'm getting away from them, th, this is an escape.</p>

<p>And uhm, (Pause) and I haven't really felt so strongly this way for awhile, at least I don't think so.  And certainly, the last few days I wasn't.  And I, I was just thinking about yesterday, and I don't quite know what mm, you know, sort of why I'd go back to it, unless it's, it's a way of my saying, yes, I feel the way we were talking about my feeling, which I could not admit I was feeling.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, in any case, you're tempted to have FTM come between you and MSCZ, and use her the way you describe.  But in fact, right now, and for some time, you are using me to come between you and MSCZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Yeah, a—, uhm, (Sigh) I'm not, well I know I'm asking sort of the question of, well then, what is it that I w—, don't want to face about my relationship with MSCZ, or what it could be, or something?  If I'm using you, and I don't know, somehow, your saying it that way, even if, I know we talked about it in those very terms before, but uhm, means something different to me this time.  I, I, at least, immediately, i—, i—, i—, sort of I felt well, now everything's going to mean, make more sense, if I think about it in that way, instead of thinking about it as I have been the last few days, of uh, I do have these feelings of wanting a relationship with you that I'm finding very difficult to admit I have.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then, you know, trying to admit that I do feel that.  (Sigh) Because then it was always as if, well, what can I do, I have these feelings?  And if I admit them, well there I am.  A, and, and thinking about it as using you, and then it implies keeping myself feeling these feelings, on purpose, and choosing to.</p>

<p>And uhm, I, a,a, and then I guess I think of 2 possibilities right away, why I do that.  And one is, w—, or, I'm wondering, one is uhm, (Sigh) — well I'm just having a hard time even thinking about it — one is wondering, I know, whether or not I can stand not having you between us.  So then I have to see, can I sustain a relationship.  And uhm, you know, function as a woman, and so forth.  (Sigh) Because somehow by doing it this way, I'm still evading full responsibility for myself, as a grown woman.</p>

<p>And then the other possibility I guess I was thinking about is, it keeps me from facing whether or not I want to, with MSCZ.  (Pause) Maybe your saying it that way means something more to me too, because uhm, lately I've had a feeling, and I think I said so the other day, or maybe I didn't know, think of it quite this way, but I haven't had the same feeling that I've had before when we've talked about feelings I might be having toward you, or fantasies.  Or uhm, lately I've just, you know I've been having trouble saying yes, I feel that way.  And I kept thinking well, maybe in part it's because this is putting it in more direct terms than I've ever tried to before.  You've been putting it in more direct terms than you ever had before.  Uhm, and I, I think that's probably true, that that's part of it.</p>

<p>But then on the other hand, I, I, I don't know, I had this feeling of, but I don't, it's not real anymore in quite the way that it used to be.  And I don't, I don't mean to because I think, well maybe I do mean to, I don't know.  Uhm, I mean I think that I have been having feelings that I still haven't wanted to admit I have, but uhm, somehow I have this feeling I'm working harder at having those feelings, or something like that.  Uhm, j—, or just, I don't know, it just seemed I began to think, yes, I am choosing to continue to feel towards you in a way that will then mean that you've come between MSCZ and me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm remembering I guess yesterday, uhm, a little bit, not the full of it.  But where I was talking about something, and it, well I, I guess it was my response, here MSCZ was doing things that I liked his doing, and I didn't want to respond.  And uhm, I mean eventually it came down to thinking, well because I was letting you come between us again, I wanted it from you, not from him.</p>

<p>But I don't know, it seems like uhm, I don't know if I'm denying it, or whether this, it's really gotten to this stage of wondering, do I really want it from you, or is it just some sort of clinging to that, because then it keeps us separated.  And, and in thinking, why would I do that, the only thing I can think, is that imagining and pretending is much better, still to me.  And because then it, everything, whatever it is I want can be exactly as I want it, if I'm imagining it.</p>

<p>And (Sigh) uh, it's probably not just this, but it seems like it's partly that.  Because here MSCZ was being just what I wanted, and doing things that I liked, and I was rejecting it.  (Pause) But then I think, but on the other hand for th—, you know, thinking about the direct feelings that I do have, uhm, oh, I still have the dilemma over, am I just thinking, yes I am fantasizing I want it with you, or am I going to allow myself to think, yes, I really want it with you right now.  But still there's something, uhm, I don't, a—, I mean, I, I, it seems clear it comes because of having felt this way about my father, but it doesn't, I've got to think of it some other way I think to really deal with it now.  Except, I know you just have more, I don't know what word to use, in my mind, than MSCZ does.  And I, I, uhm, I don't know if it's exactly authority, or presence, or — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well I, on th—, (Sigh) I just keep thinking of it, because you can, I can imagine the combined roles.  Of your being a lover for me, and a father.  And with MSCZ, as much as I work at trying to combine it, it's pretty difficult to imagine him on the fatherly side.  And uhm, so he's missing that element that I seem to find has to be there.  I don't know what I'd do, though, if I really had an opportunity of replacing MSCZ with somebody who could combine the two.  You know, if I went after an older man, like if I went after you, uhm, and there was a real possibility of it working out.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because then I think, well I wouldn't really like it, because maybe I'd function better sexually, but a, and I ju—, I don't know if I would.  But I know I'd have this feeling of being a little girl, that at this point, I still do have with MSCZ.  And I, I'd, you know, try to develop that.  But uhm, I also have a stronger feeling I don't want to keep feeling that way.  And — (Silence)</p>

<p>Or maybe, I was just thinking about this, you know, sort of contradictory feeling I have, about wanting to be a little girl still, and not wanting to be.  And uhm, well, it just seems like when I'm here, then I still want that type of relationship, mixing the two of you being a father to me and a lover.  And I can't imagine, I mean, it won't work with MSCZ, even though I've tried to set it up to a certain extent.  It never will.</p>

<p>But then when I'm not here, when I'm dealing with various situations in my life, I'm feeling more and more that I want to grow up.  And I, I, I don't know, it seems like a fairly new feeling to me.  (2-minute silence) Well, but then I, I wa—, first starting I guess, by thinking of a couple of things that I feel that's what's part of the way I'm reacting to them now.</p>

<p>One is, dealing (Sniff) on my own with uh, FTM, and not depending on MSCZ, because I know in the past I've often depended on him to, you know, sort of come in and handle the situation if I find I can't handle it.  Often, sometimes he hasn't.  He's just said, "Well you've got to handle it."  But yet I've gone to him for advice, or you know, somehow felt, well he will if he, if it really gets bad, and he has to.  And I really have a very strong feeling that I want to be the one to handle FTM.  Because it is something for me to handle, not that he'll not have anything to do with her, but that it is my situation.</p>

<p>And then at school, uhm, just with this new aide that's come, uhm, and th—, and having to direct, you know, a new situation now, where I'm having to tell somebody what to do, it's very easy for me to sort of hide behind FLMZ, and sort of say, "Well FLMZ, she's doing a lot of things you do, so you direct her."  And I've had to fight against that.  Uhm, it doesn't mean FLMZ never tells her things that she can do to help, but that uhm, I'm trying to not, you know, sort of do it in the way, because it's easy for me to hide behind FLMZ.  And, you know, again, to deal with her more directly.  But then I was just thinking, well I'm thinking of these things, but I'm not thinking about dealing with MSCZ more directly.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What would be dealing with MSCZ more directly, be, I mean, what, for example?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I think, partly not hiding behind being busy, or too tired, or —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) And just telling him you don't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But, you did mention that this week.  Which uh, granted it did seem novel.  I mean you just straight out told him and were surprised he didn't get mad.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, I guess I still don't quite know what to make of all that.  Uhm, because I know my feeling is that I can't afford to do that very much, and I don't know why he reacted as he did that night.  Because I guess in a way, I don't know, I mean, it's true, I probably was more direct than I usually am, and it was unusual.  Except, the feeling I have is, but I just did what I always do.  I had the same feeling I always have.  And it's going to, if, if I keep expressing it, then we won't be married any longer.  And I haven't decided yet what I, you know, whether I want our marriage to end.  (Sniff) So I can't afford to express that feeling.  But then I did, and he didn't get angry, and uhm, (Sigh) I guess I'm feeling puzzled.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, the next thing I thought was well, a couple of things occurred to me.  One was, simply that it's something that I'd want to think more about.  That uhm, and then I began thinking, well I wish FTM wouldn't be home. Because I know I'll be distracted by that, partly out of necessity, because she is new, and just starting on so many things.  And then, you know, there she is, the temptation to come between us.  And also thinking i, it's something I might want to talk with MSCZ about, which didn't occur to me before.  Although I don't, I don't know.  Sometimes I think maybe I hide behind talking too.  But uhm, in any case feeling, well FTM's there and now it's going to, you know, distract me.  And then I immediately started thinking again, of that feeling of having it right now, as I had today, of a lot of things, and what are they, exactly, that I've got to do this weekend.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   All these peripheral things, everything except the central thing of your life, which is deciding about your marriage.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, because then I was thinking, I don't know which comes first, but I have such trouble deciding anything.  I'm having trouble deciding what to do for this Parents Night.  I had trouble deciding definitely about FTM, that you know, first I think, well no wonder I can't decide about something as important as my marriage.  And then, but then on the other hand, it might be the other way around, that I can't decide about anything if I can't decide about that.  And — (Silence)</p>

<p>I also just started thinking something that I was thinking as I left the park.  Uhm, well it came, I guess I was thinking well w—, in each of the cases that are less serious, the Parents Night and FTM, I have trouble deciding because I'm afraid I'll miss something, or you know, I won't include something.  Something will be missing.  And uhm, and then I was thinking that I had this very strong feeling, that was completely irrational, uhm, that I was leaving FSO, and FTM was going to either kidnap her, or, you know, do some awful thing to her.  And anyway, FTM might not be there, and FSO wouldn't be there when I came back.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And, if FSO were kidnapped, and disappeared, would that make it easier to separate from MSCZ?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, probably in a way, it would.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Our time is up.</p>

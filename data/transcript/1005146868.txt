<p>CLIENT: But the problem was that they were (cut out) for one to three minutes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At every stop and it just went downhill from there and that was - I was just - yeah! I woke up late. I can leave the house and then - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I always thought that was under your control, you handled that. You can't control the T.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there were like so many in the thing even, like people walking slow to it - I missed the first line going through and even - I mean it's frustrating because you can try hard and I've gone - because now like I've gotten pretty good at leaving the house early in the morning. I mean I don't kick the door and I sort of - Jeremy was actually more sad that I have to leave in the morning - sometimes we can't have breakfast together if it's - but you know, it's just sort of like - there's so much to do that I'd be missing out on, and but that doesn't mean I don't like to stay home. I do like to stay home. But it's been actually quite busy. </p>

<p>Jeremy and I - what was it - two weeks ago we tried hanging out. For some reason, I guess you know, after living in an apartment for six months you start like, well okay, what are other things we can do around the apartment? And it just sort of happened that Jeremy's brother just moved into a new apartment and mom was just like going on and on how gorgeous it was and how Ozzie was trying to compete with Jeremy and like I don't know what sort of (unclear) I don't know what was going on but anyway, you know, it's always nice to revamp your apartment and but this sort of put the cherry on top. Like we had to (unclear). So we went and bought some stuff. And then we bought these nice lighting fixtures and Jeremy was kind of like on the fence like, 'oh, do you think we can install it?' Like I'm not good at electricity. I didn't even think about what the impact of - I would say, "oh, she glimmers, she glows on YouTube can do it, you should be able to do it."</p>

<p>And so the first one it took us like six hours and there were tears and then I think it's because you put the mount in the wrong way. And you know, we got into kind of a big fight. It wasn't (unclear) I was like crying. I was crying and like because he was really frustrated and I was like, 'well, you know.' And he was like, 'well, I was just trying to make you happy,' and I said, 'well, you acting all huffy and puffy and like frustrated, upset is not making me happy.' Let's return the other one. And so we got some sleep and things were still tense in the morning and so he finally he hung up the other one which was more direct because it was the same type of sort of chandelier hanging as opposed to the kind of wall (unclear) lights but he did it in 30 minutes and it was a really good sigh of relief but I think resulting from it I sort of, I realized that I had felt bad that I had put so much pressure on Jeremy because I thought it would be easy and like I'm always interested in handyman stuff and I'm the type of person that even my mom always laughs that I was the one to try and start cutting fabric to make a leotard even though I hadn't really learned to use a sewing machine. I mean I get myself in messes like that but I had to be cognizant that it's a lot of money to do home repairs and if you mess up like hiring the electrician could be expensive. I mean I really did like the lights and we, actually now, we're really happy with the lights. We sort of agreed: no more. Because it's an apartment building and there's stuff you're going to have to take down. But it's interesting because this weekend we saw Ozzie and Christina's place and it was nice. The deal that she had was - that Ozzie and Christina had, is that she had to - they said they paid more money if the company made improvements around the apartment. So they got a new kitchen and they had actually stayed through the bedbug sort of problem so the company sort of believed in them - you know, they had been with the company for a long, long time - even in different areas around Boston. So, you know, they had some new fixtures, new kitchen. But you know - I was happy when I was seeing it and I saw that it wasn't as sort of (unclear) not as Jeremy's mom was describing it like, I don't know - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't what you had envisioned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For (unclear) price.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it was nice and I was really happy that it was decorated in the style that they like and I mean, I don't like that particular style but it made them very happy so I was really happy for them and it was sort of like this big dichotomy between like competing and like, I mean, I tend to be a conservative person in general and it doesn't help when someone says that someone else is competing. Yeah, that's not fair. Like I didn't want to compete. Actually, I did want to compete but I suppressed it to be nice and so I found that - I mean Christina is so nice now. She used to be mean. I guess she's not well received by the family. I can see where she sort of feels like it's okay because she was upset, you know. I mean, we're people after all, but it was just really interesting. </p>

<p>And then Jeremy and I when we got home, because we had been busy this weekend, were like 'oh, (unclear) like our home is better than anyone else's.' But of course we did, we shared expressions that yeah, their place is nice but you know, we like our home better. And it wasn't like our home is better - it's like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like, it's yours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Our creation of what we think is cozy and it was really a good feeling and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There doesn't have to be one winner in that type of - </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. And I've always wondered because like I know that like Jeremy's cousins - they have, I mean they're two different artistic sort of styles - one has a loft and the other one has this cozy place and they have different styles even from us but they're very nice and I'm happy for them. And for the first time like I could just honestly say, I'm happy for Ozzie and Christina and they seemed more relaxed and even their dog seemed more relaxed. And the dog was actually nice to me. So I'm happy and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it was a good visit because it allowed you to not feel like you were having to compete with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was funny because Jeremy was a little bit - he gets a little bit suspicious of everything his brother says, like, we're saying that, 'oh, we went out here to this restaurant and this one. We went to like three different restaurants for a quick bite or breakfast or whatever, this weekend and his brother was like, 'oh, you guys are finally getting out,' or, 'you guys are going out a lot recently,' and I was like, 'yeah, well, for a while we hadn't been but it's good to go out and explore.' And Jeremy actually got mad at me because he was like, 'we go out, we do stuff with people.' And I was like, 'well, yeah, but normally we eat dinner at home just because it's healthier and it's cheaper.' </p>

<p>And so like it was frustrating and I was like, 'so what's the first response that you want me to say that will make you feel better?' I sort of was going through and talking to him about it. I sort of found out that Jeremy's really insecure about not having friends in the area like male friends and so he felt like his brother was trying to dig at him that he didn't have any friends. And I was like, 'no, no, that's not exact - he was just saying that norm - that maybe he feels guilty about going out so much and like that you cook all the time. And he's like, 'oh.' And so I was like, 'if you really want to make your brother feel bad you could say this: 'well at least it's easier to keep in shape when I eat at home than going out all the time.' Then I said, 'then your brother will feel self-conscious about his weight because he's on a diet and then he'll feel bad,' and Jeremy was like, 'I wouldn't let that happen.' </p>

<p>But it's funny because like Jeremy always wants to hang out with me and I love hanging out with Jeremy but there's times like I want to do yoga and I want to go to dance and I sort of - it's hard for Jeremy to have - it's hard to get friends. I mean, I mean you have friends from - lots of his friends used to live here but now have sort of gone off and I want Jeremy to do things with his friends.</p>

<p>Like for instance - we actually went out with his ex-girlfriend in the morning, Saturday morning, and I realized - I was like, you know, I'm going to make this - because I imagine like the cat - not the cat was her but my cat from hell guy where he had - like when he had two cats sort of like meeting each other for the first time. He had a controlled meeting. Like he had a baby gate with a towel so they could smell each other. And then like the next day that they would get a little bit closer. And so I was like you know, I don't know how it's going to be - it seems like it might be awkward. I was just there with you and Lori and I do want to meet her but I don't want to take away - like she needs to talk to you and you need to talk to her and I don't want to feel left out. </p>

<p>This is what I was thinking. I didn't want to tell him that. So as it came out - this is perfect - I can go to ballet and so I let them walk around. Like it was like perfect because I didn't feel bad about leaving Jeremy. I didn't feel upset like, 'oh, he's speaking with his ex-girlfriend. And I just went to dance and I just sort of said, wow, this is a nice concept, is that I don't have to worry about Jeremy and I can do what I want and it was actually a - so I sort of see that I mean - and it was actually funny because one of Christina's friends, like Christina is known for gossiping, and that's just sort of - most girls do gossip, but one of Christina's friends saw Jeremy and Lori walking together and you know, I think one may remember Lori as Jeremy's ex-girlfriend but it was just funny because I was just laughing that, 'oh, this is going to be quite a story.' </p>

<p>But she was fine. I mean she's not my style. She's almost like so sweet and like I don't know. I mean I guess I don't have to like her but then I sort of feel bad like am I just picking on her to pick on her or just, I don't know - is she really that sweet? Like she'd be going, 'yeah, yeah, yeah, babies.' And I don't know. Maybe - I just felt like a cold fish because it was in the morning and I hadn't had coffee. I mean, you know. I don't know. I mean I guess I can bear myself too much but in the same sense, 'whoa,' she is like really like, 'I'm a small town girl,' and she makes it really clear, like 'oh, boy, I'm not good with the city at all,' and I think you could find yourself around with an iPhone I think. I mean, you have a master's of fine arts. Obviously, you're hard working and not stupid. </p>

<p>But anyway - but you know I sort of like, I mean it was just interesting because normally I'm used to taking stage as the talker. But this time I was just more like a listener and it was really kind of strange because I would try and add in a comment but then she would top it with something more like, "oh, well you know," and she was like, "oh, there's all those" - because she was in for a conference - she was like, "oh, there's all those writers with the - you can always tell them from a mile away." I was like, "yeah, at least it's not as bad as the March meeting where there were 30,000 physicists,' that they were making jokes on airplanes, nonphysicists and flirting with them and it was just bad." </p>

<p>And she was like, "oh, no, no, I think it's just as bad here." And I was like, 'well, okay.' AI was like, I don't know, writers or any sort of intellectual are going to stand out, but I think the - I mean you know. It's just, it was just everything that was more dramatic and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she was feeling competitive, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles) Which is understandable. I mean, I was just like, okay. It was like, well, let her just have this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did Jeremy feel about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh he had fun. He thought it was nice. He said after a while Lori started complaining about walking and he was like, oh well, Janet never does this when we go on 12-mile walks. And I was like thinking, 12 mile walks - those are the death marches and I (laughing) start complaining around mile six. But I was like, oh, okay. Just before that. But it was just - I mean I don't complain on mile two. It depends how cold it is. It was just - I mean I did notice she did have really pretty eyes and I told this to Jeremy and he goes, 'yeah, well you know, eyes just tend to be pretty.' And I was just like, wow, wait a minute. For some reason I was just like, can't we just talk about it like it's neutral? I mean like she's someone we don't know? </p>

<p>I don't know - I mean I guess it's kind of like weird (unclear) like I would never be caught dead looking - like the other day I saw my ex getting coffee and I just felt like milling around the other part of the cafeteria for a while because I'd rather like - I wish he didn't (unclear). So I can imagine - [00:16:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a totally different part of the - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I think Jeremy actually took it quite well and I was, he thought it was very mature of me to leave them walking and talking and I guess it was. And more or less a chance for me to go to dance. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel secure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling a lot more security than you had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that's actually I sort of think of like I used to be so - and this is something that I forget is that for so long is that Jeremy - I was very insecure with how he was feeling about me. Then I absolutely doted on him and now it's like I'm still trying to find a balance between Jeremy and school and dance and my plans and I mean I do give Jeremy lots of attention but sometimes I just sort of walk off. You know, check on all my plants and I've - and I feel bad like because Jeremy will start like meowing like because he's unloved and he's like - 'why don't you love me?' And I was like, 'well I do love you.' And I just sort of see that he means like constant attention and it's challenging for me because like, I guess because I don't need constant attention or constant - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it also sounds like he feels lonely? You mentioned that a lot of his friends from the area no longer are around so he's not getting a lot of attention from other people so he's requiring all his attention needs get met by you. That's too much. One person can't do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where it sounds like you have more - other things in your life. You have dance. You have people from school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean now is like the frustrating thing on Friday because Friday was my day. I was rewarding myself for being away from the house all week - or at least getting out of the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you've been getting out of the house every day? [00:18:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Except Friday was going to be my day. It was a snowy day and I was, this is was perfect. I'm going to stay home and do work and be productive. And Jeremy decided to have a work from home day. And like his constant sitting next to me all day and like for some reason I can't focus when he's around. I guess because, I mean I have warm fuzzy feelings, and because they had a busy week he just wasn't doing much during the week, or much on Friday and so he was like, 'oh look at this restaurant.' Okay, okay, I really have to read this and then he's like (unclear) he's like, 'check out this music, this song,' and so I mean, I'm not perfect either. You know, because I feel like it's play time, but it feels like he's there playing. Yeah. Exactly, or like we walked the (unclear) together and got food instead of like - it was a leisurely pace instead of like race down and mow people over sort of days and it was a - it definitely - Friday was fun. </p>

<p>But I felt guilty at the same time because I needed to - my advisor actually got the paper extended so it didn't have to be turned in the end of February, but the end of March which is - you know, it's really nice except that I kept - because I got really depressed when he was like, 'oh, well, I just want time to write this paper.' And I was like, 'well, I really need this paper' like to feel good about - I didn't tell him but I was like really upset. I was really upset but then (unclear) but then I was like okay, well okay, he may not want to write this paper or he doesn't see the necessity in it but I do and I want to ask like - so I started to be more like assertive and like what are the main questions we're trying to answer, like - you know like asking him all of these sort of specific questions because like there's so many calculations you could do on a project and I think if anything, an advisor should be guiding you to forming a unique research question and, yeah, I asked him and he was like, okay, that's why I don't have a meeting. And still like, I mean, so I met with him like three and a half hours last week and I still don't have - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You still don't feel like you have the answers. [00:21:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or the question even. And so like I can see that there's things that I'm going to have to read and papers that I have to understand, but I know that if I have motivation like reproduce this data or - and it seems like what he wants to do is like use a model to sort of explain the behavior in a certain experimental paper. And so I think that might be the question. I mean, but it's just frustrating because like, I mean it's such a mature field - a specific research field that I'm looking at. It's so mature. I mean it's been worked on since 1930 and it's really hard to find where can I contribute. What's the question, but I sort of feel like being more on top of my advisor, it will at least keep me on track and also at least bring me closer to what the actual question is, I mean. </p>

<p>But on a similar note my laptop has been in the process of dying and like I heard the other day in group meeting that my advisor to one of the students, was like, 'oh did you get the new computer? How's it going?' And I'm just like, here I have not like asked the group to give me any conference money. Actually I had and I was denied because it was (unclear). It was a beautiful setting. He was like, 'well, if you were going to go to March meeting, that would be fine.' But I had been turned down for money all this time except for one summer where I was paid, and unfortunately I was not very productive so that was kind of (unclear). [00:23:09]</p>

<p>But anyways I was like, you know, I'm going to ask for a computer, for funds. And sure enough, my advisor is letting me use his Mac Book Air, which is perfect because my computer just completely, my laptop just completely died. Like it was - I'm glad I backed it up because you know, my PhD is - it's sort of in fragments in lots of places and sure I could reconstruct a lot of things, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to spend a lot of time reconstructing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah I know. So I was just really happy - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear) backup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) I know. I know my computer died. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear) on multiple discs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have them in Cloud. I have them everywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I know. Exactly. I was just so (unclear) like I'm sure if I took my computer to get fixed I could - like I mean the - I don't know exactly what's its problem but the track head doesn't work and the USB doesn't work now. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are two important things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can't use a mouse anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Cross talk) you can use his, but are they getting you a new one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, but I don't know, like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd have exclusive use of his Notebook?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I get to - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's he using?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess another Mac. Like there's nine other Macs. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has like nine other Macs and - so that was the thing. It was just like - I know, in one sense like laptops do tend to disappear from groups, like they just never get returned and I can understand wanting to save the money for the group, for the group computers, but I just thought that, it's like you just spent all this money to take two of your students to Mexico for a conference and I was just sort of feeling like what am I - chopped liver? And so, at least I was glad that I could use his Mac Book Air and at least it was something, at least until I can save up. At least I don't feel indebted to other people except for he's letting me borrow it, so take care of it - don't throw it off the counter which is what I seem to do with my - not purposely. I pulled it off a counter - my last laptop. But - so anyway, I just sort of realized in the academic world like it came to my realization that my advisor is not a very nice person. </p>

<p>Like for instance, he had been working really hard like while he was going through chemotherapy to work on his physics of music, physic of sound book. And so I thought that, oh, this was his love child. And that obviously as I was talking to him, he really wants to have his physics of sound class be interactive with the students, engaging and so I asked him recently, 'so how's your class going?' Just making conversation. And he was like, 'Well, the numbers are good and the students seem interested but they're having a hard time with my book.' He was like, 'well, but then again, I deserve it. I wrote it more for my colleagues then actual students.' And it' like, 'you're ignoring us so that you could write some book as a trophy,' like I was just so mad and this is actually - it's frustrating because like, it's like - I can't even believe this guy. This is the guy that campaigns like conservatives are so mean and are so harsh to others and they have no charity and like, oh, you're not very nice. You're not very giving and like, he does talk to students. I mean he's better than some professors who never see their students. So I'm just sort of starting to learn that you have to be assertive and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like figuring out how to ask for what you want and really being - whether it be information, like trying to sit down and figure out what really is the question here - getting help in specifying a true answer. You know, so figuring out like what can you ask for from the group in terms of support? How can you frame a request so that you get money to fund your research or to fund your travel to a conference? [00:28:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am going to - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's not going to give it to you because he's nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) No. I sort of see that yeah, I mean it's just sort of like I'm learning about people and how to like not, sort of how to work with them. Like - because I sort of see that they're kind of interested in their own sort of needs and wants and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Particularly the professional group. I mean it really is - not that focusing on your own needs needs to be competitive with somebody else's needs, but you are all there to benefit one another and to get benefit from each other. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess some people you have to ask a little - squeal a little bit louder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm [yes].</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the last thing that really came up and actually really, it made me upset on Thursdays and dance, so I've had this dance teacher (unclear) and I was in her intermediate class last semester and now I'm in her advanced class and sometimes she now substitutes another kind of intermediate advanced class when the teacher's not there and last Monday like no one - everyone was just sort of disappearing and it was down to me and this other girl. So there's a lot more time for her to give feedback and for us to go one at a time. Which I didn't feel want to do but I sort of felt like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Basically, a private class. [00:29:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's like, 'you know what your problem is - is that you're not really dancing it.' She's like, 'you need to seem - you know you're just so harsh and rushing the music and you need to think about like the water and trying to be more fluid. Try and get that mental picture that you know, softness and - or like you're in - wearing the most beautiful dress and twirling around,' and you know, she had me - and I'm just like huffing and puffing and it was like a hard combination. Like in one sense - like I'm trying to remember the combination and I am just thinking it because I'm trying to remember it. It's not something I'm used to because it's just more of an advanced - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she expecting you to be the best?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And it's like the performance and like - so then she like has me do it again and I'm just like dying here because I'm just like oh, there's no break in between. It's just one after another and -. And so I do it again and I'm sort of like failing around. I sort of see that my toes aren't pointed and you know. And she's like, 'oh, oh that looks so much better,' and, 'you just need to think about that.' And I sort of put in my note that a lot of people get on my case for being like super tense at the ballet barre and just like, I do not, like I have become, like I tend to be a little bit perfectionist in dance. I focus so much on getting my leg up and but, and then on Thursday she said it to me again. She turns around and she's like, 'stop dancing like a girl.' She's like, 'didn't we talk about this on Monday?' She's like - and I was just like, 'sorry?' I actually thought I was doing better and like I was actually enjoying - I mean, you know, I mean I was a little bit ahead of the music but I was really enjoying what I was - it was just a sort of a light, simple step. I was enjoying my port de bras. Like my port de bras look so nice and I mean, you know, so I talked to her after class. And she was like, 'you're just not feeling it. You're always ahead of the music.' And she's like, 'I don't know how to get it to you.' And I just felt kind of like, I don't know, I just felt like really, really sad, because like I mean - in a sense I do sense that I'm ahead of the bar but in the steps I'm not always with the music but because I don't want to miss a step or I want things to - I don't think - a lot, I just tend to think a lot about things and to actually feel like - I mean it's sort of hard like in a classroom setting because I sort of see it as an opportunity to work on technique as opposed to like if I was actually doing a dance. Like there's some sort of goal other than just practicing steps. And anyway, I talked to my mom about it and she's like, 'well, why don't you ask your other teachers. And why don't you take a jazz class?' and she was like, 'or you could just try something like yoga. It's very noncompetitive. It will help you feel the flow.' And I felt better because I felt like, okay, I have a plan. Now I have to take yoga and I found out that Jeremy is actually interested in yoga but it's - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you seeking something to help you kind of be able to embody her notes to you or are you thinking of escaping dance where you got criticized?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm actually thinking of adding yoga onto the four classes a week because I really want to understand what she's talking about and I know that in general like if I went to another jazz class or another alternative class, like I am very competitive and very self-critical and I know that my problem when I was a teenager my mom said that I would always dance when I was very unsure of myself at the dance studio I was going to. She said I was always very sharp and very - not very fluid and she said like I think you were just very hard on yourself. You need to go to someplace where you can learn about flow and where it's not about competing. It's about - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. That seems like a positive way to try to incorporate her feedback. It sounds like you hear what she's saying but it's not clicking in your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But staying in your head. Maybe this is a way to try to translate that into your body, to kind of feel what she's saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly it. Because I know that it's definitely - it's really interesting because I see what she's saying and it's not that I don't negate it but I'm having a hard time like owning up, like trying to be like well where am I going to have opportunities to get my leg up or where am I going to focus on extension? And I'm already stretching like 30 minutes before class and every day, so it's like I'm just having like a - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is anyone critiquing your extension? [00:35:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. Like she's like, 'oh, well, you shouldn't tilt on your arabesque. You shouldn't tilt your pelvis that way. That's not how you balance. That's how you do it partnering. And it's hard for me because I see like pictures of like ballerinas and their leg is very high with an arabesque and I'm like she's tilting her pelvis forward and like what is right? Can someone just pick up my leg and see what's the range of motion and my mom is like, well, why don't you send me a picture of your arabesque. I can talk to you about it. So eventually I'll have someone take a picture of my arabesque and I've been watching You Tubes and like, you know, some people - I mean, I guess I mean it's just - my legs have not been up this high and for a long time and, or not really ever and so there's like so many questions that I have. Like - does your head go up? Like how do you get your leg high or like - I mean it's frustrating because you go on You Tube and you see many different realities and it's - and there's very few ones are actually like hopeful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And different teachers are going to have different expectations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like different people let different things slide. Some people are more purists than others. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah,, and I mean I also saw the way that my dance teacher, she actually dances and I saw - it was more modern and contemporary and I was used to classical, like dainty and these are the sort of things that I enjoy, but are sort of full, like mature, artistic, sort of. Modern dancing being like one with the ground and feeling rather than just being a fairy. I'm used to that and it's frustrating because I really am trying hard. I'm failing miserably, but I mean not miserably, but the fact that I really am trying hard - [00:37:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not failing. It's a process. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is part of the process. And you've just moved up from - you know you just moved over that line from intermediate to advanced. Which means that there's lots of room for growth in this new place you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should probably wrap up there for today. So I have a - not on for next week, but then (unclear) but then I'm jumping ahead in weeks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not on next week because of spring break. And then we're supposed to meet the 25th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I'm going to be out of the office that day and I was wondering if you have any availability on Tuesday the 26th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 26th at what time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have a 2:30 or a 3:30 or 11:30. Any of those work for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going solid from 11 to 4:30. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could we maybe do a 5:10?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. On Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think I could probably stay late that day (unclear). [00:38:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fine.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:38:55 - 00:39:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It looks like we didn't schedule for April yet, either. So do you want to do the 8th and - what do you want to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do like the 8th and 22nd. All right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds good. And on Monday at 9:30?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:39:50 - 00:40:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm actually getting used to waking up early and my boyfriend, he woke up after me and he's like, 'oh, sorry.' He can't get used to me waking up early. So this is training when you become a schoolteacher and have to wake up really early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's an early start.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I need a co-pay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, yeah. That's right. I always forget that.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:40:51 - 00:40:56]</p>

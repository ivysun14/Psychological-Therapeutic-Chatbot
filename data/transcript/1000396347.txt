<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (6-minute silence) Mm, the first thing I thought when I came in here, and I've been quiet, because I just have this strong feeling I don't want to say this.  Uhm, I guess because it will call your attention to my breasts, and I don't want to do that.  But I was thinking about some bras I bought yesterday, and I, it, thinking about them in a way that uhm, I was happy with them yesterday, but now, I was feeling very uncertain whether I like them.  And uhm, I, I guess whether they'd look right on me.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And why are you reluctant to call my attention to your breasts?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I don't know, I, I was thinking that it somehow seems similar to (Sniff) my whole attitude about the way I dress or use makeup.  That uhm, I never want to do anything that's really dramatic, or, or really make me noticeable.  And yet, on the other hand, I really want to be noticed.  And it seems as if it's because i'm afraid of something, if I am noticed.  And uhm, (Pause) I don't know whether it's because i'm afraid you won't find me attractive, or just what.  But, or if it's just simply because I really want you to notice.  (Pause)</p>

<p>(Sniff) Another thing I keep, I, it does keep coming back to my mind — I thought of it before I began talking, and I just feel it's connected, but I don't see why, yet — uhm, last night I think I'd been dreaming, and I woke up, because I guess, FSO woke me up.  She was crying.  And I don't know, some nights, I—, i'm very slow to wake up, and by the time I do, to the point where I think i've really got to get up, she will sometime stop.  And last night I had the feeling that I heard her almost immediately when she was crying, and that I in a way, wanted to get up.  Because I did.  And then I found it very hard to get back to sleep, and she was quiet for awhile, and then she started crying again.  So I went in again and held her for longer, and then she did go to sleep after I left that time.  And I still found I couldn't get back to sleep for a long time. </p>

<p>And I began thinking about the girl that I told that I was coming to analysis.  And I suppose I was thinking of her partly because I was thinking of calling her someday soon, to see if she can come over with her child.  And uhm, I don't know, last night I just had the feeling that I'd made a terrible mistake in telling her, and that something awful was going to happen, as a result.  (Pause) And that it was a secret that should never be revealed to anyone, and uhm, this morning when I remembered feeling that way, I couldn't, I, I can recall that feeling.  But I don't understand I, rationally, I can't think why I'd be feeling that way.  (Sniff, Pause),</p>

<p>And, well, then I just think that in a way, uhm, (Sniff) — I was thinking of my telling last night — but in a way the feeling I got from thinking of having done it, was similar to that sort of panic feeling I got when I had the dream that you had betrayed me, and told whoever it was I was dreaming about then.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Cough) Well, maybe the fact that this occurs to you, uh, right after you were thinking about calling my attention to your breasts, frightened you, throws light on what the secret is.  What is the secret that you're afraid would lead to disaster, if it got out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, what I think of immediately is, uhm, that i'm thinking of coming here as, or being here, as making love, and that that's the secret I don't want people to know, but I don't know whether then I immediately start denying that, or what.  But I think again of h—, what I was feeling last night, and it was uhm, I don't know, it seemed as if I were putting, that I'd made a mistake, more on, uhm, what it says about me, that I needed to go to analysis.  And i—, I don't know, that anybody who knows is saying I am weak, or something like that.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But then, but then I, I recall again, I was still, uhm, I don't even, I, I don't know, it was just sort of a vague feeling that, since this girl knows, everyone would know, and uhm, this fear of what people would think.  And I know really, it wasn't this, this reaction I had to thinking about it, was not just the thinking I was weak if I need to go to analysis.  And I know, well I don't know, I (Sigh), the way I kept thinking about it is well, if I can just be defiant in, in front of them, then, then I don't have to worry.  And so I can see I must have been thinking it was more than just that, if I had to be defiant.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, the other thing I don't understand, because I keep thinking of yesterday, too, when I think of this.  And, uh, I don't know, as if somehow those thoughts last night were a direct outcome.  And it seems like such a contrast to the way I was thinking yesterday, of feeling hate toward MSCZ, and wanting to sort of beat him down, and be superior to him, and stand over him, and boss him, and all that. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, is it so different?  Your feeling when you told her was that you were defying him, in a sense.  I mean, maybe you didn't feel that, but that's the way he interpreted it.  And it's as though you're now feeling retribution will come.  That you've really carried out these things you just said that you'd like to do to him.  And you must feel, surely you would be punished.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Yeah, yeah, I think so.  Because th—, well the thing I think of immediately next, is uhm, that early yesterday FNI had called me, and she called mainly just to let off steam.  She was furious at just about everybody, I guess, in her family, but particularly this woman who is her housekeeper.  And uhm, I know the, I don't know whether every time recently, but several times recently when she's had to be out for classes at night, th, the woman who is the housekeeper has had no control over MJ, and he's really been very destructive.  And uhm, so she was just talking about it a, and saying she doesn't think, she didn't know what to do, and did I have any suggestions.  And yet, on the other hand, she really j—, I think, wanted to air some of her ideas and say things to me first, so she wouldn't be so violent in what she said when she spoke to v—, (Mumbles) the woman later. </p>

<p>And uhm, her attitude was that she could speak to MJ, but she could not punish him.  And she could say, "MJ, you know the rules, and this is, you're breaking a rule of the house by behaving this way."  And yet on the other hand, she felt she could not punish him, and it was entirely up to the housekeeper to handle the situation, while she was gone.  And my feeling at the time I was speaking to her was, instinctively, I would not handle it the way she was.  I would have felt that I was much more uhm, s—, I don't know, important in the discipline of my child, and that I could not count on somebody else like a housekeeper.  Although hopefully, the housekeeper would have more control than clearly, this woman does.  But that in the end, any real disciplining I would feel was m—, m—, for me to do, or for me and MSCZ. </p>

<p>And uhm, but I didn't, I don't know, I know FNI and I don't see eye to eye on a lot of things.  And so I just sort of uhm, made some suggestions that would lead to my point of view, if she wanted to follow it.  And she didn't, and I wasn't feeling particularly strongly that she didn't, because it's her family, and so forth.  But then, last night MSCZ had been working late.  And when he came home, at some point, I just told him about the, what had happened.  And he said more forcefully what was sort of my point of view.  Because we do agree on this, and a—, he was just saying what FNI should do, is th, thus and so, and uh, MJ should be punished, is one of the things I remember his saying. </p>

<p>And uhm, and after he said that, then I became all excited, and I even had trouble getting to sleep initially, because I kept thinking about that, and thinking, I should, I should have been stronger in what I said to FNi.  And it was almost as if I had not punished MJ, and I should be. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   The point is, though, he did wrong, he should be punished.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.  And I was feeling very critical of FNI then, who uhm, well I don't know, I don't see things as clearly in this wa—, I me—, I, I don't always agree with how she treats her children.  But uhm, I don't see it as clearly something that she's not doing.  And MSCZ was saying that, neither she nor MW like to discipline their children.  And, they like to yell at them sometimes, but then, nothing comes of it, and there's no really solid follow-up, or anything.  And their children are difficult.  And I didn't say this, but I h, have some sympathy for the housekeeper, whose attitude is that FNI should be punishing MJ for this behavior, and that something rests on FNI, and not just on FTL herself. </p>

<p>And uhm, last night I was getting involved in that, and being critical of FNI, who was not punishing where I thought she should.  (Pause, Sniff) But i—, well I don't know if this is because of the way i'm seeing things, or not.  But my—,  even when she was telling me yesterday morning, about this — my immediate reaction to the things MJ has been doing, is that he is asking to be punished, that he's asking for a line to be drawn and something to happen to him if he goes over it.  Not just be told in words, "No, no, no."  But for something really to happen.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I also think of FSO, who's uhm, very much going through the stage right now, of saying "no" very loudly.  And many times, as she approaches something that she knows is "no", and then hesitating until I am around, or come, or react, or whatever.  And then she'll start to do it.  And she gets quite upset if I don't react and stop her.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So what transgressions are you feeling you should be punished for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) Well I, I think of 2 things, but I don't feel any involvement now in thinking of it.  So it makes me feel i'm not sure.  Uhm, but I was thinking, both having expressed those feelings about MSCZ yesterday, and what I want to do, and then that I look on being here as making love with you, or maybe even that just that I want it to be that.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose specifically, I was feeling that way about just having told the girl about coming here, because last night when I kept thinking of it, I also kept wondering, well maybe I just have this feeling because of MSCZ's strong reaction.  And uhm, and then, in some way i'm thinking, he must be right.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>(Pause) But then, then I just start thinking well, in the case of that, I mea—, I think the other 2 things.  And I know yesterday I was really feeling guilty about feeling those things toward MSCZ.  And I don't feel guilty right now, except I know I have in the past, about thinking of wanting to make love here, so that I can see where both those things would make me feel I should be punished.  But with telling this girl, I was, just now was thinking, well that could — except that I'd d, done something that MSCZ expressly did not want me to do — uhm, could be considered just making a mistake, if I did.  I just don't even know. </p>

<p>And, well then, then the image comes to my mind of (Sigh), or, or the thought that in our family you didn't make m—, uh, there weren't any such things as mistake.  Mistakes.  Because a mistake was doing something wrong, and then you would be punished.  And it also just makes me think of something FNI told me, I guess this morning, she called me again about FTL.  And she'd told me last night, or later yesterday, that she talked things out with her, and she didn't have much hope, but she thought maybe things might work out. </p>

<p>And then apparently last night, a horrible situation developed between MJ and FTL.  And, so FNI called this morning, again I guess, to let off steam.  And one of the things that happened is MJ spilled some milk.  And FTL started screaming at him, and I don't know whether MJ did it on purpose, or not.  And FNI wasn't there, so she can't know.  But she said, "He made a mistake.  All it was a mistake."</p>

<p>And, and it just makes me think of times we spilled things at home.  it was never a mistake, it was always, "How could you be so stupid?"  And being screamed and yelled at, and made to feel very guilty.  And well, that we should be punished.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well I also start thinking of something else that uhm, (Sniff) well, I guess i've been feeling guilty about now.  That uhm, I, it's, FSO has moved into certain stages that remind me of how MBK was this summer, in attitudes and feelings, and the way she behaves, and so forth, that uhm, FNA was saying w, were true of MBK then.  And at that time, I didn't always agree, but I think it was part of my being very critical of FNA, anyway.  And the thing i'm feeling guilty about now, is I can see where, in many cases, the attitude on my part and my mother, even though neither of us expressed it that much, but it must have been very clear to FNA, must have been very hard on her.  Because now i'm thinking, she probably was right, most of the time.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well then I think of something that uhm, might be part of this.  But I don't know, I (Sigh), i'm not even sure how I came to think of it now.  But it seems to me it's more true as an attitude I used to have about myself, than right now.  But just the feeling of there being something wrong with me, and that I can't do anything right, in a way.  Or I can't be the right thing.  And uhm, I don't know, just as if sort of being what I am, I deserve to be punished. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I think the reason that you feel uninvolved with these 2 things that you thought you should be punished for, and that you're sort of searching around now, I think, is because you really don't know it's really true, or that you do feel that.  And it's uncomfortable when you get rid of it.  it seems to me one thing that seems to have happened, is that you, you uh, it's as though MSCZ's the bad guy, and i'm the good guy.  That you can think of making love with me, you can think of uh, hating him.  And sort of keep everything neat and separate that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well that, that did occur to me, because I was thinking at some point earlier today, that (Sniff) these things I'd said about MSCZ, or just the way I kept associating it all with the dance yesterday, and uhm, and I kept remembering there was that time specifically, when I was thinking of that dance, and you would be the victim, or I would be doing this to you.  And so, at some point I'd felt that way toward you.  But yet now, it is true, I have the 2 feelings very separated, and feeling good things toward you and bad things toward MSCZ. </p>

<p>Though I also was thinking of it — because I know I felt both these things toward my father — was I don't know, wanting something, and then at some, I don't know if it's simply the revenge, what I want to do to MSCZ is sort of the revenge for not getting what I want.  But uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I, I stopped, because I was thinking again of something that has continued to puzzle me since, and I don't know if I heard you correctly, or remember it correctly.  But something to do with when, sort of this basic problem with MSCZ first came up, when you were first pointing out things about it, that I think I at some point, thought you were saying, that the basic problem was that I was a female, not a male.  And here's MSCZ, a male.  And uhm, well, I just don't know what to do with that thought.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, it just seems to me right now, anyway, that this attitude does come partly from revengeful feelings.  And partly, too, just from, I don't know, almost feeling that i'm defiantly proving myself.  That I am all right, being female.  And i'm going to show — in this particular instance, i'm feeling this way toward MSCZ — but I suppose it's true, it has been true that I'd feel this way toward you and toward my father. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

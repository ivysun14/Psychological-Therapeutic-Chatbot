<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to review the forms and get started.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, things are getting better —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Overall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I certainly went through, uh, when it, when it gets really slow, of course, I think it's natural, but maybe not so much, real depressed and, and, and don't want to go to work.  I, I, I, I think I'm kind of passive if, if there's nothing happening and, um, if the morale is down at my business, it's, and my morale is down, then of course everything gets down around me and, and I can't have that because it, it doesn't, I needed to stay active and, uh, and I've kind of been trying to find that little hole in the wall and crawl into it, but, um, and I have.  I, I've needed a couple of days just to get away and, um, and, uh, and think about things a little bit, and, and then it seems like I pull out of it, and get back in there and sometimes I call it winding the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Winding the, the spring up and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and getting out of it, but, uh, you know, something else that I noticed.  Uh, you know, I don't know how long it's been, but it's, early on, you know, you said don't drink, and that was something that, uh, I, I think was —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is important, very important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, I did for a little bit, you know.  Early on, I, I, I, I would drink maybe a couple of drinks, you know, every three or four, five days and I kept, it would get less and less and less.  And then, you know, every once in a while, as of late, um, like last Thursday as an example, um, and, and, and last Thursday was probably the first time in a couple of months that I thought I, I think I'd want a drink sometimes.  I feel like I just want to have an occasional cocktail and I, I run off to California to get my daughter and I got a motel room, and, um, I thought I wanted to have a drink.  So I bought a small bottle of whiskey, poured myself a drink.  I took one drink out of that thing and I just, I, I said I don't feel like it.  It wasn't there so I just dumped it out, put the cap on it and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And called, called it a night and it's still —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Still sitting in the house and I, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and, and that wasn't the first time that that's happened.  Probably, you know, that was probably the first time in a couple of months, but, um, now, but I think one thing I've noticed more so than before, is I don't necessarily want to be around people, after I have a day at my business or something —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and that, that affects things at home because [NAME OTHER] is certainly one that wants to, you know, she's real hyperactive and, and wants to go do things and, um, but myself, I'm just, I'm not into it, and some of it is bar scene.  You know, if I go to a bar, I don't go to listen to the band or dance or shoot pool.  I think of a bar as made for drinking and, and, and so I have a hard time with that, and maybe some of that is just early sobriety or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how often do you go to bars?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> None.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because in the early recovery, you like to be off the environment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That would help you.  Once, the first year is very important.  Once you have a year of solid recovery and, and sobriety —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you can have, feel like more confident, more comfortable.  Your mindset is ready to go for a challenge like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But in the early recovery, you don't want to, uh, go for a risk because that, that, you put yourself under a lot of risk —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And pressure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Temptation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And pressure peer.  I mean nobody would know that you are recovering.  They are not, or some of them would feel like, oh, why don't we get the guy to do what we are doing.  It's just human nature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and, and then, with that in mind, I think it, it, it, being a shop owner in, in town, uh, I think it affects some of my relationship with, with my customers because I think they feel like I don't want to be around them or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something of that nature —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and I don't know that it matters or not, but I certainly, I, I haven't been wanting to be around, you know, any of the things in a way.  We've got a meeting tonight at, at our house for a particular, um, event that we're going to hold and I, I don't necessarily want to be around it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I just, large crowds of people or something.  I, I don't know if that's, if that's got anything to do with it, but I think it does.  It's, it's made me feel a little bit different.  Um, and, and the anxiousness, I think I feel a little more anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anxious, right.  And right now, you are on Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you are up to the 200 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I think so.  What was, are they, were they 25s or something, because in the end —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The small ones, I was taking eight pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight pills of the 25 because we used the starter kit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, and we gradually moved up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now I'm just taking two a day.  They must be —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two of the 100s?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Big pills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but see now, [NAME OTHER] got me some the other day across the border —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't know if they're —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we have the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt like I, I could tell a difference in them.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they are generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should have brought them here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll tell you what happens.  When we used it first, it was the brand name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was the manufacturers, like the original company.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you get the, when you, when you get the generic form —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of Lamictal, they might be not exactly the same like the original.  I mean I think the FDA would allow them to have about 80% of, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I compare it to, if I, I think for a comparison would be a Harley Davidson genuine part.  If I go to Harley —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's an exact, everything that it needs to be, but there are companies that make an aftermarket part and it doesn't quite fit in nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Close but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's really, really close, but it's not really the exact —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not, not as, as fitting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, or as crisp or as tight or something like that.  So, um, now certainly, I, I don't, and this has probably been helping a lot, is the sleeping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I've been taking the Ambien or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you are using 10 mg of the Ambien?  It's the generic Ambien too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is the generic.  Uh, no.  Yeah, it's, uh, let's see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Zolpidem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Originally it was the real deal I think, and then, and then the, the next refill was a generic one from, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because they switched you.  If they have generics, they sometimes switch without you knowing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but that's not so bad, but we did get some from across the border.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it worked, but my God, trying to get up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, it, it was way, way groggy and I didn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was not as, as, uh, clean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was a little bit staying longer in your system?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes, because I could feel, I could feel —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Trying to get one, I mean it hits you pretty hard, me anyways, but, uh, the, the other one, I could feel my legs kind of aching.  My arms kind of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like maybe, you know, like I'm fighting going to sleep or something and I kind of feel like I'm tensing up or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's making my, it would certainly make my legs and arms feel —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still on it, or did you switch to something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I switched back.  I put that stuff across —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you stopped that one, and then you, you got a new one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I went back to the pharmacy because you had wrote the prescription, I can still get one more after I'm done —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With this fill, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all, I think, you know, getting a good night's sleep has certainly been —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And for bipolar disorder, a good night's sleep is very important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And something to keep in mind too, if you start to notice that your number of hours of sleep are going down, that could be an indication that there is something going on in the, in the mania side, you see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's like kind of the thermometer of your —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mania, mania, is the sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So meaning going down, if I go to bed at 10:00 and I wake up at 7:00, and then I gradually start to wake up a little earlier?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, could be, oh, actually in the, in the initial more than at the end.  At the end, maybe it's more depression.  Like if you wake up early, usually that's depression problem, usually you see?  If you, if you cannot go to sleep, let's say if you have difficulty to start the sleep cycle —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That could be more of a mania or depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well now —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But anyway, any disturbance in sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, like generally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You say that because I told you here a while back, you know, last month, around Memorial Day when, oh, mercy sakes, I was on, well [NAME OTHER] and I went off somewhere and I just, I was, I was getting up 5:00 in the morning —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And walking outside to where I typically get up about 7:00 when she gets up or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, she gets up a little earlier than that, but, um, now I see, it seems how I'm not, I kind of came out of that little bit of a slump, um, you know, 5:30 in the morning is really hard for me to get up, but we have been.  And another thing too that I've been doing, try to, we've been walking, doing some exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, the lifestyle changes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and it, it certainly got me a little more active and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you, have you lost weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me get your weight.  Let's, let's, let's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I stepped on this and it doesn't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was, actually it's pretty, 165.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One sixty five.  What's your height?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, 5"7" I think is what it says on my license.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five seven.  All right, we'll double check that one too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and, you know, so I, I actually have been trying to, to lose weight so I think because I'd like to go back racing again, and that's enough to, one more thing that I need to add to this is I've noticed I'm pretty organized when it comes to, to things.  I like my shop to be nice and neat, and all my tools to be —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's been more, you know.  I mean I'm lining all my things up in the bathroom and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Little bit to the extreme?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what, what do you that when you are doing well or you do that when you are down more, or has it been steady?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.  I think it seems like when I'm down more because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You get anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It seems to make me, yeah.  It seems like that makes me feel better, or I have to have everything organized because if I don't, it aggravates me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, you know, it's, it's like this morning, I, I actually have two bathroom bags.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and I just have them sitting there ready to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if I went to jump on my motorcycle, I take this on my motorcycle.  If I go in my truck, I put this one in the suitcase and throw it in my truck, and one of them was open and left open this morning, and, and I said to [NAME OTHER], why is that open —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said she used a razor or something out of it, and I said well you forgot to close it.  Keep it nice and neat, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  So, it's, I, I don't know.  She kind of gives me a little bit of a hard time about it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or makes fun of me or something, and, uh, I don't think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, but [PATIENT NAME], overall, do you think that we are on the right track —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the medications?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I believe so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what, what, what I think is important from now on is keep taking your meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, now figure out, I mean which brands that work for you, and which wouldn't.  I mean which pharmacy you get it from.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should go back to, it seems like I should go back to the original —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To the brand name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I feel like, I really, really feel like there is a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the best results, the more, uh, accurate outcomes and, and actually the, the best way to do it is just go with what works for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you think that the brand name will work, work better for you, maybe you're going to pay a little bit more, but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At the same time, you, it's worth it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, and, and like I said, it, it seems like I don't, you know, argue and fussing with, with the missus or, or, or even guys at the shop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I, I can kind of brush things off a little later, you know, or let it go a little bit more.  If it's a continuing, you know, um, if they want to continue, you know, argue or fuss with me, um, of course, I, I, I, I would kind of go off in the end, but not as soon as I would before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, if it, and I'm not saying I, I flip out every single time.  I just I, I, if [NAME OTHER] wants to bicker about something or she feels bad about something, she wants to tell me how she feels.  I'll sit there and listen to it now and I can't, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not take is so personal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good.  So, would you say that on the meds, the relationship is getting better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it may be getting better.  Um, but a lot of times, I, I, I think the grass is greener on the other side, and I, I, I think about my, my past and my daughter's mother, and, and I feel bad about kind of messing that up.  I think I get a little more emotional about it.  I'm, I'm kind of an emotional person as it is anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Regrets, some guilt —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I think more so than, than, you know, than in the past.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still in touch with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every other weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.  When you have your kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  When I have to go pick my daughter up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your daughter from.  How old is your daughter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She'll be [AGE] in September.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I know that this is very sensitive issue for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When, when we talked about it, I know that your daughter is very important to you, and —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well that's what I had planned on —.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.  We had a pretty good thing going, and I certainly messed that all up, but, you know, my son, he'll be [AGE] this December, and you know, he's all doing pretty good.  He's been living with me since 2001, and, um, you know, and it's certainly a challenge raising kids, but, um, I would love to have another one, but, uh, I didn't plan for my son.  He was certainly a surprise, and the daughter though, on the other hand, I wanted another kid and I, I really wanted another one after her, and I thought I had the right person to have with, and I probably did, but, you know, you can't go backwards in life most of the time, and, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, there's a real special spot in my heart for my daughter.  One, she's a daughter.  She's a girl and I think that the love is different than for a boy, but, um, I, I feel like I messed that up and it, I think I, I give quite a bit more regret or, or emotional when I, when I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About the relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know, and you always wonder what it would have been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you say that the relationship between you and your daughter is better now on meds?  Do you have more patience?  Do you have, uh, more interest in doing things with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, especially —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you say, would you notice that because that is kind of the thing that you sometimes —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, especially with my son, you know.  My son was playing basketball and baseball and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you had, and my understanding that he's doing very well in baseball.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He most certainly is, and I can't [INAUDIBLE] state tournament in a couple of weeks, but, um, I hate to say it, but I rarely went to any of his games.  I wouldn't take the time away from work —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To do, to go —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To, to do.  You know, maybe some of the base, or basketball games because they seemed to be later in the afternoon, but I would just was so determined or, or just stay work, work, work, work, work at the shop.  So I, I feel kind of like the, the medicine is, is opened my eyes to doing, being a little more active with my loved ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what, so here, here is what you are saying.  You are doing more with your son.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are more interested in, uh, the activities and the interaction with your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The relationship is getting a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The work is getting a little bit better.  You are less, less irritate, irritable —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Around the coworkers and the, and the, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the customers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just take them one at a time and in stride.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, that's all good news.  What, what you are working on now is, again, very important.  The, um, the, uh, lifestyle changes.  Okay.  Uh, so [PATIENT NAME] let's stay with the medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need refills or are you good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I think I'm good, but there's, there's, I just had it filled up a few, a couple of weeks ago.  I, I have one more refill that says before November.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have one, another 30 days supply?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah, I, I have about 15 days right now, and I have one more 30 day on the, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On both?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to look.  I don't, probably not on the, on the, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lamisil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Lamisil because we went across the border and got it last time, and we didn't have to have a prescription.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you need prescription for Lamictal just in case you need it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes, I will, and, and I'd really like to get back on the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go, go for the brand name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If, if it works a little bit better for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what about as far as the Ambien too?  You think I should go strictly back with Ambien?  I mean because I'm on kind of a generic right now, but, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ambien would give you exactly what you expect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the, the brand name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I can tell a difference in the generic one, and I can certainly, I just put the, the, the across the border stuff away.  I'm, I'm not even going to bother with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I should probably just dump them down the toilet, but I was even on the, uh, on the, um, on the stuff across the border, I was breaking them in half, and it still would, uh, I was taking only half of the medicine and it, it still was just grogginess waking up.  I didn't like it at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's different.  The filling is different, so the, the, uh, time it's going to be in your system may be different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal 200 mg.  Do you take it in the morning or at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take it first thing in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Morning.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then again, I can tell a difference.  I mean since I've been taking it, I've been really, really, really faithful to it, but, uh, um, if I move it, put it somewhere else, of course, that's out of my normal routine —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, um, I, I have forgotten it once.  Well, I have forgotten it a couple of different times, but there was one occasion where I didn't take it for two days straight —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And man, I could, I could certainly feel a difference there.  So with that in mind, if I forget, do I just continue to take it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Continue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two at a time.  I don't go —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  Don't, don't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take six of them now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go back and forth.  No, if it is just one or two days, you are good.  You are good to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So how about that?  Let's stay with these medications.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Same amount.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Same amount for a couple of months, eight weeks or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stay with your lifestyle changes that you are doing.  If you notice any problems, of course, let us know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But otherwise, I think we are on the right track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think we are on the right track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is that it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think we are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any, anything else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You think that —</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>SPEAKER: All right one more. Have you ever seen the bumper sticker (pause) I saw one this one said, 'May the net force be with you.'</p>

<p>SPEAKER: No I haven't seen that one. And I know a lot of really dorky things.</p>

<p>SPEAKER: So yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gosh it's been such a weird couple of days. I've been sort of thinking about the whole like (pause) the conversations about being overly sensitive to various different things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I'm not really sure ... like I'm trying to (pause) sort of (pause) piece around what you know about different things what bothers me about certain stuff and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that the biggest thing is that I unfortunately have this naïve notion of still thinking that the world needs to be fair, you know? And (pause) it's something that hate about myself because it seems so immature. I know it sounds silly to that but ... (pause) It is something definitely that (pause) I don't know why I'm uncomfortable about that but yet I still very strongly feel like that. But you know I don't think that it is that I have this leaning towards things, you know that need to be fair in terms of that kind of thing.</p>

<p>(00:01:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible_00:01:52) The whole things if you know having someone die if they're young, you know? Or based upon things that they did not necessarily deserve that, you know? Not that I'm the person that does a lot who deserves things but like there's certain things and consequences of ones actions, per se, you know? And it was something totally random. And (pause) it's very (pause) there's a lot of things about myself that I'm not especially comfortable with and admitting to and one of them is the fact that although I am obsessed with sort of being as young as humanly possible in certain ways, physically that way, I get embarrassed when I haven't grown up enough to have conversations that I perceive are adult like, you know? (pause) Usually it involves being able to evade questions or like things like that the fact that I can't do the things that I perceive as being very grown-up like. You know like someone says something and you know instead of actually answering the question, you know evading the question by avoiding ... makes you think of that and you know being able to do that. I can't do that. I'm embarrassed to say that I can't do that, you know?</p>

<p>(00:03:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just little things like that that I feel very immature about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So does that happen, so I understand, like with questions that you prefer not to answer? Are there any that you'd rather sort of evade or deflect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even just like things that it would be my best interest not to be as honest with. Just in general I feel like I'm (pause) way too much of an open book to people sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I don't have as much control over what part of me people see sometimes. And for a person who has like a lot of control issues about like trying to make sure things happen the way they do it's kind of embarrassing, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. I guess I (pause) ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I (inaudible_00:04:05) by something I cannot damage control things fast enough to get back and get the upper hand on the situation, you know? Like if I'm asked a question that I'm not expecting and either, you know it would be in my best interest probably not to answer it or distract somebody but I can't do that very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it because (pause) almost like with the fairness thing you're sort of more reflected ideas that in a reasonable concept is that (pause) you should be able to answer honestly and that should be fine. And you know the world should be a fair and reasonable place and so you sort of shouldn't be penalized for telling the truth.</p>

<p>(00:04:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. Definitely. It's sort of a weird thing. It's sort of a (pause) not really sure how to explain it very well. It just (pause) I don't like the fact that I don't really have enough ... I'm a brilliant human being and I don't have any gall to my nature at all. Like in terms of like being able to take advantage of certain situations or being able to like play games and part of it is the fact that I really don't feel like the effort is really more than I'm willing to spend. But sometimes I feel like I am hopelessly (pause) (sigh) hopelessly like, I don't know how to explain it. Am I able to do it? You know which makes me kind of in my own way kind of dumb not being able to know when not to say the truth on things.</p>

<p>(00:05:51)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of a weird thing for me. I was speaking with my aunt recently about this whole thing. (pause) Mostly and she was trying to give me the advice that basically that I need to stop having my heart on my sleeve and because of the fact that I'm so open with so many people that it leads people to take advantage of me. Like, "Oh, well you know because of this I will be willing to do this for you." Or this kind of thing and she's like you've got to stop letting people know that you know that you are emotionally available to be exploited. And like well that's great and all but I have not a clue on how to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. She's of the believe that the reason why (pause) it's sort of true, the reason why you know I end up having too much on my plate is because I let people do it. Partially because of the fact that I'm too honest with them. I let them know that I'm a person who, you know gets some sort of happiness, not really happiness so much as just you know when I'm easily convince to do things, you know? (pause) I need to pick and choose it and I think she's right. But there's something to be said about not being happy go lucky innocent person who believes that the world needs to be fair. And if I just happen to have extra stuff that it's okay for me to give it to you, you know? (pause) And so (pause) ...</p>

<p>(00:07:41)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel more to you like this is simply a skill you lack or more like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Defective character.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) okay but of what sort? Like of a kind where you sort of don't have the ability to think this way or is it more like you stubbornly hold on to a view of the world that isn't ... that you kind of know isn't true or important emotional reasons? Do you know what I mean, like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably a little bit of both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's usually two different things, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel a little bit of both so I can feel like I can sleep at night with myself. I mean (pause) I think it's a little bit of both really, but mostly the later.</p>

<p>(00:08:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is hard having somebody who I care about (pause) basically more or less tell me I had Steinbeckian naiveté about the world. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My family is fabulous for that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that she was trying to be mean. She loves me to death. She just wants me to realize ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Elusive. (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like, you know I'm like, "Ah man, you know I don't want to be like in 'Mice and Men'."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That dumb. But at the same time it's like, "I don't know." I just ... she mostly, actually saying that in reference to my family, my in-laws.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's (pause) most of the people that know that my in-laws are jerks, they just don't really know to the full extent of the jerkiness of things. Really think that I'm being exploited by them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this is probably true. (pause) Like you know I don't see them very often but when I do, you know it's usually like I go all out to try and do something, you know? (pause) So I don't know it's sort of a weird thing. (pause) I (pause)</p>

<p>(00:10:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it sounds to me like that you actually have pretty mixed feelings about whether you'd want to be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I want to be under control if I could be different, you know? What I want to do is I want to be able to turn it off and on as I want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like say if people I can be like myself around but if I know that I need to be careful around certain people that I can be very different, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to be able to be more reserved and be able to properly like (pause) manipulate the situation with certain people, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And is it hard to do much of that even say with your mother-in-law?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. So you know, "Hey stop chewing yourself." The ... she just drives me up the wall. I don't even talk to her that much but when I do she definitely, you know has the ability to control the situation, pretty much, you know? And I'm just so happy go lucky that I'm just happy that you're talking to me that, you know, "Sure I will send you this spare computer we have sitting around the house." You know or something like that randomly, you know? (pause) It's sort of a ... like I said it's kind of a messed up situation in that (pause) pretty much, you know I don't really have the ability to (pause) I don't really have the ability to be able to step back and have the reserve that I need, you know? I just so happy you're talking to me that sure I'll say anything that you want me to say. And especially you can manipulate me to saying things that I don't necessarily, entirely always mean even but at that moment I really think I mean because I'm trying to make you happy. Even at some level, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>(00:12:29)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sort of ... it's like I said it's pretty messed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Primarily I've been thinking about this a lot. Not because she lives in Kentucky anymore but we're considering going to visit Kentucky briefly and (pause) if we do that there is a very good chance that we will have to visit family. And I have strong feelings about not wanting to visit family while we're there. (pause) Other than like non-biological family. We're going to go down there to visit his friend Rowland.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so and his family who ... and he's got this e-mail that was not supposed to be a guilt trip but you know the whole thing of you know who's describing all the kids and he's like, "Wow you know blah, blah, blah really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_ 00:13:17) Rowland?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rowland, yes. He's got three kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like, "You know you've got to meet Kara while she's still young and awesome." I'm like, "Dammit, you know, now I feel like I want too." So. We were hoping to try and have Bernard, his son come up and spend the summer with us and do the summer at Yale thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's one year too young. He's the same ... him and I have the same birthday. So actually the problem is in most states the cutoff date for the year you go to school and it's July 15<sup>th</sup>. We're both born July 8<sup>th</sup> so we're almost always the youngest of over a year. And so he's a year too young or whatever to come up for the summer. And we were hoping to have him come stay with us and then Rowland was mentioning the fact that that their daughter Kara who's like seven I guess is, you know, it's like "Oh my gosh she's so incredibly smart. She's like Bernard in a dress. You'll love you know chatting with her." (pause) I can't wait to meet her but I kind of feel bad that, you know it has been like that many years you know since we've been down there, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long has it been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, when Rowland got married again I guess was back in 2002.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, it's been that long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:14:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My husband had been down there briefly back in 2008-2009 when his dad had surgery for something but it was just like a ... he went there and turned around and came right back kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we stopped ... we used to spend a lot of money going down there, a lot. And it became not just a matter of finances but a matter of bitterness on my part because we'd go down there and just didn't feel like first of all there's any reciprocation, but also just didn't seem like they were all that interested in seeing us, so. (pause) But I would like to see a lot of our friends that have, you know settled down and have kids. And the only way we know some of these kids is because of, you know (pause) more or less from you know pictures, that kind of stuff. You know I've known Bernard all of his life, like literally all of his life. But like he's at the weird awkward age where he's like fourteen now, fourteen-fifteen and so it's more of a ... you know he's not ... he's very polite and very kind about everything but he's not all that interested in hanging out with grownups.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's okay. But he would love to spend the summer over at Yale of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(00:16:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But ... I'm just hoping that when he rules the world that he will remember me kindly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: As a person who would take him to various museums and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's an exceptionally good kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But ... (pause) it's kind of hard not being in certain people's lives you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. Yeah. It sounds like you really ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have stronger feelings about Rowland's kids than I do about my own nieces and nephews because I barely know them and although sometimes I make jokes about things to make them more comfortable and so I often make the joke of, "Yeah I'm looking forward to the point where ... you know they get to the point where they can't stand their parents so I finally get to know them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is ... but at the same time in doing that to avail the fact that I'm sad that I can't have a relationship with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that she thinks that in her mind she can totally ... that her kids can't have a relationship with us. But it becomes extremely awkward ... I mean how in the world are we supposed to get into contact with her children, you know if Kerry and Mike aren't speaking, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not exactly certain, you know to ... if the six-year-old has its own cell phone or not, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) But it's just sort of an awkward, weird thing, you know? I just realized two days ago that my niece, Gemma's ... because she was born on Friday the thirteenth which is ... she just had her fourteenth birthday and I'm like, "Oh my God. How long ago with that?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know this is the kid who like the last time I was going to visit, like when I ... she desperately wanted me to sleep with her and when I did not, for lots of reasons especially because of the fact I can't fit into a like a crib/toddler bed, you know she decided that she was going to sleep right next to me on the couch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I wakeup and find her there. But now she's fourteen years old, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:18:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure that's not, you know she's completely different person, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sad stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) I'm not sure if I should be proud of her or freak-out by the few things that I hear about her or what, you know? Apparently she is disgusted with her public school system. Two years ago, three years ago she got disgusted with her public school system so she gathered up a bunch of other students and started conducting classes while they were supposed to have other classes so that they could actually ... I'm not sure if like I should be upset or ... because I did something kind of like that but we were all like sixteen at that point and it was because we didn't feel like they were teaching us the right things in a foreign language class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she was like ten -twelve years old when she started trying it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is kind of weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not sure if I'm proud of her or creeped out by that or what, you know? I know nothing about Aiden. Because Aiden is a male in his family. We don't respect males, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't literally know nothing. I don't know anything about him at all other than the fact that I know he was born sometime in August. That's it. It's like a complete and total blank. Oh yes, I also know that for a while there they thought he may had a learning disability. But actually it was that he just couldn't get a word in edge wise. I'm totally serious. He was an extremely late talker.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As soon as his older sister went to school he started talking. Completely serious. They did all the of the testing. They thought there was something wrong with him.</p>

<p>(00:20:02)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was literally ... he just needed to have his little sister gone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Peace and quiet so he could talk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So ... but I mean, that's all I know. And that was obviously years ago since he's probably like ten or twelve now. So, I don't know anything about them, you know? Whereas I have, although I'm an only child, I had very close relationship with a lot of, you know my cousins and I will have no nieces and nephews officially on my side of the family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have many very close friends that their children, you know are very special to me, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I find it so strange that, you know these children that I know nothing about. And I felt really bad because for a longtime I was doing stuff for them and I just stopped doing it because I just felt like there was nothing coming from the other side. Like just send me an e-mail or something saying we've received the package. I know the kids can't send me e-mail but the mom just saying, "We got the package with the stuff that you sent the other day." That would just be great. Not even a thank you just so you know the package arrives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An acknowledgment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And (pause) I realized that it really didn't matter. For a while there I was sending things that I couldn't really afford to buy because they wanted them. But I was also mixing it up with things like, like they're in Kentucky so they don't see the leaves change so I was sending them leaves so they could see the leaves, you know so they could see what color leaves, nothing. Couldn't tell nothing was ... nothing ever came back. And so I felt like I was just drilling all of this energy into a hole, you know?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:21:44)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (pause) I wonder if one thing that makes it hard to like navigate with Mike's family is, I don't get the sense from the way you describe it that you kind of feel the sort of immediate pang of their doing something hurtful which makes it hard to ... I guess I'm sort of picturing like navigating a ship at night in a rocky area. And like if you don't have someway of like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no way of figuring out what is and is not appropriate behavior or accepted or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well like when you send them things and they don't even respond, like to acknowledge let alone thank you for what you've done. I don't get the sense that you have an immediate feeling of being hurt.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I dampened in that. I think I had too, you know? (pause) I think at the time I was really hurt. But I knew that if I acted that way that I was never going to get a response, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes ... I mean I think I know what it means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) I think that (pause) I think that I just started letting go because I knew that it was too pain ... after a couple of quick things of, you know (sigh) (pause) after a couple things where I wasn't necessarily really appreciated that's when I started realizing that, you know (pause) I needed to stop caring, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you do this thing with bad feelings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where it's like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to like, I mean how in the world else am I supposed to deal with it, you know? I have this person in my life who I care very much about and her mother doesn't give a damn, you know?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess (pause) it's a dilemma. Like I don't have a solution for the dilemma. I guess how it seems to me is that by pretending it doesn't hurt as much as it does and ignoring when your in-laws do hurtful things to you it seems to me you put yourself in this position of continuing to get hurt and not being able to protect yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they keep me at arms length I have really no way of saying that something bothers me though.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well but you're saying that ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I were to send an e-mail saying that I'm really hurt, that I, you know that I haven't heard anything back I would get nothing back anyways. And she screens, I mean all of the family have all these screens. I mean they made the mistake of letting us see that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I'm not talking about that so much is that (pause) you know that ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're actually meaning feeling the pain as opposed to not necessarily saying to them that you're hurting me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Correct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I imagine that would drive you ... like that would help you to have the kind of reserve or to be able to like deflect or evade questions. Or make decisions about how and when to put yourself out there. Because you're saying it's so hard to do. I don't have any belief that you get anything any better back from them. I don't think this would change them one bit. I'm just saying that like it seems like my hope would be like you might ... it might help you to not keep walking into the same door.</p>

<p>(00:26:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying really hard to sort of like fit in by acting like things don't bother me though. Because that's the way that they do things, like you know in terms of, "Oh you're sick? No big deal." You know? Or you know whatever, just no big deal, you know you just keep ... like at any given time whatever happens, like if we ever tell like something to Mike's mom about what's wrong with me or actually wrong with him, "Oh Kerry at that at one point. Yeah it was pretty bad."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great. You know like something tells me that she did not actually have an autoimmune reaction in her, you know in her intestinal system that kept her from be able to digest things. I could be wrong, you know, it's possible, you know? And she just sort of kept on plotting on.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well but I mean you know the answer there, I mean (inaudible_ 00:27:09) batting total bullshit to dismiss what's going on with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but the thing is everybody is like that. You know the whole thing about, "Oh it's no big deal that, you know you spent money you didn't have on this dress because of, you know that somebody else you know did nothing." Kids will be kids. Can't believe you're such a spaz you know that she ruined it within twenty minutes of like, you know putting it on her, you know? You shouldn't be like, you know you don't buy things for children if you're not okay with like letting them ruin something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I was ... maybe I'm the one that screwed up by that, you know that I'm upset. You know I have to be not upset about this because it's like ... children are supposed to ruin things, children are supposed to do this, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to keep myself (pause) I have to not feel things to be able to fit into the family.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not fitting into the family in anyway that's remotely working for you and I don't even think you really have a whole lot to lose with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know. I just ...</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:28:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wish that it was otherwise. I wish I thought it was like, you know we were sitting here talking about like, "Well you know if you were just a little more like this or a little more like that. The few cultural differences ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There are definitely some things that just ... some incidences that have just really bothered me so much that, you know I have to numb them out. I mean otherwise they're just too painful. I mean I spent a long time crying over a lot of this stuff and quite frankly I have friends that are like, "We're sick of hearing about it, you know?" And so I had to just sort of numb it out, you know? Everything is about power with them. I did some very, very, to me very meaningful things that I will never know if they even still exist anymore, you know? That (pause) I will never ... I just feel like I shouldn't have done, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really awful to be treated that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:29:37)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>And (pause) at the very least once I started getting, you know nieces and nephews I was hoping that, you know just, you know maybe things are not working out the way that they want them be but at least maybe they ... you know eventually they'll like me, you know? I didn't do this because I wanted them to like me. Like I gave Gemma when she was a baby a necklace of mine that I actually got that my dad bought for me when we were in Paris together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And partially because of the fact that we couldn't have children. I found that out and I wanted to make sure some family member got it. It was made for a child, it's not like I could wear it anymore anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know it was extremely valuable. I don't know if she understood it was valuable. I'm assuming that she did. But the point though is that I don't even know if it's actually like in their possession anymore. I left it ... you know and I knew that, you know it was going to take some time because she was a baby at the time. So I wrote a letter about, you know that this was something that was very special to me and my own dad, you know bought this for me when I was in Europe with him when I was about, you know six or seven, blah, blah, blah. And (pause) I got no acknowledgment even like, "Oh we're going to put this away for her.", you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is pretty straightforward. That's unconscionable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:31:08)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really unconscionable behavior on their part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yes because it was valuable but it wasn't just because it was a valuable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. (cross talk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's part of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because one of these days if she wants to go to Europe I will take her, you know? It doesn't matter what I have to do to do it because I want to make sure that these kids actually get some life outside of ... you know (pause) where they are. And yes I know they've traveled but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can't make sure that they get that no matter how good it would be for them. How kind it would be on your part. (pause) I mean you can't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just don't want them growing up thinking that basically that the 'Jerry Springer' show of their lives right now is really not only the only viable options that they have but even necessarily acceptable type of life, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean that would be great if that was something you had more control over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Somebody's really wanting attention today. Basically the ... but I just don't want anymore of those kids to really like ... just (inaudible_00:32:57) through this. You know of being ignored and being told things weren't good enough and that kind of stuff. And I know the very least that his life he ... and this is where I start to sound like an asshole but like did he appreciate the things, you know that I was able to give him, you know? Makes me sound like some sort of benevolent freak. And like, "Okay so I realize that you have these terrible white trash ways and I'm going to show like that, you know you don't necessarily have to be that way." But yet at the same time it's not like it's ... you know it's not like it's been especially good for him either to be raised the way he was, you know?</p>

<p>(00:33:36)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're freaking proud of it. (pause) You know that they raised him on neglect. The way your raise an orchid or a cactus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because honestly I think they believe that smothering people would kill them. I don't know. But at the same time like when Rowland got remarried, you know his wife who I only just met ... Mike had known her because apparently I guess they lived down the street from each ... very random thing. Small world ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is his second wife?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah second wife.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: His first wife passed away really early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's part of the reason why with Bernard I'm very close to him is because he was at that age where he was not able to really understand and he was very angry. So ... I mean he was like six.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. He's the child of Rowland's first wife? I didn't realize that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah sorry I didn't explain that right. Yeah Rowland and Gemma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he was like I guess six-ish when it happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it was pretty bad. It's really bad. And I think that ... there were a lot of things going on but I think that a lot of people like to criticize the fact that he wanted to get married. When I say right away I'm talking about like within three years of being widowed. Not like (pause) next month. But you know I had a lot compassion for Bernard, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know his wife also had a child, she was divorced. Her name is Katherine and within like hours of meeting her, Katherine wanted me carrying her around everywhere I went. And like this is something where like, you know that she ... like the fact is that you know this person who Candace only just met who doesn't know anything about me, understood enough about me that I was actually, although I was in high heels while doing this was having the time of my life carrying around a six year old, you know? Or seven year old or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I adored doing it. And why in the world my own sister-in-law like doesn't understand enough about me (pause) kind of freaks me out, you know? I mean I'm sure that Candace ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It isn't that she fails to understand, that's not the problem. (pause) I don't know what the problem is but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't care or she's decided that I'm a different person than I really am, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't either.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:35:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do know that, like I said that there's this reputation of Mike's ex-girlfriends are being crazy. I don't know how much of it is actually true and how much of it is not. One of them I met is bonafide crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been in the family a longtime.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not that crazy. I can't be that crazy. But they want me to be crazy, you know? (pause) But I just, you know have to wonder how much of this has been setup, you know to (pause) to be crazy, you know? (pause) I don't know. But it's just a rotten life and I want Mike to like honest to God, you know I can't ever say this but I don't ever want him to have anything to do with any of those people ever again. But I can't do that because that would make me awful. (pause) I have in my own way like sort of implied that and quite frankly you know he doesn't have a whole lot to do with them. He hasn't spoken to his sister since his graduation more or less because she implied that, you know that I was nuts and the whole family can't stand me. But ... you know ... they have spoken by text briefly once when his one brother got out of jail and once when she heard that he, which is true, but he had a mass in his head and she just you know said something like, "Hi how are you doing?" And he's like, "Uh if you're trying to like apologize for being mean to my wife feel free to call me. Otherwise just go away." (laugh) Which was really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it just ... I don't get it it's such ... everything ... you know I'm being told that I am screwed up from a screwed up family, you know? When everything that I have is ... and I bought into it. I don't even understand how in the world I was able to be manipulated into buying into it and believe it, really. Like one hundred percent been brainwashed into believing there's something wrong with me and my family, you know? And I even feel guilty about it. But this is why I have to keep my family from really knowing what's going on. Like at least my parents because I think that it would just kill them.</p>

<p>(00:38:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Why I guess I imagine it must have something to do with how much you wanted to have them as family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sort of how much of the benefit of the doubt in the way you wanted to give to them because it seems to me that's your strategy for making relationships work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah for the most part. (pause) And most of the time it works. (pause) Why in the world can I not like go though? I mean cut my loses. Why is it so important to me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are really good questions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like the ones I don't know the answer too and I don't know if I ever will, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They sound answerable to me. Like in other words (pause) maybe not tomorrow or next week but ... (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really something I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah pretty much the reason why I've decided that I'm obnoxious and shallow and all this stuff is because is that's kind of what I got from them. Though they said it to me directly. It's always third party but you know? (pause) God forbid I clothe, fed, and cared for their son, you know, (pause) when nobody else did. Before we were married back when I was only like nineteen years old, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like when ... like they weren't taking care of him. Like he had nothing to ... they sent him to Brooklyn for the winter with one of those sleeveless ski jackets. You know that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. At what age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eighteen, nineteen. (pause) They didn't even buy him a winter coat because they didn't think they ... I guess it not even dawned on them what winter coats are like, you know? Mind you that Mike's mother was born at the Dartmouth hospital all the way across town here, you know, while her dad was at Harvard, you know? Like this is not like ... I mean sure they can claim that they'd been living in Kentucky but they have to have some freaking clue, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>(00:41:01)</p>

<p>I don't know. It just (pause) It just kills me that, you know that they (pause) had no, you know (pause) interest in caring for him, you know? Because he's a good kid. He's bright, he loves people, you know? They even started propaganda about things that aren't even true, you know? Like the first thing I heard about was the fact that Mike hates babies. Like I heard that Mike like ... Mike said he's allergic to babies. Like maybe he said that when he was like a little kid. I have never met a man in my life who has been a bigger sucker for a baby than him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like kids that are from like across the room at brunch start staring at him and he starts making faces back ... he loves them. I don't even understand what was the point about saying that? This wasn't like to give me condolences after he found out we couldn't have kids. This was told to me like at eighteen that you know that he just was not into kids. It's like ... and he actually thought he wasn't either except for the fact that he just realized he liked being around kids. It's such a weird, weird world that they tell him what he likes, you know and what he doesn't like, you know? The only time that ever happened to me in my life and my dad only just admitted this like five years ago is he tried a psychological experiment of telling me what my favorite color was to see if it was really my favorite color, like from the beginning. Yeah.\</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I cannot believe ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) I have kind of a sense of your dad's like benign scientific curiosity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty much what it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he started ... and it only came out because we were looking ... we were at the drug store and I was looking at two different types of cough syrup and he's like, "Why don't you get that one. That one's blue." And I'm like ... because the green looks like it's more powerful. I don't' know. He's like, "No. But your favorite color is blue." And the next thing that I found out is that he's been telling me my whole life that my favorite color is blue. (laugh) And I ask him, "How many other things?" He's like, "Nothing. I just ..." Apparently he was reading something back in the seventies and he thought it would be an interesting experiment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... but that's like the only like weird thing I've ever been told about my life that wasn't my own decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it was just because he was just (pause) I think at the time he just thought it was amusing, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know (pause) the (pause) the fact I mean ... you know I married a guy that was dictated everything that he likes and doesn't like, you know? And it's kind of weird, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How weird. And for the most part actually none of it's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:44:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is even weirder.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With me actually I don't really know what my favorite color is because (laugh) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I almost doubted that but now I understand statistically that most people's favorite color is blue so it's entirely possible that it was a coincidence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just a weird thing, you know? (pause) I don't know. (sigh) I wish that I understood why it is that ... they claim I come from a maladjusted family that is broken and I don't think like it's true. But at the same time if it weren't true then why in the world would I be so desperate and so easily brainwashable? Did that make sense? That's a weird paradox I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it does make sense. I mean I think I follow your logic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because obviously if I'm able to be brainwashed so easily, obviously I must have come from a screwed up family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's not necessarily true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trust me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I believe you on this one. (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) It's really not necessarily true. I mean for example if to take a dramatic example. If you looked at all the ... not everybody who's been in a cult is from a totally screwed up wacky family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Fair enough. (pause) But it just ... it makes me angry with myself that I am so easily ... I was so easily taken in and you know ... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean here's another (pause) overly simplistic (pause) story line. I don't get the sense there was a whole lot of arguing or hostility or bad feeling in your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was usually resolved pretty fast. If it was it was very good-natured. If that makes sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it does. And so like ... and I imagine you all tend ... you were a family where you all tended to give each other the benefit of the doubt all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For the most part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Usually ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it wasn't then it was definitely described to me as and I remember being told as a child that your brain hasn't fully matured yet, therefore you don't get to make a decision in this. When you know ... like seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) Yeah I understand. That's the thing that only a six year old could decide. Like ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I was told that my frontal cortex hasn't done growing yet, you know? But at the same time it was very adaptable. The only time I remember my parents physically yelling at each other in public was in Italy and I think it was because of the fact ... and they weren't really yelling at each other. I think they were having a Donatella Botticelli argument.</p>

<p>(00:47:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the thing is, is that it was almost like because of the fact that we were in an area where people got very, very passionate about it ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be contagious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was contagious and next thing you know ... this was like not uncommon at all to have these kinds of arguments.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's like a very, very poignant moment in life thinking to myself, "Have they just like totally gone around the bend?" And then I realize as I'm looking around going, "Everybody else is yelling here too."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, like (pause) if you ... I mean there's a very simple version that maybe entirely true but there's just one possibility. You grew up in a family where people gave each other the benefit of doubt and that almost always worked out very well and it was shown to be well deserved afterwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like why wouldn't you do that with a new family you wanted to be part of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. That's very true.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:48:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tomorrow's a big day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck. I hope it goes well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing quite like, you know getting up at 3 a.m. to be somewhere at four and (inaudible_ 00:48:26).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually all the employees will be at work at 4 a.m.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because ...</p>

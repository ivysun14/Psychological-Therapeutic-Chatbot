<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: August-oh my God. April, finished with interview 17. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:24.4) for the first time in two and a half weeks. (inaudible at 0:00:34.6). And I didn't have a good time when I was there. I really didn't. So really (inaudible at 0:00:45.1) keeping on going. And I really didn't like it. So - </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have underlined experience though, the (inaudible at 0:00:51.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it was not like that. I realized that it would be helpful. I already knew I'm in a serious state here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I realized, so I did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you like going to class and you make some kind of a difference. It wasn't just depressing you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think. When someone pointed out to me, you know that if I have been to a lot of times, I wouldn't be quite as far behind. But really I hadn't done the work, to pass that kind of test. I don't know. At this point, like right now, I feel like I would be better off studying, than being here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well can you - do you want to just quit for today and set up a thing up for another time? [0:01:46.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just-I just feel really busy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As of now, I want to say that because I wanted you to make that a real possibility, seems (ph) fair to me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what I thought. I don't, see -  It [really would] (ph) be pointless. Because nothing is that pressing. It's sort of like it is just studying I have to do. Just that I don't know like I really see a lot of space to do this in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see. [0:02:25.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they're all kind of present you for you now too. Like all the-the stuff of a list or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, you don't know what to talk about? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't have time. I really feel like I have a lot of things to really work on, in here. But, I don't know. I just don't feel like saying serious stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like wanting to feel like you're getting on with one of those things than you are? Like you get- [0:03:31.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to. It's sometimes funny. I get like in a very poor phase. And maybe very busy from the time I get up, until the time I go to bed. And, I can-when I look back on what I've done that day, and I really didn't that much studying done, but you sure were busy. You didn't get much studying done. You didn't waste time. You weren't like making things to do. You were really [factoring in] (ph) your tasks for yourself which were all like good tasks to spend your time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They were real things that had to be done but they didn't get on, the biggest thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I can just-just four weeks and it is like all we do. A lot of days, too, I really don't feel like getting it done. (inaudible at 0:04:44.5) And even now, right now what I'm doing is talking -  well talking and thinking about the stuff I have to do. And it's just-I thinking, "Wow that's a lot (ph)." And then of a sudden something pops into my mind, that's one more thing. I just think, "Good grief. All of that, and now I just thought of another."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the list is just multiplying-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And multiplying. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel like, (inaudible at 0:05:12.1). I'm not depressed by it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not going to say, "Oh my God, I might as well give up because this is really terrible." But you're thinking, "Okay well."</p>

<p>PATIENT: There you go. Yeah, sometimes have to be done at a certain time. And then there are other things that can be done at anytime but they should be done by the end of the week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then somehow there's excitement to that too. With a little - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right because it seems like a possibility I can get it done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of look forward. [0:05:43.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm feeling I need to like sit down and schedule. Just so I can put it down on paper if I can see it. What hours each day are, do I have commitments for? And then it will list the things I have to do. Like filling out the remaining spaces and what else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that wanting to know-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like time always stays together within a week. Making sure that I don't forget anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can know that it's all there, and kind of plan for it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It just occurred to me, I'm a (inaudible at 0:06:48.2) assistance in at least a week. Like take crusts along the way. But I never do. This is-this is the moment that I'm going to ask a detour (ph) to you, that spring is coming late this year. It just seems like it's still chilly out when I expect it to be-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is chilly definitely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really really warm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've lived in New York, or around New York my whole life, and every year I think that it's terrible that it's cold so late. But that's because I'm going by-I keep going by what they say in the textbooks or something about the seasons. So I don't-I keep thinking, "Well April. It should be warm. March it should be getting warm even." But even-and that's even though I've lived in New York my whole life. And I don't think that it's ever, really been like I think April should be. I haven't changed my notion of what April should be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep on -  every time I pass a tennis court and I see they don't even have the nets up, it just seems to me that this time last year, this time in previous years, people were playing tennis constantly. [0:08:05.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It could be. It's certainly less rain. But I only know that from the-because the radio has started to  - </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: To mess up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Speak out to] (ph) everybody. There's only been an eighteenth of a hundred -  no. Eighteen hundredth of an inch of rain since March, which is unusual for spring around here. It's been incredibly dry. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But see I didn't know that. But then I thought, Yeah, I'm ri-that's right. I've only worn my raincoat to school one day. But I hadn't thought-</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:08:40.4) It seems like for a few weeks every time I came over here it was raining. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't remember. If it was raining, it was probably raining one of those hundredths of an inch. </p>

<p>(laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not a very good - if it's a conclusion [you want] (ph), I'm not a very good person to ask. (inaudible at 0:08:59.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. You sound like what I already know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You say that, you think it's telling right, but it's probably not. Which is the same feeling I have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying... trying to think of something. I wonder why it's so much sunnier than I remember this spring ever being. There's never this much sunlight. (inaudible at 0:09:59.8). Any time it's, sunny in the middle, it's always cold. That's just another one of these observations. And it, it was cold and then more cloudy than I think. And it's also a bit more (inaudible at 0:10:24.2) on warm days than it is on cold days. But it's just-something that bothers me. Why can't it be a sunny day in the winter. It would be so much more pleasant. I don't get it. But, the same old feelings that we've mentioned sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah at the moment everything seems to be pretty much in control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, there's nothing like back, pressuring you to talk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing threatening to break out. Nothing pressing me to talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what does that leave you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels exterior. I'm sure there are still things to talk about. But I don't know, it is part of my whole nature, not to be very talkative, at least at this point. I think it's unusual when I come up with someone. And they're like, "Silence is the reality, conversation is the exception." It's sort of like I have to make an effort to do it. And since I have to make an effort, it's by definition, that it's not what I do. It's not the most pleasant thing I could do. Something like that. And I just feel like, do-no longer be there, and not really ever having to do this. [0:12:51.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of a demand that's put on you that's difficult for you to meet. Meaning, that you'll do it but it's not pleasant. It's kind of work to have to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Any conversation yeah. Or any situation that calls for conversation. If we're sitting at a table or a coffee shop with people or something. You know, it's just something strange in that I really would like to talk to people and everything like that. But it's sort of now this situation with French. (inaudible at 0:13:36.5) The reason that I cannot pass French. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the process is-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still am not doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of what you're saying not doing it because the process involved in getting there is very unpleasant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In a sense, you're sitting and talking with people. The weird thing of it is I talk to people that would make you go, "Oh." Yeah, I spend time with people and everything like that. But, that's the goal. But if I try to do it, it feels unpleasant. And I would feel more comfortable being alone, or not having to talk. And I feel more comfortable now, not having to talk. Although I cast in the future that, I'll feel more comf-I keep on saying that. I feel better talking and interacting with people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but right now, you said in the coffee shop, or you think about sitting there and having to talk. It just seems like it's kind of passing, rather unpleasant and makes you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it makes me like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't fit doing that? Or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't fit and I can't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're no good at-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's also very very trying when I'm in a situation with more than one person. If you [land] (ph) there, you just sort of have to. You can't listen to two other groups talk. Or... [0:15:17.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, when you feel like it's on you, to carry-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's definitely, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then what happens?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel uncomfortable and let them start. Occasionally I manage to talk. But it doesn't last that long. And when it starts to falter, I start feeling uncomfortable again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not really clear on what that discomfort is about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Being -  returning to the situation where you feel you're locked in a room with nothing to talk about. Not talking, just sitting there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And reacting kind of to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Think it makes me nervous. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then there's the same-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And something should happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't just say, "Well okay." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's something should. Something should be being said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again you're feeling like you're the person that should be saying it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much, because it seems to me that most other people, they feel they have something to say. And this other person that I'm with, generally seems to be more (inaudible at 0:17:01.5). Seems to be better at talking to people all right. And then person gets with me and this person can't talk. And it's not like, "Yeah, I'm right." It must me or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like kind of feeling like you're letting down around (ph), in your own way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. For some reason other people don't like to talk to me. You know with other - I got a feeling it was something. It's either-it's either my... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either actively you're kind of passively making it difficult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible at 0:17:46.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So either you're worrying that you aren't doing something you should be or you're kind of wondering, what is it about me that turns people off?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. I don't really have anything more to say about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) Bad news because it's the same type of thing that you're talking about? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Somewhat. It's also I don't feel like getting into it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, it's not a very real concern to you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what that means. Not a real concern. I just felt like saying this should be talking about here, right now, my concerns that-it would really be nice to do something, outside or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then maybe you better work (ph) at putting the things up, about the talking thing it's like not very involving for you when as talking about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at this moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there a way-</p>

<p>PATIENT: But to say that if I were-I could be in a different state for any state of mind, or something that could be very involved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm kind of asking-do you think it's a state of mind thing? Or do you think there's a difference in how you talked about, which would have made it, involving for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking about it in a different way, could have produced a different state of mind, in terms of the... just getting drawn into it and being involved in it. That's the state of mind that I'm-that's sort of required. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm almost asking, is there - can you think of a thing that could have made you more involved in it? At this point, given the state of mind that you started out. [0:19:51.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not. I can't really think of one. Sometimes I think when like I get most involved in the -  talking about something. It's just sort of having to fall on it, the discussion of something that is somewhat meaningful to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How to-I could just be sort of talking on a somewhat superficial level about something. And then I sort of stumble across, this other thing. And I could end up being involved in the other thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas trying-setting out with the other thing, we didn't really get involved in it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying it's kind of a way that you've seen yourself is that if you want to decide a certain thing to talk about is hard for you, to get into and (inaudible at 0:21:05.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now if-Yeah, if I were talking about something else, and all of a sudden, this outward (ph) problem, became related to it or something. One way that I'd do it is talking about and I just can sort of wade over, to it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But discovering it instead of choosing what it's going to be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well- yeah it's discovery. Because it's in the stuff (ph) that I am trying to talk about and say, "Well this is what I really want to talk about it-talk about. And, now how am I going to display (ph) that. What can I talk about."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't kind of say you have a trick on yourself to make it seem like you've discovered the thing that you really need to talk about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean, it's always needed (ph) though, but that I can't talk about, something from out of my head (ph), from other there or something. Like talking about my conversation. I can't do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now -  [0:22:19.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I looked on this sort of... paper on self exploring myself or something. Not having any self discipline or will power. Because, if I did have self discipline or will power, I wouldn't talk about this thing. Even though it wasn't particularly involving for me at the moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, I'm not clear whether you mean what you can't-what you find difficult to talk, to just decide. You find it difficult-this may not be meaningful to finish this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you find it difficult to talk about, a thing when you just decide to talk about it. Or whether you find it difficult to speak to it unless you weren't involved. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:23:26.5) I was trying to get at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it just doesn't make any sense to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well then could you say again, what-why you started learning about yourself when some of this happened. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's another instance of, rather than working to make a conversation go, I just retreat back to a more comfortable position, of not having to talk. I just didn't really leave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems to be like saying, here, when you kind of aren't feeling involved in something you've decided to talk about-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just should keep pushing on it for a while, in a constant state [like that] (ph), to make it work. And if I give me up, then I know it's a type of problem like that. It's, just sort of getting into my desire to be more comfortable, by being unique (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're really choosing, between-</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I'm afraid. [0:24:59.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, between talking in a way that's difficult for you, and to kind of give (ph). And it's unpleasant. And just being quiet which is more comfortable than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in some ways it's more comfortable and in other ways it's uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but neither of those is a very (inaudible at 0:25:20.2) is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. When you're trying to talk to someone and you're on the street or something like that, you can't always talk about what you're interested in. And you may-you have to either get yourself interested in what the other person is talking about or find some sort of middle ground. And I think the people who get along best with other people are the ones who-who are more adept maybe, at getting into -  like what (ph) other people are into at the moment. And that's sort of what they talk about, talk with them. Rather than always having to talk about what they are in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that how you see yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's usually what I'm interested in at the moment, yeah. Probably nothing at all. Because anything that what I'm interested in is difficult to talk about. I got -  I used to be able to be to sit down in these groups of people, and they'd just talk and talk about some things. And bait each other. And it just made no sense at all to me because I wasn't interested in what they were talking about. </p>

<p>I couldn't even understand what they meant. I couldn't follow it or anything. In a way that's sort of like, listening to music. Because in music, you can just sort of have the radio on and it's sort of there and everything like that. It's the way to get into it. But it takes a little effort to get into it. Or at least for me it does. Like there's an actually qualitative distinction between good music (listened to). (ph) [0:27:36.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you're saying that, not only does that same thing apply in conversation, social relationships, but that you-that kind of mental shift (inaudible at 0:27:54.2). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I-I seem to want to but I seem to be unable to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't get yourself to be invested in it, say the things that you need to-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I just sort of, selfishly or something like that. I will choose my instantaneous comfort over what I want to do. In the same way that I chose my instantaneous comfort, makes it hard to fit (ph), over what I ought to do, or what I really thought that I should do, and what would be best for me. And what was like, made me feel better at some point in the future. You know that I really think that it would be much better for me to talk and get myself to talk. By talking to people, getting close to them, and to meet (ph) them and all that stuff. But it's just easier in moments not to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's difficult about doing that talking, like you have...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting myself to really concentrate on it. Just like I have to get myself to really concentrate on French. [0:29:35.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Otherwise you're kind of distracted and not really there -  </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm distracted by myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like background music?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're thinking about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Myself and all the other things, that I have to do. That stuff like what's going to happen to me in the future. I'm doing more of - thinking, "What am I going to do after I move (ph)?" and there's something else. Not only thinking that, well I think to a certain...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now does that mean to you that what you should be doing is not having those background things that are off, in those other thoughts?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just when I'm with myself, I think that. I should (inaudible at 0:30:28.4), when I have nothing left to do. I should be able to have more than a bad (ph) feeling, a higher goal or something that's like-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's almost like you're saying you kind of turn your attention so there's things that happen, like background things. And I think, those are kind of things, I think that happens a lot to me, and to people that I know. Is it in place of feeling (ph) something? Now I don't know how much statistically and I don't know how much compared to you, but I guess how I interpret what you said is, given that that happens a lot is more of what you can turn your attention to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My concentration. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not that the other things really get obliterated but then you know, don't talk [for the moment] (ph). And it's hard for you to do that. They still kind of all seem to count (ph) for the most. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like to (inaudible at 0:31:29.7). I mean like, even if you have to really all push back at some point and tell them (ph) you have too much activity to concentrate, on something else. If you don't pay attention, to the moment, more or less.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is your experience that those-that those things that you're calling to get your thoughts off, are really big and they really bother you. And you need to do something about that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they are things that I need to be thinking about them. But it just seems sort of, self-concerned (ph), self centered. It's part of a self centered mind or something. Just-looking for the easiest thing to fill your head with. Which, you're going to trivia. Things that don't require a lot of time and thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying you aren't even really involved with them. Like they are kind of the furnishing that is already there. And it's easier to-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just keep on running back and forth at the same thing, and not-and just not doing anything worthwhile or something. But they're just... (inaudible at 0:33:05.1) to what I need. I don't know. You know, having (inaudible at 0:33:13.2) at the moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like they're at the same-they take up a lot of room. And there is not room for every-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:33:23.1). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're thinking that you should kind of-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like sort of people who think from the funnies (ph), you know. Except I'm not really that fun, it's all in my mind. I'm not doing anything, but it's like-I'm sort of wondering maybe I should. Which is just a mechanical response (ph), but it takes time. I can almost be asleep. It's no effort and I'm not directing myself to anything. Or working on anything. I think that's pretty place. (inaudible at 0:34:08.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just filling up time and that's cool, kind of. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know what you meant by cool. I don't think it's cool. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If it's one way, to (inaudible at 0:34:32.6). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of take a stance to it, like you were towards him on the phone (ph). Saying, "This is trivial. Pretty damn trivial." (inaudible at 0:34:38.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not-not that it's trivial just that, completely unproductive if you like. If you like-it's not really - like being asleep 24 hours a day. You are just doing that. There's nothing... it's like twiddling your thumbs. You're doing a lot of manual labor. Your hands are busy but you've just done nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've done nothing to show for it. Is that-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's not-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not even satisfying to do it. It's just-done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you think about the way you think, kind of to say, "I haven't gotten anywhere out of this." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think, "This is ridiculous you know." All you knew (inaudible at 0:35:53.1). To be with people, and do something constructive. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of getting very annoyed with yourself in that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:36:07.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Only it's not very interfering. It's not really... I don't know what to do. That's what I needed to say. I don't know how to get out of it. So, I don't feel like doing it. Trapped with high walls that you can't get out of. Like, you're digging a hole. And really as the hole gets deeper, you (inaudible at 0:36:49.9). It's too deep to get out of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just stuck. And you've done it to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It doesn't bother me so much that, I don't see myself-I mean I don't think of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In those terms.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The central thing is more to be on track, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like when I'm not being able-not knowing where to go, having a place to go and what I should to do. Not only will this stuff have to do it correctly, in front of your own (inaudible at 0:37:32.0). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't really see how you can change this, is what you're saying. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't just step out of it and start, having stuff and doing it right. I can-I can barely sit down with a bunch of people and start talking to them, having a good time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's not-it seems to you that it's not going to be a matter of being able to shift. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or even if you did decide if that's what you wanted to do, you know in a-even when you do decide-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't see what course of action to get you to that end place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah I've already decided I already tried it. You know, I have decided not only to, have friends that you think you could go (ph) a lot more time with it. It's just so odd not knowing how I'm going to do it. I mean this way it's just, taking the steps because I really don't know if it's-how it's done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid you'll make a mistake.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And embarrass me and diminish my chance of the-harm my chances of... doing it truly (ph) in the future. [0:39:08.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You made that, in relevancy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not necessarily relevant it's just one of the-why I won't do these steps forward and it will actually can set me back. You know it's sort of... like afraid of being put down or something. Really shame (ph), being ashamed, send me up, in my room for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid that you'll have to cross something that is going to discourage you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just, then I won't do it right now and be discouraged. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't want to be discouraged and you're kind of holding back from-from getting into anything that could, because you're really afraid of something-might want to say to you. You were right-because you got your way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but then, I think that, what's more real, than when it seems like being afraid. It's just that I have to...I'm seeking the easiest way and the path of least resistance, to spend (ph) my time. Which... I don't know. It's just the easiest to do. It's-for a lot of reasons it's the most pleasant thing to do at the moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're finding it difficult to shake loose from that momentary pleasure thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's - yeah, it's very difficult. Not difficult, it's difficult but I can't say that I'm in the process of doing it, so it's-I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, that's what-it's not exactly for you, yet a matter of trying to shake loose of it and not being able to but, it's more of seeing yourself make that choice every time. You know kind of behaviorally, you just-(inaudible at 0:41:40.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that, if I had like a more - a clear idea then I would probably not. But, I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what having a clear idea for me. Which I think even when I have a clear idea of the problem, I think I'll still go on. After finding this need to trivialize this, (inaudible at 0:42:24.6). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't see yourself as going to change in, (inaudible at 0:42:29.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not in the future. Not really in the future. Almost like I could contrast in this school. Now I always had this idea that I'm going to settle down and start working when school is over but I think I'm going to do something about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But this it doesn't seem to you like you have any power over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't. I don't have any idea or none really. I just have, what I have said to you. Pretty much. There's no clear solution. Like there is no assignment which (inaudible at 0:43:11.8). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know how to study, you don't know how to get to-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I used to know how to study. I have done it. I realize I don't really know. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've never really gotten to know people in that way that you're talking about now have you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In an adult way, I would kids, ten years old. But that's-knowing kids is a very different thing than I would like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it kind of feels that you want-those are all -  those skills that maybe you had ten years ago are just very different in your element now. And now you're very ignorant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it seems like, it just occurred to me what I'm doing is-in a way, it's very childish. Because children are aren't ignorant, egocentric. [I guess that's what bothers me] (ph). Like when I was a boy, you just take a toy car or something and play on the kitchen table, it's just a toy car on the table. It's a lot of fun. It's sort of in my imagination or something, and just sort of stay very busy with your self and what you're doing. And it's similar to what I'm doing now. [0:44:33.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what wait-there are nice things about that though, too. And that's - I'm not clear what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd say it's nice, for a little while. That the kid, every day, spends all his time, with a car on the table. And you're doing a good two and a half years or something like that, or longer. After a while it tends to, be a bad thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he like doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What if he does? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See if you like doing it, then it's more complicated. So, that's almost to raise-are you criticizing yourself this solitary tendency in you. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much of value is to be criticized. I mean you seem to be-or more raising, I guess that's what I'm saying. I'm reacting to the fact that you seem to writing off this whole tendency you see in yourself is a bad thing, as a child (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think-I'm reminded of-it's childish or something like that. The reason that I feel a need to write it off. I don't like that idea of myself, of being alone. I hate the idea of being alone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I could just see myself going to work from nine to five, Mondays through Fridays, this job, and going back to my room and studying. All the time alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't like that image of yourself. [0:46:40.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You read books and everything like that, yeah. No I don't like the image of me, setting up in my attic or something like that. And reading every night, from the time I got home up until bedtime. Going to sleep, going to work. I'm just - and then dying alone. Getting old alone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that - you mean, not a good independent, but that you are-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just as I remember. I don't like that. I have an uncle, who - maybe I'm afraid of it because I've seen it, [in real life] (ph). I have an uncle that, had-just this past year got married. He was almost 50 I think. He was really fading (ph). And my mother wanted to say that, how lonely he'd been. And then more, more of a year or something, I think I'd never felt how lonely he was. </p>

<p>Because it just, can't have so much with my experience as a kid having all these people around you [playing with you] (ph) and all the other kids in the neighborhood. I don't know but that just sort of alerted me to, to the fact that being strong and irrational about your stuff. Being alone, are you involved around other people's problems that other people feel. Are you involved in yours? Just, wouldn't do for me. [0:48:37.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want that kind of separateness. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Even now wherever I get that the idea that somebody is alone, I say, "Oh that's not good." But maybe other people who don't mind it. But I always think that they do. I mean, I think that they really mind it. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you still - </p>

<p>PATIENT: All the old ladies you see walking around Central Park, and but then again, maybe that doesn't bother them. But I just can't conceive that it wouldn't (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's-it's more though than that, I guess. It's like - what it means for me, when you think about yourself being alone like that, you can't imagine it being a good thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would really be rather painful to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, that's when you finally get-why we get, totally alone. Not only am I alone but it is almost not living. I don't know. I can think of, probably, an autistic child or something that like, sitting (inaudible at 0:50:00.7) being perfectly happy. And yet I'm really not. I wonder why they're actually caring more. But it's just perfectly happy. Maybe he is curious enough. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the point-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how that fits into it, just seems like I'm learning. My idea of existing is not that. I mean I-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you don't really mean-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't be happy unless I have something to show, for it, what I'm guessing. Might be just something I've made or something I've conceivably have written or a picture I've taken or -  I want to do something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like two things. You really want to do something, and you want to be alive in that way. And you keep on seeing yourself as doing this other thing, killing time, staying one place, kind of. [0:51:02.8]</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well this that, this is-this is sort of like, two problems which are being like one. It's - I don't, I don't you're saying them. I've got nothing to show for my life. And my life hasn't been interested for someone to see. It's -  that's like one problem. But another problem would be, thinking of being alone. It's a natural thing for-to do. I mean it totally sounds like that's to be alone or something. I don't mean that literally. I mean in my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I'm always seeing that in my mind, and the natural thing is to be alone. And I don't like to be alone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your thoughts kind of isolate you, in what you're thinking. And yet that outcome (inaudible at 0:52:10.7). </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not so much my thoughts. It's been my lack of thoughts. I don't - I don't even consider them to having thoughts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you think thought to mean a good idea?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, thought, when you said, "Thought" I think of an idea. It can mean something, something like that. These are just a mashing (ph) (inaudible at 0:52:33.5). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they aren't legitimate enough to be called thoughts, you mean. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's very true. Maybe like washing your face before going to sleep tonight. That's, they're not really thoughts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean there's nothing in them to say to other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there's nothing to say in them. I mean, blah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do they bore you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The fact that there's nothing about them to say to other people is not really an important thing, it's just-boring. Maybe to me it's like being unproductive. They really don't - don't have any information. [0:53:46.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's nothing in them to excite you or keep you moving? Or get moving?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing in them that relates to any new way of doing anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the inside of your mind is always the same, you're saying? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In general over a period of time, it's all-you can say it's the same because there are all these trivia floating around there. But I was thinking in more specific terms you're only spending a few hours, to just think of the same exact things three times, and getting (ph) involved. And what it means for me inside (ph) me. I don't know. That may have been-part of the last paragraph, the last few sentences, it sounds like a paragraph in conversation. It started to get close to the edge as far as getting too abstract. Like if I'm not careful I'll step over and it's not going to meaningful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could we go back, to the end of the other paragraph? And see how come you started loosing track? What started being...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just don't think that I'm... I'm moving forward. I might circle around something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is feeling distant from it, starting to feel distant from it a matter of thinking to yourself, "This isn't getting anywhere." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like I'm being stalled from it. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's getting distant-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's keeping me talking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But isn't getting distant a product of that reflection? Or is it, is it one of the things that we used to (inaudible at 0:56:12.2)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose it's how we listen. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably the easiest answer, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you understand the question?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was having a hard time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Understanding it? Okay. What alternative-I was basically asking, how does that distant thing start happening, for you? And one thing I was thinking that it could work, when you mentioned the thing about standing in (inaudible at 0:56:48.1), thinking about, "Am I getting anywhere?" Like that. One way, that the distance thing might help it, is that, when you start checking on that. Like carrying on the conversation, plus thinking about whether it's getting somewhere. That that, pulls you away. It's a... </p>

<p>PATIENT: [Yeah, but] (ph)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now do you understand that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I'm trying to rephrase (ph) something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that-</p>

<p>PATIENT: To really make-[0:57:16.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I may not be being clear for you. What's happening, you just don't get at all what I'm saying? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's-what's happening is that we talked about, these-I just don't how to tie them in. I'm having a hard time making -  making meaning to a constructive. Seems rather abstract, trying to remember something that was abstract or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to remember what you were thinking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How to remember feeling that. Trying to change the feelings into words. Trying to describe what's going on in my head in words. But how do you match the words to that, just sort of clearly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of don't seem related? But you can't get back to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know the exact relation to it. I can't-I'm saying that because what's going on in my head does not fit into one of two things you said. Either one case or the other, not being in two cases. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:58:24.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is one - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't really-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is one-is A called B is being called A or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. So then you're saying when it didn't really fit into either of those-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Made it up. Out of the blue. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't even know if it didn't so-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tried to pick the word that fit. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you feel like you know the pic-</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really difficult. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like in a situation like that you've got to pick or you can't say, "This is so not a meaningful task for you?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that I should do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. What about-</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's just the easiest way of how I'm doing it when I don't really understand what you said. I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did a kind of thought. Pretend that you know and trail out an answer that's-doesn't really compromise where you're at. But-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretend to you that I know - and pretend to me that I know, all this kind of stuff. But yes, (inaudible at 0:59:17.7) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you really are, is just confused about the whole thing. I'm not at all sure you can -  even resolved it all but certainly not going to say that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How-why I said that was because you said-well, I said maybe the thing isn't (inaudible at 0:59:41.6). Maybe neither A or B. It's the same. And you said, "Well yeah, but you can't say 'shouldn't feel that.' Or 'Can't feel that.'" </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's possible. It seemed. Maybe, probably. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that isn't like a-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although in some way, I didn't really feel that, that it was for me to say that it wasn't helpful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seemed to me that you asked the question, you must have thought it was a really good thing to go on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean wasn't for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like, I assumed that the way you structured the question, that the choices were exhausted. No matter what was going on in my head, it had to fall into one of those two categories we talked about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's a-that's a bad way of asking a question. I know I have a tendency to do that. And I think, that I need to have a third alternative open, when I ask it like that. And I guess the implication isn't there, as always. The third category being, "Or does this make no sense." (laughs) One of the ways that I don't say that, which is more for information than anything else, I don't know. Is that, one of the main reasons is that I assume that they are, and I guess that that doesn't leave enough open for you sometimes. You know, you don't feel from when I say it like that but there really is a real alternative for you to say, "That doesn't make sense." [1:01:24.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well sometimes I do. I think. Sometimes I do. (inaudible at 1:01:34.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's okay. But I have a question about that. Is that like, do you have a sense that that only happens when I ask in a certain way or is it something you need or...? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it happens, when I understand more clearly-when I think I understand more clearly what you mean. It's when I say I don't understand something that you're asking, that I assume, your question is more-I don't know what category at the moment. But your question more clear that probably does not give alternatives to me. [1:02:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now that's when you understand what it means. That's sad. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's probably it-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that just-it that implicitly to say that when you don't understand you think I'm saying something more profound? Or-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like that yeah. It's more profound than... and I'm not understanding at all. But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you ought. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would be able to at least understand it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you don't, you shouldn't ask?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know that. I don't ask.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I didn't mean that that was exactly, explicit. But that seems to be implicit in how you perceive when we get to a point like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't ask. It's easier not to ask for me but just assume. But you're right when you've given me these two choices, and I've somehow got it. (inaudible at 1:03:50.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing about not asking is what was-embarrassing? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You shouldn't be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's mostly, I think, meaning a good tactic where I work. If I was on to something that I liked talking about to the educational (inaudible at 1:04:15.0), I don't want to ask a question and maybe be (inaudible at 1:04:21.1) like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But the problem is that the also answering with a kind of, 'one or the other or picking one', also can distract you. Like any of those alternatives seem probably to distract you from the thing that you know. Like-now there's something that may be difficult for you to do, and I guess that's probably why I've never done it this way. Which is to say, "You know, look. Bad question." This is how I would put it. I don't know how you would put it. The question may be good or not but it's kind of irrelevant responding (ph) to this other thing, if we're to go on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I should say that but-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now-</p>

<p>PATIENT: For fear of offending you or something like that. Why I wouldn't do (inaudible at 1:05:05.6). And go on and on and on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And hope you can kind of fend me off with that and get back to the-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And get that same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, why I wasn't saying it. I think that-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of, okay, have to do a holding action for a couple of minutes and try to keep the other thing in your mind until you can gracefully get back to it, without....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just subtlety (ph). (laughs) Just kind of  - </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Hope she doesn't pick on that."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hold sort of stop and starts. Sort of like that handle (ph) by picking that part of the brain, and here comes a question that I kind of answer. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When happens can you get back to the other thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I'm handling an equivalent question you know, in a more or less automatic way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the other thing, that is there, so you can pick up on it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose. It doesn't always work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I'm really asking, is that a successful package that you can-thing that you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really because you do ask me questions and I do, say everything I want. And sometimes I know that your question are not like that, clear to me. But rather than stopping to get this question cleared and having you think about the question, you would think about it, which would tend to move right along. As a (inaudible at 1:06:38.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you say, (clicks tongue) you give your-your little thing, and then you can go right back. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm asking. Can you really go back? Or does that work? Can you get back to that point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd say pretty well. I'd say, pretty well that (inaudible at 1:06:57.9). Not making a big effort to give you that, the most accurate answer to the question. Now that effort implies now making some effort into clearly the question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well now I'm raising this other alternative which is to say, "Well I don't want to answer that question. That doesn't seem relevant." And I'm really posing, this success thing. It isn't really between not answering at all, or getting clear. But between-in riddle. And kind of hoping that your mind is going to hold, the thing that you're really into, through your handing me an answer. And whatever I do with that, that your mind is going to hold your involvement, until you can get back to it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess -  I still - I probably wished that what-and then expecting an answer from you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:08:05.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understood what you said that (inaudible at 1:08:06.2). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well there is another alternative, but it's complicated. See really I'm asking, I'm raising a fourth alternative, of something you could do. And we have-don't have time to explore whether it makes sense to you. But a fourth alternative would be for you to say, "No I don't want to answer that question." And what I'm concerned about is, (clucks tongue), this thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what I'm raising, it seems to be that's a better way of staying involved in the thing, and having to go through, putting another thing into storage. Putting another thing into- [1:08:39.4]</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well no. No, I-the first time you presented that to me, right away, I said, "This is a lot better for me." And more or less planning on begging to do that. It would really-it's a more honest answer or something like that. And this way I avoid, confusing you I suppose with an accurate answer. You know like if you ask me a question I don't understand that I give you any old answer, you can-you might like to think something else from my answer. Which means-you know, because I didn't really understand the question. [1:09:29.8]</p>

<p>The things you say may not be, maybe that true. So it would be better-I assume that's why you suggested it. It seems to me that it would be better that I say that. And not making up a good answer. I start to feel like-I don't know, maybe guilty. For not having done that before. For not having been that honest. But, it's not really bothering me, to get this sort of-I've known all along that I'm not that honest or something like that. That may be part of my problem with talking with people. I tend to do what's easiest for me, not lie, although it might be necessary to do. You know like it's hard for me to tell someone, "I don't want to answer your question." It doesn't mean anything to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry, I've got to stop. I didn't realize it was so late. I'm sorry. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Next (ph) Wednesday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of needed the direct approach. After allow-I mean, I started talking about the direct-using the direct approach and we had decided that it's something to talk on Friday. (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? So, are you glad about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. And I was just like, "You were just saying, well it's pouring out there with a different (inaudible at 1:11:15.2)."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it did have to occur to me that -  something that I still wanted to talk about had to occur, here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Bye. </p>

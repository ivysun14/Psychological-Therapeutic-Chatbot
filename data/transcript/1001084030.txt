<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] is an interesting lady, in that she has had, um, both ADD and, uh, post-traumatic stress disorder.  She takes Adderall XR 25 mg 3 times daily and, um, also Prozac</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Effexor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excuse me, Effexor, um, how much do you take?  How much Effexor do you take?  Uh, 225 mg per day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].  Well, my dad became bedridden -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which was for a very short period of time, but I wasn't allowed to see him, yknow, and um then [NAME OTHER] tried to go over and see him and she turned him away and, but then, he became an official member of a club because all of dad's children were, yknow, treated that way -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it wasn't, it hurt his feelings, but we could all sort of, he could commiserate with us, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me say something.  [PATIENT NAME] is an old patient, old meaning many, many years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, um, she has been at odds with her family for some time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ten years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For 10 years.  Um, especially her father and his step wife.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> His wife.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> His wife, your step, step, stepmother.  And there has been a lot of conflict back and forth with that with the stepmother.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the ex husband.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the ex husband.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They've kind of joined forces.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Joint forces to sort of keep [PATIENT NAME] out of the picture.  [PATIENT NAME] has had lots of problems.  Her mental illness, which showed she had extreme ADD, very much like someone who was, who looked manic, it was so severe.  Um, that was taken as, that was taken to be the use of drugs and her use of Adderall to try to control it, was also used as abuse, and she was put in jail for a while.  Um, where she lost several teeth and a few other things, that came out with the post-traumatic stress disorder.  Um -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Any taking of drugs by my father and his, especially his wife - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, his second wife, Prozac was oh, my God, which I was on to begin with, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You pull yourself up by your boot straps.  You don't, yknow, need that kind of stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  But what's, what's happened now now has been that the father's died and the alliances have realigned with her, with the patient and her siblings, now getting on the same page.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And this realignment has slowly come about when I came back to town about 2 years ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was arrested.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Again for no reason, but in York County, that can happen.  I mean, they don't really, they don't really have to have a reason, I mean, um, yknow, and that's 1 of, I think, the underlying reasons for my paranoia, as people call it - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And um, they say well now, you shouldn't be afraid to go out, because you haven't done anything.  I said I never did anything before and I got arrested.  You gotta understand, yknow, I mean, when they pull the rug out from under you with things that you always counted on, the police are honest, truth prevails.  Yknow, the law is written for, yknow, the good people and it's only as good as the people who are behind it.  And they can get away with stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you still, are you still, you don't have any warrants still out on you or anything like that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but, but, um, because, um, not that I know it, but that's something that I want in writing, if that's possible.  If family court will even do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know if they would.  You just have to, you just have to, uh, at some point, go and ask the police if you have any outstanding warrants.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm gonna pull up, have a sheet pulled up - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or get, or get, or get, um, uh, [NAME OTHER] to do it for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, and to see just, yknow, what all's on there, if anything.  Because I did wanna clear any of that up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And as much as I can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  For clarification, during her divorce trial, she was, uh, given a local town, not a local town, I'm blocking the name out.  An advocate to work, uh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ad litem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Guardian ad litem to work with her best interests.  He didn't exactly work with her best interests in my opinion and then charged her a fee.  And when she couldn't pay it, 'cause she wasn't working, he had her put in jail and that was, that was the warrant that was sort of outstanding until finally the community got together and threatened to stage a, a um, a benefit for her to get her out of jail, um, and he dropped his request for payment and everything else.  And dropped the warrant and that's gone, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And actually, yknow, in the 1994 divorce decree, I was given custody of the children.  There wasn't even an ad litem.  But this custody thing came in 2000.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I remember that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, years later.  And in between those times, it was never any letter.  He slashed my tires.  He interfered with my employment, he, I mean, it was 1 thing after another.  And people'd come running up to me and go [PATIENT NAME], you won't believe what [NAME OTHER] is saying about you.  And I go oh, he'll get over it.  Yknow, he'll get, it'll, it'll go away.  But, uh, because apparently, every where he went, he must've grabbed the milkman and said, [PATIENT NAME]'s insane or something.  But anyway, that has been, he has spent his life, yknow, on me.  And I've tried to live my life movin' ahead.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, what's happened with all that, what's happened with your, uh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In the meantime, the sis, the wife, my dad's wife, aligned with the ex husband, I think my father just living in the same household, he was kinda browbeatin' down and then my brothers in law, my sister, my sister who's handicapped, also living in that same household, and she can only take so much stress til she waves the red flag and said I, I agree with you, yknow?  Um, but, it's like, uh, the sister just could not go any longer without seeing me because all our lives, we were only like 22 months apart.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my whole life was always, where's [NAME OTHER], look after [NAME OTHER] and there's nothing that ever happened to me in my life that I didn't judge how does that affect [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, you're beginning to get everything back together with your family.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And my brother's have come, and my brothers, uh, my brother, [NAME OTHER], who's a [INAUDIBLE] graduate, he and his 15  year old son were sitting in the room with my dad, who was sleeping, yknow, he, he was just sleeping but they were sittin' there and [NAME OTHER] walked in and my brother said to his son, well there's still only 3 men in the room.  I mean, that's how, um, outspoken they have become now on my side.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like they've seen the light and they're really mad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, they're upset with themselves - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They feel like, yknow, gee, yknow, they're embarrassed, um, but that's not gonna happen again, yknow, that's how [INAUDIBLE] is.  But my son, who is adopted, and who was also kind of thrown out in the cold, my brother [NAME OTHER] and my brother [NAME OTHER], um, took him and bought him a beautiful suit for the funeral and when he spotted shoes that, like my father wore, they bought him grandfather shoes to wear to the funeral.  Because my father was his only real male, uh, what am I trying to say?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Model.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, model, yknow, and he was dearly close to my father and my father loved him, just as he did his, yknow, biological children.  And all that is coming to the front and I hadn't decided if I was gonna go to the funeral or not until the night before, but my sister had asked me and I always stood beside her.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've always been behind her no matter what.  So that night before, about midnight, I called her and I said I'm gonna come to the funeral.  And she said oh, thank you, yknow, so, and when I was getting dressed, of course she would see this, quietly getting dressed all the way to the funeral, because my great aunt [NAME OTHER] was driving me to make sure I got there.  And I'm putting on my shoes, yknow, and um, they put the broche to my hair as I got out of the car.  When my feet hit the steps of the church to go into the ladies' parlor where the family was to gather - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had the peace of God.  And they said they could hear voices saying she's here.  She actually came.  I never heard any of that.  Yknow, I mean, I went through the funeral helping hold up my sister, um, I'm at peace with my father because, yknow, his last words to me, I was able to see him, was the things he used to always say to me, 'cause my father and I were most alike.  I believe he had ADD, yknow, but and the military's what kept him on the straight and narrow, but he looked at me and he said I believe in you.  And that's what he used to always say to me, yknow, I believe in you.  And, um, and everything was, yknow, as it should be.  I'm a relationship person.  That's yknow what, my life is about, to have the fold come back together like that is, uh, is just another miracle.  It's another miracle.  Now, [NAME OTHER], my daughter, is the last hold out but, yknow, [NAME OTHER] told somebody, my son said, you've got to remember who she's been living with.  Yknow, and what's she's been under, but she's gonna come around and she is.  And, um, we're not gonna have any of this well she's not this, she's not that, yknow?  That's, that ended with me, I hope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We'll see.  And I think, um, we all just keep saying we're good people.  Yknow?  And we're just gonna go forward.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're good people.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, it's lots of, of, um, I've never been a drinker, but everybody got together after the funeral - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And of course my brothers popped their, what are they Cuervo's, that beer, that Mexican beer, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the cousins and all and they all looked right me and said you want a [INAUDIBLE], you want an iced tea, you want, yknow, but um, and no funny looks, yknow.  Um, it's um, and it's, I've always been a little different yknow.  I, I have a funky sense of humor, but it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  What, what's working with you with the medicine, with the Adderall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, that's what I wanted to ask you about today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know if it's the situation that, see, I, I think I've always been a responsible person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've gone through my, yknow, really crazy stage where I didn't know left from right and, um, I had no confidence in myself, but now I really feel the pressure that, yknow, I've got to be present, things are happenin' now that I want to, yknow, I mean, I'm very much a part of my son's life and, I'm helping him make decisions and, yknow, he wants to go get his GED.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wonderful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, yknow, just, just all those other things, and I [INAUDIBLE] like the Effexor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How high a dose did you go up to?  You're up to 350, I think it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Up to 350?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're taking 5 a day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's 350.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's okay?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 'Cause that's one thing I wanna check with you today, 'cause I think last time I was here I was on 2o and you sent me to 3, yknow, go to three.  But, um, I just thought this is no time to fail now, yknow, where you get that, you go over the bump in the road with your stomach.  I said I can't, I've got to, I've got to hold out for this, but um, I still feel like I'm having trouble focusing and I don't know if it's because I'm pushing too much on myself, yknow, but it's almost like I'm scheming, I'm gonna make a mistake [INAUDIBLE].  Like today, when you asked me my phone number?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was like okay, now the other day I practiced that.  I practiced my phone number, yknow?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, so that I could tell it instead of going oh, gee, let me think, what's my phone number?  Um, also up here, yknow, I've got some sense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got a little startled.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Every time you startle, things block out for ya.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they'll come back to you in a minute so.  That doesn't mean anything except you startle easily.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you wouldn't believe the people at the cemetery, the older people that came up to me and 1 gentlemen just kept shaking my arms and sobbing.  And just sobbing and he looked at me and said where are you living?  And I said [INAUDIBLE] and you would've thought I said Clover.  He went Clover?  Yknow, like not [INAUDIBLE]?  Clover?  And just buried his head in my chest.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then one little lady came up and just kissed me and kissed me and I left there with, yknow, lipstick all over me, but it was like I was so proud of you.  I was so glad you were here.  You should've been here, you're supposed to be here.  And this couple came up, sobbing, 1 of them on crutches.  And his wife, I've never seen shed a tear, she's the one that walks like this, like she's from the military, the sergeant or something. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She was sobbing.  And they both stood there and they said and your daddy told her to move over in church so you could sit down.  We could see it from the balcony.  Yknow, they all, the church, that I sat behind my dad and I tapped him on the shoulder and he said come up here and with me [PATIENT NAME] and I said okay dad.  Well, they were right on the corner and he couldn't get [NAME OTHER] to move other.  So, finally he said, in his military voice, [NAME OTHER] you have to move over so [PATIENT NAME] can sit down.  And they said through the whole church, people were going [PATIENT NAME]'s sitting with [INAUDIBLE], yknow, and so they said you sat with your dad, oh yes you did.  Yknow, it was all these people that had an investment in this relationship.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  And to make you part of the community again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, and it was lovely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.  Yeah, I know.  It's wonderful.  Enjoy it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's lovely.  I am.  And I just think God is good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow.  I have 2 sisters in law, and of course, 1 is - </p>

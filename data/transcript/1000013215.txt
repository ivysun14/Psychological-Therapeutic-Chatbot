</p><p>PATIENT: The first day it's been...this has really been shifted back.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I know it's (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, like it hasn't been...today was about (inaudible). For the first time out of the three (ph), I decided yesterday I was going to write a book this summer. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How about that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So, it's got to be final (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How about that.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) You're delighted?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes and no. It's okay. I could have come to this decision a few (ph) months ago. (inaudible) 00:01:59

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And how have you been feeling?

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. But it's...what it sure does...when I'm doing a lot of work; it takes my mind off things rather (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of dealing....

</p><p>PATIENT: So this thing which I just haven't been confronting...I just haven't been facing (inaudible) maybe it's okay. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sound...you look like you're delighted and you sound like you're delighted (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well...I just feel wary of what's going to happen (inaudible) today (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wary of sort of rocking...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, just knowing inside there's things that aren't really straightened out because I decided (inaudible) book. (inaudible) 00:03:03 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm nervous and all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible) has been around for a long time, it's just...it's just a matter of sitting down and doing it. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) deadline, September 30 (ph). (inaudible) because there's enough time so that it's reasonable (inaudible). I can start now (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah but (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) one foot out and...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that's not really very (inaudible) I don't think. (inaudible) It's not (inaudible) much different. (inaudible) (overlapping voices) 00:04:46

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Unlock your anger. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really on my back but I just sort of feel guilty (inaudible) what's holding it up? I don't like that (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which thing? The clock?

</p><p>PATIENT: That piece of wood or whatever it is. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) creepy?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The way fungus looks and mushrooms look (inaudible) not very...I mean, it's pleasant (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, I like it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess or else it wouldn't be there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) say (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) do that (inaudible) do you interpret dreams? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: There's one that...having dreams where I'm back in D.C. riding around town on a horse. 00:06:43

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) D.C. riding on a horse. Can you be the horse?

</p><p>PATIENT: Can I be the horse? I'm on the horse. I'm not the horse.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but (inaudible) horse man; what would you say to him? What would you do? What do horses do?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, I can imagine being in the front instead of plowing through the streets. (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's it like?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, the feeling, I guess, is just like going through water.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And what's the horse do? Like, say, like I'm a horse and I go through the town and I'm...I (inaudible) like be the horse. (inaudible) talking, the horse. The water looks warm (inaudible) happening. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's hard to do. It just feels like riding a wave. Just...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But be it; rather than say it just feels like...I'm the horse and I'm riding... (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: [I can't do it.] (ph) (quiet from 00:08:12 to 00:08:39) I keep getting the same sensation which isn't really being the horse; it's just sort of being on top, on the front of the horse. I can...I can sort of feel the water but I can see it and hear it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) hear the water?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not really loud; just the way it sounds when a horse goes through the water. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it splashing? 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) splashing, churning. Water (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you be the water (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I can imagine being on the surface of the water; rippling like water...like water...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm water and (inaudible) rippling (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I can say it but I don't know what it means. I mean I can...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then what?

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I'm in its waves.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Big waves?

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 00:10:06

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I can picture it all. I can sense it all. I can sense what I (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can sense (inaudible) in the water.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are there fish swimming around in there? (inaudible) sand on the bottom? Is there mud? Is there rocks? Would you think about coke bottles (inaudible) or doesn't that happen (inaudible) How does it feel to hit the shore? If there's a shore.

</p><p>PATIENT: Splashy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Why am I here?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) something...like you're not there. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm sort of...since you've been directing this very slowly for the last two minutes (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you irritated with me?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not particularly. I mean the whole idea sounds like fun (inaudible) But I'm just not ready to deal with it. I'm holding myself back from (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:12:32

</p><p>PATIENT: It just seems like something I'd really have to concentrate on. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That it would take so much extra effort to just be the different parts in your dream?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I wasn't even thinking that (inaudible) Yeah, it takes a lot of effort. (inaudible) 00:13:19

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can imagine getting into teach individual thing maybe...maybe. I'm not even sure then. I'm not sure how competent I would be doing anything but what I really feel (inaudible) I've never really felt that. I've never really felt I was (inaudible) I would love the work (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. And I can sort of feel a lot of what it's like...splashing up on the rocks. (inaudible) I certainly can't feel what (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe there isn't any.

</p><p>PATIENT: Any what? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I was just making it up to try and be (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, well, there's seaweed in the ocean. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're an ocean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that's the...that's the word that I can (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's what it was rather than that or a puddle or a...

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It was definitely an ocean. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, no. It wasn't an ocean in D.C.. It was just sort of...instead of the highway, it was a horse riding down the road; down South street or down wherever it was. It's happened before; just sort of a canal.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Road (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or water; there wasn't much to the water. It was just a vehicle...not a vehicle; the horse was a vehicle. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did it have color?

</p><p>PATIENT: Standard light blue (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Clear or (inaudible)? 00:15:28

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) the...I wasn't concentrating on the water. Well, it just seemed very strange that I would...I don't dream about D.C. very often. That's where I grew up. That was strange the last couple times....well, a couple times (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What?

</p><p>PATIENT: A couple times that stand out clearly, I was driving on a horse. The last one was Saturday night. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What did you do? Just driving around or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: I should have written it down. I'm not really sure. I was with somebody who I know; somebody else. I'm not sure who it was; we just...we were driving, going to my home and then we sort of went up on deck and (inaudible) walk on deck and we got off and it was my mother's and we just sort of got off the horse. Which we could do (inaudible) still remember and the deck (inaudible) land (inaudible). I don't know. 00:16:51

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you know? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not enough (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: It just seems hostile in the world.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hostile? (inaudible) I was angry with you in that dream?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it just comes across to me as a hostile person. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean it that way. I mean seriously.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I just (overlapping voices) no way at all to answer.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're more paying attention to (inaudible) You're paying more attention to what you don't know than what you do know. You always know something of what's happening (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I believe that. I mean, your senses are always picking things up but it's still (inaudible) I don't know (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does any...any of the (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) sort of artificial. So I started feelings any beginnings (inaudible) artificial (inaudible) So what? So, I'll feel silly doing it or uncomfortable doing it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel uncomfortable when you're quiet?

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometimes, sometimes I (inaudible) I feel uncomfortable when I'm quiet when I think something else should (inaudible) 00:18:46

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) somebody (inaudible) (quiet to 00:20:25)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, you stare at somebody for so long (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Not a bad stare; just a stare; kind of judging stare (ph). I mean, you're looking at my eyes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's staring?

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that's staring. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, because that didn't feel like staring to me so that's why I'm asking you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. What kind of...what does staring mean to you? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: You don't know what staring means to you?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not exactly but I think it's, you know, just sort of...I don't...being pushy and waiting to see what happens (inaudible) To me, that's (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible) It doesn't matter. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Don't like when you're playing, sometimes a game (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know about (inaudible) I guess so. (inaudible) 00:22:10

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is this more uncomfortable than talking about whatever it was you were thinking you could talk about but it wasn't somehow (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: It wasn't particularly uncomfortable. I don't know if it was particularly productive. (inaudible) But I can't seem to get myself (inaudible) comes out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That thing so that you would want to blurt out.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe. I suppose. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean did you have some things in mind that...

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Had some good things considering it doesn't...hasn't really gotten that deep. Oh, and then on one hand, pretty much willing to just let them (inaudible) to see if it does get any deeper; just because if it does, it does. But on the other hand, I mean, they...maybe I'm just going to have to do it. I don't know...I'm afraid to do it, I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You want it and yet, not happening.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you say if it were? 00:24:40

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd just sort of talk about more of my sexual hang-ups; woman problems; competition problems. (Overlapping voices) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Want to talk about any of those?

</p><p>PATIENT: Pardon me?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to talk about any of those?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not sure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's part of it...is not being too sure whether you want to talk about it here or not. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes and no. I mean I sort of want to talk about them but I sort of want to get into it where it's sort of a more personal type feeling than an impersonal type feeling. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And that's puzzling. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I just wanted...I just want to feel that you know me better. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Than I see you feeling in that this, is just part of it? That somehow I see more of you than just that or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, we're better friends. I don't know either. And that just maybe a (overlapping voices) saying that (overlapping voices)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you like to feel...you'd like to feel that we were better friends and...

</p><p>PATIENT: Strange. I spent most of my life not telling anybody anything. Especially not...well, I'm sure I felt things but not really realizing what I was feeling. And even when I have, it's only been relatively few people...mainly girls and mainly in situations where there's been some kind of a response (inaudible) person going to be here which I don't (inaudible) but yet it's weird so I don't really know how to go about doing it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow you'd have to get some kind of...find it sexual or something...kind of response?

</p><p>PATIENT: for some reason, though it doesn't make any sense, I don't think. I mean I don't think it's necessary because we're really going into talking about this. But that's sort of the way I've gone (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of...you've made it happen that way in the past. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe just (inaudible) I've got to pour this out and it's going to hurt a lot so I...well, if I can get some pats on the head and some hugging and tender stuff (inaudible) 00:27:24

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you'd like to feel my care...my feeling tender toward you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I suppose. Again, maybe that's just an armor (inaudible) maybe I'm just building that up. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel good (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then why worry about being (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I should be able to talk about in other circumstances too...I think I demand it. And I think I only allow myself to be free with myself if I can get something like that in return; which I think is kind of self defeating. I think I'd be better off if I was freer without demanding (inaudible) people. Or without demanding (inaudible) which I do a lot of the time too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Must be pretty good then, feeling desperate...so desperate you demand something then you feel like they only give it to you because you grabbed it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) that isn't very satisfying. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, but it happens. Just piled on (inaudible) inferiority feelings of a lousy guy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then you really feel awful because other people (inaudible) You (inaudible) do you feel less than (inaudible) How are you feeling now?

</p><p>PATIENT: Just listening...nice.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Nice...listening. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) paying attention to what you're saying (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Pretty well (inaudible) Not expense (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's all I could really expect. I mean when I...if I leave and analyze (inaudible) probably going to feel better about it then. Anyway, that's how it recurs. I just get too grabby. 00:29:54

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you grab?

</p><p>PATIENT: People. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Where are you grabbing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Totally, all over. I don't mean physically. Just...I just feel real bad when things are taken away from me; like people are taken away from me even though they're not being taken away form me. That's how I view it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Am I being taken away from you?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. why'd you ask?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, because I wondered what people and I was wondering was that happening here and so (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I mean you're here. You're...that can never happen here. Well, it could (inaudible) No, it couldn't really. I mean, all you could ever do is not pay attention which I don't think is very likely to happen. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does that...would drive you up a wall? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, probably. But I tend to feel it's very irrational because sometimes it doesn't bother me at all and I think I'm...what I end up doing is putting demands on other people which are hurting them and hurting me too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What kind of demands? 00:31:25

</p><p>PATIENT: Demands on their attention and demands on their time and what they do with their lives. Well, if you spend this much time with me you must like me and if you like me therefore you got to want to spend more time (inaudible) can't spend any time (inaudible) love me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you feel awful? (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't know why it happens and I don't...I mean, I actually feel that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's it feel like?

</p><p>PATIENT: Kind of wrenching. Yeah. It's lousy. Feels like the same things you feel before you want to jump out of the window. It feels very despair. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) definitely nothing you can do about it; you're still helpless?

</p><p>PATIENT: Pretty much. Pretty much all I can say is well, don't jump out of the window and just (inaudible) something time will cure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) hurt.

</p><p>PATIENT: But I don't' really know what to do with (inaudible) I don't know how to get myself out of it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) still miserable and (inaudible) not knowing what to do to change it; to alter it; to get away from it and crashing out a window...don't want to do that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometimes I do. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of wanting to break out of that feeling. 00:33:34

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it feels better. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But not wanting to smash yourself to bits...are you?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know; not particularly. I'd rather not feel that way. I spend so much time doing it and not really enough time feeling anything but...even when I'm not, I just spend a lot of time feeling very, very neutral (ph). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling now? Neutral or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: A little of everything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A little of jumping out...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't feel like jumping out the window. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You tell me.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I just try...just imagining what that felt like; I've felt a little bit of that but then I've gotten thrown back into the (inaudible) so now I just feel...yeah, pretty neutral. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does my attention (inaudible)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: How is your attention (inaudible)? Therapeutic; not really deeply friendly. It feels...it still feels impersonal. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I'm not looking at you as a person?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, just like we don't know each other; just like we're not friends. 00:35:10

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like looking at a bug or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, just like talking with somebody who you talk to who's an associate who isn't a friend.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You talk to them and there's kind of limits on it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) would express yourself; that would be different with a friend. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It would feel different. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How would it feel?

</p><p>PATIENT: I would just feel easier about being me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) No (inaudible) Well, maybe, I mean...you haven't...yeah, probably. I'd relax more. (inaudible) more time and more topics to talk to you about (inaudible) You want to talk to me about yourself (inaudible) 00:36:37 (silence to 00:37:45) I kind of feel that I don't express my feelings very well or myself (inaudible) and I actually feel that I'm aware of it which tends to make me not try a little bit more. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you (inaudible) more you feel that you should (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I just don't verbalize it very well and I don't express it very well and other people can do it better and so I try to do it; I'm not doing it well and I realize it so I try not to do it. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't' want to do it (inaudible) ?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I always worry too much about being compared about how I am in relation to other people. If everybody else did it loudly (ph), I wouldn't mind doing it badly too but when other people can do it well, I feel worse about doing it badly. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like there you are being creepy or something...clumsy (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you sense how I do (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, not specifically...I mean, yes. You do it well but...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm one of those people that does it well?

</p><p>PATIENT: But...yeah. You're just one of those people that does it well. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not clumsy?

</p><p>PATIENT: I suppose you are in (inaudible) You didn't answer my questions about staring much better than I would have (inaudible) but somehow or other that...on a whole you're not clumsy about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: What does what do?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That (inaudible) clumsy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, that's good. I don't want you to be or else (inaudible) Well, it's good.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That feels good?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought it would also maybe make it harder too. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe it does. Still feels good just to hear you express...I always like hearing somebody else expressing (inaudible) That isn't what feels bad; what feels bad is the fact that I don't do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Somehow that you can't or don't. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean, maybe when I...when I try to do it and can't do it, that yeah, I feel jealous. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Too many maybes. 00:40:54

</p><p>PATIENT: I just...I just feel inferior (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometimes. Sometimes I don't. if it's obvious that I'm doing it better...that I'm doing it fairly well and the reactions I'm getting from what I'm doing are that then I feel confident (inaudible). But if not, then it just...it just falls apart. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you expressing your self now well? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) just talking. (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) easy; nothing to it; just talking. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I just wasn't talking very deeply. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you push aside what you did do. Or what you can do. (inaudible) anybody, it's just talking. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I just don't think that it would...it will have done (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Alright, it's not...

</p><p>PATIENT: Getting deeper is...I guess it's just relative. If I can do it easily, it's no big deal. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so...so the kinds of things that would be a big deal would be talking about some kind of sexual problems (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, no. it's just talking that...getting deeper into me and trying to understand what I feel because I've gotten into discussions innumerable times, I just never seem to be able to get into it and it's always seemed...it always turns out that...that the other person seems to know what's going on and I don't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that? 00:42:54

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't believe it, for one, but I can't do anything about it. I can't verbalize it. I can't argue with it...with words. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you still have your own feeling...

</p><p>PATIENT: But maybe deep down inside it's true. I'm afraid of that too. (inaudible) can't seem to argue with (inaudible) It makes me feel helpless (inaudible) Actually...well, I'll get into a pretty long thing and the other person will say oh, this, is totally pointless...why are you wasting my time?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Where do you go from there?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feel really cut off?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Cut down.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe it's true but still it's just... Or maybe my reaction should just be okay, if I'm wasting your time, I'll go find somebody else to talk with. 00:44:24

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'd feel hurt. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Sure. And it's just...I don't know what to do. It's just feels totally helpless. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like I'm (inaudible) I don't know what else (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: On the other hand, I can see that I can spend an hour and not say anything. I don't know exactly where to go. I'm not very insightful about myself. It's also a visioneer (ph) having...well, when I let people seem to know more about me than I do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So what (inaudible) Creepy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And that makes me feel (inaudible) It just makes me feel a little bit worthless in that regard. And they (inaudible) than I do so what can I do (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can I ever get there? (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: If I say I'm thinking and they say no, no, this, is the way it is, I believe me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Who do you believe? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you feel pulled between? Partly sensing like you've got it but...I don't know. Maybe like can't argue with or you don't know...

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just very frustrating; deeply frustrating. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feeling (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not about this; just when I think about feeling that way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like, gee it's a ***damn frustrating feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I'm actually feeling it; part of it. (inaudible) isn't really happened to me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's it feel like?

</p><p>PATIENT: Real anxious. You can feel it in your throat. Very energy sapping. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of draining?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's just...the hole is almost impossible to crawl out of. 00:47:23

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's happened?

</p><p>PATIENT: Just creating dialogue.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: In your head?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) I should have come back. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What you should have said then?

</p><p>PATIENT: Totally (inaudible) Well, I guess not really good because all I'm thinking of it is in terms of the competition.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't really know what you mean when you say competition. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, you're beating me down so I have to beat you rather than trying to get anywhere...just trying to beat the other person. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Struggling with them rather than free you...trying to get (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Struggling with them rather than going to some...trying to accomplish something with them and it turns into (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it that way here?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Well, maybe sometimes (inaudible) Sometimes I'm sure I feel that way but not too often.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you say...would you feel comfortable (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) if you ask me or if I feel like it. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I ask a lot what you're feeling so maybe...(inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't like any (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What does it feel like?

</p><p>PATIENT: It just feels very abrupt and cut off and artificial. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow you're being cut off and (overlapping voices) 

</p><p>PATIENT: yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because its'...the clock says 3 rather than...

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I guess I should be able to keep on but maybe that's being demanding of you (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) then you feel like maybe you're asking too much. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah because I don't really like to get...I don'; know how to get out of things gracefully. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How is it graceful to get up and go? Or to turn off your feelings?

</p><p>PATIENT: I wasn't even talking about this. That too; but just other times if I get into a serious discussion like this, it's...it never seems to end right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) there a way you can be satisfied with (inaudible) How would you like this to end so that you'd be satisfied?

</p><p>PATIENT: This thing? I sort of feel like getting up and leaving whenever I felt like getting up and leaving rather than...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can't you get up and leave sooner than (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, sure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I can. What will that prove? 00:51:15

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to be fixed by... (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't. I could feel after five minutes or something...but that's sort of a one way deal. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I can't get up and leave after five minutes?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't get up and leave after two hours. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) have to get my money's worth. Not really money but just my time is worth. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) as much as you can or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: Might as well stick around for the hour (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you got to?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't mind (inaudible) I don't ever feel that it's going to be (inaudible) the extra few minutes is...I mean it has to help. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To the feeling?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it isn't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) Just a feeling.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 00:52:41

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You got about five minutes...oh, I guess not but that clock. I guess you don't. I was looking (inaudible) had about five minutes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Probably part of the same thing where I sort of tend to let everything control me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you doing it all the time here? Or some of the time?

</p><p>PATIENT: Some of the time. Actually, I've been controlling more than I thought I was where I haven't really gone deep enough (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Time for us to stop. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Today's the 16th. You bee here the 23rd and also...

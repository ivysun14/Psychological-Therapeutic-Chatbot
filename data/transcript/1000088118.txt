<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: Client 0222-115, interview number 2, December 5, 1971. 

</p><p>December, last year was very bad. I don't know but about the middle of December on but starting about now for about a month it was awful. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I was here about then. It was fun. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I can tell I'm not used to it because I came out without my scraper so when I go back to my car the windows will be all frosted because I had my heater on. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I've got a friend from Boise and he can hardly get outside in this cold. In the meantime, I don't know how long it will last probably another three days but we will probably have to reschedule a time because I got fired from my old job and I've started a new one. And I don't know what the time is on it. I don't know the first thing about the new job. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Ok, well we can just set it up as we go along. I don't, I have some limits but not that many. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I imagine, they haven't mentioned it being second shift so I imagine it's first. And it's way the hell down in Linden Blvd, 27 East. That's about as much as I know about it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are you glad to be rid of that old one?

</p><p>PATIENT: Very. Yeah, I really celebrated. I'm still recuperating from celebrating. Yeah, it was a pretty good deal. Kind of a lucky break. About an hour before I got the word that I was to be dismissed as of the 31st, my government sponsor called me and asked me to stop in and said he had a new job for me that paid another 150 a month. So I went to work that day knowing I had a job and then found out I was getting fired. It was just the way I liked to have played it. 

</p><p>I hope you didn't wear moccasins. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: This morning? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: No, I keep those over here. 0:03:00.9

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess that's just my ears. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: There's something wrong.

</p><p>PATIENT: No they're ringing like crazy. At first I thought one of those, no I guess that isn't a clock. I thought that clock was making a real high pitched twang. I've been sitting in front of speakers that... I went over to the festival (inaudible) that was going on. I've just about gone deaf in the last three days. 

</p><p>I take it we're in the middle of another ramble session. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Unless you have something that you want to change about it. 0:04:05.4

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh no. I just every now and then end up at a dead end. I wonder if it's a no-no to not keep talking sometimes. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's not a no-no to not keep talking. I'm a little sleepy and I can't...

</p><p>PATIENT: That's about a triple negative there. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: What you meant was, was it ok to be quiet. The answer is sure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh. I mentioned that I had a friend that came up from Boise. And with a hair's worth of luck, if he can get a job here he'll move up here and stay here. But we'll have no idea as to what our luck will be on that until tonight. We're going out to do some government brown nosing which is what my job consists of for the main part. And I'll take him with me so that he can meet whoever is sponsoring me in this government job. With some luck maybe he'll offer him a job. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: This job that you just got is a government job.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Everything that I do around here seems to be government patronage. This one, different from the last one, will be a full fledged civil service. The last one was merely, I was contracted by the state. Which is handy because that way they can't fire me. All they can do is fail to renew my contract. So my work record is still unblemished. I have lost maybe three days worth of work in the process of getting changed over. And that somehow doesn't break my heart. I kind of dug the vacation. What I remember of it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you will be glad to have this friend here. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I'd really be happy about that. He's about the closest friend that I have left that's in the States. He and I and another guy that's in Holland now, a guy I was supposed to go in the service with are just about, well, we three are each others' closest friends since we were about 13, 14 years old. I guess the reason we kind of stayed that way is, although we weren't together all those years we saw each other occasionally. But we all developed almost exactly along the same lines with what we were doing and what we were up to. 0:07:01.1

</p><p>THERAPIST: So it feels like you still know him even though you haven't had (overlapping)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in the last year he and I have been real close. He was pretty much living with me when I was back in Boise, just bumming around. And that's what he's doing now as a matter of fact. He was working at that time but he always dug it so well that he jokingly would refer to one of these days he's going to quit his job and become a full time hippie. So he finally did that. He's just having a gas now. He's got enough money saved up to where he doesn't have to worry about it. And he's just going around be grubby and stoned all the time. He really loves it. A little more realistic than I was I think. He realizes it can't last very long. 

</p><p>Is that holly?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Right next to you, yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It has two different kinds of leaves. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think that is supposed to be the female. The male tree died. So all the berries fell off of this one and it won't have any more unless I get another male tree. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) That's the horniest little tree I've ever heard of. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well apparently whenever you see a holly tree with berries, there is a male tree somewhere around. Which I never realized. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmm. Wow. 0:09:01.4 

</p><p>Well, I can think of a lot of things to talk about but my mind is sailing along about eight miles in front of my mouth. I don't know if I could ever keep up with it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You mean like you're going somewhere inside but it is really hard to let somebody in on it because it goes so quickly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, well it is not like I'm not willing to talk about it, it is like I'm just thinking so many things all at one time that I'm not sure I could make it make sense. Vocabulary structure. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah I didn't sense that you weren't willing to let somebody in. It was more like you just felt it was hard to get it out or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 0:10:01.3

</p><p>THERAPIST: Does anything stick out for you in what's sailing along? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, that is what I was looking for. Some point that I could just get hold of that is a single enough idea that I can follow it back down. But, no. There really is not any time structure. I was just thinking about the things that have been happening in the last three years right up to the present. And that's a lot of talking to try and cover all that. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It is like the whole spectrum in two minutes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, I got some awfully good news. The girl that I have been going with lives back in Boise has been under a type of house arrest. She has parents like I used to have a boss. And at first they were willing to let me date her. And she is several years younger than I. She is 15 now. When we first started dating they thought it was cool because they didn't know I was 19. They thought I was 18 I guess. Although they never heard it. They just took it for granted. And that I drove a new car and an expensive one. And I dressed well and I had shorter hair at that time than most of the people that she ran around with. So they really dug it. 0:11:32.1

</p><p>I had a car accident. It was a fatality accident so it was in the paper and they found out I was 19 years old and I could no longer see her. Which means that I couldn't see her and let them know. Well, that went on a long time. Last summer, in a very complete act of stupidity I sent her a cap of speed and her folks decided at that time to start opening her mail. They had, well let me step back. Earlier that summer they had decided that they would go ahead and let us see each other when they found out we still were and it was obvious that they weren't going to stop us. 

</p><p>So at that time they decided to open her mail, found that plus going down and reading through a lot of her other letters. They found out I was a freak. Found out she was a freak. Decided that I was the one that turned her on and shit really hit the fan. So she has been under house arrest and of course I'm still kaput. But she could go to school. She had to be home ten minutes after school was out. She could leave for school 20 minutes before it started. Other than that she had to stay at home. Well, when she stayed home she had to stay down in her room in the basement. Because if she was upstairs, her old man is a terrible alcoholic and he will invariably get awfully upset over something and beat on her. I've seen her just as black and blue beat up that it is pitiful. 0:13:04.7

</p><p>So that means since last October or so she hasn't been out of her room except to go to school. And just the other day they finally gave her the word that she is free to run around again. So kind of due to my stupidity I feel like I have had an albatross taken off my neck lately. Generally in the last two weeks things have started looking a lot better than they have before. I'll know by the end of this week just how well off she will be. I don't know whether they will let her see her old friends. They haven't let her see any of them just the same as I. But I have a feeling that if she does it right she will be able to just work her way back around to it. 0:14:00.9

</p><p>I'll be going back to Boise by February 7 at the latest. Or whatever February 7th is. That's a Sunday. So I may go back the last weekend in January. No the first weekend. I don't know. At any rate I'll be back there by then. If we get Josh a job we'll probably go back before that. To get his stuff and bring it back up. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: So it sounds like that as you bring me up to date that a lot of things or a number of things anyway have been happening that kind of bode well and look good. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just can't imagine all the things that have happened since the last time I was here. That's kind of what was tripping me up. Because I was thinking back and like I said it was three years worth, but my gosh, then I got to thinking just in the last three weeks there has been numeral things. 0:15:05.7

</p><p>I went to Boise shortly after the first time I was here. Just freaked out all together on acid. I was really uptight and just scared shitless for about 6 1/2 hours before I finally got it under control. After that I felt really great. But I came real close to going ahead and taking some thorazine and just zonking myself out until the acid wore off. Which is bad news because that has happened to me once. I got carried off to the hospital and pumped full. And I came to. And when you come to it is like you are still so stoned that you don't know what is happening. 

</p><p>And it is doubly confusing when you wake up, you become conscious again. I was having some awfully strange things go through my head the first time anyway. So that when I woke up in a hospital room that I didn't know how I got there and I didn't know where I was anyway and it is an awfully strange looking place with bottles and tubes. I recognized it as such, as a hospital luckily because I use to work in them. But I didn't know what I was doing there. I decided that I had either died and been taken there or I had been born. I didn't know which. 

</p><p>That type of thing kind of came close to happening again. Only this time I didn't take the thorazine and it was kind of a game of, even though maybe I should freak out, can I keep from it. And it took about six hours but I really dug that. Because it helped clear up a lot of things in my head that never got cleared up because of the way that things ended the last time that something like that happened. 0:16:55.8

</p><p>THERAPIST: You mean like sticking with it somehow made it better? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. It is kind of a game. Well, game. I don't mean that. A game per say is something you like to play with. But it was a question of whether...What had happened is I had done some acid and then took a hit of nitrous oxide. Which I should have known better. But I passed out shortly. Just momentarily. And I remember that it was like falling down into a blackness and there was a band down there that wasn't visible in itself. It was like a tension. And I fell down and I hit it and it tore open and there was a white spot that just expanded as I came back up and came back to consciousness. And the thing was to me that I have a terrible, terrible death fantasy. I've been really wrapped up and curious and involved in it for quite a while now. And I've always wondered what, well, I have a kind of religion of my own. I hate to use that word on it but it is just kind of something that I believe in. 0:18:07.8

</p><p>And the only remaining question to me in it of what would make it fit together was a purpose for a person to die and continue on in a different realm or even to continue on here. I don't know how. I just don't believe in just death. But it was like when I passed out and came back to I saw what the purpose was of life and recycled life. And it amounted to nothing but a mistake of something of another dimension. We are an accident. We are the development of their bad habit. And it just terribly upset me. It was kind of like there is no way we can win. We are doomed to be a complete failure all the way down the line. 

</p><p>And it had me terribly upset for a while because it left me in the position of could I fight and try to make it better even I already knew it was impossible? Or should I just give up? But if I just give up, life is recycled so I just end up with the same problems somewhere else. Which is what finally got me out of it. But it is awfully hard to try to reason out when you're stoned. That was the essence of that. 0:19:52.4

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm wondering about is like it sounds like things around you, like externals in your life look like they are about to go well if they haven't started already, but what I don't know quite is how you are seeing that. Or how these things are making you feel. I don't get a sense of where you are in all of this. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Suspicious. I see things look good so many times and they have never been good. I'm uptight about everything like that. I'm happy that for a change it at least looks good. But I will not accept it as such until it is already done, I've got everything I need out of it and I can go away. And then I will look back on it as good. I can't even remember who it was, Walden or somebody like that said "You cannot be, you cannot be leading a happy life. You can have led a happy life. When you die you can turn back and say I had a happy life." And it is not safe to pack away a category until it is all over with. 0:21:01.8

</p><p>THERAPIST: In some way, things looking up makes part of you very vigilant, it sounds like. Or very wary.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: I see you kind of looking out of the corners of your eyes to see what is going to come up and undermine what is happening. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Right. And it is also due to my own habits. Sometimes I have the tendency if things were to look good to sit back and go boy that's real grunt. (ph) 0:21:32.0 And just sit there. And I also have to be careful to keep my own ass in gear. I'm just the laziest person around that I know of. I'd be happy just to sit for the rest of my life. Which is kind of what I'm working toward. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: To be able to sit. 0:21:59.0

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd just like to sit back for the last 30, 40, 50 years of my life. Which is the reason I almost insist on going into a profession. My father just can't understand why it is that I want to go into a med school, when he knows that I'm a really for shit student. But I think that if I could ever get started and by keep being careful of myself that way. If I could get my a through I would be in a position where I could at least make some.... I really enjoy medicine. I'm sure of that now. It's just that the idea of umpteen years of school is the kind of thing that I've never handled before. So I'd have to be, med school is a rough way to learn how to study. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You bet. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Once I could get through, I know I'd enjoy medicine. The practicing of it. Which means that would be the first, well the first time in a long time, the first time I'd ever had a job that I made money at that I enjoyed. And those two factors both mean an almost equal amount to me. In fact money probably means more if I could get it quick enough that I wouldn't have to stay very long at a job. I'd do it that way if I could get it easier.

</p><p>But mostly I'm just so sick of society that I'd like to just go back on a mountaintop and do my thing there. I like people but they seem to show an overwhelming trend to be stupid and painful to other people. Although even though they don't intend to most of the time. They're just dangerous because of their blindness. I'm kind of an anti humanitarian. I like people as a whole only in theory, not in practice. In actual interaction with them, I like persons but people are unreasonable. They're incommunicable. 0:24:13.8

</p><p>That's a repeal abortion law button, isn't it? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Is there a legislation around to get those started or are they just doing that from scratch?

</p><p>THERAPIST: I don't know about this state, but there have been books and other things that I've heard about that have been (inaudible at 0:24:52.6) and I don't really know if (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I was kind of surprised to find that New York had such archaic laws. I figured that some place with a city the size of New York and the population they do here, would do better. 0:25:15.6

</p><p>THERAPIST: Don't mean a thing.

</p><p>PATIENT:(chuckles) You could do that anywhere huh?

</p><p>THERAPIST: I sure don't consider New York and New York very forward looking places. 

</p><p>PATIENT:(chuckles)0:26:02.1

</p><p>Was I late getting here? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: This morning? No. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh. I just remembered that we intersected each other on the second floor. I almost was. I went to bed last night and remembered that someone had blown a fuse earlier that day and that my clock had been a half hour off.:26:41.2 So I went up and checked. I thought I was getting to bed nice and early. It was 12:00. And I went out and looked and it was 2:30 already and I still had another half hour to go. I was just all ready to turn out the light and thought, no I better check it. 

</p><p>That is something that I've noticed lately too. My mind seems to be working for a change. Normally if there is any possibility of me forgetting something and not doing it, I'll manage it. And lately I seem to be remembering little things. It is very minor things. Like I'll go down to my room and I wanted to get some matches and a pen and some paper. And while I was down there I remembered to get another kind of pen so that I could sign my, put my name on my record albums. And it struck me then that was kind of the straw that finally brought it to the front of my mind that I have been doing a lot of that lately. Whereas normally I would have gone back upstairs and forgotten the matches to boot and then have to come down two more times. I don't know what is causing it but it is a complete reversal of what the trend was maybe a month and a half, two months ago. 0:27:59.1

</p><p>THERAPIST: So you feel in some way like you're, I can tell, I've had a feeling like that as you tell it that you're beginning to work for yourself. Or your mind at least is beginning to work in ways that may have more constructive consequences or something. You said nothing quite that detailed or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. I'm not sure what it means myself but that's kind of what I was hoping that it would (inaudible) me. That's the thing that I'm looking for. That maybe it's settled into a more useful groove instead of just brooding on completely unattached subjects. Not irrelevant but certainly not actively physically pertinent to what I am doing. 0:29:00.3

</p><p>But mostly I can't figure out what caused it. That's what really baffles me because I've been stoned almost constant since about December 27. In fact, I stay after grass now. (ph) But that wouldn't normally be normal I don't think. People don't normally have, their memory doesn't improve when they're all stoned out but that's kind of what was happening. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah it sounds like that kind of alertness or whatever it is that makes you be able to pick up on the small things really is very unusual under these circumstances. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I used to do that. I used to say that I perform better when I was ripped. I used to be able to drive quite well on acid. In fact, it got to be kind of a joke. We'd drive down the street and somebody would ask what the speed limit was. Instead of looking for the sign, we'd look at the speedometer because I would always be right on the speed limit whether I knew it or not. I didn't even know how fast I was going but I knew I'd be going right on the speed limit. Well, it's kind of to that effect. I'll do it without even having to think of it. Like that pen, I just grabbed it and as I came out the door I thought, wow. I wasn't even thinking that I had to come down and get that. 0:30:34.9

</p><p>I was speaking with Josh the other day. The guy that is up from Boise. And he was telling me that he's got a coat that has six or eight pockets. It looks like something he ripped off from Captain Kangaroo. It's really ridiculous. He says he can never remember where he puts stuff. But when he gets all ripped out he just reaches in and there it is. And I was thinking maybe that in spite of the popular belief getting stoned does do that. But it can't. I've seen too many people who can't even remember their name when they're ripped. 0:32:00.5

</p><p>I remember what it was. I was going to mention something when it happened the other day. I was going to remember to mention it but I didn't until just now. This girl in Boise, Jessica, and I are as it looks right now as good as married. Even though it will probably be a year and a half, not quite, before we will be able to be together. The other day, just out of the blue two old girlfriends of mine both sent me letters and are both asking me to come back.

</p><p>One of them is asking me to go to Hayden to see her. The other one wants to see me the next time I go to Boise. And it's kind of a completely confusing situation because I've been real good friends with both of them for a couple of years now and I'm sure they both know that I'm going with Jess. But I'm not quite sure what it is that they want. 

</p><p>Well, one of them simply wants to get something going. But the other one, a girl named Sharon in Boise. I went with her. Well, she's the only girl I dated all through high school. She was the only girl I dated for quite a few years to any extent. On and off, we kind of dated each other steadily from, Jesus, (inaudible at 0: 33:55.2) Since I was about 14 I guess until just about three months ago last year. At that time she broke up with me. 

</p><p>And that gave me fits. I was really screwed up bad for quite a while. I made a suicide attempt and I was all screwed up and really enjoyed sitting home mourning and all this kind of stuff. But a few months later I met Jessica and things progressed from there. Now all of a sudden this girl sends me a letter. A Christmas present and all this kind of stuff. I'm not quite sure what to do with it. But I think I will be sure to look her up next time I get to Boise to find out what's going on. 0:34:52.7

</p><p>That's something that's curious. Even if I thought it spelled bad news, even if I was sure that what she was trying to do was to start something that would be either impossible to start. I wouldn't be willing to. Or else it would just be a hassle. I'll probably go see her because she has asked me to. If anybody ever wants to talk to me it seems like I'll always go to it. But I do that even when I see to myself that it would probably be easier if I didn't. If I just ignored it altogether. 0:35:48.1

</p><p>THERAPIST: Are you saying you wonder why that is, why you do that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, kind of. 0:36:00.6

</p><p>Well, part of it being, I imagine. I still like her though. She and I are real good friends. And I've helped her out of trouble a couple of times. I think that it is appropriate that I am always afraid that somebody should ask to talk to me, if they really need help then I'm willing to help them any way I can. And I always figured that one of these days if I were to be turning people down just saying that I'm too busy to have anything to do with you, then it's liable to mess them up bad. (ph) And I'd feel like it was my responsibility. Not that I caused it but that I didn't help it.

</p><p>Which is kind of the way I was feeling about Jessica when she was all locked up like that. Not that I was the cause and certainly no help to her. Which is kind of what our relationship has been anyway. We knew each other for about two months, I'm in New York and it's been nothing but hassle ever since then. We only get to see each other every couple of months for a couple of hours. And it just hurts how to keep a relationship going on the basis of that. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like despite that you're pretty clear about it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Even though it's very difficult and she's been in a lot of confining and whatever kinds of circumstances. There is something very clear about it. 0:37:53.9

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. And that's what is so great about Jessica is that it is not hard to get something put down and understood between us. She's almost as open as I am. Almost. We've gone over that many times between us. At first there was a possibility that she might just leave home and come up here. But when I got arrested, it kind of blew the cookies on that because it was obvious that I would either end up in jail or on probation. 

</p><p>At least, well known. Better known by the police so there was no way we could risk that. It was at that point that she told her folks that we were still going together. Which was when they decided that maybe since there was no way they could keep us apart they may as well bring it out in the open so they could keep an eye on her. I have a suspicion that that is what they meant when they went ahead and let us be back together. Because it was several months later when they started getting into her mail. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that they didn't have that in mind several months before when they went ahead and slacked up. 0:39:19.3

</p><p>But since then, I mean since the cookies have gotten blown a second or third or fourth time, I don't know how many times this has happened. But it has become obvious that we're just going to have to wait it out until she is 18. Or wait it out until she is 17 and have a court order that puts her into her own custody. I'm not quite sure how to do it. But I know at least some people have. Over their parents objection they've been put in their own custody. I wish there was some way I could prove child beating. But there's no way a child could testify against their parent since they're not a majority age and since they are an involved party, they can't' do that. Their testimony is good if someone else that has brought the charges used them as a witness. 0:40:29.4

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: That is a little vintage BMW, isn't it? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes. I've always wanted one. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I once got to drive one. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Did you? I've heard they drive like a truck. 

</p><p>PATIENT: They're pretty stiff. Drive it. Maybe that's an exaggeration. I got to tool around in the parking lot. (chuckles) He wouldn't even let me out on the street. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Before we quit and get into a hassle about the next appointment, I realized the other day I forgot to ask what you thought about how many times a week you were to come, as soon as you get yourself stabilized on the job. You don't really care or what your preference would be. 0:42:19.8

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, as rapidly as things are happening, I think twice a week would be good. We could stretch them out. Like you said, I just got to thinking back over all of the things that have happened since the last time I was here. Of course that is considerably more than one week, but I would hate to try and keep track of that every time. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Do you have some sense that you need to tell me what has happened for me or more like for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: For me. I just, it is the first time I have stopped to think back over it. It just kind of has been happening constantly. Of course, when Josh came up here he came up for a big party so it has been going ever since. At least between he and I. And I have been moving so fast I haven't stopped to turn around and look where I've been yet. Still not sure. I guess the strangest sense of it is that I know all that has happened really has very little bearing on what is going to be happening. It is like my job ended and things stopped for a while. Whatever I did in here, be stoned or do whatever is really just what I did during that time. It isn't going to have a whole lot of bearing on when I start trucking again and get another job and go back to the routine. 0:44:04.6

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Yeah, that is so I guess. What strikes me is the things that you have been mentioning in this hour are more like the things that sound like they would have something to do with how things are going to go. Like your job and this guy coming up or what is happening with Jessica and I haven't really heard that edge of it before. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right, It is like I'm looking back trying to find something in it that is going to have a meaning or bearing. And they aren't the most obvious things that happened. Like I can remember tripping Christmas. Or I could remember this or that. But those were a gas and those sure were the thing at the time but they just won't have that much to do with what will happen in the future. Which is strange. It is like a time out from the routine that I've been going through for years now. 0:45:01.1

</p><p>(knuckles crack) That is one of my worst habits. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I used to do that all the time when I was little. People would try to scare me by saying I would get big knuckles (inaudible at 0:45:28.1).

</p><p>PATIENT: I read not too long ago that isn't true. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I've seen some yoga (ph) people do it. They may not do it that quickly and all that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That is weird stuff. I used to watch a guy that would lay on his stomach and then lift himself up from his head one vertebra at a time until he was from his waist almost straight up. It would take him like an hour to do it. Aww it was ugly. Oooh. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Like a snake in slow motion. 0:46:02.7

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I can't imagine the purpose of it all but it sure was weird to look at. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think I'm going to try it. You really have to have time for it. (inaudible at 0:46:13.9) half hour a day. (inaudible) it might be a good idea.

</p><p>PATIENT: I know there are Judo and Karate classes right? I've wanted to start them for a long time. It is the kind of thing where it is too easy to just sit at home instead and just listen to the stereo. Now a job or school I can manage to kick myself in the ass and just go do it. But for just my benefit, I would rather just sit there too often. But I'm getting too out of shape.

</p><p>My God. It has a year since I've been active. A little better. It's been since I screwed up my shoulder. Wow, that was a long time ago. August of '67. I came walking out of a dance place and some clown jumped on me. Before I knew much of what was going on some cops showed up and sprayed me in the face with mace, hit me across the side of the head. Well, sprayed me in the face with mace and I fell on the ground. One of them reached down to pick me up and fell on top of me, put a knee in my back and broke three of my ribs. The other guy thought I had dragged him down and was trying to beat him up. Now this, is a six foot 200 pound sheriff that I'm beating up. So he whips out his club and let me have it across side of the head and gave me a concussion. And I'm laying there kind of racked up. I didn't even know what was going on still the mace had me so screwed up. And I said all right, I'm dead! He said, well you're going to be. And I'm laying on my stomach so he grabbed my arm and pulled me. Threw me back up in the air and popped my shoulder out. 0:47:59.1

</p><p>Well, I didn't even notice that for a couple of minutes. We're standing there and tears. They had maced me so hard that the pores had opened up and I was seeping blood all over my face and up into my hair. And he said if you guys don't behave I'm going to take you down to the station. I looked down and my shoulder came out to here and sunk back in about an inch and a half, two inches, back under the shoulder blade and then came out again. I said wow well let's go on down and get it over with then because I want to do something with this. And then they realized they had gone a little too far. 

</p><p>So they just sent this other kid away who had jumped me. Just sent him on, gave him a cigarette and told him to go back inside and have a good time. And then they tried to put my shoulder back. And this old game of putting their foot in my chest and twisting around on it. And the guy says is it in? And I says, I don't think so. (inaudible at 0:48:55.2). And it was hurting. I knew they were doing bad things to it. So I said, well I can move it. I guess it is ok. 0:49:02.8

</p><p>They go, can you lift it up? And I say yeah. They say, no not like that and grab my arm. He says now can you move it? And of course I couldn't move it down. I was about to start crying. He says, well here, I'll move it down for you. So I got to the hospital and they had loused it up so bad that I've got tendons and ligaments that are like spaghetti now. I could throw a snowball and pop it out. But since that point I have been about as inactive as I've ever been in my life. It's really getting me out of shape. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: OK, what about, were you wanting to wait and see how things went and then call up and set up an appointment? Is that the best way to handle it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Probably best because I don't even know which shift I will be working yet. I should have my test back by the end of this week at the latest. I mean, I should, well I should have my test back and be set up to start the job. I may even start it this week. So by the end of this week I should be able to call up and make the arrangement. 0:50:19.9

</p><p>THERAPIST: Ok, I guess the best thing to do would be really to try and get me on the phone myself so we can haggle over time. And sometimes I'm really hard to catch. So let me give you this number and my home number. I've got this jazzy new phone system. (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. They came off of the extension deal. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: What is that number? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Your own number? (chuckles) Somebody asked me that the other day and I had to take a note out of my wallet. 0:51:03.0

</p><p>THERAPIST: Ok. And I'll hear from you sometime at the end of the week then?

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Ok. Oh Lord. I get to walk home. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'd offer you a ride but it is probably as far to my car as it is to....

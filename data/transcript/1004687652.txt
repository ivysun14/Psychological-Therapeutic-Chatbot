<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry for not getting back to you quicker about tomorrow...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to make sure that you can save it because I haven't heard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, no, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have very, very bad reception when I'm in my house in general...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I fuckin' don't get texts or phone calls until much later. Like I'll get a message.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So, um, uh, then for future reference is it better if I need to reach you especially, uh, like during the evening or on a weekend to e-mail you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just....like I won't get like the notification till much later, so I was doing it more to make sure that it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. No, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. So, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so what's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (sighs), it's just been an exhausting few days now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mike's having such a really hard time with his addiction right now that it's just, um, that's pretty darn paralyzing cuz it's like part of it's the fact that (pause) (sighs)...and maybe it's just because I am...no, no, it's not just me. Um, I don't feel comfortable trying to be intimate with him if he's been acting out recently which just makes me feel very (inaudible at 00:01:22). So, but...ya know with all the stress that's been going on I really would like to gain some comfort from my husband but he's off somewhere else and so it's been, ya know, quite frustrating. [00:01:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I, um, yeah so I uh, like I said its made me pretty upset. (pause) And the thing is, is that it's just so exhausting getting to the truth of things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that it's (sighs) (pause)...it's not even worth it. It's not worth the chase. Like I, back when I actually attended S-Anon meetings which were basically loved ones who have, ya know, someone in their lives with sexual addictions, there are women who are obsessed with chasing down every single detail of things. They want to know everything. I would like to know details. I really would. But not like at that level, and quite frankly the amount of effort that it takes for the minimal amount of insight it's just not worth it, ya know? And so (pause) I do have these sort of artificial preferences about things too and I feel kind of a bit of a jerk for wanting these things but like recently I was like ya know I really would like you to be sober around my birthday. That kind of thing. He's not very good at that. He wasn't even sober on our anniversary which sort of led to some very, very unpleasant things. If he had just been truthful the first time around on that it wouldn't...like I would have been like oh, oh I'm disappointed, that's a shame. But like the fact that it had to be like a oh, no, everything's fine ya know, and like I'm going to make you feel like you're going to...like you're the one's that's...every single thing that you think seems off is just you just overreacting or something...you're, you're, you're misplacing your concern on me. I think that's part of the reason why, by the way, that I always doubt my own judgment now is that I have been given by so many people um, between him and his family, the, the, the oh, you're sense of whatever is off, such that I get very, very...and I don't ever really truly know cuz sometimes I don't always find out what's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:03:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? And (sighs) (pause) it's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you find out on your anniversary what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I said to him like well, just because, just so I can lay it all to rest, do you mind if I just take a look at your computer. He's like well, actually I was. Sometimes he actually lets me use it cuz he thinks that I can't find out, and like there's no good reason why this much...I mean I don't look at like the programs. I know him well enough to know that he can clean up anything like that. All I have to do is see what the router data is coming in and out of it, ya know? Or I can look at the system log and find out like what processes at one point in time were being used. These are not things that he can erase per se. Um, but I...he just is honest with me at that point, ya know sort of. Um, at least mostly. But the thing is, is that like (sighs) (pause) that's exhausting ya know to have to get to that point of being told oh, no, everything's fine, don't worry, just relax. Ya know. Go take a nap. You're obviously just sort of...because I do talk about the fact that sometimes when I'm out and about that I sort of need a reset, like, because I have been...like especially when it's (pause)...the store is super manic cuz there's not...there's tons and tons of people and with completely and totally irrational expectations. Um (pause) that I do need a reset and I'm just sort of like I'm jumping at nothing at all, which is true. But very...I mean that isn't nor...that's tax free, that's day after Thanksgiving, that's when someone throws a phone at me. [00:05:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I can actually celebrate the anniversary but it's been a long time since I've actually had a phone thrown at me. It used to happen all the time. People get very frustrated when they're angry. Ya know, that kind of stuff, so (sighs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Somebody'd throw an phone at you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. If you talk to anybody that's worked for Microsoft for more than 3 years they've had some small device thrown at them at some point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think that hurts, like you could...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually they miss cuz they're so upset that they don't, they're, they're not very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...yeah. But the point, though, is, is that it's the indignity...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...of it all. Somebody who like...they're already...they already have a broken phone and you've just told them that it isn't just the glass. That like all the electronics under the glass has been bothered too. And they get angry and then they throw the phone at you. And so you have something that has broken glass thrown at you. Usually, like I said, by the time they get to that point they're so angry that they don't, they don't usually hit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:06:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but yes, it gets to be that (inaudible at 00:07:02). Lots of during Christmas, (inaudible at 00:07:03) whatever, birthdays because you can't fix this, whatever, ya know. Yeah. So sometimes I need a reset from that cuz I mean it's a lot of fight or flight. But it's just the nature of the industry because we sort of propped ourself up to be the company that doesn't...you know that is wonderful customer service. Um, but (pause) ya know it's...but ya know it's, it's, it's very hard sometimes cuz it's like...ya know but I usually can reset by the time I get home. On the bus it's been...I've got this whole like, I've got this whole ritual of listening to music, doing something that's very detail oriented that I am very good at. It's like a self-reinforcing thing. Like, ya know, I, I, I've got a whole series of positive music along with, ya know, tasks that are not impossible, ya know, to do and that kind of thing. It usually resets me by the time I get home, so (pause)...almost all of us have some sort of thing for that. Back when I was in Cincinnati it was heavy drinking...not for me, but the people I knew. I'd go and hang with them. I, uh...I think that they do that at my store here, but I just don't have the interest of coming back later at night slash finding out how to get back from the surburbs at night after drinking to really know, whereas in Cincinnati we were literally in the middle of the city. We went to the bar that was right across from our store, ya know. And I could stumble home all of 700 feet to my apartment before...so it wasn't that big of a deal, but, um, it seems to be that it's a pretty common thing to have to do something to cope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:08:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...but...I mean that doesn't make us any different than air traffic controllers or...there's a lot of very high-stress jobs where people put a lot of pressure on you. It's not like it's (sighs)...you go into it with your eyes open. You know when you work there that you're going to deal with completely irrational people, and in many ways the store in Burlington is actually more sane than the old one. Um, now the thing is when I say sane—oh gosh, um—I should probably explain to you why it is that like, that like there's...I don't know, ya know. It's not even really relevant. But my old store was very, very (sigh) (pause)...due to the nature of it's proximity to other things we would get a lot more weirdos, but at the same time also we didn't have all the problems of the suburbs either, though. You never got somebody whose phone somehow got caught in the lawnmower. I have no idea how that happens to this day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It happens in the summer time about once every other week that somebody got their phone in the lawnmower. Yeah. So (pause) I can't even fathom that one. In the city that doesn't happen so much cuz we don't really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...have lawns.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's just really...I guess that it's really frustrating. I started at the beginning of my summer like distraction. Um, I think I've told you that I was thinking about trying to do the language thing again. Um, trying to learn a language.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Instead of trying to do one of the ones I failed at I think that I'm doing is I'm picking up one that I've never tried and one that I cannot feel bad because I don't know it if I fail at it because like if I try to pick up Russian, every member of my family can read and speak and all this other stuff. When I tried to pick up Greek, ya know, dad speaks it, but also just a lot of people, ya know, do that. Latin, same thing. And when I say I was a failure, I wasn't that bad. It was just not enough. Never attained enough. So I'm picking up Mandarin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which sounds hard but it's not as hard as you think. So (pause), so I'm gonna try and do some self-study and then I'm going to go try to visit this professor who teaches. There are two classes at the university. There is, there is an intensive beginning and then they have something called practical Mandarin which is I guess for people who are going abroad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:11:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's more like how to recognize the word bathroom and things like that. Um (pause), which I've been told is actually very dangerous if I wanted to learn it as a skill long-term because you learn bad habits.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't care. I just want...I just want to be able to if I go over there to have some sort of bearings. I don't know if I will or not, but it's something different. Something I can't compete with. There's nobody I know...actually that's not true. All the people I know who know Mandarin are (pause)...have a cultural link to it. Therefore, it's different, so we'll see how it goes. (pause) I don't have a metric to compare myself to and feel like a failure basically, and supposedly the actual language itself is a lot simpler than you'd think it would be cuz they have very...they don't have any um short vowels. Like it's always...the word Nikon is neekon, not nykon. They don't have a long "i" like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:12:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, it's very short. It's very mechanical is the way you make words. It's just that lexicon is hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it apparently is going to be going away in the past...I mean it's very rarely written any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like kids don't learn cursive any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so there's a good chance that within the next 10 years it won't actually be in the, in the lexicon. So if I don't learn it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's not the end of the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...that makes it a lot less difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah, so you just have to learn each one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which like you learn, like the symbol for bathroom and things like that it's more symbolic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, but actually using it to write to somebody is very, very unusual any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but we'll see. I'm doing this not for credit, not...ya know doing this low stakes. We'll see how it goes. It might very well work. I am willing to like if come mid July I'm struggling, pull the plug and do something else. Usually I stick with it to be...to say that I finished cuz I don't like to be oh, I'm the person that finished, but sometimes I just feel like I just...I'm being a glutton for punishment and then sort of make myself feel bad about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But instead of yes-I-stuck-with-it-and-I-finished feeling, I get the wow, this totally confirms that I suck at this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:14:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I, um...I'm not going to let myself, ya know, get into that belief and I'm not gonna tell...let anybody tell me right now about this, how what will and will not make me feel good and get accomplished cuz that's...I, I'm kind of...especially academically I feel like it's bullshit. I've always felt like it's bullshit. Like people can tell me what's going to give me satisfaction but they have no idea, and so if I'm doing it for my own edification then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm just not gonna listen to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm...that's easier for me to go with my instincts on...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...cuz I know myself very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, other things ya know, telling me oh, you'll feel better if you do this. Sometimes I get influenced too much, ya know? But we'll see. (sighs) I just (pause)...I need, just need something, ya know...not something to do cuz I have plenty to do. I need something that's gonna be (pause) more of an escapism from my world ya know? Something that's gonna be different. So (pause), so like I said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I can imagine it's escapist in a way, but also I guess I'm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the word escapism, like escapism isn't quite the right word. I need a vacation from like...I need ya know a daily vacation from ya know worrying about my, my cares in my life and by jumping into that then I can go back into it, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess also the thing like it's learning stuff. It's in a classroom ya know, um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...which (pause) I guess as I understand it ya know is generally stuff that makes you feel...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's my natural habit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when I had mentioned it to...I had e-mailed a couple friends about this, and they're like oh, just get the Pimsleur, and I'm like no, no, no, you don't understand...I will always find some...I understand...I, there's a lot of things I can self-pace myself through. This is not one of them. I may get the stuff, but I need to be in a classroom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? I need to be like tonight's Mandarin night and I'm ya know gonna pack myself a lunch and go and leave the house no matter what drama's there. I mean it sounds lovely to go and get myself some tapes, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but I need, I need the, I need the interaction. So (pause) we'll see. We'll see how it goes. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was shocked to find out that it was actually, that the class that is at the...there's a class and stuff at the university uh what's it called, uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Adult ed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Adult, yeah. Theirs is actually...their introduction one appears to be more difficult than the one that Yale has...not for the comprehensive but the basic survival skills.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz their introductory one said that it would be very helpful if you'd had some sort of back...ya know that it was really geared toward...even though it was I, introductory I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...introductory I, if you had some background in this and I'm like no, actually. I know that the other type of rating that they have starts with the "k" other than [inaudible], but that's really about it. I know that books run the other direction because I used to read Manga but that's, I mean that's, that's the, that's like, that's like the maximum. So, I was just surprised that that was true. I don't know if they're just writing that to say that, but it appeared from the course description to be more difficult than the one that Yale had, which, like I said, really looks like you're spen...like it's made to be like you're spending the fall, ya know, doing at somebody's lab. This is how to make sure that you can find a taxi stand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, which ya know...it'll be...like I said it'll be helpful. The last language I took was so esoteric that it was very hard to get involved in. I took Latin. You don't really like...you don't learn the way you learn languages normally where you learn, ya know, normally. You spend a lot of time reading texts and so even with the first lesson you're reading (inaudible at 00:18:54) of some sort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's...at no point can I actually really say anything...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that's meaningful, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I can talk about dictators and like yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's not a living...it never was a living language so, but so, but yeah...that's pretty much been the, ya know, I'm was just trying to keep myself going. It's just that I suck at it ya know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not so sure you suck at it. You are dealing with a lot. [00:19:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Well, it's not so much I suck at it as much as (pause) there are certain things that along the way that I find to be harder to deal with than others, so...I find certain situations more frustrating and more off putting than some other people do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause)...and they are usually things that I have to deal with more than the average person so like ya know doctor's offices that most healthy people don't have to go there that much. Therefore, the annoyance isn't all that common, so (pause) but (pause) I have to admit that I really don't know what else to say really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long (inaudible at 00:21:06) ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not much. Just exhaustion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to just rest for a couple of minutes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no I meant more like (pause) I'm not very good at the just-what—pops-in-one's-head kind of person cuz really it's just like wow, what pops into my head is boy I'm tired. That's really about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's uh (pause) relevant. Um (pause), along probably most other places you work pretty hard in here, so I could imagine that when you pause you feel like you want to sort of relax a minute or take a break for a minute or feel like I'm tired. I mean, I think it's sort of important, an important part of your experience here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's, it's not just that. It's just also like, like wow...I would really like to take a nap right now. Not just like pause for a minute but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know like wow, ya know (pause). I'm just, ya know, I find my life boring and I don't know. (pause) It's very hard for me sometimes to find out what is relevant and what is not. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean of what you might say or do you mean...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is important to share, what isn't. Like sometimes it's like wow, ya know I even find this to be kind of boring in terms of that, ya know? I find my despair to be very boring. (pause) Not that any, that there's anything that would liven it up per se or anything like that (pause). When I speak to other people I usually use a sense of levity that is a little bit, um, overdone because it makes it at least...first of all I try to make it short so it seems like it's not like I'm, ya know, trying to extract any sympathy but mostly just cuz it's like wow, ya know, this is really kind of depressing and boring, ya know? (pause) I do make a lot of jokes. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, ya know, it makes it seem at least more amusing and interesting. The other day I made a joke about...cuz people noticed I was limping, and it was like yup, if I have to get this hip replaced that means ya know that they...cuz at work if you have 3 major component replacements, which I've already had 2 joint replacements, they usually swap out the whole computer for a new one, and like they're just gonna...at that point they're just gonna give me a whole new body, ya know just like the, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, like what you do at work. [00:24:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that was a pretty big hit in terms of the jokes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean obviously really sad but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it made it more interesting than gee, ya know, it's gonna really suck if I have to get another, if I have to get another joint surgery and that kind of stuff. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you pretty much hate your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Pretty much. Live for the past. (pause) The problem is, is that when you had such an amusing, extraordinary past and you have a very normal future it's sort of a (pause) it's hard sometimes to even just (pause) get acclimated to it. (pause) I find Christmas is a lot like brides who have like super big weddings and afterwards like they so they aren't the center of attention afterward and they're like so why am I so depressed. And like well, I don't think it's quite like that, but thanks for trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just...I didn't really need to be the center of attention. It just was at least something interesting going on all the time (pause). The thing is, is that I know that if I went back and I spent more time over at Brown it isn't like that any more. The culture isn't like that any more either. I spent, I mean I've spent time there. They're still very dorkish but it's not...I mean there are two universities that they modeled after...for the story behind Weird Science, like and Brown was one of them. That isn't true any more. I mean they, they, they don't let you do the kind of things that we've done in the past.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean Real Genius or Weird Science?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry Real Genius. I'm sorry, tired. I can't believe I got that one. Yeah. That's what I meant, Real Genius. Sorry. Yeah. Like the kind of things of like freezing things with liquid nitrogen and dropping them from staircases. They don't let you do that any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but...so I know that that kind of stuff...and it's just...not that I really necessarily want to do it, but (pause) it's one of the many reasons why I don't like getting older. I don't like to admit that things are over. (pause) Hell, I just referenced an 80s movie (snorts) in terms of like things being over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I don't know. (pause) And yes, my life sucks but it could be a lot worse. (pause) I really feel like on some level that why I let myself fall into despair. I can't dig myself out. Ya know? [00:28:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, you can't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dig myself out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dig yourself out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just feel like when I get like that it's just not, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I think that when I get that way I just let myself get too...I get kind of irrational and get very, like I said I mean everything makes me unhappy at that point ya know? I just (pause)...I just don't like that. And it's very, very hard to get out of it. Very hard. And so I just don't like to let myself get there because when I do it's impossible to get out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long does it last?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. (pause) Like I spent most of 2002 to 2003 feeling sorry for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I mean that isn't just the only time but when I do it just...I mean sometimes it takes days or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I make myself sick when I do that, ya know? Being upset bothers my stomach a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, usually I get nauseated and throw up if I get really, really upset about something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not all the time but (pause) it does happen. (inaudible at 00:31:07) made the joke about...what was it she called it? Um, something bulimia. She made a joke about being like bulimia but you're not making the choices of it, like not really, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) but it's just ya know, it was (pause)...I mean yes I found lots and lots of causes for it but basi...the concept is that I get sick, I get upset and then something happens and then like this perfect storm happens and the next thing you know I'm like at the hospital with colitis or something like that ya know? It only happens when I let myself get really, really stuck and wallowing. It isn't just like I...ya know I get, I get a little nauseous, it ends up being like some sort of digestive...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ugliness, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I'm not really sure what that's about, but there's definitely a component of distress associated with it, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's not the same as um sort of similar to like somebody with Crohns.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They tested me actually a couple times for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, where stress can...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...um, cause like the GI problems that go on with Crohns.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because of the fact that my immune system tends to be very - they call it rheumatoid arthritis but it tends to sometimes branch out and does other things it, it, it mimics a lot of symptoms like Crohns. Sometimes I've gotten symptoms like many other things also.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But for me...there are other symptoms that happen sometimes but the biggest thing that really happens is that I have never been able to tolerate being nauseous very well and so (pause) that's the one where basically for me it's very crippling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's, yeah, that's why I don't really like to let myself get that upset about anything. (pause) It's really hard when like your emotions create something like this, something that is actually...like I said it's not the only thing that created this, but it creates something that's very real too. It isn't just like well I have an upset stomach. No, I'm ending up like (inaudible at 00:34:16) consumer like when they're doing some sort of CT scan kind of thing ya know. It isn't just like, ya know...it, it, it is very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it isn't just sort of like a hysterical throwing up, which is no fun either...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have (inaudible at 00:34:33) of horror throwing up before too but not like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. This is more like, ya know, even after the time passes we were upset about something it's still, there's a lot of repercussions. So, it just...that isn't the only thing that's happened, but that's the one that...it's like my serious weakness. All of my life I've never been very good with that. I don't...I don't deal with it very well. And so...not that there's many people in the world who like this kind of thing, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that I run across.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, it's something that...I have...day to day I can handle chronic pain, and there are people who have like IBS and other things like and digestive things and they can handle it. It's not something that I have the coping skills to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:35:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's just (pause) amongst many other things ya know, but this is just like (pause)...it's many, there's many things in life that really force me to not really want to be that sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Valid ones, ya know? (noise) I think she's snoring. So (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long have you actually been that sad underneath?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like even if that's the place you, ya know, for very reasonable reasons don't want to let yourself go...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably the entire time since between now and December 1st, 1999.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At 11 AM. That's when I found out that, for the first time that I figured out what was going on kind of. It just doesn't ever really go away. If I let myself I'll just despair. (pause) Maybe I'm just being dramatic by saying it's been like that the whole time, but I'm pretty sure that if I just let myself like be, like literally yeah if I let myself the entire time I probably would have gone to reset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) There are certain things in life that understanding it doesn't make it any easier to keep going. Like understanding my arthritis has made it slightly easier to keep going cuz it's like I understand why when I wake up in the morning that, ya know, sometimes I'm in a lot of pain. It's like while over the night, ya know, that like it been collecting. Your immune system tends not to work when you're awake. It tends to work when you're asleep, so I know that my immune system is busy tearing my body apart while I'm sleeping.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of knowledge is actually helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, the more that I know and understand about my husband's addiction doesn't really make it that much easier to keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to but I just don't know. I mean I do keep going but it doesn't make it...the inside doesn't change anything, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm really starting to despair of whether or not he can actually ever really recover from this either. Ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:39:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Oh well. He's a good man. He really doesn't deserve this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause) Neither of you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But at least I had a foundation where (pause) I knew that I was loved and supported, that kind of thing. (pause) If I get angry around the house he is immediately thinks that I angered him. Like I spilled something at one point...well while up on a ladder I spilled something all over myself. I'm flipping out, ya know. He's trying to help. I'm saying no, no, no, you leave it alone, this and this, and then he's like ya know I'm really kind of bitter that, ya know, I'm really kind of resentful that you spilled something on yourself and you took it out on me...and not just took it out on me but that you're angry with me about it. And I said that makes no sense at all. How in the world is it that like I'm angry. I wanted, you know I needed to take care of the situation because it would have spilled and it was going to stain really bad and I needed to take care of the situation but in no way was I angry at you. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And on top of it like him being angry and also he's resentful because he felt like he didn't do anything wrong. I'm like I'm...this doesn't make...like where did we get to that point, and how many times that I've been frustrated with something and like you thought I was mad at you. This is the equivalent of stubbing one's toe and starting to swear ya know. It's not...it's, it's 30 seconds later you're fine. I'm just angry cuz I'm covered in ya know whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I feel like it's awful that he (pause) ya know feels that way about things, but he always has. I have seen it happen over again, ya know, with our nephew. Sometimes I hear about it and realize it's happening over again with them too. It's like they're just convenient punching bags. That's so sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. [00:42:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? It makes me want to call up my sister-in-law and yell at her about things. (pause) I, most of the things that I heard, though, it's like it's really none of my business to yell at her about, but I find it disturbing that, ya know, her 9- or 10-year-old son has to look to his younger or older sister to tell him what he's feeling. That's really creepy. And on top of it just to reinforce that, she has her 10-year-old son sharing a bedroom with their 9-year-old daughter so that she can bully him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...she has the space. She just doesn't want to...the other room is...like she has a 4-bedroom house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But one of them is filled with junk right now and it's kind of inconvenient to have to clean up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they've been sharing rooms for a long time now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like doesn't that seem a little bit weird? Yeah. He didn't speak until his older sister went to school because...they thought there was something wrong. They did all this testing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He just needed actually to have some peace and quiet from his sister who talked all the time, ya know? And, and it's just, it's like everything I hear about what's going on over there makes me think to myself my God, this is like scarily mirroring what we've suspected with Mike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Right down to the fact that his sister lives in the house that he grew up in. His mother gave his sister the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a sense of resentment by the way. Um, so like Aiden is living in Mike's bedroom that he grew up as a child in, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:44:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just...and he doesn't remember a damn thing really but if you connect the dots it just looks really bad. It looks really bad. But nobody wants to actually...we can't get any external confirmation...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...therefore it feels very awkward to, ya know? They're all like...they're actually willing to admit that he doesn't remember anything but like that's such a strange phenomenon. I wonder why that is, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We should finish up for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I will see you Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, we should talk about a later time, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I do not have my schedule and stuff with me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do it on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, let's do it on Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We'll do it on Tuesday. [00:45:47]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it was gone for a few months in the winter because there is much less light here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was it there before?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was there before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, somehow I forgot you had it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you wouldn't have seen it since last year, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, hello again tree. (laughter) So I met with that prescriber. Did you talk to her?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, she was really nice and she gave me two things to try. One of them being a short supply of Dexedrine because she was really hesitant to prescribe it to me since it can increase psychotic symptoms. And she also gave me Abilify to try because she said that of the anti-psychotic drugs, the one that was least likely to cause weight gain, which I was worried about. I took one small dose of that —</p>

<p>[01:11.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The Abilify?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I experienced really bad side effects.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it can cause muscle tension and it caused extreme tension in my neck and shoulders, so much so that you could see the muscle ropes sticking out. I got a killer migraine from all the tension, and — this really freaked me out — I noticed that my mouth was really tense and my tongue felt bizarre and uncomfortable. I kept wanting to move my mouth because it felt so tense. And then I was looking up reviews of people who have used it, and that can be a sign of TD, tardive dyskinesia, or however you pronounce it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tardive dyskinesia?</p>

<p>[01:59.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is a side effect of Abilify that shows up in like 4.5 percent of people who try it. And it can be permanent, which is terrifying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was scared to take it again. So I called her and she said —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I was disappointed. (laughter) I would've freaked out. I mean if I hadn't had the permanent tinnitus from Wellbutrin, I might not have been so paranoid. Like I could've ended up with a permanent mouth twitching thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm sort of losing hope with drugs other than straight-up ADD drugs because I seem to be a magnet for bad side effects. Like if there's some permanent negative side effect, I will get it. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're going to get it.</p>

<p>[03:09.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the Dexedrine has been definitely helping when I take it. I've been able to do my freelance work in a way that feels like logical and like the speed is normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. That's a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a big deal. She advised me not to take it every day because you can become dependent on it pretty easily.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So she [didn't say anything about] tolerance but dependence?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, both. Yeah, because your tolerance, I guess, [you get used to it pretty quickly] and you need more and more if you take it too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although some people take it every day for years and years. But I know some people say it loses —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it can vary, maybe.</p>

<p>[03:55.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for some people it loses its effectiveness. So I took it all weekend and I decided just to take half of one on Monday and then today. So it's been kind of rough. I didn't really feel like some withdrawal symptoms like a headache. I'm feeling a little down, but nothing too serious. Nothing as bad as permanent facial twitching. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's good. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it seems like, I mean maybe once I get used to it, there will be less of a difference on days I take it and days I don't take it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When do you see her again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In almost two weeks. She said maybe we could talk about another thing to try, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow you're not that psyched to try something else.</p>

<p>[04:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and a lot of straight-up antidepressants cause weight gain and sleepiness, which are just really unappealing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They can, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know. (chuckles) I think I'll just see if she can give me a decent amount of Dexedrine to work with, because I think there would be two ways to go at this with drugs. Like either take on the focus problem straight-on, or take on the sort of depression and distracting presences or voices or whatever, and hope that dealing with those would help the focus problem. But it seems like the second strategy is sort of — I'm just not [receiving] those drugs very well, so it seems like the first strategy is probably the best.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I really don't know. I mean, that's something that she would have ideas about. I guess the question in my mind is, not based on knowing about much of these drugs, but I'm just trying to think it through. I guess the question is how likely is it that if you have bad side effects with more than one of the medications, you are likely to have bad side effects with more of them.</p>

<p>[06:26.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if that's true, then I could see why you wouldn't want to try anything else, but she would really know. I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'll discuss it with her then, but sort of not too hopeful about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, it's done you more harm than good. But you had a pretty good impression of her, in other words?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she was very nice and easy to talk to. Nice and calm. (laughter) Unlike the other woman. It was a good meeting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also she's somebody you feel like you could talk to and say whatever you need to about what you do and don't want to do, and she'll be receptive.</p>

<p>[07:27.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, she was very hesitant to give me any Dexedrine, but I did sort of press the case for her to give me some. Not enough for every day between now and our next meeting. So we reached a compromise and she's like "Just try it and look out for anything weird." So we came to an agreement by the end of the session.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have you seen the TV ads for Abilify? It's like cartoons. There's this woman with this coat and I think the coat symbolizes depression, and Abilify comes along and takes away her coat, or something like that. It just makes it look like this totally innocuous happy drug that everyone should be taking.</p>

<p>[08:21.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (voices overlapping) version of an antidepressant commercial, kind of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and there are parodies on YouTube of how happy the commercial sounds and then the list of side effects (laughter) that they have to talk about at the end. But I don't know. It's sort of disheartening that a drug with such serious side effects that a lot of people experience some of, and that is likely to cause diabetes which is a family risk factor for me. Like they sort of pitch something that would be good for a lot of people who are dealing with straight-up depression, which seems like there are a lot of other drugs that tackle that with fewer serious side effects. I mean, if 4.5 percent of people get this weird facial twitching thing, that's pretty bad. So I don't know. It seems like it should be reserved for people with really serious problems that are debilitating their life completely. I don't know.</p>

<p>[09:32.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound angry about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I mean, I guess I felt sort of irrationally angry at her for prescribing it to me, even though it's something that's considered legitimate to prescribe to people. And she was fine when I reacted badly and wanted to stop taking it. I don't know. It just seems like these very dangerous things are being thrown around a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like cavalierly?</p>

<p>[10:24.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the problems I'm having are certainly making it very difficult for me to live my life and pursue the things I want to pursue. But I think diabetes would do a worse job of it. (chuckles) I don't know. I think I sort of feel a little bit extra wary of people and social structures and perceived wisdom since trying the Abilify. (pause) I got a little bit snappy with both Jeff and Sue over something sort of silly. I've lost my house keys and the little key card that lets me into the gym. Not that I've been going to the gym, but I would like to. And this form.</p>

<p>[11:29.1]</p>

<p>Like my room has been super messy, which doesn't really bother me as long as no one sees it. I'm pretty immune to it. But then having lost these three things, I figured it was probably finally time to clean my room. I'm like, you know, do laundry and all of that. It wasn't a laundry emergency, but it seems like the two things go together. And I spent hours working on it because there was just so much stuff everywhere. Like nothing was put away, everything was out. (laughter) It was very hard to walk. Stacks of books on the floor and the bed, books everywhere. I was really resentful of having to do this because cleaning — some people enjoy cleaning, it makes them feel good like they have done something worthwhile. But cleaning just makes me feel like shit, like oh God, I'm such a sell-out, wasting my time on this worthless activity.</p>

<p>[12:34.6]</p>

<p>I know that cleaning common areas is part of the social contract you sign when you become a roommate, so that doesn't feel as bad. It's like okay, I kind of have to do this, every once in a while, so I'm getting it done. But then my own room, I never have to do that. So if I do it, it's like almost like an ideological stance against everything I believe in. Not that I believe in having a messy room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like this bumper sticker I saw the other day that said "a clean house is a sign of a wasted life." I'm sure it sort of it feels that way to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, because I wouldn't like — I mean that's just sort of judgmental against others. I recognize that other people value that. It's a Jeffer of taste. But since it's not like in my taste profile, when I do it I feel like do I not even care about writing my novel or doing my job? Because it always takes hours, it gets so messy. Sometimes I try to keep it clean so it's not this thing that takes eight hours once in a while. (laughter)</p>

<p>[13:42.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But generally at some point that stops happening. (pause) And so while I was cleaning, I was in a really bad mood (chuckles) and Sue does this, it's annoying — she was like "Oh, now it's going to feel so good when your room is clean. You know, it may be taking a while, but you'll feel so great once it's done." And I sort of got a little harsh and was like "No, I'm wasting my time. This is such a farce that does not make me feel good." She didn't seem to believe it.</p>

<p>[14:29.3]</p>

<p>And Jeff sort of says the same thing because he was out of earshot when I snapped at Sue. (laughter). I did the same thing to him. I don't know. I mean, I think generally I avoid actually lashing out at people about these things, but I guess it was just a cluster of situations in which what seemed to be like the common wisdom perhaps went against what was best for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe also in all three situations, people who are supposed to be there for you really weren't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of. I mean, they were like trying to cheer me up and make me feel like there was some worth in what was going on. So it was like good intentions.</p>

<p>[15:33.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, Wiseman has good intentions too. She was trying to make you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or I assume she was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. I guess it's frustrating. It just makes me feel very sort of isolated and like there's a lot of burden on my shoulders to really figure everything out. Not that — I'm sure if I had [Jeff] with Dr. Wiseman in two weeks and said I'm having these bad side effects, what should I do, she would've said "stop taking it." It's not like it was really all up to me to figure that out. But I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It felt like it was really on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When in truth, it wasn't. But somehow it read that way.</p>

<p>[16:35.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, one of the tough things you've been dealing with has not been squarely on your shoulders to deal with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if I say I don't know, maybe it says more about me than all the things I've been dealing with. (laughter) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I ask a bit rhetorically, like it seems to me the burden has pretty much fallen squarely on you for the difficult things you've had to deal with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That sort of reinforces the idea that I should be strong and deal with things on my own because that's how things usually work out, and I should practice that and make sure I don't lose that skill. Not that it's a skill I seem likely to lose, but it's one of those things that seems like a good overall policy to have or something.</p>

<p>[17:42.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, kind of like be practiced at and used to dealing with things on your own, because you're going to have to do it anyway?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Occasionally I feel more like going in the direction of oh, I should let people in more and see if anyone else has any advice or guidance. But I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Although I guess one thing that is maybe a little different, if I follow, is that whereas you might at other times withdraw, this time you have felt more like irritated and angry.</p>

<p>[18:32.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Both Sue and Jeff totally waste time cleaning. It's a vague procrastination device for both of them. Not that I think that people shouldn't clean. But there's something pathological about their cleaning. With Jeff, it's more organizing than cleaning. He has to find the perfect way to arrange the furniture in his room and organize everything. And he was less abrasive than Sue, because Sue was talking about how I would feel. I know how I feel and Sue doesn't. Whereas Jeff was talking more about sort of the general value of a clean room and things being findable and clothes not getting wrinkled and such things. (laughter)</p>

<p>[19:42.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More practical —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is less annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I still got irritated because it's like wow, I value my work much more than I value being able to find stuff and not having a wrinkled shirt. (laughter) But then again, it's sort of sad that I feel like my work and stuff is going so badly that I feel extreme guilt at spending an evening and night cleaning my room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So this wasn't being angry because you just felt you were wasting your time. It was being angry with yourself because you should have been working.</p>

<p>[20:33.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like when I had my job in DC, I felt much better about cleaning because there was a much better work/life balanced feeling, so it didn't bother me so much. But now, when I'm still behind on the freelance stuff, even though I've been much more able to do it, I got behind and I'm still, that really stresses me out. And I just know that whatever I do after the job, I won't have as much time to work on the novel. So it seems really imperative to work on it a lot every day. And so I just sort of freak out when I spend a lot of time doing other things, I guess.</p>

<p>[21:34.9]</p>

<p>It's not that I'm managing my time so amazingly each day. There's time spent being depressed and trying to work and being unable to work because I'm depressed. (laughter) You know, I waste time doing things that are non-productive and maybe I should go clean my room and try to get back to work. But it's not like it makes me feel better. I don't know if it would make a difference. It's not like I don't have time to clean my room. It just feels wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think the way I think I'm understanding it, [if I'm right], is that you're just pretty mad at yourself overall about work and not being productive enough and not doing a good enough job of it. Maybe you're really pissed off with yourself about that, and taking the time to do something like cleaning your room gives you occasion to lay into yourself for not working. Although it's not sort of practical, it's just a way you're being angry, if that makes sense. In other words, as you say, it's not as though you're using every other minute.</p>

<p>[22:55.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds more like the way when people lay into each other, it's not necessarily very practically motivated. It's like getting something off their chest, do you know what I mean? It's more like [the way that you] lay into yourself than that you're actually trying to be pragmatic with yourself. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I half-believe that it's justified that I'm angry with myself, and I half-think well, what about that afternoon you spent being depressed, that was even worse. (laughter) Like, nothing happened. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like nothing even got cleaned, you mean?</p>

<p>[23:51.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) I mean, getting things clean, I may not feel good afterwards, but it's something the world recognizes as good. Whereas nobody recognizes an afternoon of being depressed as good. It's just like, no net value there. (pause) And I know there's this school of thought that suggests you go out and go to the gym, and clean and do this and that because then you'll be more productive in the hours when you're trying to work. I don't know if I found that to be the case. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough. It seems like cooking nice dinners or watching a movie in the evening to like end work, I don't know that that helps me.</p>

<p>[24:53.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does and it doesn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. But the Dexedrine, it's a little more predictable when I'll be able to work, but without it it's so unpredictable when the stars will align in my mind. It seems like I should be trying for it all the time because I never know when it's going to happen. It could strike in the middle of when I'm cleaning my room and I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So you're just kind of on-call in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also sounds like there's a bit of [inaudible at 25:33.3] talking and maybe with me as well, of like — it's a funny way to put it — but being sick of other people's prescriptions. You know, clearly with Wiseman, with Sue and Jeff as well, there's this idea how I should do things and that idea of how I should do things, but for me, that's bullshit. (laughter)</p>

<p>[26:04.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't see why I should have to do it that way. It doesn't work for me. Or I guess I have — it sort of feels like the way you're talking about it — I feel like there's a bit of a, and maybe not, but an implicit kind of cautionary tale for me. Like you're kind of warning me like, look buddy. Not in so many words, but a little bit like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It certainly hasn't occurred to me (laughter). I guess — I mean, I generally haven't felt that sort of sense with you. Ooh, I'm getting some weird light pattern disturbances.</p>

<p>[27:03.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that usually mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to tell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Are you okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's probably exacerbated by the fact that all I've eaten today is a soy yogurt. So who knows how much of it is just that. But it's always suspicious when it hits at a certain moment. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to run down and get a candy bar or something? Would that help you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm not like super dizzy. I think it's just sort of a combination of being hungry intensifying whatever these other things are. They're not so bad now. Maybe if I look at the brick wall. There's sort of less things to move around.</p>

<p>[27:58.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I guess it's hard. I don't really want to give people the impression that I don't want advice, because I do think that people's perspectives can help each other, obviously. So I don't want to like give that impression to anyone. I guess it's just sort of an irritable spot this week. It's something that's always slightly sensitive, and there were just three things that brought out that tendency in me. I'm sort of hoping it will all —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible] of people feeling like they know better without really paying attention to what it's like for you.</p>

<p>[28:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess most, especially with Sue where she didn't only, it seems to me, come across as knowing better about cleaning your room but about how you would feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that was definitely the worst of the three for that reason. Because with Jeff, at least, the things he was saying were sort of true. Like sure I would have been able to find that piece of paper and I probably wouldn't be able to find my keys. Those are sort of true things that I can deal with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even sort of with him, it sounds like there's a bit of an imposition because it's very clear that for him, this is certainly much better, you know. I mean, how much did it feel to you like he was imposing the way things are for him on you?</p>

<p>[30:02.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there might have been a little of that, and sometimes I feel it's justified in a way because he was helping me with my taxes this weekend, and there was one — I found several helpful papers that were needed, but there was one that we couldn't find, and we weren't sure whether it existed or didn't. And if I'd had a folder for taxes, we would have known within five minutes whether that form existed. And so I guess in a serious relationship, it's sort of expected that people impose their preferences and best interests on each other. That's always — I mean, you know to expect it because you're helping each other and cooperating and all of that. It's still a little difficult sometimes to take. And one of the things I snapped at him when he was trying to tell me that a clean room is a valuable thing is that "Oh, I guess it's good practice for cohabiting, isn't it?" (laughter) He didn't deny it. (laughter)</p>

<p>[31:25.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were also saying it — I think the point where the (inaudible) started to get worse was when you were telling me you were feeling like this hasn't felt so much like a part of our dynamic here. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was there more you had in mind to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. I mean, I guess I wonder sometimes. Like on the one hand, I just have this sort of natural resistance to being told what to do. And on the other hand, sometimes I wonder if there are obvious things that I'm missing that maybe I should ask about or be less resistant to. So I think this situation sort of brings out that conflict of ideas in me. Being unsure of whether I should try to get all the information I can and not sort of put up a wall to that, or whether I should sort of let that tendency show because it's there and seems unlikely to go away. (laughter) So I'm just not sure which is best.</p>

<p>[33:04.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With regard to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess there are times when it seems like you were suggesting a certain path and I wasn't really open to it. Like back when I was talking for the first time about the traumatic events, and you were drawing attention to the way I tended to describe them in a very disassociated way without emotion or very many details. It seems you felt there would be value in dealing with them in a different way.</p>

<p>[34:05.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the moment, let's put aside what I had in mind. I'm happy to tell you that in a minute. But I guess what I'm interested in at the moment is how it felt to you when I said that, as though there were the implication that it would be better for you to speak in more concrete detail and more emotionally about what happened. And that you kind of noted that, but disagreed. (pause)</p>

<p>[35:03.4]</p>

<p>I didn't have in mind that there was a specific way you should speak about them. I don't remember real clearly what I was thinking at the time, but I suspect I was playing out what probably seemed to me like a way you were coping with how you felt about what happened. And I probably [had the half-thought] like, you know, that was worth pointing out because I didn't know how aware you were about how you were speaking about them in that way. You know, [sometimes people can tell a difference and sometimes they can't]. And I guess I think when people are aware of that, it's useful to know. It strikes me as though you're saying that it felt there was a value judgment coming. That I was making a judgment about how you were talking about it in a way, and implying there was (inaudible) better.</p>

<p>[36:45.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I didn't think it was sort of like coded advice. I didn't think it was like, you can do this but I'm going to say it in acceptable language. (laughter) But I guess I do tend to take things as advice even when they're maybe not. (chuckles) I think because my parents like to give me coded advice, so I'm always on the look-out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And here's another point I have]. Though it wasn't, that I'm aware of, when it felt like advice, why did you not want to do it?</p>

<p>[37:42.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sounded like being that vulnerable in the first place, and then in the second place being that vulnerable in the presence of another person, was just really overwhelming. And I was sort of worried about totally falling apart. I mean, I had pretty much totally fallen apart, but I was able to tell myself I hadn't. And getting to a point where I felt helpless and then having someone else know that I was at that point was really unappealing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you worry could happen?</p>

<p>[38:39.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if the emotions really took over, I would lose my sense of control over the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it something here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The situation of like experiencing things from the past. Like — (pause) just in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has that ever happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it has happened completely. I mean, there were times when putting this together was newer, I would just like cry for hours and be unable to get out of bed. And I mean, that was awfully inconvenient in terms of getting my coursework done.</p>

<p>[39:45.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine so, yeah. And I would think probably painful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I mean, when we were like talking about the events and putting things together, for days after in like the evenings after therapy, I could never do anything except maybe write in my diary. Because I would just know that those evenings were —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Shot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I would try to get everything done before therapy because I knew nothing was going to happen afterwards in terms of work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I didn't know. I'm not surprised given what we were talking about, but I'm sorry that it was so difficult.</p>

<p>[40:49.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, you know, I knew that I was putting things together and there was a reason why I was doing that. I guess the thought of losing more control was sort of scary, and that way I was able to go home and shut my door and just sort of — I guess no one saw me being helpless. Sometimes it seems like things don't exist on the same plane if no one has concrete evidence of them. Like I think part of the reason why I totally ignored my classmates since leaving is I'm not totally crazy if no one knows I'm crazy. (laughter) That's like half as good as not having serious psychological problems is like having nobody know that you have them.</p>

<p>[42:02.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I don't think you're totally crazy (inaudible at 42:16.8). But yeah, that's not what's going on, I don't think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't feel totally crazy. I just worry that people might interpret it as that, because I think that people are very afraid of mental illness and they really don't want to think about it because no one wants to feel a commonality with it. They might see something in themselves they don't want to see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now, but we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. See you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye, take care.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what's the situation at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The situation at home is I've basically isolated myself to my home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, off and traveling and doing his stuff and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you ain't talking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, no, it's not that we're not talking, um, we do talk but our conversations and I mean we do talk frequently but our conversations are limited to his work, um, politics and football.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for our relationship problems, in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have tried to bring them up, as to what my concerns are and he gets very defense or that I'm getting off track, well, I don't know where I'm getting off track with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds like he's still angry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes and I will say that yesterday I did, um, last Wednesday I had, um, my son had a doctor's appointment and, um, because he's [AGE], he is still covered under my insurance, and so I wanted him to get a physical because he had been complaining about headaches and, um, like pulsating behind the eyes and like dizziness and so I said well we have to get you in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, check that out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he went into the doctor and the doctor basically said, you know, they wanted some blood work, which that's a natural thing if you go for a physical, but then he also wanted him to have a CT scan to find out what's going on, because I was thinking it was maybe high blood pressure.  So I mean I've never had a CT scan so I told [NAME OTHER], I was kind of concerned, I didn't show my son that I was concerned and I know that it's just like a ruling out factor that there's anything but then yesterday was his appointment for the CT scan and [NAME OTHER] was very, you know, he's [AGE], what, you've got to take this kid by the hand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, he's only [AGE], I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's [AGE], he doesn't, I mean basically his father never took him to doctors when he was young, so how is he supposed to know how these things work and I'm the one with the insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, did you go with him, I mean, or not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I went, I mean I didn't go in with him but I went in, you know, for the paperwork and to make sure that he had all his information correct and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stuff like that and [NAME OTHER] just feels, you know, he's a grown man.  Well, he's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, I mean they don't know about that stuff.  So now he knows.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a learning thing.  You're not going to do it every time for the next 5 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No and I do understand that but, so I mean basically I just look at it, I think our relationship, I think our relationship has problems, oh, oh, oh, and here's the good part, because Tuesday night prior to, [NAME OTHER] and I had a big argument because I was going with [NAME OTHER].  It wasn't because I was going with [NAME OTHER] but he throws out the fact about me, do you know how nervous I am about your going to [DEIDENTIFIED] tomorrow and what's up in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that's a gambling boat is up in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME], it's been 2 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two months now, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't, haven't gone near it and I said well I'd like to thank you for your vote of confidence that you have in me, I'm concerned about my son and I'd really like to thank you for that and he said, well, you know, you can't blame me.  Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I discussed with my sister and she said [PATIENT NAME], you may have blew it out of proportion but the fight escalated because I think that very much in our relationship, everything revolves around [NAME OTHER] and I probably allowed that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In a way, yeah, but it's like the people who stop drinking, nobody really believes them for 6 months, I mean it's just sort of human nature.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you've got 2 months, see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I have 2 months but see my, my thing with my gambling wasn't like it was a quantity of going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was, I mean I do believe that I am a compulsive gambler but it's only, it's if I'm there, I don't know when to quit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well don't go there, yeah, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, so that's, that's what the whole thing, but just because I'm going to be in the same area—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm sure you've driven by the Hardrock sometimes too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't, but see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You probably did this morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's saying, he's saying that's a different thing because I'm not into playing the shot machines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They've got everything, well, no they don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No they don't, but, and I tried to explain to him, I said, you know, the thought of going and playing blackjack, it sickens me because I did realize, um, I got a big rude awakening, it was like how angry he was, my sister was angry, my other sister was devastated and she was angry at me, I mean it just caused a big turmoil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well as long as you stopped it but I don't expect everybody to calm down too much if it's too early, so what I'm telling you is they're still all reacting pretty normally.  [NAME OTHER] is an unknown because there were kind of problems before that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's a matter of let's see what it calms down to be, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean but I'm saying like with our marital life focusing strictly around his job—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I know that I am, I know that I am a defensive person, so of course I had my comebacks with the fact that I think he's a very high maintenance person, that I think that he loves the spotlight and I think that I have sacrificed a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For his—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, for his job because he takes it so seriously and then with the, you know, the election coming up, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, he has an election coming up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we're talking about the election.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER]'s very passionate about it, I mean I am too but I think that we need to work on some one on one time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you on the same side or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, thank God we are, we're on the same side, we didn't support the same—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Person in the primaries but now we're on, we are on the same page.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On that but those discussions can still get heated because of the fact that I'll say something, well this is just ridiculous and 2 hours later he claims that as his, see, that's what I was saying and I said no, I'm the one that said that.  Now is this wrong of me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No but that still falls back to the rule, don't ever argue religion or politics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we're on the same side, how can you argue when you're on the same side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, obviously, you can because there's multiple issues, you know, on both sides.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, no, we both believe the same things but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm, I was just telling him, I said that to you, I said that to you last night, now you're coming out with this like as your original idea, you know, that you said it.  I said, no, I was the one that said that and I guess that maybe I'm getting into the, um, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're not, as you say, you're not getting credit for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not getting credit for anything, that, yeah, that's basically how I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the most important thing is what you think about yourself, it's secondary what he thinks, I mean psychologically I'm telling you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My reality and his reality are then two different things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they could be but the older you get, I'll give you a hint—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can move ahead, the more you don't give a shit what anybody says, including your family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But your husband, your spouse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, same thing, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm actually, I'm actually to the point, I'm just thinking that our marriage has become, for me, it's security.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's also where it's driving me nuts, he's starting to drive me nuts, I mean not, not nutty like but it's just irritating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's kind of stable but unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's it, that's exactly it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is really what most marriages are, probably two thirds of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, if you really ask around and look around closely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't think that most people admit that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, they probably don't even think like that.  In other words, it's a good deal that you're kind of afraid to get out and it would be very expensive on both sides but it's not very satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right but to him it is satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it may, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you're—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably not, if I had him here, I bet I could get—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know and this is the thing that I have asked him, you know, I mean I just talked to him the other day and I said, honey, I really, if we're going to make this marriage work, I really think we do need marriage counseling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I agree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he doesn't see it because on his end, he's very busy, he's very involved in what he does, he's very happy and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's more than eager to share and, unfortunately, it has to do with the [DEIDENTIFIED] which just gets me all, but that's, that's the nature of his job and that's what he deals with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've just got to rethink whether you're going to stay or not.  I mean, we really don't see his job changing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I don't see his job changing, I see it possibly he may get into something where he doesn't have to deal with, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] employees directly and that would maybe be a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  You've still got to make your own life, you know.  When your husband has a job like that, you've got to make your own life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I understand that and I'm not sure—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you did, you made a stupid attempt to do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I made a life, yes, I did and that's how it all started and I tried to explain that to him because that's when it started, that was my attempt to venture out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And to meet people and basically, and I mean it was, and it was just, it was like a fun thing, unfortunately—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was money and risk involved and it was like a give/take but I mean I could go there and I'd have people around me and we'd have fun and, you know, then he started coming into it because he said, well you wanted me to come, I said, no, I wanted something to have myself that I could tell you stories or funny stories of what, you know, happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said I really didn't want you, if you wanted to come, I wasn't going to tell you, you can't come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I, yes, I just, I chose the wrong thing to do, yes, yes, that was my, you know, weekly outing or whatever and then I didn't, I didn't go for a couple months and then one of my old buddies called me and said, hey, do you want to go out on the boat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure, why not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Guy at the condo where I live, they say, you want to go to the racetrack Saturday, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so there's just, um, you know, but I mean he has been doing a lot of traveling and this is the other thing that got me about him saying, oh, I'm so worried about you going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  He's been out of town a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now [PHYSICIAN NAME], am I going to pick a day, if I'm going to do it, where he knows that I'm going up there or would I have done it when he was out of town and wouldn't really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's where I was looking at it, come on, give me a little credit, I've realized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that boils down to, I'm still mad at you, you know, that's really what that was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any time he makes a comment like that, you can just go, well obviously you're still angry, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just leave it at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, I mean you think about it, every day either two people go to work or one goes to work and they both have all day to fool around or do anything they want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean they trust each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  And so I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Find something else to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I really, I think that maybe it has to do with my age factor, the stage of my life that I'm going through, that I'm just like, is this all there is, I mean is this it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but what you're really saying is, what I got here I don't like, I've got to change something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, but I mean I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he's not changeable so, okay, you've got the rest of what's going on in the world but, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean there's lots of things you could do that would have some meaning and you obviously can't work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get workman's comp money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, it's the workman's comp but I mean it's not even that, I mean I did go to a couple of the GA meetings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I stopped going because it's like I put myself in an isolated situation again where I feel just safer in my home type deal.  I'm not going to get in any trouble if I'm at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you can't keep that up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but that's, that's where I am.  I mean it was difficult, it was difficult for me to come here because it seems like now I only leave my house if it's absolutely, I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, okay, so you slipped back into that, so you've just got to fight it and got out but not to troublesome stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just stay away from the boats and all, you'll be fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, but I mean I did, I did realize that even though like I'm saying it wasn't the amount of times I went out, I do realize that I do have a problem because to spend that much money in one day on something with hope of, it was almost like a panic, I was panicked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean, all day or after you did it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	While I was there I was panicked, I've got to get this back, I've got to get this back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it just wasn't working that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, never chase.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Certain rules, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't know what snapped in my brain that just went—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to get this back, I'm going to get it back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but your brain is also going, I want that good feeling of winning a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And at the same time, I'll get it back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but when you're down and you continue to go to the ATM machine, that's not a logical thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I told you I had this lady that went to Hardrock for the first time, 22 hours she played the same machine, 22 hours, it's crazy in other words.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it does do something to your brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, but, but is, would you consider this person a normal person, not a person that is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well actually you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is like whacked out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, actually you're a normal person who probably has the genes to become an addicted person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were into an addict thing at that point, I mean, it's like why would somebody go from Cocaine once or twice a week to 3 or 4 times a day, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I mean what that tells you is, just stay away from it, it's too bad you had to find it out the hard way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could have lost more, believe me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Well, I've, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've been there, I like to gamble.  I gamble a lot and I analyze myself a lot when those things are happening and it's, it's fascinating how you can get thinking, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But to me it's almost like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You lost control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Your mind, right, I lost control and it was like, like I'm saying, it was panic mode and I know just, just if I get more money and then I got to the point, I didn't even realize how much money I had—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Taken out because it's like, oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's just a little at a time, you're only really thinking in these little segments of 20, 30 minutes, probably or an hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right, and I did—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I lost all of the money I had in that hour, I'll go get some more and try another hour, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and that's basically what happened.  I mean it wasn't, I 'm thinking I, you know, I mean I kind of consider myself an intelligent person but when it comes to that, I'm not, it's like I'm just a free for all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right, you got it now, you just remember it because that stays there, that's part of your brain, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's what I did learn from the meetings, I also had some books sent to me and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My brother in law has a saying from those meetings, it's where the feet go, the mind will follow, that's a good saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I knew he hadn't gambled in years and I said you want to go to the racetrack with me, you know, sit there and have a beer or something and he goes, no, where the feet go, the mind will follow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay and this is after years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because like at the meetings, [NAME OTHER] has—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He still thinks about it and all, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See but when I think about it, I get, uh, um, in the pit of my stomach it's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but what about 5 years from now, you still have to be on guard, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, because at one of the meetings I was saying, [NAME OTHER] does have a convention coming up in December of all months but he has one in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I said, you know, so this is something I definitely can't go to and they're like, don't say that because December is a long ways away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's not that far away, shit, it's like 60 days or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What if, right, well but this was, this was the first meeting I attended—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said, because this gentleman, of course, he hasn't gambled in 15 years—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he's like, I can, I can walk into any casino and it doesn't, it doesn't phase me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't, I don't know that would be right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe you should probably not go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No and I understand that, that I shouldn't, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe next year you could do something like that but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But basically that's what there is in [DEIDENTIFIED], I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, that's the trouble, you can't walk to your hotel room without seeing it all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're in every hotel, they're in every hotel room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm given so much time on my own, [NAME OTHER]'s in meetings that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The temptation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's not enough there to occupy you all day, every day that wouldn't be gambling, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, no, you walk, you walk out of your hotel room, you go down to the lobby and it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You walk down the street—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's there and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they're right there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think they have them like in a convenience store they even have the little—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, supermarket, everywhere.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The goddamn airport.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, the airport, like uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One time I was $300 ahead, when I get to the airport and the plane got delayed, so I lost all the money back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The same thing happened to us but, fortunately or unfortunately, what everyone will call it, that's, that's what kind of triggered because I won.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well it can, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I really think that that's the worst thing that happened to me is that I won.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know what you've got to do.  Look, I mean basically you're alone, okay, you live with this guy, uh, you want to make it more satisfactory eventually but you've still got to manage your own life, you know, so if he died, you still have to manage your own life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and I mean one of my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do whatever you'd do if he died, maybe that's the way to look at it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't know if I want to say that because if he died, if he died I think I would be out dating and I don't know if [NAME OTHER] would appreciate that advice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you've got to fight this wanting to stay home, yeah, I understand it's kicked in with the stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's more difficult than you think that it is.  It's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we've got the meds kind of maxed out, that's the trouble there.  You're taking 300 Wellbutrin, how about the Xanax?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh my Xanax is my savior.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how many times a day are you taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take it, I take it in the morning and then I take it, now if I'm home, I can just handle taking a couple in the morning but if I'm going out somewhere—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I have to replenish myself on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's okay but, I don't know, you might try just taking it regular, 3 times a day for now and see if that helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just, uh, level things out because yesterday when I went, I went to my son's appointment and granted I took a couple of Xanax in the morning and then we were at the mall, he wanted me to go see his girlfriend at the mall and we went into a store and I was talking to the clerk at the store and all the sudden I felt an anxiety attack coming on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, okay.  Well, let's try to, I'm going to rewrite you the prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why is that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you'll have a little more.  So one, 3 times a day and one as needed.  What's today, 18?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So now this I will just take it in place of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it is like the one you've got I guess but that's about to run out, I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I, well I have, I think I have 2 refills left on that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that should—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So are they just going to put it on file, this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They'll just put on file?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good for 6 months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Um, now as far as, as far as, I mean do you think that it would be helpful if [NAME OTHER] did come in?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah.  Here, sign this thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There and there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  He should talk to somebody.  Just sign them both, it just says—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean you have this line description of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't matter, just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just sign it anywhere.</p>

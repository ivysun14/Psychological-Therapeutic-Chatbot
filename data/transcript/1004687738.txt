<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: What we were talking about on Monday, I found myself doing this exact same thing with James on the phone. It's so crazy. It's so crazy. It was like I was really angry with him and then it just went away. (laughs) After I hung up the phone, that's when I stopped and thought about it and was like, "What just happened here?" I thought about it and it's so strange. What had happened was that he had a really bad day and he said, "Yeah, I just had a bad day." [00:01:06] He didn't want to talk about it. I know from when he has days where he has been sad or depressed or not able to get out of bed, basically, it makes it worse for me to push him on it. He just wasn't saying anything so I was carrying the conversation. It was like talking to a rag doll in some ways. He was trying to participate in some ways but he wasn't going to say, "You know, I'm not doing well. Can we just not talk tonight?" He wasn't going to suggest any topics of conversation. He wasn't going to say, "Okay, I'm tired. Can I go to bed?" He just wasn't doing anything. [00:02:12] I tried to kind of say, "Do you want to talk about it?" or "I'm sorry you had a bad day," and so on. There was just nothing. (pause) It was kind of like only in retrospect I could see that I was really angry there for a second; and then I said, "Why is James doing this?" I said, "James is not doing well. This is how he deals with being sad and he doesn't feel like he can put any pressure on me right now. He's trying to be really careful around me." That pissed me off (laughs) because that's just not viable in the long term. On the other hand it's like, "How dare he make these choices for me?" but it's also, "How dare I make those choices for him?" [00:03:29] Maybe he's right, but that's not what partnership looks like to me. I said, "Okay, why is he doing this? Okay, this is what's going on with him," and it was like, "Ahh, poor James." Then I was like, "Wait. You just did that thing." (laughs) The analysis of it itself was another way it also had the function of distancing me from it. I couldn't get it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:04:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not entirely clear why I should, but—feeling your feelings, whatever—I'm taking it as a positive. (laughs) So, yeah, I still haven't talked with him about this because yesterday he was doing better enough that he did want to talk to me about what he was going through, so we just talked about that. We talked about stuff about Hannah Arendt and Eichmann in Jerusalem, which I read a couple of years ago and he's reading now for the first time. He just checked it out from the library but has read a lot of the criticisms surrounding it. I haven't read any of the criticisms; I just read the original. I just picked it up off of Franco's bookshelf and I thought it was fascinating. I've been talking with James about it. [00:05:31] I think James doesn't know what to do because he feels like the system that he's in is wicked or is evil in some way, that it's a bad system; and doesn't know what he should do within that. He doesn't know if he should apply for this job at Berkeley. I think he seems like he probably isn't going to. At this point, I kind of suspect that James is rationalizing his moods in some ways, but that doesn't mean that the problems are there to work with. He is working in a bad system. He does have some kind of moral obligation there. I don't know what it is. [00:06:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The system you are referring to is the engineering departments in general? His department in particular? </p>

<p>CLIENT: The way that biomechanics research runs in the United States, which is basically entirely government funded—either entirely government funded or administrative; so and most of the industry runs on government grants as well. That's something that I made my peace with and he just keeps running into it. (pause) I don't know what to tell him. I am just kind of the collocation partner saying, "I won't be upset with you if you don't apply for this Berkeley job. I just want you to do something that will make you feel good about what you are doing. Whatever that turns out to be, go for it. We'll figure it out." But this is the way that he deals with being upset, he shuts down. We've talked about it before and we're going to have to keep talking about it. I fill silences with all of the things that I imagine that he could be saying to me, and it's nothing. What he's actually thinking is usually much less cruel to me than what I think he's thinking. (laughs) [00:08:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he shuts down if he's feeling bad, he doesn't say anything and you, in your mind, imagine he's thinking all sorts of bad things about you? That's how you fill the silences?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Both when he's sad and when we're fighting, like when he's upset with me. In this case, I'm just so anxious about burdening him that that is what I was filling that silence with. "I can't turn to you in my time of trouble because it will break you," which may or may not be true. (pause) [00:09:35] So it's a "thing", clearly. (laughs) I know you didn't actually need me to tell you that, but I'm going to anyway. (both laugh) It's very strange. The image in my mind is of the red cloak in front of a bull that draws the attention somewhere else. I don't know who anybody is in that scenario, but that's the image; (both laugh) because it doesn't quite map out as an analogy. Which is the emotion and which is me and which is my mind and which one is James? I'm pretty sure it's not a bull. (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's not the bull. That anger, I think, is the bull. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahh—I think the anger is the red cloak.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the red cloak, I think, is the . . . What? Go ahead. What's your thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think it was because I was thinking of the anger as the other image. It's like a red dot right on the corner of my vision, so then I jump to red cloak in front of the bull. I think you're right. Everything is different. [00:11:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your thought? Your thought is the red dot is sort of in a blind spot, sort of what we were talking about the other day, and then that can be the red cloak.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like it is maybe James is the bull. (laughs) It's like it's waived in front of James and then it's put on me—put on me and I don't even notice because I go from "I am angry at James" to "I am disappointed and sad" to "I am angry at myself" and I don't even notice. That's the problem with writing things down. You come up with images that are very attractive but don't necessarily work. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The difference between your view on this and my view on this is that my view is that these images or fantasies or scenarios work quite well, just unclear how. I mean in the same way that a dream can either not make any sense or really not line up with reality. A better example, a clearer example would be a slip of the tongue. Where you say something and think, "That doesn't make sense. That's clearly not what I meant to say," but at least the idea is; and I guess my opinion would be—I don't think it's always true, though sometimes I think it is—that actually that is what you meant to say, it's just from a point of view that you don't want to have. Is that clear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. [00:13:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess my punch about . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it didn't work aesthetically, it's really just what I predicate. (laughs) I get what you're saying. We're not in a writing workshop. (laughs) Yeah. (pause) [00:13:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Right. The clearest way to me would be that you're the bull, James is the matador, and the cape is this mental sleight of hand that you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And in my mind the matador is my mind and the cape is this trick that it's doing, if that makes sense. My mind does some things separate from my conscious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're worried about goring James with your anger. [00:14:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that you're distracting yourself in the anger in this way, like a cape distracts the bull from goring the shit out of the matador. (chuckles) But you're saying to you it's more like you don't want to gore your mind with the [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:12) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think this is also coming from a not-terribly-clear understanding of how bullfighting works. (laughs) The part that's clear to me is that the person who is maneuvering the cape is that part of my mind that I'm not conscious of, the part that I don't want—or that I do want, clearly, but that I am not necessarily in control of. The other thing I thought of when I thought about being afraid of crushing James was that I had this image of growing very tall like Alice in Wonderland and rampaging along the East Coast and crushing James in the ground. [00:16:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like stomping on him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. It's a lot more troubling for me than it really should be considering all of the movies where giant things stomp on people are pretty funny. (laughs) That is very scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. You know that Mel Brooks quote? Something like, "When I cut my finger, it's tragedy. When I walk into an open sewer and die, that's comedy."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I haven't heard that. I like it, though. I think the connection between us is that if I'm angry and I don't know what to do with it and if I'm angry at somebody else, then I [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:34) James if I'm angry at him. If I'm angry at myself, that just hurts me, which I knew but is still true. (pause) [00:18:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you or both of us are waiting to kick around a little at the moment in trying to think our way through what's going on, rather than looking at what was making you angry at me or him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a little stubborn. (pause) That's very hard. I just get distracted. I hear you like, "Okay, that's what I'm going to do now," and then I just go do something else, like my mind. (pause) I mean, I'm frustrated with you right now because I'm like, "No, the logic works this way," and you're like, "No, it works this way." I'm like, "But it's my image." (pause) [00:20:39] It's also, partially at least, being frustrated with myself because I am really uncomfortable talking about my images or fantasies like this. I find it really difficult so I'm not going to sketch it in; or like it's hard for me to lay it out clearly. So part of me feels like this is you're poking at something I'm not comfortable with, which is fine, but I get upset. For James, he's trying to take care of me but he's isolating me, but I don't want to say or even think that even when you are in trouble and upset and unhappy, you still have to be thinking about me. I don't think that about myself, in that he thinks at least that this is how he copes with being upset. He's not ready to talk about it and I'm angry at him for that, but I don't feel like I should be. (long pause) [00:24:02] I don't know how to get around this because [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:08) like this is more like waiting. It pushes me for a real reason to some extent. I think it may be in a more useful way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:35) (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't like talking about things like images or fantasies. I don't know why. (pause) [00:26:28] Because I think they're hard, even more than most things are viable to misinterpretation, and I don't know who would be doing the misinterpreting, but . . . (laughs) I'm telling you about them because I think that you might be able to see more about them than I do. At the same time, I want to be able to say, "No. That's wrong." So hard. A hard line to walk, I guess. [00:27:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if you want to put it out there, but I also have authorial control over them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that, but I don't really believe in authorial control as a concept anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it's actually something similar with your anger, where each of these things—feeling angry especially—I think what you feel is an irrational amount of fear. To feel that way, or these kinds of images and fantasies, you feel quite exposed and vulnerable and like you've lost real control over yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's easier for me to see that in the latter than in the former. (pause) [00:29:30] When I was in 3rd or 4th grade I wrote a poem. I wrote lots of little poems then. It was published in my school literary journal. I remember it was about a cat. I was really into animals then. A teacher said, "Isn't it about this," like this kind of broader, symbolic thing, and he was like "Cadie Cat is always wanting something different, something more." That was the only line I really remember. I could probably remember more, but that's the one that matters. He was like, "Isn't it about all of us want something outside of ourselves?" I was like, "No. It's about a cat." (both laugh) [00:30:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sir, you are mistaken.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But, yeah, this is fairly scary for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What upset you just then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More the kind of "everything together". I don't know. Clearly, nine-year-old me was mistaken. It was about the fact that I was really unhappy with my life and wanted something better; so I guess thinking that and then thinking that I just do feel so exc . . . (voice trails off) (pause) [00:32:41] This is why I'm not a writer. (laughs) One of the reasons. Did I tell you that my sister-in-law and I have a writing journal? I haven't really written anything for it. I'll probably just journal for now. I don't have any kind of fiction to write or I don't have the mind space for it. One of the things that a friend suggested was, "Write your way through it." That's what some people do. I don't think I'm there yet. (pause) (sniffles) [00:34:02] My roommates are really—I like them a lot—one of them really wants to make me better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is Eric? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Eric. He's the one who the first thing was, "Exercise." He repeated it and then he was like, "Meditation." He was like, "You don't have mindfulness?" I was like, (sigh) "Yes. I have it." (laughs) I feel good about the way I handled it. It was just like, "Eric, you know you don't need to make me better. I'm going to be sad. There's nothing you can do about that. You don't need to fix it. It's okay." I don't really think it sunk in. He also had two turkey burgers and vodka and Sprite for breakfast. (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't sound like a philosopher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's an impolitical philosopher actually. [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:25) He's really sweet. (crying) I don't know how to even begin to explain things to him. It doesn't help that I've been doing really well for the last few days, so he hasn't seen me sad yet. I'm sure this is not a coincidence. Oh, well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you have been keeping it together around them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And new people and stuff. They like me. That's strange. I'm always surprised when people like me. They usually do and I'm always surprised. Is it helpful for you for me to tell you about these things? These images? Is that helpful? [00:37:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniggers)(sniffles) That's not very helpful. (laughs) I guess so. It's not really a question you can answer. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this sort of all relates to—this is going to sound very generic when I say this—the difficulty of free-association, where you're in a struggle over whether to describe things like images. It's like writing to just put things out there that don't seem to fit or don't understand well or don't seem ascribed, or you don't know where they go. I'm exaggerating it a bit, but I think there's probably some truth to that. Then, I think you do something that  ] (inaudible at 00:38:47) which is to deal with the ambiguity and anxiety of that and make it about what I want and what's going to help me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Fair enough. Fair enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My point, of course, isn't to make you feel bad or like you're doing anything wrong, but I think this can be fairly pervasive for you. [00:39:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well just keep telling me about it. I'm just really scared. (voice breaks)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) [Emma and I are going to stop apologizing.] (inaudible at 00:40:07) (laughs) She's even started giving me grief for it, which is helpful actually. Kirsten apologizes even more than I do. I'm just really scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) (sniffles) I guess I don't know. I was going to say there's nothing actually scarier than dying, but I'm not actually sure about that. (laughs) (sniffles) It probably all works out. It's one of those nice things about me that there's a real clarity there. I was like, "Well, these are my choices so, I'm choosing the treatment." (sniffles) I'm doing a little better, quite a lot better now, which is good. The choices aren't always this clear. How are we on time? [00:41:51] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have a few minutes yet. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (voice breaking) I want to hold [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:02) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:42:03) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that is an external cause for constraint.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for calling me on this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really helpful. Most people don't do that. I don't know whether they see it or not, but they don't do it. They don't point it out to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean what you seem to be avoiding or what seems to be uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or the ways in wish I push things back onto you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And why I'm avoiding them so much. Now I'm stuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you not really want to say anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. It's more like I can't think of anything to say that wouldn't be avoiding what's really happening. It would be like, "Well, let's talk about something else." Just that I'm so scared for me. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it's terrifying. I think this has got you down very hard so as not to be so scared of it, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop for now. We can talk some more tomorrow.</p>

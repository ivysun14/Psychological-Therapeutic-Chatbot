<p>This series of six transcripts features a couple, Dennis and Renee.  The following is session #5 of the six sessions.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: So welcome back and check in and see how things feel to you as … how have you been doing? [inaudible] since the last time?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Been doing pretty good. We've been real communicating and being in touch with each other and sharing feelings, and really close this past week. I think we're doing really well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to verify that [inaudible]?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. [inaudible] surprise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a kind of a surprise. How do you account for that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All because of me. Just kidding.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Don't give up your day job. I think it is because we both shared on both sides and for me I know that when Dennis can acknowledge pain for me, what this has caused, then I'm pretty open to being open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like he was sincerely doing that this week?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That was a little different because that seemed like before you really didn't trust who he was.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So could you get a sense of why it seemed different to you at this time he would be more sincere?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think he struggled as much as he usually does. It wasn't where he passively started out at not - either not acknowledging or minimizing him them, when you saw that you weren't, then you move into that. To me it seemed as if you started from a point of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's interesting. It seemed like he didn't struggle so much with those other parts. That he could just go in and listen and then speak about …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: They didn't get in the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You agree that they didn't get in the way the way they usually do?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It seemed that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And because of that, you were able to trust it more?</p>

<p>0:02:16.0</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And respond in a similar way and that felt different to both of you then?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. It sure did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. That angry part of you didn't get in the way too much this week?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm trying to think. At least not for the last few days. On the weekend or anything. I don't think it did. I was in a lot of pain I think over the weekend and you really acknowledged that and were okay with it. Usually I feel like you would want to …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Keep my distance or …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Keep your distance or minimize it or, but you were really supportive this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was different too for Dennis to really be able to be present with you when you were going through that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum. And just to accept it or not. I feel like sometimes you push me away when it's painful.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just by acknowledging it and giving you a hug and telling you I'd be there for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is pretty unusual for you. This sense I get.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a sense of how you were able to do it this differently?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. Just learning the needs, Renee's needs and learning how to respond appropriately and be there for her. Instead of the minimizing that I used to do and that I probably still do, but I'm working on that as I progress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Okay. That all sounds clear now. Last time we talked a lot about your kids and whether or not to talk to them about details.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you reach a conclusion or is that something you want to revisit or where do things stand with that?</p>

<p>0:04:21.9</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It won't hurt to revisit it. Just touch base with you on it and we've been talking about it. I told Renee I feel fairly comfortable with letting them know what's been going on, but exactly telling them what happened with me. I got a little mixed up the other night with where we were on that because we were originally thinking that we were going to tell them that I had an affair. Maybe …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think I want to say it that way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. Well that's what we discussed the other night. I wanted to talk about that again and just kind of reiterate what made the most sense. When we were talking about that, I don't recall exactly how we were going - how I was going to put that, but we did …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The last time that we talked, you didn't think that that would be part of the role-play.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Exactly. I don't recall exactly how I wanted to put that though. I turn a little forgetful. Can you help me with that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: The only word that I had come up with was actually the one that Dick used and that was relationship. That's really … I don't know. I think both of us are still at a loss for how to put it together.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. We are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're still pretty interested in telling them though?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I still am pretty interested in telling them. I am because I still feel that the truth is better. And Max is exhibiting a lot of symptoms of stress. So I think that has to do with what's happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're clear you want to tell them something?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not sure of the right words?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're sort of in the same ballpark on that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh yeah. I guess I don't have a problem with telling them, but I just am not sure the right words to use and when.</p>

<p>0:06:58.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And when.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, last time we had you kind of do a trial and Dennis you listened. How would it be if we tried you just throwing it out and seeing how it went?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: As in talking to Renee like I'm talking to the boys?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Ummm. Well I could try it. Might be a little tough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. If it doesn't work, that's fine. Just see how it goes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Can I do this with the boys are here and you also? I mean [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Let's get down to how it would happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys are setting here together and the boys are here.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: All right. Well, I guess I would start with [inaudible] Max said. You guys know that mom and dad have had problems for several months and I know you think we're getting divorced and you think that in the back of your mind. We want to talk to you guys about several things and mom and dad have been working on our marriage and rebuilding it, and making it stronger than it's ever been. And going to continue to do that. More than anything, we want you guys to know that we will love you and we'll always be there for your needs. We want to share several things with you tonight.</p>

<p>Mom and dad still love each other. There have been problems in the past with dad and the business over the last couple of years, and building the business and working in Harper [ph] Leather. Mom and dad have through those several years maybe distanced themselves. We've grown apart a little bit, not totally, but we've been disconnected a little bit. Over that time period, something had happened where dad got involved with another person, another woman and never told mom about that. Mom found out and I hurt her tremendously, and I feel very bad about that. I hurt mom terribly and that's why we're going to counseling. That's why we're rebuilding our marriage relationship. 0:10:08.3</p>

<p>That's something we think that you guys need to know because it may help you guys when you get married. We want to be truthful and honest with you guys. You know that that's a hard thing for me to tell you and I never wanted to hurt mom, but I did. I let this get out of control and if you have any questions, you can ask and I'll try to answer them. Mom and dad still love each other, and we're going to make our family stronger than it ever was. Someone needed to tell you. I needed to tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's that feel?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It feels - I feel pretty good about saying that. Being honest for this situation. How did it feel to listen to?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I thought he did a really good job. I feel pretty comfortable with that. I think probably it's something that I think that they need to know is that that involvement is over.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That might be something really important.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Good point.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because that …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Can we go now? (laughter)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Can I [inaudible] you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you did a nice job too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thank you. More with that or should we find something else?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think the only - maybe one other thing and that is that maybe we should bring the word trust in. I don't know if this is right to do, but you have to rebuild their trust [inaudible]. So I think that they need to hear that. That will give them some words to use.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [inaudible] the trust.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think you did a really nice job.</p>

<p>0:12:39.6</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What should we do now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Where do we go?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you had some questions about the future. Well, I mean I'm impressed by what you've done so far. I think you've got a long way to go. There's a lot to repair and you sort of got a nice running start on that. But I would stick with it. I would keep [inaudible]. Whatever arrangement, you're seeing somebody else. Is that right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think it's important to keep this kind of going where you're talking with each other in the same room. I also think it's good to keep working with these parts we've identified. You know I was real impressed to hear that you're not doing the minimizing as much. With the little work you did do, you were able to get him to step back, the confused part and all that stuff. So I would really encourage you to keep it up. Beyond that, I don't know. Do you have other questions about this?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [inaudible] mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About this topic. About the future.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess maybe - I guess I think we still - I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When is it appropriate? [inaudible]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh you mean telling the kids?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When will it be appropriate?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. When we're more comfortable to tell them or what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What do you think? What feels right to you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: About ten years. (laughter). Just kidding. I guess I'd be ready at any time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Then I think of the opposite end of the spectrum. I still have a little fear about telling them.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No hurry. We know we're not going to tell them until after the holidays. So I guess that's something we'll have to figure out and just talk about. Right?</p>

<p>0:15:20.6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I like what you said about how you've been able to talk about this on your own son. I like the way you worked on it together. So I feel like I can trust you to find the right time. I think you know your kids. You both obviously are very invested parents and you have good instincts. So I am going to trust those instincts about that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We agree.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's nice to hear. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hum. Anything else about the true stuff?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think just for me I think knowing, putting more of the pieces together of what happened. That's important. I've been talking with Dennis a lot about how important it is for me to have affirmation and to kind of actually map the whole thing out and to understand my own parts, as well as his parts in what happened. Just to understand that it just makes it easier for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do some more of that tonight?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. If we can. I'd like to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We have some time. Okay. Do you want to talk to each other about that or do you want to look inside and see what parts are involved? How would you like to do that?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We've been working with that with Cecile a little bit. So, I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Direction? No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Preference on how you want to do it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Uh uh. Why don't we start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We start with you talking to each other and Renee since you brought it up, why don't you take the lead and see what you need in the way of more detail.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>0:17:28.7</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess I - well first I appreciate you doing the - you know, figuring out the dates for me. Everything that helps. I guess the stuff that I need to know would be what you were thinking and what you were feeling. Maybe like some of your feelings - what was happening that year. I did a calendar of what my feelings were and …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What was happening at that time when it started?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Before that. Six months before that or weeks before that. All the events that were happening.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, things were just busy in general before this happened and that's about it. With our lifestyles. With family activities and church, and all the regular stuff. My job and the PV casing and the business thing. It's just a busy time in my life, as well as ours as a family. You know we were disconnected for many times and I have a hard time remembering and/or realizing that, but I'm sure it was true. I was just so good at minimizing and shutting things out that I probably was disconnecting. Just didn't realize it.</p>

<p>As far as when this all happened, when it went down, it just kind of hit me like a ton of bricks I guess when this woman was attracted to me. I look back and I'm just kind of dumbfounded that it happened and I'm ashamed that it happened. I mean I just look back and I never have had anybody in my whole life that attracted me other than you. I don't mean that in a bad way. It sounded bad, but I don't mean that in a bad way. Before you, I've never had any situation where I had someone that interested in me. And during that time with our disconnection and so forth, I kind of just let things happen and I shouldn't have.</p>

<p>I told you many times that the time that I spent with this person, I reiterated that I was very much in love with you and I don't know why I wanted to be with this person. And things had happened and I just felt bad for this person because she had a crummy life and what have you. One thing led to another and I just don't know why I couldn't say no. I'm so mad about that and ashamed because I wasn't able to look at the consequences and what could happen to my family and you. I wasn't smart enough to look ahead. It's just like I'm not smart enough now to look ahead.</p>

<p>I wasn't smart enough to look ahead at this business thing and what would happen with my friendship with my best friend, and ruined. So it's kind of a similar thing, why I didn't have enough [inaudible] look ahead at that. I just figured, “Ah, it'll be okay”. Silly, but what can I say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible] see how Renee's reacting.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's pretty hurtful to hear that you didn't have anybody that attracted to you. You said in that way before and each time I hear that, it does hurt.</p>

<p>0:21:59.1</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Say some more about what hurts about hearing that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I still feel like I was interested in you, although I recognized that I pulled away. I was telling you about the pattern that I see. If I feel that you're disconnected from me, then I'm very fearful and then not only do I disconnect from you, but I disconnect from myself. So it's not exactly like I can see how you would have the affair. I still think there were other options, but I can see that in our own ways when we were looking for each other and missing the mark. So I feel pretty sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Thanks. Would you like to work with that sadness?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess it will be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So go ahead and find it [inaudible].</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I would say that it's in my throat and like across here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]? So focus there. So you get a pretty good sense and apply.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's kind of interesting. I feel like it could be called a veil of tears that I [inaudible] study for. That was about that time. So I think I felt really alone then. I was really fearful about the kids, about the pedophile in our neighborhood. The breast biopsy. So it was a really fearful time and I didn't feel like I could retool or that you could retool. I felt really alone already. I think in my head I see it almost like this small little dot over here and all the rest of my life is over here. And it was hard for me to feel like I could protect the kids and it was hard for me to feel like - I think being in control. I think I had a hard time feeling like I was in control.</p>

<p>When I'm disconnected from myself, it's really hard. I think that [inaudible] really solid based for me. If I feel the connection with you, then I can do a lot of things. I remember writing a letter to you about that. About all the things that I can do, the volunteer work and the studio work, and the kids, and the house. All those things I can do if I [inaudible] to you and I feel your support. If I don't, then pretty much I feel like my world falls apart. I don't really - it's hard for me to keep it together. I feel like I look back at that and I feel like there was disgust [inaudible] how I felt.</p>

<p>I know that I disconnected from you. There was a part of me that feels like I wanted to connect really bad with you, but there was a part in me I know that was disconnected from you. When I was afraid to reach out …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I wish I would have kept the journal because I know there were plenty of times where - that you made me angry. I just don't remember specifically. But I just can't remember if there were times where we were disconnected and you were disconnected from me, as well as me to you. You know. I mean I think it was for both of us that way. Maybe that was part of our drifting apart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are times where you sense Renee's being consumed with the experience and she's not really available. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Specifically I can't get specific on that, but I just think there were times when you shut me out. And probably because I did the same to you. Maybe just like not being there or …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: There were a lot of angry type of things in my journal. A lot of angry times and I didn't feel hurt and I didn't feel supported. [inaudible] tested for HIV and I feel like you minimized that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Probably there's some truth to that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it sounds like there were a lot of things going on and you were having to deal with them primarily. And Dennis was consumed with his work and …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I opened the blister not supporting what she was doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would come and look for help, and he would do the minimizing and then you would feel pushed away. And then you'd try and handle it on your own, but you had to disconnect to no-anchor kind of feeling because he's your anchor. And then it just kind of escalated. Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sound right to you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does this help to go through some of these details?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. You know, for us to look at the past and understand what happened. Sure. It's interesting. I don't really have specific memories about it though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm that way too. My memory is a total sieve.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mine was too, but I journaled my crazy. I have books over just the last year. So that does help, because I don't think I would remember all the parts either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So it sounds like also then if you can maintain this shift, where you're no longer minimizing, you're much better able to be present when Renee's upset. And you're not so afraid of her anger that you won't really talk about your feelings. Sounds like you're more in touch with your feelings.</p>

<p>0:29:28.8</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would go a long way to prevent something like that happening again. It sounds like.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'm not sure how much time we have left. But we've got a little time left here. So why don't you each take a little reading inside with this conversation. Just take a second and focus inside and see how your body is feeling as you talk like this. Looks like you don't know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. I'm very - listen to every word.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Very calm and comfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So just focus inside for a second and see how that for you Renee, how that sad part is still there. If you want to say anything more. And Dennis, how your different you know when you talk about your shame. See if there is anything more that needs to be said from inside your bodies.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I think I have fear now that goes from here to about here. And I think I - you mentioned of being angry. That I'd go away to the workshop.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I mentioned that, but I was a little confused and mixed up about that. I think I might have been anxious more than angry, you know, before you went. But once you were there, I started to think it was fine and I think that I was excited for you, happy for you. Really. I mean I might not have showed it or told you that. I'm glad you can do things like that. They're healthy for you. Make you feel good about yourself. I know I mixed you up a little bit there. Didn't I?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I'm just wondering because it's kind of - when I came home, it was when you started the affair. So I'm wondering if there's a connection there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um um.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean we did go through HIV and breast biopsy and the pedophile and our 15th wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>0:32:10.6</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. My mom's birthday or whatever.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That was after though. I mean that was during …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [inaudible]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's just take a second and check in there and see if there is anything about what Renee is saying about - this would be jealousy or ???</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there was anything about her g

oing to this workshop that that was triggering for you?
MALE CLIENT: No. I think, just think - I just think the time was in general, we were so busy and hectic. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with what had happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the more general fear would be that if you continue to shine and to create that would bother Dennis?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Actually it's more about to me, it's more about that I'm able to do what I need to do for myself. I think that I hear that you don't take care of yourself. I mean I think that you were able to go away before and you took time to do that. Now the role kind of shifted and …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not taking care of myself. I haven't been.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is the fear that Dennis would resent the fact that you do or …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Resent or being jealous. Because I think I might hear some of that in your voice when you …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Talk about it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Or sometimes when you say … yeah. Maybe that. Or sometimes when you say, “I don't have any friends.” You'll make it in a joking way, but underneath I think that it sounds like wishing you didn't' attend to your friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think there's some truth to that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I just the last several years with this new business I had not been taking care of myself. As far as things I like to do, which are minimal, but regardless. The things I used to do, I don't do anymore. I plan to change that eventually. When, I don't know. I can't right now.</p>

<p>0:34:49.9</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're encouraging Dennis to try and take care of himself.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I do. Encourage [inaudible]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's always encouraging when I came to [inaudible]. You know, problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're also worried that if he doesn't, that it would get in the way [inaudible]?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. And just cause another big …</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Rift.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. Another rift.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think there's some potential in that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't believe him?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No. Because you're saying …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel very comfortable. I'm very relaxed. This makes me warm. We're sharing, having a nice conversation. No. I'm serious. I mean, that's my - I'm saying that from my heart.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's very nice. That's very generous. I think about I - I feel bad for you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks. Feel bad for me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's nice for Dennis to hear that I guess. That's a different issue than what he resents you taking care of yourself.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>0:36:34.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just check with that fear now and see what it's doing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's a little less. It's just here. I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just try. Just focus on to see what that is. See what that wants you to say for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it might still be what I am afraid of and [inaudible] still afraid of having an affair. I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I understand why you feel that way. From what happened. Something like that doesn't go away over night. So I just have to be there for you and we have to just work at our marriage like we've been doing and keep it open. I know you don't feel that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want you to focus on that part to see if it feels possible that you will come to a point where you won't worry about that so much. Maybe you can ask what it might take for that to be the case.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I guess it would be that you would be finding a balance into the affair yourself, as well as taking care of me and taking care of the kids.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it feels like Dennis not taking care of himself in general will make him more vulnerable to being lured by something like that? That makes sense. Does that make sense to you, Dennis?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it would actually be reassuring for you to see him doing things he enjoyed?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I think that's something to keep talking about, to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's that part doing now?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A little better.</p>

<p>0:38:50.0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Better?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's got a strangle hold.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We don't have a whole lot of time left, but I wanted to just check with that angry part of you and see how it's doing. The kind of closeness that's happening here. If it's okay with …</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. I think actually it's kind of taken a step back. The fear part is there. I think I use angry to cover up the fear. And Dennis you've been more open to hearing that I'm fearful and more accepting that I'm fearful and being vulnerable. So it's [inaudible] I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the part doesn't feel the need to get in Dennis' face and getting attention? Does that sound right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. That does sound right. You know how you helped the other night? I asked you to give me the dates and write them down, and then we had that nice conversation. Even though it was really intense. I think you did a very nice job there. We talked about it and we shared more about the affair and even though it was hard to hear, I was able to tell you that it was important for me to know the details and it was important for me to know this because it made me feel less separate from you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So that was really helpful. And I didn't [inaudible]. And we actually even joked about a few things.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Now what really [inaudible]. It's a first huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like that was a good …</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Big step.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Step. Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: A very big step.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Okay. Anything else before we stop tonight? You and I are clean from last time?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You probably get the second time than having it again, I'll probably say it a lot faster.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear that. Good.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: When are we going to eat?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, like you said, we'll have one more session. Feels like you've come a distance. That's good. Today it felt good to me. It's also important for me to say that sometimes after it's been really bad and maybe you get a little bit closer, you get a little hope, there are these protective parts that are going to look for any false moves on the other person's part. Do you know what I mean? They might jump in to try and protect you. So sometimes when you get close like that, you get your hopes up, but the next little spat sends you reeling back almost to where you started. I'm not saying it's going to happen. I just want to prepare you, to warn you that that potential is there and just to keep an eye on that. And if it did happen, you aren't back where you started. It just feels that way for a temporary period. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [inaudible] yesterday too. Buckle up, honey. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Buckle that seat belt. But on the other hand, I get this sense you're over a couple of the humps. Particularly these minimizing parts, the confused part.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you can stay present in the way you have been, I think it will go a long way to preventing something like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's really been a really welcoming change.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is new in your relationship in general, to have Dennis this available.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's great.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're making good use of this crisis. Okay?</p>

<p>0:43:44.6</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Good luck tonight.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

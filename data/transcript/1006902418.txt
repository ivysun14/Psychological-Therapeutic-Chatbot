<p><b>Jon Carlson Interview regarding Client KB</b></p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> I use an integrative approach to helping based upon the theory of Alfred Adler’s Individual Psychology. These theoretical ideas allow me to focus on the strengths of each client and to help them to develop the courage needed to bring more satisfaction into their lives. I often find myself helping the client or giving permission to the client to continue to do the types of things they are already doing. This often involves helping the client become more present and aware of what they are doing, thinking and feeling. I place a premium on satisfying relationships especially with the key people in the client’s life.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Will you provide a brief description of your training and background? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> My formal education includes two earned doctoral degrees. One degree was in counseling and the other in clinical psychology. I also have a Certificate in Psychotherapy, which is the Adlerian equivalent of psychoanalytic training. My informal training comes from developing over 300 training tapes with the leading psychotherapists where they worked live with actual clients. By watching and discussing the multiple sessions that each expert conducted I was able to indirectly hone my own skills in assessment and intervention.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The client was a 43 year-old female who was currently living with her parents. She has been married to her husband for 12 years and known him for 25 years. They have lived nearby one another but apart for five years and continue to have regular time together. She stated that, “This arrangement decreases our arguments.” She reports being very close to her sister and her four children. Her sister is 2 years older and in her 4th marriage.  KB also reported that she has had two DUI’s and indicates that she drinks too much and too often. This was the only session as the client did not return for future sessions.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  What was your goal or hope for the sessions? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The clients goals for counseling were to: move in with her husband and get along; create a better relationship with her father who believes that KB and her mother are too close; and to develop a means to supplement her income.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> Success comes in many packages for me. Therapy can be successful if I feel a collaborative relationship with the client. Sometimes I feel success when I help the client achieve a goal that they have set. While other times therapy is successful if I just honor and accept the client and their story. KB currently seems to be in denial and needs to address the severity of her alcohol use. I had hoped to work with her on this and other issues but she cancelled four appointments before finally indicating that she was not ready for therapy at this time in her life and wanted her file closed.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The intake session seemed to go fine. There were not any successes or breakthroughs other than her honesty and openness.  It took KB several weeks of making and cancelling appointments before finally closing her file. This would seem to indicate that a treatment alliance was created but it was not sufficient enough to compete with the appeal of alcohol.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The psychotherapy took place in an outpatient psychotherapy clinic in southern Wisconsin. The client indicated she sought treatment for what she stated was depression and later indicated was to deal with her past and present issues.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> This client is a good example of many of the clients who go to treatment looking for a magical cure and discover that relief will require a significant change in her lifestyle. Although she was intelligent enough to realize what needed changing, she was unwilling to face these issues directly at this time in her life. It is likely that things will need to get worse before she will make treatment a priority. </p>

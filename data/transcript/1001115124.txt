<center><P><b>Session Transcript</b></P></center>

<P>TH 1: Okay, I just know the barest of details about your situation. You have been together for twelve years.</P>
<P>M1 1: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 2: And you, aside from the relationship, have a business together. And it's a landscaping business.</P>
<P>M1 2: Primarily.</P>
<P>TH 3: And why don't we just start fresh then, how you see the situation.</P>
<P>M1 3: Well, actually, I think it's kind of an odd situation because we initially contacted this facility because we thought we needed counseling because we were under real stressful times. We were busy, very busy, and really had no time, no relaxation, no recreation whatsoever, and so Allan thought it would be a good idea to see a counselor because we have gone through couples counseling before but discovered that really what we needed was individual help at that time which progressed, we progressed a lot with, so . . .</P>
<P>TH 4: Seeing a therapist separately?</P>
<P>M1 4: Right.</P>
<P>TH 5: I see.</P>
<P>M1 5: Right, and so he said he thought now we should try this again and go into some couples counseling. So, after he called and found out that not until fall would there be anything available, we slowed down quite a bit, and things seemed much easier in our relationship. We just had a lot of conflict, and we are really just mostly stressed out more than anything. But, um so we came for the interview anyway because then suddenly it was time, and we both thought it would be just a good thing to do anyway because I think we have conflict sometimes with communication, either a lacking of it, or we are not understanding one another. You know we have these routines where we tend to interpret what the other person is saying incorrectly. So that's really what we came for. And though I don't think either one of us feel like there is anything pressing we needed to resolve, I thought it would be good because when we had gone to couples counseling initially what I really thought was beneficial was we did these communication exercises. Where our counselor would kind of um mediate. He would listen to what I say and then have Allen tell me what he heard, and I thought that was very useful and very helpful with Allen in particular because when there was a third party present he could see where sometimes he says one thing when he is meaning another. And it helped a lot.</P>
<P>TH 6: So right now we have the luxury of not having something pressing.</P>
<P>M1 6: Right.</P>
<P>TH 7: And the external pressure of the outside stress is reduced for right now. I wonder what might to useful to take advantage of that to kind of, I don't know, Monday morning quarterback a little bit what's been going on and see what's been useful, and what you might want to consider working on. Um...helpful to me if you would is give me a recent example of the kind of communication difficulties that sometimes arise.</P>
<P>M1 7: Well, it sounds oversimplified I think, but actually it's just that Allen doesn't concentrate on what he is saying. He is thinking about what he is going to say next, and so he might say white when he means black, and I am very literal. I think he means what he says, and when I am second guessing trying to figure out what he is trying to communicate, then it causes all these arguments because he doesn't want to take responsibility for having said what he didn't mean to say. So we argue over those kinds of things, and it's all real petty stuff, but it becomes kind of monumental because it happens so continually, and when we are real busy, then we are just kind of comparing notes and doing our work and trying to get the bare essentials that we need to communicate to one another said, and then often times that turns out to be that we didn't do that well enough.</P>
<P>TH 8: Now, I understand that you work together, and you live together. Are we talking primarily about personal kinds of things or about work kinds or things?</P>
<P>M1 8: I would say both, yeah.</P>
<P>TH 9: Can you think of an example that might be a small enough kind of an issue so that this pattern, this process gets to be the issue and not the details of it. Some of these things are trivial, but they are ongoing.</P>
<P>M1 9: Right. Well, I can think of one just on the way here this evening. We were talking about a job we are doing tomorrow, and I asked Allen well what exactly are we doing with this lady, because it was a job that we had bid in the spring and she didn't want to do it until fall, and he said well we have to plant these shrubs. It's really only one variety of shrub, and we are going to remove what's existing and put in some edging, mulch it, and that's basically it other than transplanting what we removed. I said oh, okay. That doesn't sound so bad. And he said then there's ajuga and seda, and he started listing other things. And I said well wait. We only are selling one plant material. We only are doing the shrubs we talked about. No there's ajuga and then there's the next thing. And he says no there isn't ajuga. I don't know what he is talking about. I'd like to know because I'd like to be prepared for what we are going to do, but I find that it's easier to just wait until the date because he is taking care of the details of this one. I'm really just doing the labor. I'll wait until we get there and do what needs to be done, but it causes frustration and causes us to bicker because he is saying one thing and then the next moment he is saying another one, and then he just smiles like that was funny. He doesn't see the frustration.</P>
<P>TH 10: Um hmm so is it that he is thinking out loud . . .</P>
<P>M1 10: I don't know what it is. I don't understand it. I think that he's thinking out loud. I think he has a habit of thinking out loud, yes. I think that Allen is not a real committing person. You know when you ask him, if I ask him what do you want to do, he will name the options to me, but he doesn't tell me what he wants to do. He's not decisive. So, he gives me all the information that I'm already aware of, but I still don't know where he stands. So that's a kind of a conflict that we have.</P>
<P>TH 11: Now, you've been together twelve years.</P>
<P>M1 11: Yeah, twelve or thirteen.</P>
<P>TH 12: Despite this style on his part, how have you managed to go, I mean that's an accomplishment for anybody to go twelve or thirteen years or ten years?</P>
<P>M1 12: I think we have a great relationship. I don't feel like it's a struggle other than that. And again, I think that's petty. It's not a high concern. I told Allen when we first started this, I don't really know what we are here for. I hope we are not wasting other people's time. I don't feel like anything is broken that needs fixing. I just think it's a good maintenance thing.</P>
<P>TH 13: Sounds like maintenance improvement.</P>
<P>M1 13: Right. Overall I think we have a wonderful relationship.</P>
<P>TH 14: It sounds like you have some insight into this process. Do you have any sense that he does?</P>
<P>M1 14: I don't know. I think so. I think he does, but I think Allen is more resistant. I remember when we first saw a counselor, I was excited. I thought it was going to be a lot of fun because it was something we were doing just for us, and he was dreading it. He thought that I didn't have any idea what I was getting into and that it was going to be miserable, but he had a lot of secrets, and so I think it was a whole lot more painful for him - I don't know if I think it was more painful for him than it was for me, but he had a lot of owning up to do that he wasn't wanting to.</P>
<P>TH 15: But he went ahead with it.</P>
<P>M1 15: Right.</P>
<P>TH 16: Now would he be surprised to, if he heard you give this example, that . . .</P>
<P>M1 16: I don't think so.</P>
<P>TH 17: So he might not even recognize that there is a communication difficulty?</P>
<P>M1 17: Do I think he would recognize it was a communication difficulty? Ohyeah. I have articulated that over and over again.</P>
<P>TH 18: So he is aware of that?</P>
<P>M1 18: I think he is fully aware of how I feel and how I perceive this.</P>
<P>TH 19: And what would be his interpretation if he were here just to either agree or dispute yours?</P>
<P>M1 19: I think, I think he is impatient with me for not just understanding what he means. He expects me, I believe he expects me to just understand his ways and be able to fill in the blanks and decipher which of the things he really meant, and I think that it mildly amuses him that it is such a struggle. And I think he gets frustrated and angry too because he thinks that I am just being a stickler and wanting him to use the right words, and that's not exactly the case.</P>
<P>TH 20: I see. So he doesn't always get that there is a real communication problem rather than just trying to correct the way that he speaks to you.</P>
<P>M1 20: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 21: It sound like, though, that he has a lot of confidence in a basic understanding that you have with him.</P>
<P>M1 21: Well, essentially, we always want the same thing. We go about it in completely different ways, but you know with our work, we both have the same vision on what we should do. But I kind of lost track there. You asked . . .</P>
<P>TH 22: Well, behind the idea gee, you must understand me, you are just correcting the way I talk to you, seems to me the assumption that he can trust you knowing him quite well.</P>
<P>M1 22: Yeah, I think so.</P>
<P>TH 23: He has a lot of confidence in the fact that he is known quite well.</P>
<P>M1 23: Right. And because otherwise our relationship is really good, and thisdoesn't seem to be monumental, so he doesn't want to bother with it, I think.</P>
<P>TH 24: If I asked him what the most pressing problem was, what would he say?</P>
<P>M1 24: I think that he thinks I am too short tempered. Probably that I need tocontrol that. I think that really bothers him because I do get real short tempered.</P>
<P>TH 25: With him or in general?</P>
<P>M1 25: With people I am close to. Not with the public.</P>
<P>TH 26: Does he feel that he gets the brunt of it? Does he get it more than most people?</P>
<P>M1 26: I don't know if he thinks he gets that more than someone else very close to me. My mother is a real close friend to both of us, and so she does a lot of things with us, and I think he thinks she probably gets it as much. I'm not saying I don't do it. I do. I am very short tempered. Um and I don't know that it's in any way related to Allen and communication. I find I'm less tolerant of things. In more recent years I just want, I am the kind of person that wants to make decisions and move on. I don't want to dwell on things that are difficult, and I think that's when I get short tempered. Like for instance, in my mother's life she has this ongoing turmoil with my next brother, my little brother. There are three of us. And I get frustrated because I hate to see her struggle. I hate to see how he uses her, and I hate to keep talking about it if we are not going to do anything about it. And I become very short and tense over it. And I resent that it interferes with my relationship with her, and I can't do anything about it. I feel like there is nothing I can do.</P>
<P>TH 27: Now if I asked him to give a recent example where this was mostly a personal issue between the two of you, what would he come up with?</P>
<P>M1 27: You mean where I am short tempered? That kind of a thing?</P>
<P>TH 28: Yes.</P>
<P>M1 28: I'm not sure.... I know I was angry enough recently. I just don't remember when or what about. You know what happens actually in our relationship with this? I see nothing wrong with being angry. I am going to get angry about things, and I see nothing wrong with letting it out. Allen often times tells me that when I am angry like that, he feels responsible. He feels like I am pinning it on him, and he says he thinks it's because his father always did that. His father might break a tool, and it's Allen's fault. Allen also suppresses his anger. He lets it show in different ways. Real convoluted ways that you don't realize what's going on until you step away from it and you think, ah, he's mad. But he doesn't want that to show, and so he is acting squirrely, you know? So, I don't recall a recent instance because I'm mad at the time.</P>
<P>TH 29: In a sense there is no big deal to it. You are angry. You expressed it and that was the end.</P>
<P>M1 29: Yeah, I've always done that. And I know it's a problem for Allen. I think that it makes him real nervous. He always says he expects like his father, the next thing he might get hit. Well, he doesn't expect that from me, but that's what anger is to him. He is going to be hurt. And so it's difficult because I just want to fly off the handle, get it our of my system, and be done. And I probably did that several times in the past week.</P>
<P>TH 30: How would he know that it wasn't personal, that he wasn't responsible?</P>
<P>M1 30: I think he has to pay attention. I don't think he does. I think that he plays these same old routines, you know. He hears tension in my tone. He hears that I'm angry, and he associates all sorts of other baggage from way back with that, and that's what he is consumed by rather than the problem at hand. There are times where he will allow me to do that and I can tell he is. He is giving me space. He is totally silent and backs away, and I don't know what he does. But those times that he can tell . . .</P>
<P>TH 31: That would be a useful example to work from a time when indeed that's what he did. That you are allowed to vent. He saw that it wasn't personal, and not only were you able to get on with things, but he was able to get on with things, the day, whatever, without feeling that tension.</P>
<P>M1 31: Oh, I'm sorry to be so blank about specifics.... Shoot. I observe him do it, and I know he's done it really recently too, but I don't know that the example was because like I say, again, I am angry about it at the time and then it kind of passed, and it doesn't mean much to me, so I don't recall.</P>
<P>TH 32: Any sense of contribution that you might make when he is successfully able to negotiate these situations? Anything that you might do that aids him in doing that?</P>
<P>M1 32: To help him to do that?</P>
<P>TH 33: Yeah, that you might have done . . .</P>
<P>M1 33: Well, what I try to do, and I was saying it today, this wasn't about anger. It was just about being generally... I have a tendency to worry a lot. I worry about money, and I worry about getting things done, and so I try to articulate that to him, but I preface it by saying I don't want you to think you need to solve this for me. I just need to get this off my chest. I need to know that you are aware of our financial situation and that you are not feeling free to spend whatever we want to on anything for pleasure because I kind of manage the money. So, I preface it by saying don't try to erase this. Don't try to fix it and tell me I don't need to feel this way. Just listen to me, and try to understand how I feel so that I know that you are sharing that same information. That's what I try to do, and sometimes that works.</P>
<P>TH 34: That kind of communication, that's a real achievement for anybody. Is it often you are able to talk with that clarity? That's a real accomplishment.</P>
<P>M1 34: I think it is. I find it saves a lot of time in the long run. But it depends on how things unfold. Sometimes I might become upset about something and don't have the time to think about how I am going to be taken, I just sound off.</P>
<P>TH 35: I mean to put it simple. There are times when you want to be able to communicate with a certain indelicacy, and you'd just as soon that he not take it personal.</P>
<P>M1 35: Right. I want to address my own needs, not be thinking about what he is doing.</P>
<P>TH 36: So, maybe I'm moving too quickly, um but am I right in that you would feel comfortable, more comfortable if some situation could occur in which you were able to be upset, he was able to hear you out, not problem solve, and not take it personal.</P>
<P>M1 36: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 37: That would be a mark of some improvement.</P>
<P>M1 37: Progress. Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 38: I see.</P>
<P>M1 38: Definitely.</P>
<P>TH 39: Now, I'm just wondering again having talked to him. Would he see it as a mark of some progress if he were able to think aloud, to show you a first draft of his thoughts and not confuse you with this is the final, this is what he thinks. This is what he needs.</P>
<P>M1 39: I don't know. I don't know if that's something he is doing because he needs to or if it's just he doesn't understand what I may have asked. See Allen has said in the past, different counselors have asked even, do you need more time apart? Do you want some private time to do your own thing? And I can always see him kind of hesitate on that one. He thinks maybe he does, but then he says but I don't know what for. I can't imagine what I'd do or what I am going to do. I enjoy being with you. We have a lot of things in common. But I do find that Allen does like to tune out. He likes to not, I tend to be very analytical. I'm very critical of myself, and I do talk about that a lot. I try to bounce my perceptions off him and say do you think that I'm see this very clearly? And I think there are times when he doesn't pay attention or he doesn't listen, where he might, I'm thinking if this is similar to when he wants to think out loud, that kind of a thing. He wants to tune me out at those times. But he doesn't want to just say so. I could deal with that if he'd say I don't want to deal with this now, but he doesn't. Instead he tries to convince me that he is tuned in, and he's not.</P>
<P>TH 40: I'm wondering though,again I may be simple minded on this point and giving him more credit than he deserves on it, but I am wondering are those times when he seems tuned out. Is he being thoughtful about what you are saying?</P>
<P>M1 40: I don't know.</P>
<P>TH 41: He's locked into something that you've said.</P>
<P>M1 41: I don't know because a lot of times different things we will discuss. He says I need to think about that. But I've never known him to come back and say okay. Now I've thought about that, and here's what I think.</P>
<P>TH 42: So that would be something different.</P>
<P>M1 42: Right.</P>
<P>TH 43: That gave you some evidence that he wasn't spaced out. That in fact he was pondering, locked into something that you had said earlier and tuned into that.</P>
<P>M1 43: Right. I just was talking to him about an example today about my mother. He is always trying to organize my mother, tell her that she should keep track of the earnings she makes on the side and that when things aren't as good that she can reflect on that and know that it's going to get better again. You'd have some record of what you'd earned, and I said yeah, but sheis 71: years old. She is real set in her ways. She is not worried about it like you and I are. And you are trying to apply your system, you know, impose that on her, and it's not going to work. I tell you. It's like beating your head against a wall. I think it's a good suggestion, but I think you need to do it yourself if that's what you want because it is your needs you are serving, and, um I'm sorry. I get distracted, and I can't think where I was going with that. But I can't relate that to what I was saying now.</P>
<P>TH 44: In terms of his style.</P>
<P>M1 44: Yes. Oh, oh. After I told him that, he said you know, I'll have to thinkabout that. And I can't help but think right away. I'll never hear about that again.</P>
<P>TH 45: I see.</P>
<P>M1 45: I know if he is going to think about it, he might. I don't know, but . . .</P>
<P>TH 46: So if you had a sense that some of the things you said weren't going into a, sort of out into space into a black hole, that they would come back to you . . .</P>
<P>M1 46: I think that when it calls for a lot of reflection that Allen is overwhelmed, and I don't think maybe he really does think about it. I think that means, what he is really saying is I need some space now. This is getting a little uncomfortable, and I don't think he is really going to think about it.</P>
<P>TH 47: I see. So you feel it may get dropped at that point.</P>
<P>M1 47: Yeah. I don't know if it will ever be brought up again.</P>
<P>TH 48: I see. You know, one philosophy is if it's not broke right now, we won't fix it. The other is it doesn't have to be broke to improve things, and I kind of got a sense of wanting to check it out with you that you more operate in thesecond category that there is a chance to improve some things particular in the sense that you have gotten through a period of stress, and we have the luxury of kind of reflecting on things. Suppose though, as a part of any time you do some improvements, that it is a matter of some things having to get, there is a bit of disruption. I don't know, just to give you an example, getting my floors done. It means that I have to live with a lot of mess with the hope that that's what you have to do to get your floors done. I am wondering if you would be interested in thinking about the relationship the same way that you would be willing to have some of these incidents occur. In your case specifically instances in which you looked for the opportunity for you to be upset about something and for you to announce that you are being upset, and you were not asking him to solve it, and you were hoping that he wouldn't take it personal and were able to focus on those things and maybe even not go out of the way to avoid them. Would that be an okay way to proceed?</P>
<P>M1 48: I think so.</P>
<P>TH 49: Things are at a stage right now where you would be willing to add that?</P>
<P>M1 49: Yeah, yeah . I think that happens anyway.</P>
<P>TH 50: Sure. And for his part, if he had something comparable that he wanted, again I can't second guess him, you would be willing to endorse episodes,incidents, you otherwise wouldn't be having.</P>
<P>M1 50: Right.</P>
<P>TH 51: All again with the idea that if things aren't broke we can still work on improving them.</P>
<P>M1 51: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 52: Well, then if it's okay with you, I will talk to him a bit.</P>
<P>M1 52: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 53: And I can't foresee exactly what we will talk about, but it might come down to me proposing at the end of my talk the three of us some episodes that welook for collect even look forward to in the sense there are opportunities to make these improvements.</P>
<P>M1 53: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 54: That's not too odd a way to proceed?</P>
<P>M1 54: No. Not for me.</P>
<P>TH 55: Great. So why don't we do that then. If you would just go ahead and let him know. Thanks.</P>
<P>M1 55: Behind this curtain.</P>
<P>TH 56: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 57: Hi. I hope we weren't too long.</P>
<P>M2 1: No, that's okay.</P>
<P>TH 58: I wonder if I could sort of start fresh and just ask how do you see your situation right now?</P>
<P>M2 2: Which one?</P>
<P>TH 59: As a couple.</P>
<P>M2 3: Um, hm. I think overall we are in pretty good shape. We've been through a lot, and we've gotten through it. I think we've just, we're kind of settling in I think really. Fine tuning I guess.</P>
<P>TH 60: Yeah, that certainly fits with what I just heard. It sounds like there was a period in which things were a bit more hectic, stressful, and somehow you found resources to deal with that and we're coming in on the heels of that rather than trying to work our way out of that. And one thought is if it's no longer broke, don't fix it, not even clear that it was broke, but it sounds like it was stressful. The other thought is well, this could be an opportunity to focus on improving things even if they are not in bad shape. And if we had that in mind, what might you want to improve?</P>
<P>M2 4: Um, hm... Hard questions... Um I think that sometimes when we do have disagreements we kind of reach this I don't know if it's an emotional block or some kind of communication block where we can't seem to get through to the other person. And I think that I am too keyed into Hugh's feelings and how they effect me, and I am not able to get past that and think about my own feelings. I think so often that how I feel is based on how he feels. And I think that can be a problem. I can't free myself of that. You know, if he is in a bad mood, then I have to fix it. I'm kind of a fixer. I always find problems and figure a way to solve them.</P>
<P>TH 61: So, if he is having a bad time of it, even if it's not personal, it can become your bad time. It will be something you have to do something about.</P>
<P>M2 5: Right. Right.</P>
<P>TH 62: Can you think of any time recently, even if it was a small matter. Itdoesn't have to be a big one. If it's a big one that's fine too, in which that came up,a specific example. Can you think of a recent time when he was a bit moody or out of sorts?</P>
<P>M2 6: Yeah, he's pretty moody pretty often.</P>
<P>TH 63: So we wouldn't have to wait a long time for that to happen.</P>
<P>M2 7: No. Nothing really specific. You know, he just might get bent out of shape because I don't know he got a spot on his shirt or something. That's not agood example, but you know, I feel like I have to fix it, and I feel over burdened,and then I think sometimes I get resentful because I end up doing more than maybe</P>
<P>I think I should. But I don't seem to be able to control that.</P>
<P>TH 64: Now one solution, even if it's a non-realistic one, would be that henever got upset again. We probably can't count on that one.</P>
<P>M2 8: I'd like that, though.</P>
<P>TH 65: Certainly you would like him to manage it a bit more.</P>
<P>M2 9: Yeah, he expressed his anger freely which is probably good because Idon't, and I mean, I feel fairly certain of why I don't. I grew up in a very angryhorrible household, so I don't like you know anger. I want to get rid of it.</P>
<P>TH 66: Um, is there a way, aside from the changes that he might make, that itcould get a bit more comfortable that from time to time he got angry, the things he could say so that you wouldn't have to take it so personal or feel you had to fix it?</P>
<P>M2 10: I don't know. He's you know in the past he's told me that it's not, that I don't have to fix it. It's okay for him to be that way. I just, I think I get so uncomfortable being in that presence that . . .</P>
<P>TH 67: Maybe at a visceral level . . .</P>
<P>M2 11: Yeah, it's something that's really, I can't really control it at all. It's very overwhelming. It's very uncomfortable. It's all I can think about. I can't seem to get beyond that until it's past, and so I've tried to, you know, step back and wait for it to pass knowing that it doesn't involve me, it's not really about me, all those things. But that's a hard thing for me.</P>
<P>TH 68: Are there any things that he can do that make it a bit easier. Like can you think of an example where he was out of sorts and it didn't become your problem?</P>
<P>M2 12: Um just if I wasn't around to witness it.</P>
<P>TH 69: Does he know how it effects you? Does he know . . .</P>
<P>M2 13: Yeah, I think so. And sometimes that only makes it worse. He gets angry over that because you know he realizes why I get that way, and I think itmakes, I think it makes him angry because I think he believes that I'm notresponding to him so much as I am responding to my past.</P>
<P>TH 70: I see. So then you become the focus and discussion becomes your past.</P>
<P>M2 14: And it gets distorted kind of and the point gets confused. I get to a certain point when we have disagreements or when there are times like that where my mind just goes blank. I can't think. I jus kind of shut down, and he recognizes that too. He sees that same thing happen. And I think it's just from my past where i would just really just shut down, you know, withdraw completely, and I can't even think. I can't even think straight. Is say things that are all convoluted and crazy, you know. And it makes the situation worse.</P>
<P>TH 71: Now any thoughts on if I were having this line of questioning with him and asking him what does he see as a problem and what was he looking to again a matter of improvement not that this is something that was broken or, any idea what he would have come up with?</P>
<P>M2 15: I don't know. Maybe just that I always feel like okay I have to fix things, and I do this not just in our relationship, I mean with his family and things like that, problems that his mother has with his brother, all of those kinds of things. I'm always kind of trying to be a problem solver, and he often says I don't want you to do that. But I don't know any other way to be. I don't know, I guess that would be my guess, but I really can't say.</P>
<P>TH 72: You see that as the main communication problem that he would point to?</P>
<P>M2 16: To me it seems like everything comes back to that. It's my need to make everything right.</P>
<P>TH 73: So it would be nice if he got upset less or not at all.</P>
<P>M2 17: I guess so. Yeah. Or I could learn better to deal with it. I mean that's the other option. Because I get angry too, but I mean everybody has to. It's unrealistic to say don't get angry because I can't deal with it.</P>
<P>TH 74: Let me focus on an incident that wasn't something he got angry about. You know, it was just something he mentioned in passing that you two were having a chat about a job coming up or something, and I guess he felt there was a little bit of communication problems around precisely what you had to do in the job. Does that ring a bell at all?</P>
<P>M2 18: Sounds like it. I kind of go about things from an abstract way. I mean I do all the organizing and ordering and that kind of thing.</P>
<P>TH 75: And to add, I got a sense that maybe what you had been doing I don't feel I totally had a handle on it, but maybe you were thinking out loud about what you needed to do.</P>
<P>M2 19: Yeah, I do that a lot.</P>
<P>TH 76: Yeah, that was my inference that what he took as a final work order you may have simply been thinking out loud.</P>
<P>M2 20: Well, I think the problem in that regard is that Hugh takes things very literally. Everything is to the letter exactly as stated, and I tend to be more abstract and vague. Maybe sometimes I do a lot of thinking out loud, and I think that there is often conflict because of that.</P>
<P>TH 77: I guess the thing that I have to keep in perspective just having met you two is that you and he have been together for twelve or thirteen years now, and that's no small achievement for anybody. And somehow at times he is angry in a way that viscerally, just gut-wise, you react to him, and at times you think out loud in a way that confuses him, but this is a couple that's gone through a lot and has a lot of strengths. It sounds like these are sort of, these certainly haven't been crucial to your surviving as a couple, but nonetheless they are the sources of some annoyance. Are things at the point perhaps simply because things are going well in other ways, that you would want to have these sort of things happen as a chance to work on them?</P>
<P>M2 21: Yeah, I suppose so. I guess it's just the stuff that stands out now as being you know a bigger problem. The hard stuff is all past.</P>
<P>TH 78: Right, right. And we have that luxury of having happened, looking forward in terms of how might things be a bit better.</P>
<P>M2 22: Right.</P>
<P>TH 79: Well, let me just try this out before I try it on both of you. What if it meant, I don't want to sound like Mission Impossible, but what if I offered of this assignment if you are willing to take it, that your job was to watch for opportunities in which he was out of sorts or angry or irritable, and you were inclined to solve the problem for him, and we without giving specific instructions how you are going to resolve that, we look to him maybe getting a better handle on his management of his emotion and you feeling less responsible, and we looked for those things to occur. In fact, we almost took them as opportunities, and the notion is you could then come back and talk to your counselor about sort of go over those.</P>
<P>M2 23: I think that's . . .</P>
<P>TH 80: So that him getting upset and you feeling responsible, on one level we can look at well, that's unfortunate. No relationship is perfect, but instead we could also look at it well here's an opportunity to see our reactions, to talk about our reactions, to collect this as an example and in some sense if a week went by without him ever getting angry, that's nice, but it meant that there was nothing to report. So if something happened, it at least gave me something to work on. Is it too uncomfortable, or would you be willing to collect those sort of things.</P>
<P>M2 24: Um, I can try. I have a tendency in the past when we've had counseling before I always am uncomfortable with that kind of homework kind of thing, and I think it's just because I feel that I guess I don't know exactly how to go about it. I can try. He is always a good person about reminding me and actually being a bit of a nag about it.</P>
<P>TH 81: We might make it in some sense simplify it, and that we simply will look to those episodes as something to bring in and talk about. And it sounds like one goal is for him to know a little bit more about his impact on you, and you perhaps to feel a little bit needed in terms of fixing him. But sometimes it sounds like he is inconsolable, he is unfixable.</P>
<P>M2 25: Yeah, yeah I think that is the case.</P>
<P>TH 82: And it's not that you haven't found the skeleton key, there just isn't one.</P>
<P>M2 26: Right.</P>
<P>TH 83: On your part, I am wondering if we could look to opportunities in which you were thinking abstractly, thinking out loud, and he learned to tolerate that that's just the rough draft and that maybe the message is in the long run you appreciate that he is concrete, and he needs to come down to that level, but he needs to appreciate that at times you need to think out loud like that. And he should be patient.</P>
<P>M2 27: Yeah, well, that would be nice.</P>
<P>TH 84: You give me the confidence, whether we plan or not, that he will get irritable at some point soon.</P>
<P>M2 28: Oh, yeah. That's a given. T</P>
<P>H 85: Okay, so at least we won't have to wait too long. It's not that we have to space out the sessions just waiting for that to happen.</P>
<P>M2 29: Right.</P>
<P>TH 86: I see. How about for you in terms of you thinking abstractly while he is waiting for something concrete? Would we have to wait a long time for that to happen?</P>
<P>M2 30: Maybe not, because we have something we have to do in the next couple of days.</P>
<P>TH 87: So you understand that if we commit ourselves to this course of action,we may be dealing with events that are frequent enough that we don't have to planthem. They will happen anyway. We can be confident about that. But our goal isnot to try to change them but to bring in the details to talk about them and that'swhere the change occurs.</P>
<P>M2 31: That sounds like a plan.</P>
<P>TH 88: Does that sound okay?</P>
<P>M2 32: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 89: And in doing all this we are taking advantage of the fact that we are seeing a period in which you two have come through some stuff, and that's behind you for now. Okay, if it's okay with you, then I'll invite him back in, and we can propose this as a plan.</P>
<P>M2 33: Okay?</P>
<P>TH 90: Is this comfortable . . .</P>
<P>M2 34: Yeah, I feel comfortable with it. I think it's interesting because when we started this we had had these disagreements, and he said that I thought we should see a counselor and do all that, and when we had one of these disagreements, that's when I called and set all this up. Then when we finally came, he said that well he really feels that we actually are doing better than most people, and he didn't realize that that was all it was. He didn't realize it, and since then we've had some of these disagreements, and he didn't want to talk about them, he didn't want to bring them here, and I felt that's why we were coming.</P>
<P>TH 91: So now we are sort of establishing explicit encouragement that this is . . .</P>
<P>M2 35: Yeah, and I think you've kind of pinpointed some things that probably need some work.</P>
<P>TH 92: Good, if we could have him back then.</P>
<P>M2 36: It sure gets hot.</P>
<P>TH 93: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 94: Well, we came up with some work for you of sorts. I have work for both of you if you are willing to accept this, and it sounds like we can take advantage of the fact that you've been through a rough period and that we can now, having that behind you, concentrate on how can things be improved. Things don't have to be broke for things to be improved. And the burden falls on you if you are willing to accept it from time to time to be irritable. Or to be out of sorts, and the idea is that we don't necessarily want you to work up a head of steam just for the benefit of counseling, but from time to time it will happen anyway. And what we are looking for is those incidents to be grist for the mill, something to come in and talk about so each of you gets more of a sense of the other one's reaction. Does that sound okay?</P>
<P>M1 56: If I understand you, are you asking me to think of an instance and . . .</P>
<P>TH 95: No, to wait for the possibility, and so if a week goes by and you are never upset about anything, that could be a great week, but it means that you've had a holiday from the kinds of things, which we all need every now and then, from the kinds of things we are focusing on. If on the other hand something happened to upset you and you happened to feel somewhat responsible for that or on edge at a basic gut level at times that effects you, much as you would like it otherwise, it bothers you at that level, and we had a chance to talk about that. So we are looking to collect those. If you never get irritated, that's fine. If you do, it's something to work on, and then it goes both ways. We are also looking for episodes in which you start out first draft thoughts kind of abstract, and you struggle to get down to a concrete level, and it doesn't mean that you have to purposely be confusing, but I just assume that in the normal course of a week working together, sometimes in your personal life, sometimes in your work life, that you will be thinking out loud, and you will be thinking, well, what's concretely being asked here. So, we want not big blowups but episodes of each of these two classes to occur. Not trying to avoid them necessarily, but when they occur, they are things to be talked about, to be analyzed. Not necessarily in every day life, but to be taken back with confidence that coming to a session is a chance to work on these things. Is that an okay way to proceed?</P>
<P>M1 57: I think so.</P>
<P>TH 96: It's not too weird that you are asked to go out and be irritable and you are asked to be abstract?</P>
<P>M2 37: We do that anyway.</P>
<P>M1 58: It's not something we avoid. It seems to assult us. When it happens, it happens.</P>
<P>TH 97: But we at least now possibly have a chance to make it an opportunity.</P>
<P>M1 59: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 98: So that in some sense at least, frustrating as it might be at the moment, we can in part welcome it. Now we have something specifically to talk about that's inevitably going to come up. And counseling isn't going to go on forever, so some of these things can happen in between sessions. It insures that good use can be made of the counseling. So if you are willing to accept this assignment for you . . .</P>
<P>M2 38: Yeah, I accept it.</P>
<P>TH 99: For you it's talking abstractly and you figuring out what concretely is being asked and you from time to time being upset and for you to think well this hits me at a gut level, but I am going to try not to make it my problem.</P>
<P>M1 60: Sounds like I have the easy assignment. I'm not really changing anything. I'm always trying to understand what you are saying anyway, and I don't have any problem letting my anger out, so . . .</P>
<P>TH 100: No, but he is always trying to live with your anger, and you are always trying to figure out concretely what the abstractions mean.</P>
<P>M1 61: Right. So it seems like normal life to me.</P>
<P>M2 39: And it is.</P>
<P>TH 101: What we are talking about and the thing that we need to keep in mind,whatever we are talking about hasn't kept from building your life of twelve or more years together.</P>
<P>M1 62: No.</P>
<P>TH 102: I think it's a matter of keeping it in that perspective. And it's becausethings are going well that we can look forward to them in small ways not goingwell to give us something to work with.</P>
<P>M1 62: Did you look forward to counseling after things seemed to calm downanyway, that we were not having so many conflicts?</P>
<P>M2 40: You mean now, this last time?</P>
<P>M1 63: No, I don't mean specific session, but I mean when it came time that we could have counseling and take the time to do that. Did you look forward to it?</P>
<P>M2 41: No, I don't ever look forward to it because for me it's a lot of work. I know that you will talk about things that are uncomfortable and that you don't want to talk about, and I know that you have to talk about them if you want themto get better. So, I don't think I'd look forward to it. I think of it as something that needs to be done like I think of everything.</P>
<P>TH 103: Well, if we follow this plan, I won't say go out and have a great week. I'd say have a very good one and have some problems come up that we insures we have something to talk about. I hope that's not an odd way of . . .</P>
<P>M1 64: No, that's okay. I don't quite understand though. You mean so that when it happens we will be talking . . .</P>
<P>TH 104: Exactly. And there is a benefit to these occurrences that gives you something to talk to him about.</P>
<P>M2 42: To turn it into something productive.</P>
<P>TH 105: Exactly.</P>
<P>M1 65: Instead of just totally disruptive and then moving away from it instead of . . .</P>
<P>TH 106: It's almost like if you think about your car having an intermittentproblem. You can leave it in the driveway, or you can drive it around and hopethat the problem occurs so that you can report more clearly about what it is.</P>
<P>Particularly when it is the kind of problem we can't necessarily observe whenyou're in.</P>
<P>M1 66: Yeah.</P>
<P>M2 43: Makes sense.</P>
<P>TH 107: Great. Thank you very much for giving us the benefit of your visit, and</P>
<P>I hope that in some small way this returns the favor.</P>
<P>M1 67: Certainly. Thank you.</P>
<P>M2 44: Thanks a lot.</P>

<center><P><b>Treatment Plan for this Couple</b></P></center>

<p>In the following session, Coyne would again see each member of the couple separately. At that time, he would check out to see what had been happening and how the assignment had worked out. He would ask each of the couple how it set with him, looking for specifics about the interaction. If each of the couple had played out his role, Coyne would congratulate them because that would me they had something to talk about. His goal would be to insert himself into the couple's life and thus change behaviors because they are, in a sense, being observed. Over time, he would like to see them becoming a bit more tolerant of each other's behavior while changing their own behaviors.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Adjusts microphone] So start again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah. Oh, in the 24 hours — I [chuckles] — I had a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] You had a homework assignment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know. It is — [pauses] um, well, I did think about some things, but I don't think I've reached any conclusions. Um, [pauses] — um — [pauses] you know, I'm going — I'm driving to, actually, Portland from here, um, in July. And [that mileage] (ph) makes me think that it is probably fewer weeks than I — than I think. You know, but — um, and I'll be stopping to see my dad in Michigan, and, uh, [sirens sound] I think that'll probably the last chance to see him before I leave, and, uh... [00:01:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're going from here, Michigan, Portland, France?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, [chuckles] here's the stop ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Michigan, Portland, here, France - yeah. Yeah, so, um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I took out a few stops.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, you know, [chuckles] that's a long trip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] and, uh, so — I don't know; I'm just trying to think, do I want to get this letter sent off before I drive through there? I'm only planning on staying for a little bit, like an afternoon, maybe, um, part of the reason being I don't really want to [chuckles] be there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:01:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [sound of air conditioner starts] or — I mean, it is not — it is not like I haven't — it is not like I'm, um, needing any more time for this; I mean, I think I know what I want to say. [Pauses] And, um, I think, at this point, it is — if I wait any longer, it is just procrastinating. Um... [Taps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem pretty clear that you wanted to send it when we talked about it last.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Yeah, yeah. And I think the more I think around in my head, which is actually pretty frequently, um, the more I think that [taps surface] it is not a, um — [pauses] it is not a, [fidgets] "You screwed up. I want an apology"; it is more, [pauses] [taps surface] "This is where things are." Um, [pauses] [chuckles, sounds emotional] sorry. Um, [slaps surface] and, [pauses for seven seconds] yeah, [claps hand] so it is not like I want — I guess I want to acknowledge that the past few years have been awkward, as he's probably noticed... [00:03:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And there's a reason, and this is why, and I want that to end. And then it is my — it is [pauses] [clears throat] um, [pauses] it has been my initiative [slaps hand], my — to [taps hand] — for the awkwardness, and so this is my explanation for it, and this is, um, [pauses] — this is how I want to put it [taps surface] to rest. So [pauses for six seconds] — but I think it is just a matter of putting it all down [taps hand]. Um, [pauses] but in thinking about that, I also am wondering what's going to happen, if anything, to me when I send this letter... [00:04:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And we presumably [taps hand] have a conversation. [Sighs] [pauses] I mean, [clucks] will my [pauses] — will it be a burden off my shoulders? Will I be a nervous wreck 'til he gets it and responds?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the best-case scenario, and what's the worst-case scenario?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the worst-case scenario isn't very likely, so I wouldn't — worst-case would mean he doesn't - doesn't want to speak to me again. [00:05:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that — that just wouldn't fly. Um, [pauses] and, again, I don't think it is also likely just because of the way it is going to be [taps surface] framed and [pauses] explained. And, um, so [exhales] [clucks] best — and best-case scenario is that [exhales] [pauses] he takes responsibility for it and [pauses] doesn't [pauses 11 seconds] — um, doesn't pass it off as being [pauses] uh, [pauses] due to circumstances or, [swallows] um, that he did all he could at the time, things like that, 'cause I've heard that from him... [00:06:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's maybe more likely?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um, I guess it depends on which thing we're talking about, but [pauses] [sighs] — I don't know. I mean, [pauses] it is — it is hard for me to think about how it would have turned out if none of that had ever happened. Um, [pauses] in many ways, my behavior modeled my elder brothers', who were out of the house by the time that happened. [00:07:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [clucks] but I don't think there was the same depression or anxiety. Um, so I don't know. I mean, I don't know where I'm going with this, I guess. I think — I think he was too hands-off. I think [shrugs] [slaps surface] [swallows] [pauses 18 seconds] I mean, I think he wasn't interested in being a parent, and we talked about that, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] And it is hard to say that, you know, uh, in a letter. [Chuckles in exasperation] And [pauses] provide evidence, and, [sighs] — what could he do? You know, I mean, that's a pretty damning... [00:08:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Thing to say - "You didn't really want to be a parent, did you?" — at least not to seven kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think at 70— whatever age he is — [taps surface] 77, 78 — that would be pretty hard to take, and [pauses] I guess I don't know if that's the message I want to send, if that's kind of a [slaps surface]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, ancillary to the main message. But it is kind of the conclusion I reached when I had, you know... [00:08:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Recounted each thing, and, uh, I guess I don't need to say it to him; he can probably come to that conclusion himself if I leave him there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [exhales] I don't know — I sometimes wonder what goes through his head. I think he's reflective but then I think he's not.</p>

<p>[Sound of air conditioner starts]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Well, things may look very different from his perspective...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and, um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Especially not knowing so much of what his children have gone through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Just so many of us just kind of sweep it aside...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And put on a smiley face, and [slaps surface] tell jokes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want — no, they know that's not the case. I know, hey — [makes sweeping sound] <i>shwhhhh —</i> most of us have issues, and yet the tendency is to [pauses] not want to be angry with the perpetrator a<i>nnnd</i> want to just [rubs surface] put it behind. [00:10:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it has had different [slaps surface] consequences across each member of the family. So, you know, I guess, best-case scenario, you know, beyond that is that [clucks] he [pauses] reflects on what I'm saying and [pauses] considers, um, the impact of his actions and what — and actually, um, acknowledges that it is not just me, but it is also, um, perhaps other kids memories of him. So, [speaks softly] yeah. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Would you feel less anxious about sending one piece of the letter? I mean, I know there's a lot in there; it covers a lot of different things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, no, I don't think so. I mean, I think any time you bring up this — this piece of history, it is hard for everyone involved. [Pauses] Nobody wants to talk about it. [Sighs] So, um — but that, to me, is kind of a keystone of the whole thing, and [pauses] it is, uh, a large portion of a — [slaps surface] a, um, upbringing that has...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:11:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Similar components that all kind of center around this theme of, um, not taking responsibility for his actions. And I think that — I guess what — what encourages me is that, [swallows] you know, I — [sniffles] I can understand why he would want to — [can you get a tissue] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Yeah, OK] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] OK. Um, why he would want to just push it aside, and I [know he tried to prevent] (ph), too. And that, um, [exhales] - I mean, it is a [fidgets with objects] — is a slippery — it is — it is an attractive option to just, [slaps hands] you know, try to push it behind you, put it as fast as possible behind you, put things back to normal, um, and I'm - I will [clucks] address that in the letter. I think [pauses]... [00:13:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is a really uncomfortable thing to approach.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is horrible. I mean, it is like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is pretty easy to see why somebody would want to avoid...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have a — I mean, you know, I asked for that referral last week; thank you for that. Um, that's painful for me to even [exhales] want to think about, you know. And [pauses] [sighs] I don't even know how much work we can get done in the time that remains here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I fear that, once we go to France, it will just be like — get caught up in the, you know, flurry of activity and [pauses] — and it gets brushed aside - I don't - ... [00:14:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because it is not fun (ph), [taps surface] so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think in the — I think, especially in comparison to the [slaps surface] things that you have pushed yourself to confront the past year, noticing how much your father chose to avoid, it seems like he's, you know, taking the easy way out...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Because you've confronted a lot of really difficult things within your — your personal work in here and, I think, also in your relationship in working to get yourself to a place where you could ask for a referral, think about starting...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Writing a letter. Those are all confronting things that were probably more comfortable to avoid in the short-term.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [says sadly] it is true. [00:14:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think, as you've experienced, you know that there is a consequence to avoiding, and you've felt that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, I mean, [chuckles in exasperation] I can probably predict it, [slaps surface] you know — I mean, considering [slaps hand] what happened to me and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [exhales deeply] [slaps hand] you know, if I really want to invest in this marriage, I <i>have</i> to do this. And [slaps hand] — and [chuckles in exasperation] I can say that without saying I want to do this...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I could — just cannot swap those two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just do not want to do it. Um, but it is like, [slaps surface] you know, wanting a tumor removed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it is going to — it is going to be hell, but you have to do it. And [pauses five seconds] [clucks] I think it is not as bad as this. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Well, it is probably better and worse at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The less passive — you can't just be put to sleep and have them take it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [chuckles] yeah, exactly. Um...[00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you also have a bit more control. You don't have to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Leave yourself defenseless on the operating table; you can bring all your defenses with you to therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles quietly] Well, yeah, I'd say that's actually the best way to put it, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, [pauses for 11 seconds] so [pauses for six seconds] I guess my message to him is, "You're human, like me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 15 seconds] [sound of air conditioner starts] [clucks] and, um, [pauses] [clucks] humans screw up, and humans need to [pauses] heal. And, to me, this is... [00:17:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That process for both of us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, part of healing is acknowledging the screw-ups.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Claps hand]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what — that's what you're really asking him to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah. And, uh, [pauses] [clucks] not so much the initial screw-up because he's apologized, you know, as — obviously. What I think is just the — the failure to see what the long-term effects are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, well, it sounds like you're not asking him to apologize for what he did to your sister; you're asking him to apologize and acknowledge what he didn't do for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Taps surface] Yeah, and I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That his actions affected not just one person but an entire family system. [00:18:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and — and, for many years beyond, that — that event. And [fidgets] you know, I, um — [clucks] and I guess what anybody would say (ph) I'm asking him to apologize, I'm not even really asking him to apologize; I'm just asking him to acknowledge that this is my reality...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And he might disagree with it, but I don't see how he...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's about your opinion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....You know, [slaps hand] that he would. So, uh [pauses] — but I get back to the — I come back to the idea of how I would have turned out had this not happened, [slaps surface] and how much of this — how much of how I turned out today is, uh, in part to that, on the good side and the bad side of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, I'm trying to — as I kick this around, I'm trying to also acknowledge the good things that he instilled in me. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] And I think that is hard to do right now, but it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hard to do because of your anger with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Or hard to do because it is — I - it is this sometimes struggle you seem to acknowledge the good things in yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, [clears throat] well, yeah, both, I guess. I mean, I think it is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's a problem with multiple choice in therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: <i>Shhhhee</i> — yeah, yeah, yeah. [Chuckles] Um, you know, I — I am angry with him, and the more I [pauses] think about him, the more I see the same tendencies carried out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are some of the good things in you, whether they came from him or elsewhere? I'd like to have an opportunity to practice recognizing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hah [brief chuckle], you would do that. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would, right up until the last meeting. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yes. Um, [pauses for 15 seconds] [sighs] I think I have — I have a solid moral framework about how to treat people, [pauses] um, [pauses] myself excluded, I guess. Um, [pauses for 24 seconds] [inhales] I can work hard [a slam sounds in background] if it is something I'm interested [chuckles] in. Um, [pauses]... [00:21:13]</p>

<p>[Door opens in background]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can work hard even when it is not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>[Door closes in background]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In my experience of knowing you from, you know, a good portion of this academic piece of your career, you worked hard even in the classes that weren't your favorites.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, that's true. [Chuckles] I guess [fidgets] I enjoy working hard [chuckles] when it is something I'm interested in doing. Um, [sighs] [pauses] I'm conscientious. I'm considerate. I'm not all these things all the time, of course, [pauses] — uh, [pauses for nine seconds]... [00:22:10]</p>

<p>[Door opens in background]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't mean that you're not those things. None of us are perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Inhales] No, that's true. I don't — I don't want to suggest that, um, [fidgets] the absence overrules the predominance, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, [exhales] [pauses for 12 seconds] [inhales] but I do think there are things that - you know, he moved some of these, perhaps, but, [pauses for 12 seconds] yeah, he's such a religious man, and I am [pauses] — I have a [pauses for a eight seconds] — I'm trying to use words that don't sound so flaky. Um, [pauses]... [00:23:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, so often, when I say things — well, not — so often, when I hear things put a certain way, I — I can't help but think of the stereotype of "spiritual but not religious," um, because I think it is so, uh, useless; it is so uninformative. I have a strong sense of my own spirituality and relationship [pauses for 11 seconds] to God. [00:24:04]</p>

<p>Um, [pauses] [clucks] and I've also — I mean, I've always attributed that to my mom, not my dad. And [pauses] - I don't know - I guess I should probably take a look at that, uh, tonight. All my evidence suggests that he was rote, by the book. You go into confession, um, on whatever days they were — these days, I don't remember — and go to Mass on the feast (ph) days, and so on and so forth — things that I just think are ridiculous, for me. [Pauses] And I know — and I guess the reason I have a hard time with this is, how is it that I know — I suppose, having experienced it, but — that I can't let this just — with my wife, just [slaps surface] linger, uh, and we're going to have to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But for someone who's so self-described — well, I wouldn't say he was boasting about it, but he holds himself up to be a religious person and yet he does this thing. OK, fine. Um, where's <i>my</i> religious or spiritual sensibility [sounds to shrug with hands on surface] come in to knowing that I can't this slide, and yet his religious... [00:26:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Sensibility allowed him to not?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, again, I say — probably because I experienced it — but [sighs] [clucks] I don't know. Anyway, it is, uh, probably at a dead-end, I think. Um, [pauses] I don't [want to go over] (ph) [fidgets].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is really hard. It is important. [Shifts in seat] I [clucks] — I think it is — it is interesting because you're looking at what happened from your perspective.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is the only perspective you have because you haven't talked with him, but I think it is possible that he frames things in a completely different way and, for him, that's reality. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, you know, you're kind wrestling with this question of, you know, "How can he have kind of let this — you know, let that aftermath happen?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, [clucks] — uh, and he may have very well sealed that he appropriately dealt with it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Based on how he structures things in his head. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...The story that he's kind of built up around it, for himself because our memories, really, are built; they're not — they're not snapshots of what happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We create and layer these stories around events that happened in our lives, and that's what we remember — the stories that we create about things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm, mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're very real for us. They're, you know, how we think our — our event — the events in our lives unfolded is our reality, but it could be completely different from the story that somebody else built up, even living in the same household.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why you can have [clucks] —there's a lot of research of an eyewitness accounts kind of talks about how we build memories and how we store our memories. The three people all witness the same thing and give completely different stories about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they're not lying. That's — those are the memories that they have created for themselves around that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you and your dad are no different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah. I guess I — I was listening to you, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I couldn't help but think about his reality...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...At the time. He is a, [pauses] um, you know, a trusted member of the community. He's working with a special program that he created for the people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...For at-risk, uh, adolescents, and [shifts in seat], you know, for someone like that, whose action [door opens in background] caused many things to fall apart for [door closes in background] [inaudible at 29:06] to have the community, perhaps, whispering behind his back... [00:29:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...About what he did — I can't imagine, uh, [pauses] what that must feel like, walking into your church when the two children whom you adopted were brought up in front of the whole church to be introduced to the — to the parish...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And now this is what happened. I can't [becomes emotional] <i>imagine</i> the courage that that took to walk back in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I [would think] (ph) it is really hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even to just show up anywhere around town. I mean, I... [00:30:00]</p>

<p>[Door opens in background]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, it — it is really impossible to know [door closes in background] how he framed himself or what he thinks, what he thought, what he felt, but I take — the — the disappointment that you have in yourself and some of the self-loathing that you carry...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...For your actions with another <i>adult</i>...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You know, put that — put yourself in your father's shoes for making a transgression against a child.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, you know, I can't [slaps surface] — you know, I don't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can't. It is — it is [sighs] [pauses for seven seconds] — I can't say I would — I can't say I would do it — or would have done it differently myself. I guess that's probably part of the message.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. It is really hard to know how any of us would be in certain situations. [00:30:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean, [pauses] you know, [pauses for seven seconds] — and when I see a really, really obese person walking down the street, I can't help but think what courage they have to just get up and go out into public, you know, with — with [sighs] — knowing that there are probably people who will be repulsed by them, you know, or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And [pauses] it makes my issues kind of seem minor. But to know [sound of air conditioner starts] the courage he had [sighs] to face a community that most of whom probably know, uh, what's going on, and [pauses for eight seconds] - I don't know if I would — I probably would have moved. [00:32:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [pauses] I guess, as I think about this, he didn't move. He didn't [pauses] become a hermit or a shut-in. He [pauses for 22 seconds] — he did what he thought was right for himself and perhaps the family. But, [pauses] again, there are things that fall through the cracks, [sound of a slam in background] and I guess I feel like I am one of those. [00:33:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a pretty important thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But [sighs] [pauses for 15 seconds] — I don't know — this [exhales] realization that you've helped me come to [slaps surface] is going to require, um, [pauses for five seconds] — well, actually, it'd be probably a larger part of the letter than [slaps surface] it is now. I don't think there is anything like this in there. [00:34:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we're just keeping it more complicated is all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Before this is over] (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I have to — I'd like to (ph) — [sighs] I don't know how to handle sending this him and - and flying into town, and out in a few hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Well, your relationship with him does not end when you move.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I also — this kind of [shifts in seat] — [whispers] I don't know— [fidgets] what this kind of, um, [sighs] [pauses for eight seconds] — I can't think of the word — bombshell...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That I'm about to drop on him, I, um — I suspect he will [door closes in background] want to meet with me and talk about it. [00:35:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you make time for that in your traveling plans? You know, as you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he weren't out in the middle of nowhere, I might be able to. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But [exhales] it is possible. I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perhaps he could meet you somewhere else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to... [fidgets] [taps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also wonder — I mean, you have taken a lot of time to process this [taps surface] in the many layers that it incorporates...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Quietly chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And it may be that his — he might need some of the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Taps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clucks] You know, I think the idea of sending it ahead of time, so he can read it, absorb it, have some — formulate his questions in response, and, um — and then it may be that he needs to talk about it with you more than once. It might not... [00:36:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I can imagine.</p>

<p>[Sound of air conditioner stops]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know? I might not be a sort of [fidgets] three-day powwow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, it might be a touch upon it/move away/touch upon it/move away-type of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some of that might be in person and some of that might be over the phone, and some of that might be at the [taps surface] next Christmas family gathering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It doesn't have to go any one particular way. It doesn't necessarily need to go the way he wants it to or the way that you envisioned it. You know, there's lots of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...There's lots of way for you guys to be able to acknowledge what you've written, um, give him a chance to absorb and respond to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't — I — I would, I think, would hesitate to encourage you to plan it perfectly before you send it. You know... [00:37:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Plan it all out — all out the way that you think that you want it to go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, because you — it is never going to be perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and it seems really important for you to get him the message before you leave. That — that's something I've heard you say over time...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That's remained really important for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Fidgets, makes sounds] Yeah, it still is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'd say allow him — you know, allowing you to get — get the letter sent even though the — you know the re — the logistics of it isn't necessarily what you would have orchestrated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Sighs] Yeah, um, [pauses for eight seconds] - [clucks] and I guess, um, you know, I think my consideration for him and how he would react, or what I would think that he would want, I guess, is secondary. I mean, for me, this is... [00:38:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...The important thing is for me to get this off my chest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know if there is any real — after that, I don't know that there is any real work that I need to do with it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because I've kind of spilled it all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How it has been a failure how I communicated something, and that is one thing. But I think, at that point, the ball is in his court...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...As to how he wants to receive it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...How he wants to interpret it, and how he wants our relationship to be after.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can put in there that this is what I am hoping will [slaps surface] — our relationship can be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, um, [pauses] — so, yeah, I mean — I don't know. [Pauses for 14 seconds] I don't know if I'll stop there at all, but [sound of air conditioner starts] — 'cause it is going to be awkward...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Faintly] Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Whether I've sent it or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It has always [been this way] (ph) for the past few years. Uh, so, yeah. [Slaps surface] [pauses for 12 seconds] I guess I'll have to [speaks faintly] think about that. [Sighs] [Drums on surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I want to follow up on the referral because I know you said that you got it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And you don't know how much time there is. Have you actually scheduled with somebody? [00:40:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. I, um — I was out of town all last week, [slaps surface] and so, uh, I had talked to my wife about it, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she's interested in doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Sighs] [pauses] I don't really know. I mean, we've had some smattering of counseling (ph) before we moved down here, in the summer between, and I don't really remember where we left off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [slaps surface] I think the psychologist there was [inaudible], and then she joined a women's group — or a support group, [claps hand] which she did not want to do, and I don't think any of it has changed. I don't think she's going to [chuckles in exasperation] want to do it over in France. [Claps hand] But I guess, um, for me, the point is to communicate my fears to her... [00:41:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And my — my concerns about what we need to do in order to deal with this, in whatever way that means, and whatever that looks like. [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because of, you know, my fear of a tendency to just move past it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You tired? [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not, actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Well, you look like you're going to yawn, but I don't blame you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, um, but — uh, [pauses] so, yeah, I don't know where we're going to pick up. I guess, again, it is just not so much [sighs] the method; it is just the doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think you actually caught me thinking of other names to refer you to if [anonymous] didn't work out. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How did you pick her? Does that mean she's got an interesting s-s-story?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She does. Um, I picked her because I — I happen to love her presence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:41:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Um, she — she keeps her — so she's an ordained minister but she keeps that separate from her counsel — her counseling. She's a licensed social worker...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ....And has been much, much longer than she's been an ordained reverend — or minister; I'm sorry that I don't recall which.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [clucks] but she just happened — she is an extremely non-judgmental, kind, warm presence, and I think she works really well with couples because of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She can really — she can sit with a wide variety of people and issues, and just emanate this [slaps surface] unconditional support, um, and I think that's a — a wonderful presence to have [slaps surface] when you're working with a couple because one of the challenges of working with couples is being able to connect with both members of the couple...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And being able to empathize with both sides when, sometimes, they seem — they seem to be two different sets. [Slaps surface]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, so [clucks] I've worked with her. She has worked — she's sort of been a — like a satellite person other there forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. [00:42:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She does a lot of crisis work, um, like on-call stuff. So she's been there forever, and she was there when I was there, and I — I got to work with her a lot, um, and I've just always held her in very high regard. Um, [clucks] she also is — because she has worked, um, sort of tangentially, she is very familiar with the culture...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And I think that's helpful just, you know, because of the — um, you know, having — having just finished...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You know, the course there and understanding the pressures of where you are right now, that kind of thing. I feel like it just kind of helpful kind of background knowledge to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but she's busy, which is why you caught me thinking about this, you know, "Does that person do couples?" Um, [chuckles] but I would be willing...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...If you can guys get a start and at least, you know, you can start while you're here...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...That would be great. My fear is that you're going to call her, and she is going to be busy for weeks. Who knows?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but I actually didn't come up with any other good names.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, well, I'll let you know if we strike out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. That — you know, give her call, and let me know. It would be great if she — you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Sometimes, you catch people just as, you know, [slaps surface] other people have graduated and left, and there are spaces in the planner (ph). [00:44:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe the summer is — is....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Might be lighter for some reason? Yeah. Um, but I will think on it more if you need back-up names.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I — [sighs] I will probably call her tomorrow, or send her an e-mail, whichever, um, because the rest of today is shot, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, OK. And I think we're scheduled for Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eleven-thirty, I think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eleven-thirty? [Turns off microphone recording]</p>

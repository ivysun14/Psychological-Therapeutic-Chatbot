<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now we just have our regular meeting.  So tell me what's been happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, my wife's been asking me to get out.  We thought we had a way of selling the house now and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I got an apartment and then that fell through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What happened?  You told me that, that friend was going—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he, you know, he's a, he's an orthopedic surgeon and, uh, he's a very cool guy, very nice guy and all that, but, you know, he's, he had a builder take a look at it and the builder basically said that you're going to have to put about $50/$100 in it when you go to sell it again which is no big deal.  I mean that's, you know, a lot, a lot of, um, I mean it's still a good deal for, for, uh, someone.  A very good deal considering what I'm willing to let it go at.  Um, so that dropped through now.  I, so now I have a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he didn't want to put additional money into it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does it need to have done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I, it's, it's an old home.  It needs new windows, it's going to need a new roof; needs 2 new bathrooms.  You know, between $50 and $100 is, is what it's going to take basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And what it seems like, the other, so it's, today we put it on the market—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and, um, you know, there are builders, because a builder is going to buy it.  The, the land is really a cool piece of property.  Either a builder's going to buy it for, um, a lot—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm laughing because while I'm taping the session, I'm making all this noise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  Well, I was going to say, can I have beer too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want a soda?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.  I'm just, they don't know.  Um, so it's either a builder's going to buy it or somebody's going to come in with, you know, because they want to get into [DEIDENTIFIED] and, and, uh, and fix it up and I'm just looking to cover, you know, our expenses.  Get, we know what all the expenses are now including you and, and others and cover all our expenses and we should come away with, with, you know, minimal money, but a little bit of money too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the property's a, it's a very nice—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a very nice lot.  There's a pond on it and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How big is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's an acre and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy, that's big, yeah.  And that's big for [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that, um, well, that's conforming lot in [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  So they could, they could put on any size house they really want.  They could tear it down because it's a tiny little ranch, about 1400 square foot ranch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So this is the kind of situation where people would actually buy the property and take the house down and put up a [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's very common anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	House?  Is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very common.  Very common.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  See I, I, I know of, uh, I, I know of other places where that's done.  It's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm sure it's very common.  You know, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, my friend lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].  They do it there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There you go because I know [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very, very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] they do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because they want to live near the Jewish community.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, well, that's off [INAUDIBLE].  Actually, I built those, a lot of the homes in, in, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] because, well, designed them, built them, because I worked for a developer that is Jewish, a Jewish family.  Actually, the 3 fathers, the families were all [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they, um, they, they're the ones that were [DEIDENTIFIED] way back when that every development they have is, has a [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And, and they're in the movie, at the end of the movie putting stones on his grave and, and they even have a bust of him that, you know, in their office and things like that.  It's really pretty, you know, it's really pretty touching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they were like teenagers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not, no, actually, oh, yeah, no, the fathers were.  They were, they were teenagers and younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they all have the numbers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, that's incredible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, um, when I traveled to Europe for school, I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] and it's, it is one of the most, I, you know, hair standing up on the back of my neck right now.  Um, almost, almost bizarre, um, experiences you ever want to have in your life.  It's just not, it, there's nothing that ever even came close in terms of what it did to you emotionally and what it made you really contemplate about humanity.  I mean it just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's beyond my, you know, um, and, you know, having been there, I actually, it gained me favor with those families that, you know, oh, you're a Christian that, under, that has gone a really, because most of them haven't, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They haven't gone there to any of the camps, um, except for obviously with parents that had gone there.  Um, everybody should, everybody should go.  They actually are one of the major contributors to [DEIDENTIFIED] down there.  So, um, I know [DEIDENTIFIED] very, very well and, yeah, that's a very, that's a, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What today's houses are, what—[DEIDENTIFIED] used to be the wealthy community when I was growing up, obviously very Jewish.  That was the Jewish community and, um, or, you know, so the Orthodox can walk to the synagogues and whatnot and it still is, but what used to be very upscale, you know, not anymore.  So they just buy them and tear them down and build them up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or dramatically expand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or dramatically expand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't even look like the same house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, they're not.  They save one wall and, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—they do.  It's, it's often, so it's essentially a tear down, but, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because my friend had like a professional hockey player live across the street and, you know, just, you know, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So anyway now with this, uh, uh, and out of work and, and about to lose insurance, um, health insurance and, so I have to scramble with that somehow, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has it been Cobra?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, just not being able to pay it.  Um, the, uh, we decided that while it's on the market, the house is on the market and, you know, I've, I've looked into it a little bit with the realtors and we should be able to sell it within a month, somewhere around there, priced at what we're going to price it at, um, but in the meantime, you know, we're trying to figure out what, what we're going to pay and what we're not and I explained to my wife that I believe that we should be paying just credit card bills, you know, to keep from mass, you know, collection issues and let them start foreclosing on our home because, you know, that's really nothing there.  It takes them a year to actually do that, um, and, and then, you know, you could stop it at any time when you, you know, when you actually—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You could stop it at the last minute, ac, actually.  So that's where I am with that.  Um, I actually have a job perspective that I'm very, very, very enthused at, uh, about, uh, that I went and met with the guy on Friday, but they seem to be a little, a little bit squirrelly.  What it would be is actually landscape architecture but in sales sort of design and build the company and they want somebody to be able to go and, and it's high end.  It's a quarter of a million to a million or a quarter of a million to 2 million dollar landscape design and build.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's just, you know, they did Bruce Springstien's home, you know, things like that.  Right.  So you can only imagine.  You know, it's, these are people with unlimited, um, we're actually going for [NAME OTHER] who is the owner of the [DEIDENTIFIED].  So we're going for his compound in, in, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] where he just tore down a 24,000 square foot home in [DEIDENTIFIED] and wants to put up what he, what he's referring to as a great camp which I know very much about because great camps originated up in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm very familiar with all that and basically it'll be a large home, it'll probably be a sep, another recreation, dining hall but very high end; um, and then smaller cabins.  The cabins are probably going to be about, you know, 3,000 square foot or whatever.  Um, you know, it, just spaced out and, and tucked into the woods and whatnot, but they, he's got a property there and like when Brett Favre was coming to the Jets he would have him come out, go hunting on the property, you know, things like that.  That's what he wants.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is this guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I don't know.  I've not met him yet, but my, my, my, [DEIDENTIFIED], older did the, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So that we have some ins with him at some level and I could probably get to him, um, at some level and that's what, you know, that's one of my first prospects, but other than that, I have to, you know, I, I need to start generating leads.  I think I'd be well suited for it.  I never thought I would be.  I, I never wanted to go into [DEIDENTIFIED].  The lack of structure in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, you know, you need to take the initiative.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You need to, but for whatever reason in my mind, I've been revolted by that idea all my life mostly because any, you know, everybody's got this idea of what a salesperson is, but this is different.  I understand this, this, this product very well.  I, and I can talk it very well; um, and I feel as though I can do it.  I can, I can, you know, I can do it now.  I can get the leads.  I could, I could stay engaged or, or engaged in that process of, of, uh, of marketing.  Um, maybe I'm wrong, uh, but I don't think so.  I feel like it.  You know, that's the first time that's ever been the case.  Um, so, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that that comes through.  If that comes through then, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why'd, why'd you say they were a little squirrelly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, in, he's, you know, he was, he put out an ad.  He was looking for somebody for quite some time and, and going down to see my, my girlfriend found, you know, had met the guy and found out they were looking for somebody and referred me and he's got another guy he's, he's talking with and he really wants both of us, but they're going into their slow season and, you know, he's kind of weighing the options and now if I could kind of hear in this voice that, you know, maybe they don't want to bring somebody on this time of year and wait until the spring when they could actually start, because they're going to be carrying me for that amount of time and I've got a good argument against that when I do sit down and, with them, um, and there'd be, you know, it'd be base salary, but it'll be commission, but it's significant.  It's 10 percent commission, you know, do the numbers.  They're expecting me the first year to sell about a million five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  So, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'd be great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it would be, you know, it would be really great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, it's, it's, uh, and here's the good part.  You know, I have friends out in [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's a very big industry out there.  They were, they all did better than anybody else, you know, coming out of school and they never needed to get a license to do it because it's, of the industry that they're in and those guys, the highest end guys, in fact, their, their firm does all the [DEIDENTIFIED]'s, uh, flower displays, you know, every year.  They have just acres of gardens just for that so they can bring the bulbs in and whatnot, but anyway, they, um, out there, he's responsible for the contacts, the sales, the coordination of subcontractors, the, the management of his people on the site, the, and all that stuff.  Here, they say you sell, we'll take it from there.  No details.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's perfect for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's perfect for me.  You know, I thought, but I still have design, um, authority.  I, you know, I, I still come up with concepts and that's, you know, me holding the pen like this on, on a piece of week—old trash, um, you know, and talking with the, uh, owners, and then, you know, um, bring it back to the people who, uh, who will then take it from there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds very attractive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, it does, doesn't it sound, it sounds very attractive for me.  It meets a lot of the criteria.  Um, I'm not behind a desk.  I'm, I'm on the road.  It used to be bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very personal, but, you know, I mean honestly I mean I could see—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, right, and you ought to see the, I mean the first, I, I shattled them on Friday and, um, he's not, he's not educated at all.  He's just one of those, you know, business guys.  He came up to the range.  And even when we were meeting, we were meeting with these clients, it was, you know, I was, and after a while I had to pull him aside and ask him if it was okay, but I was, I couldn't help myself.  I was chiming in with ideas and, and, and getting building enthusiasm.  By the end of the day, I was so pumped up that, um, quite honestly, I needed to take some Klonopin just to, to chill out because I was, I was so, so pumped up.  Um, so, you know, it, it sounds like, one of the other thing is I tried this once coming out of college and I did not like, I did not like it for a couple of reasons.  One is A, it wasn't the high end.  It was the plant my front yard kind of a thing, um, and there you dealt with, um, and, an internal contractors and essentially I would have been associating with, you know, I, it sounds, it sounds bigotive, but, you know, the lowest forms of, of life in terms of the people you're working with, you know, being, um, you know, pure laborers, lowest level laborers and, and whatnot and it's just, I remember even, I remember saying, gees, you know, all's I'm going to do is say fuck and shit for the rest of my life if I work with these people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I, I went [DEIDENTIFIED].  I, I'm, you know, I'm, and, and I know that this is only one aspect of the business and that's not where I wanted to be.  So I, I moved into the office jobs and that's clearly not what I want, I, you know, what I, I'm suit, well suited for.  I mean right now I'm going to the office and basically I'm in and out.  You know, I'm [DEIDENTIFIED], but they give, I'm allowed to do whatever I want in the office.  I'm finding basically I spend about 6 hours in the office and that's it.  I'm finding also too lately that I come out of that, I, I go home and now I'm starting to hit the couch right away and sleep for an hour and it's been many years since I've had to do that.  That was when I was depressed that, I mean the office just exhausted me.  So, but one of the negatives was when I was doing that the first time around was I was getting high all day too.  You know, I didn't have discipline in that.  So, you know, that was undermining me constantly too and, and that's not, that not being the case now, you know, I feel much better about it.  Much, much better about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have to, I have to find a way of pinning these guys down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, uh, I imagine the jobs that they're going to do for the next couple of months are, are already committed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But then you'd want to start in January booking stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, exactly.  So between now and January would, you know, they're paying me, you know, I'm on the payroll for whatever, you know, the retainer's going to be and, and, um, um, and, and honestly I'm always thinking out of the box.  And I, the package that I'm kind of thinking in my mind is, is really kind of, you know, probably be unusual for them, but may be very attractive to them.  For example, you know, let's say they give me, you know, a base salary of $60,000.  Um, I'd, I'd knock it down to $50,000 for the first year, but I would want them to get me a vehicle.  The vehicle I have has got, you know, almost 200,000 miles on it and it's a beast.  It just tears through gas.  One of the things he said is they'll pay me like 45 cents a mile or whatever it is and, you know, everything, everywhere I drive, that's where, you know, that's, um, well, I'd probably could pay for a vehicle with, with that eventually, but, um, you know, it doesn't make sense to me.  Say give me a credit card.  I'm going to say give me a credit card for gas.  It just doesn't make sense.  Um, so, you know, I, I have to structure some things with them and, and negotiate a little bit, but, um, I'm trying to bring it to a head.  I'm trying to tell them that, you know, I, I need to do something soon.  Either with them or someone else.  Kind of pulling a little bit of a sales deal with them, but it's the truth.  I need to, I need to nail something down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the peace of mind that came with the, with the true promise was incredible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I would try and get it worked out [INAUDIBLE].  I mean, um, I can't imagine people spending that on that.  What if, I always see [NAME OTHER] as kind of Bohemian.  I guess the wife is not, but would it, what do they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I, I, you know, I don't know.  I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He had a house in [DEIDENTIFIED] and a farm in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.  Um, but, you know, just, just when you go to [DEIDENTIFIED] or, you know, when you start putting in, you know, stone patios and, and, um, you know, huge stone patios and swimming pools and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And retaining walls and all that stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it, easily, you know, easily $200,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The pools that these guys build are $100,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, I, I know what you mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it all, I guess so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're not talking about shrubs.  You know, that's the, that's the easy and cheap part of it all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, um, it's all the, it's all the other stuff.  That's what it is.  It's all hardscaped stuff.  You know, everyone, almost everyone wants a pergola.  They want, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A built—in fire, uh, you know, one of those wooden structures that almost looks Greek, columns, with columns and, and have, would have, you know, just lattice on the top, heavy lattice on the top.  It gives you sort of, you know, it articulates the space for you and makes it a little more of a human space and gives it a little bit of shade and throws some interesting shadows, those kinds of things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so they, um, tentatively we've got a meeting for Monday.  Um, I saw the e—mail from him on that and, um, and I asked.  You know, I, I almost started running.  I mean even my [DEIDENTIFIED], I called my boss since and he said listen, I've got this perspective job, I, you know, I, and if we get it, there's a huge amount of engineering on it too.  So not, that not withstanding my old boss is very loyal to me.  He'll do anything to help me so that, you know, he said, yeah, whatever resources you need.  I, you know, I'll give you somebody to work on for a couple days and, and prepare plans and renderings and all that, but—and I said I was going to do that, um, because they don't have, really have the capability of doing it at that scale and at that quality.  Uh, and, um, I started getting off, going off and doing it and he said, well, what—I said—he said well, send me an e—mail and, uh, you know, of your ideas and then I'll give it to the architect who the, he kind of invited in because he doesn't really know what he's doing, but the architect doesn't either.  He's not well suited to do this either, but he's very big on networking, giving people work that, well, it's not, he's not, doesn't have the right teammate there.  Um, I'll show the architect and, because—I said I don't want him to step on peoples' toes, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, and he said, and, and, uh, why don't you come up with a package that you'd be happy with, um, you know, that you would need to, to, to survive, um, you know, because of the, the time of year and all that and, and, um, send it to me in an e—mail and I'll run it past my partner and I, you know, I got off the phone and I said, this isn't the way to do this, you know?  So I sat and wrote him a long e—mail yesterday saying, hey, you know, this, I've got these ideas; I, you know, I'm very interested, you know, I know you're interested in me, but this is not the kind of thing I want to discuss through e—mails.  I think that we need to sit down and I need to get his partner too.  Clearly his partner, he can't, he's not going to be able to make a decision without his partner too.  So and, you know, I wanted to talk to both of them and, and I guess he more or less agreed.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, we're heading on there.  On another front, my son is, uh, we've re, I've realized through my therapist that my son is learned to terrorize us, basically threaten everything and, and go off completely and, and, uh, you know, get us to capitulate to, uh, like for example, Sunday he was supposed to clean the garage, didn't.  I asked, he asked me if he could do it Monday.  I said okay, but no going out and if you don't do it Monday you lose your phone and that's like kissing death for him.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he didn't do it Monday.  He asked to do it Tuesday.  I said, no, and I told you what was going to happen.  I went into his room to take his phone away, he flipped out and wouldn't give it to me and all this kind of stuff.  So he, so I went down to the room and found out how and I disconnected his phone and, um, of course, the next day he, you know, he freaked out.  That was yesterday he freaked out and, and, and he, the kid's bright.  He found out what our, what our security code is to be able to, you know, work with [DEIDENTIFIED] and turned his phone back on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I immediately turned it back off again and, you know, he called me up with, you know, you walk—I'm sick of this dad.  I don't,  I don't want to be here anymore and I'm going to leave the house; I'm going—you left me and mommy, you walked out on your family, you, you know, he knows all the, you know, he's probably heard it from, um, you know, overheard it from [NAME OTHER] or something like that, but, um, you know, pushing all the buttons.  I'm throwing all your clothes out.  Don't come home.  You know, we're, we're at that level of stress now.  He backed off the phone, but I talked to my therapist right away and she said listen to, you know, he's making his choices; explain to him that you're sorry that he's making those choices; that mom and I are on the same page with your punishment, mom and I are of, on the same page with in terms of the situation and what we're doing; um, it's got nothing to do with you.  You know, if you choose to move out, that's your choice and I really, you know, I think you'll regret it and I, you know, I will always, you know, I'll always forgive you and, you know, when, if and when you think you've made a mistake and she said, this was interesting.  She said, and if you touch my, any of my, any of my possessions, I'm going to call the police on you, you know?  That's, that's what I have to do.  And, uh, about an hour later, he, uh, he went out and I'm sure he went out and got high.  He's getting high all the time now.  Um, and about an hour later when he came home, I went out, and he called me and he apologized and, and now we're going to see how today boils down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Today will be the first day with the for sale sign in front of the house.  So this, this should be interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, suffice it to say that, um, sleeping is very difficult.  Klonopin is, is, uh, you know, I'm, I'm taking more Klonopin than, than I ever have.  Uh, baseline anxiety, probably some depression going on, but I was without my, uh, I was, I was out, without my Wellbutrin for a while.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I ran out, you know, got to the, I ran out, called in a refill to my, uh, because that was one that you refilled for me a little earlier than the last time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So then I ran out before I ran out of everything else.  So I, um, I called the pharmacist and I told her Lamictal, I don't know why, and I got in there and she said goes, you don't want Lamictal, what do you want?  You know, because she knew, she just refilled the Lamictal for me.  Um, I said, oh, it's the Wellbutrin.  I says, I, but I'm seeing you next Wednesday so give me enough and she did.  I'm taking it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now I, I gave you a script for that last time also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So there should have been a refill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I gave you Wellbutrin, I gave you everything last time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you, you sure you gave it to me then because you had just called it in literally days before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, but I, on the side of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So then either I have a script floating around if you did it separately or I turned the script in, but it, now would you have put more than one of those on?  So then they should have had it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean between you and me, um, the, when I call stuff in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, because I'm not in the office—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They, those, they don't always make it to the chart.  So, you know, if it's a controlled medicine and/or someone that I don't feel comfortable with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then I'm more careful about it, but if it's just calling in your [INAUDIBLE], you know, it doesn't always make it to the chart.  So, I, I treat it as if it's a give me and, and, you know, I give you the refills that you need.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the side of you not running out before we meet again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so I have written down that I gave you everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  So and you often combine more than one on a, on a same script.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not going to use Wellbutrin.  What, what difference does it make if I give you more refills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, no, I'm not questioning that, right, I, I'm not.  Um, it was, you know, I'm not, but what I'm saying is, I don't think I had any more scripts to hold on to.  I think you had two of them on one script, so they should have had it in the files.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I, I do write two on a, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and they should have had it on the files—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All things being equal, I probably wrote the Wellbutrin and Lamictal on the same script.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I would think too.  That's what I would think too.  And, and given the fact that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can tell you for sure because Concerta, [INAUDIBLE] and Ambien each require their own script.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There you go.  And it, and, and I know there was two on one and there always is.  So that's what happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was, that's what happened and that's why you, and I had it, they got, oh, no, they didn't get in touch with you.  They got, I got enough to carry me through.  So anxiety is, is, uh, is huge.  Um, I, you know, I'm holding my own, but, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and what's happening with your son's treatment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, um, we, we've, he, he's staying on Abilify and he is now accepting it a little bit more and he's got, and he's on Concerta.  Um, he rebels.  He was rebellious ag, against taking it, but he seems to be, I seemed to have convinced him that it's something he needs to do, so he's doing it.  Um, he doesn't really like the doctor he's going to.  Hey, he's [AGE] now.  Can you take him?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The benefit of that would be that we could talk about it.  You know, he really, he really hates me talking to the doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but he, but that's, that's, would he have a problem?  He, he wouldn't like that.  I mean, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we would take it, I mean we would be discussing it now and he'd come in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'd have to look at the laws because [AGE] to [AGE] is kind of transitional.  In other words, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of pedia—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I think [AGE] is considered you, like an adult.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it, well, let's put it this way.  In, when looking at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now in terms of, of, uh, privacy and I have one other family that I had seen the mom for many years—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the son had had, uh, honestly similar difficulties to your son.  And so I started seeing him in the past year—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's come up that he is concerned that we talk about him or we scheme about him—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Scheme's a good word.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When, when I see his mom.  So I, I don't know that he'd want to see your doctor especially if, when you and I came first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if he'd put that together.  If you don't have a problem with it, I'd like to ask him because he doesn't like the woman he's, he's going—it's funny because she is an eccentric.  Her name is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Do you ever hear of her?  She's, I think she's very well known—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's in [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, she's an eccentric red—headed Jewish lady—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's got this strong little personality—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and he, he just doesn't, he just doesn't click with her, you know what I mean?  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was he seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at one time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  He really didn't like [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] at all and to be honest with you, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had, I, we didn't like him, but he had that, that therapist voice, that very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's a very nice guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't, you know, I'm not taking that, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just, you know, it just, it just turned [NAME OTHER] and he was not accepting that either.  He was not accepting that.  He's beginning to accept.  At camp, he found out that, you know, uh, you know, that some of his friends had it and, you know, one of them was not medicating for the summer and, and we, you know, the, even the counselors and everybody would make fun of him in a very nice way, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Make fun of the fact that, oh, [NAME OTHER]'s having one of those ADD moments kind of a thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is, is he seeing someone who's in network?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  And, and she's brutally expensive too.  Um, anyone in network is not American, anyone—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the entire, through the entire 8 alternatives that they, they give you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On what insurance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Aetna.  Aetna.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah,  it's hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is properly, uh, I've seen late adolescents, but I, I usually kind of sort of, you know, do college age and up.  Uh, we, the first, the first thing would be whether he'd be open to seeing [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and that's what I'm saying.  Well, actually, the only reason why—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how would he feel—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He would have adequate privacy because he would be entitled to it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, so that's one hurdle and then the other would be the child is very difficult.  Who else could we have him see here that would be good?  What's the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, according to everyone, this woman is very, very good.  Um, just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good with medications and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes, medications.  Now, um, you know, my therapist is willing to see him, but she says I want complete control.  In other words, she wants to, she wants, you know, will have him, uh, you know, go through drug rehab right away and all this kind of stuff, you know, really kicking his ass, you know, play the tough love thing which quite honestly we're finding he's, he's starting to work on our end.  He started smoking cigarettes and he regrets it.  It's, he's, he's smoking a great deal and I know he regrets it.  Um, um, he's got tremendous anxiety.  He's got—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It would be very hard to get a kid that age who's so unhappy to not smoke pot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Damn right.  I wrote the book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wrote the book and he is, you know, and I, and I rec, and I told him that if he just would, you know, buy into the idea that he's got a problem and that the reason why he's smoking the pot the way he is is because he's uncomfortable, as I put it, in his own skin and I was always told by my doctor, someday you'll be comfortable in your own skin and I didn't understand what it was until it happened one day.  And, um, he seems to be buying into it all.  He really does.  Now she's got him on I think 10 mg of Abilify and I think, and I think he should be up to, you know, about 30, whatever it is.  I don't know.  That's, that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think he ought to be higher?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, absolutely.  He's still got the, he cannot control his anger at, at all.  I mean, you know, just an outburst.  He, and I, and I know what's going on.  That's why—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you really think he has both bipolar disorder and ADHD?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do.  I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, because it's always, it's very difficult a kid that age there's always the turbulence of just, you know, that age too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, where does adolescence start, stop, and problems, you know, start/stop.  Um, but he, if it weren't for the pot right now, you know, and, and then his outbursts and he's, he's obviously going through some difficult issues here at home.  I think we blew it with having him go to that school.  I mean his self—esteem went down the tube because, you know, he felt like a big loser, you know, with, amongst all those other kids.  He was much more, I don't want to say much more intelligent, much more capable, um, and they did not give him what, what they needed.  It was therapy is all they were giving him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we could have gotten that anyway.  Um, one of the things is that he does not appear to like drinking too much.  So far so good there.  Um, but pot is, is, um, is, I understand it completely.  I understand what, how he acted yesterday; I understand why.  I know I had, I would constantly have these feelings like I, I had absolutely no control over a situation and, you know, the, the, the fight or flight came out, you know, but you shut off my phone.  That's, you know, and fight or flight would come out at a level that was just, you know, frightening at times.  I've come to understand I, we were frightened of him for a while.  I've come to understand that it is a lot of, you know, intimidation is what it is, um, and it's not right, and he's remorseful about it.  Um, so I think, you know, I think personally I think that you could do pretty well with him and, and me at least telling you the, you know, what we're seeing at home because he does not explain very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now one, like he went to her office one time and expected to come out with, um, anti—anx, anti—anxiety, anxiety meds because somebody had told him that, you know, that's what he needed.  He's anxious; he needs that.  So he thought he was going to come out, out with Xanax or something like that and this stuff is not doing anything for him and I'm not sure that it is, I mean it's doing something.  We did see an, a, an improvement when he started taking it, but now he needs more and he's, when he did this research online it's for bipolar—I don't have bipolar disorder, blah, blah, blah, blah, and, uh, I explained to him that, you know, these medications have different uses and, and he's accepted that now too.  Um, he's taking more responsibility for himself.  Um, he is.  You know, at a pleasurable level.  He's, he's waking up for school, it's something I couldn't do—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But see, let's see if, um, hmm.  Well, you could ask him about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could see if there are other, other people that would have more expertise with teenagers.  All right.  So let's, let's, um, we'll think about that one, but let's figure for you too.  So the [INAUDIBLE] and Lamictal we're going to leave alone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Concerta, you're taking one a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Ambien you're using how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you give me one a day.  I have been using it, um, quite often, you know, pretty much every day for the last several weeks, um, because well, and I try not to because I know that A, I, I have a hangover in the morning.  It's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I have realized that now, but I do.  It's harder for me to wake up.  And there's definitely memory loss, you know?  It's the overall memory loss with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE] down a half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe.  Maybe.  Now these are CRs so, you know, we can't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.  Actually that's what you used to give me were CRs and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I, I, I thought it was—I had written down Ambien 10 mg which isn't CR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Maybe it isn't then.  Did you ever give me CRs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm looking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe not.  Maybe I'm, I'm mistaken.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To give you an idea, this is, this is interesting.  My son was not, he has difficulty sleeping, but at times, he sleeps, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it was regular Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And CR would be worse because it would be more apt to cause the hangover.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Um, and I, and I offered my son a, uh, an Ambien.  I said, [NAME OTHER], you know, I'll tell you what, I'll give you something to help you go to sleep tonight and he didn't want it.  He didn't, he didn't want to take, you know, the medication.  It's really kind of interesting.  Uh, I will tell you this and I probably should—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We, we had tapered off the Ambien—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A while ago.  The last time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we gave you Seroquel and then you felt too tired with that and then we tapered off of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm starting to lose what, what we've done in the past [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, no, but, um, rather than give you Ambien, is there a role for giving you more clonazepam?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we were doing that too and, in fact, we were doing that before the, the, um, Ambien and it was only when I was saying, hey, you know what, now I'm starting to have trouble with sleeping again that you put Ambien back into it, into the mix again and it was as, on an as—needed basis and, and I still use it.  I, last night I didn't use it.  I try to really force myself, um, you know, not to need it and not to use it, um, but, uh, uh, I, I'm concerned—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm concerned that the, the clonaz, clonazepam inject, even during the day at this point is not doing what it needs to do in terms of dosage.  Um, I, I find myself, I, I, I find myself a lot like leaving one in the car because I'll come out of like a meeting or something so wound up that it's just, um, it's like a cat in a cage that I used to experience way back when.  I'll, I'll give you some, an interesting thing that—now we're jumping, but help, if you can stay with me for a little bit.  My son, uh, supposed to wake up on his own.  I was, you know, he asked me to wake him up early one day, I did.  He flew off the handle at me, you know, angered, you know?  I said, [NAME OTHER], you know, I'm not going, [NAME OTHER], I'm waking you up that's it.  He missed his bus, can you drive me?  I said, no, I'm not going to drive you.  Um, and, uh, so he, he stayed home from school.  That's, that's the consequences.  But I had to go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, and I said, [NAME OTHER], take a ride with me, you know, come down to [DEIDENTIFIED].  And I used it as a reason, an excuse, and an opportunity to have him listen to driven—to distraction.  I'm sure you know the book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I have it on CD just so that, I've been trying to get him to understand what it is that he's dealing with and I gave him a half of a clonazepam and gosh, if that didn't put that child into a place where I could talk, he would sit, he would talk with me, he would, he would, he'd engage as opposed to constantly—and I remember this with me too.  Constantly not being happy where you are and, and wanting to go do something else, anything else, um, including getting up, standing up and walking away.  He doesn't know why or where, but that's what he was doing.  Um, that was very telling to me, um, that obviously whatever we're doing isn't enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, he, he's complicated also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He is very complicated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's very complicated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's such a sweet child in there too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if I, what, I mean I don't want you to feel that you need to take a clonazepam.  You know there are other ways to deal with stress other than taking a clonazepam tablet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean you could take a walk or you could talk to somebody, but, you know, there's other things that you could do.  So I don't want it to become too much of a focus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I understand that and I don't either.  Remember, I was even an advocate of getting rid of it when you were saying, no, let's not, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but we've gone considerably higher since then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm still not, you know, I would say that I take 2 mg every other day, every third day.  You know, I'm only 1, 1 mg a day but there's times like in the afternoon if I come out of a, just an average meeting, um, and then I have to segway into something else, I have to still perform, I am, I am, well, you hear me talking now, but I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does, does that help with sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it cause less memory loss than Ambien?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think, I think that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why don't we just have you taper off the Ambien.  You know, use a half as needed until you're done with those, but, um, just utilize the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's essentially, that's essentially what I am doing and it's only when I'm really, that's not working that I would actually take a, I mean I, it happens sometimes where at about 1:00 in the morning I realize, [PATIENT NAME], you're not, you're not going to sleep tonight and, uh, and I know taking an Ambien is not good because that's going to be rough in the morning, but I, I've got a choice, what am I going to do?  I'm going to see the sun rise and then not be good in the morning or get to sleep and I, I will, I'll take an Ambien at that point.  I'll tell you what, I'm going to leave you for a moment here to think about this.  I need to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or else we're not going to get anything from your end.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How you going to pay for the prescriptions if you lose your insurance coverage?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, credit card.  We're just, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would urge you to continue the Cobra.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, we are trying, yeah, we're, we're, we're, yeah, you're not urging me.  It's, it's, it's, we don't really have an alternative.  Between me and my son, it's, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because it's going to cost more to not have it with the medications that you're taking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But basically the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?  What if someone gets sick?  What if someone has an accident?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I know.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I wouldn't bully these people, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What?  The, uh, job?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I would, I would just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Believe me my therapist is in the same boat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I would, I would just convince them how, what a good job you're going to do for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's exactly what she said too and she also said that I need to recognize if I believe that the sec, that the guy I'm dealing with does not really have the authority that when I do sit down, but I will probably be working and, and answering directly to him, that when I do meet with them all, that I really show, you know, the utmost respect and, um, and, um, loyalty to, not the, not the president, but the vice president that I'll be working with so that the guy's not, you know, doesn't feel threatened by me and that he understands that I respect the chain of command if it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.  I remember now, there was confusion about the Lamictal.  You were taking one twice a day of the 150s.  Remember that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I, I did, I did do that.  Now we're down to 2 100s, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Do you see a difference between 150 and 200?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what, it could be circumstances, I don't know, but it seemed like taking 2 150s was doing pretty good.  The reason why we knocked it down though was because we were, I was believing that it was, um, it was, uh, kind of exasperating the mania.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but the mix, the mix of issues right now is such that I mean I'll have the, you know, I'll have a day that I'm really low and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At one point we came from 200 down to 150.  There must have been a reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were getting more high on the 200?  Is that what you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, yeah, I remember, you know what, come to, come to think of it, I think I remember a conversation with you basically, our conversation went that, you know, sometimes the lower doses will, will effect you in that manner, you know, greater than the higher doses even though there's that manic possibility, it makes since that it, it, it's logical that the higher, the more, the more the side effect, but you said that that's not always true.  Is that possible that we had that conversation?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll look and see what happened here.  Here you were on, okay, here it is.  This is May '07.  Mood elevated since increasing Lamictal to 200 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm taking now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we went back to 150.  So that's why I gave you the 150 and I remember the conversation last time is that I gave you a single 150 so you wouldn't have to break them and blah, blah, blah.  Remember that?  You know so you take 150 and there's no confusion.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So what am I taking now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going, I'm going to give you the 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I have 100s and I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Taking 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you should go down to 11/2—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Until you're done with them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you have to remember that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I got that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	150—11/2 100s and then once you're done with those—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A single 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You, uh, you know, see I take, and I don't save the bottles.  There's something about the, um, I don't know the image of all the bottles, but I have this little tackle box, you know, two—sided flip top tackle box and I took them to the apartment—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I keep all my medication in that.  So I have, you know, antibiotics for my acne, I have [INAUDIBLE] for my gout; I have whatever you give me.  Uh, I'm also taking, uh, fish oil and, uh, [INAUDIBLE] so that, you know, and that, I'll tell you, I don't know if, we talked about this a little bit, but if you haven't tried that routine, I'm impressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every morning, I didn't realize it, every morning I get out of bed like an old man and all of a sudden I realized that was gone.  Gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much fish oil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's one a day.  So I don't know what, I don't know what the, uh—no, two a day, I'm sorry.  One in the morning—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But did you have knee problems or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the gout.  So that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, but, yeah, everything.  Yeah, I mean everything was hurting.  I mean I was, I was, I felt like I played a football game every day and I'd be waking up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like that.  Knee problems for sure.  I have had this one opened up a couple times.  Um, but it was, it's the overall that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Was really pretty incredible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So here's the deal.  So with the Wellbutrin, you take 3, that we got.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamictal you're going to take 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Got it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that you were a little charged up and that's why you're taking more Klonopin and Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You think, what was that again?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think on 2 to 300 of Lamictal, you're a little more charged up and you're taking more Ambien and Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Take [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So go back to the 150 of Lamictal—11/2 until you're done and then a single 150.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's easy, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  The Klonopin I would say a milligram.  Let's do it flexibility.  It's a milligram pill.  You can take half to one as needed up to once like a couple of times a day.  So you could take half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I wouldn't take a whole after a meeting.  If you had to, had to, I'd take a half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I try to take them before the meetings to be honest with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It makes things more co—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine, but I would do it flexibly half to one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always.  Always flexible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then I'm going to have you taper off the Ambien and just if you need it, the Klonopin half to one at bedtime, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's just try and make it more simple.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then the Concerta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My guess is if I don't have to sit at a desk.  I probably don't need the Concerta.  I mean, you know, when I get to that, if I make this change, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do.  I think it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think bipolar's driving most of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then how about taking, you know, how about there's a couple—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just saying, I'm not making, saying make a move now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm saying that's my feeling that, you know, that bipolar's driving most of what I've got going on including the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't there a need to, at some times, to do paperwork or, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll find that out, but even then, it, it wouldn't be at the level that I was, you know, I mean it was, the level of focus that I needed, you know, at, at the other job that I'm doing a little bit of is, was just, I mean it was intense focus all day on everything, just keeping all the balls in the air, you know?  Computer, organization, files, everything.  It's just, it was incredible and I don't think, I don't think we could have done anything that would have really fixed that for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't think we could have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, because in the long run, now looking back, that's essentially what the problem was and I've, and I did better instead of, instead of having, instead of having Concerta, I did better when I was more sedated.  Sedation has, has always been the surviving factor for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine.  That's fine.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I, you know, I don't want, I, I never want to take Klonopin.  I, you know, but it seems like that's the answer for us and, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's fine.  That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I've rebelled against it a lot which, which for a self—medicating pot smoker, you would think that, you know, that would be the answer I would be looking for, but I guess in some ways, I'm looking to go as far away from that as I, as I can, but I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did we ever treat you with Neurontin at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I came in here with was Neurontin.  Wait a minute, yes, and you said you didn't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wasn't that I said I didn't like it.  I said—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More for pain, pain management.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I said it hadn't been shown to be effective for mood swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I was taking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you feel—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I walked in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you feel, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I definitely had benefit from that when I, when I was given to it, to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know, we weren't, certainly weren't working with cocktails like this.  I definitely saw a benefit in that class of whatever it was, but that's, even before we started going into some of the, you know, truly bipolar, um, medications.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I've, I had, I mean it's, it never passed muster when we first started meeting, people were using that a lot on the, the belief that since it's an anti—convulsant would work with bipolar disorder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and it's never [INAUDIBLE] itself as, you know, [INAUDIBLE] studied separating from placebo, but in individual patients it can be beneficial.  I wonder if that, that would be a role for that instead of the Klonopin because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's more of a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's calming and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  In addition to the Lamictal.  Well, it might enable us to eventually get off the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You know what though, in my life right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, all right, we wouldn't it now, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  No, I'm just saying that I, I really think that when I come out of other end and fortunately, let me tell you something, the fact that I'm even saying that that I'm going to come out on the other end is hugely significant, you know, in, since we've been seeing each other.  I, I know that in lesser situations I did not have the capability to think that way.  So I'm, I truly believe I'm going to come out on the other end and when I do, I think we're going to have a whole new game to play, a whole new game to play, um, depending on where I land.  I have major anxiety about really how my son's going to adjust to this.  You know, is he going to accept me, is he going to accept my friend, my girlfriend, um, all those things and if they start to settle down, I mean she, she knows that I have changed a great deal in the last 2 months.  Um, she's a very understanding person.  She's got, actually, she's got ADD, but she's got ADD where she, they gave her Adderall and it was an instant perfect.  I was so envious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Made her instant perfect.  Um, what a focusing animal she is and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, much less complicated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Must less complicated</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's a daydreamer type.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So why don't we stop, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I'm giving you everything—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've had enough of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm giving you everything and, uh, you know,  a month plus a refill except Concerta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would urge you, urge you to keep the Cobra.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm, we're going, I understand that.  It's just that there's no question.  We have to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  My father let his insurance lapse and then fell down the stairs.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As if he's kind of consistent with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With the genetic?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, with, with him at least.  You know, he's done a lot of bad things.  So, um, so I, I feel—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I really urge people not to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's 1,300 bucks a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, it's terrible.  It's terrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It really is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I mean the, the, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I figure I spend $1,300 a month on that and then with the insurance eco—pays and if I were, you know, giving you payments and all that, I spend another like $2,200, another $1,200 to $1,300 a month—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Between, I mean think about that—$2,500 a month in medical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before you do anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before I take care of any other health issues that I might have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's just, it, when I, I try not to think about that because when I do, I start, it starts to real, it starts to get to me.  It's the one thing that does get to me, realizing that, you know, that that's a major reason why I'm having so much difficulties is that a huge part of my, my, um, my resources goes to just trying to earn resources.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Vicious.  Vicious cycle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little problem that, uh, you know, very little is being paid attention to.  You, you know, even in the campaign, right?  You know?  It's just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Little minor problem that, that people in this country are suffering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's a lot, there's a lot of people.  I know we got, I got to go, I've, I've had enough talking to, but I need some music and a calm drive, but I have a friend who's down in, that I see twice a year, he's from Georgia because I, I grade the exams with him and he, uh, very intelligent guy, very, very I mean very detailed.  He's research everything and all this kind of stuff, but he's been trying to have a kid for, you know, many, many years and they finally conceived and they had a child and it was, has all kind of congenital issues.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and they thought, okay, you know, it's been in the hospital for months, they actually got a hotel room next to the hospital and all that kind of stuff.  His, his partners are supportive of him, everything, and, um, and now, now they just found a little while ago that he's got this pulmonary blah, blah, blah that's, that's basically not, it's terrible.  It's a matter of how long, um, and, you know, he's, he's dealing with it and all that, but even before that, I found out that he confided in me because he knew my, because I had talked to him, but he confided in me that I had no idea that this guy would even do this, but he takes a shot, I bet you more than a shot of Vodka in the morning and gets high in the morning right away, gets high during the, during the day just like I used to do and actually the, the booze wasn't even in my repertoire, but I, no one would believe this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No one and, in fact, I just called him on, on the way here and I'm, I'm starting to try to stay really in touch with him and encourage him to, he was, he was thinking about going to see somebody and maybe getting something for the anxiety and stuff and I need to convince him that there's something more than anxiety that he needs to deal with that he, you know, any doctor will never not see that and given what he's going through right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that he needs to, to look at the bigger picture.  He goes, but what if some day I run for president and they, that's the way this guy thinks, you know, and or my health insurance.  I go for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said you don't, you don't need health insurance if you don't take care of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See now that's the [NAME OTHER] affect.  Anyone thinks that they can be president.  You know, even no matter how poorly qualified they might be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, that's this guy.  No, actually, it was before [NAME OTHER] and don't start on that with me.  Don't start on that because I'll tell you, I, there's, you know, I, there's, there's one right ticket this time, there's no question about it.  One's, one's a talker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We disagree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know we do and we have to agree to disagree with it, on this one otherwise, you know, we'll—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we're going to disagree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have to just, but and, and honestly, and I'm sure you feel the same way with me, but honestly, as an intelligent person that I know you are, I just don't get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, ditto.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just don't get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ditto.  I don't know the last 8 years of not, of not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, but no, but that's not what we're getting is the last 8 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We certainly are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But don't, but that's what he's trying to sell everybody, but we're not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is one, this is the one guy that would fuck his own party, that would reach across the lines, that does everything out of principle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's nonsense.  That's nonsense.  He is, you know, he used to, he used to be principle straight talking stress.  He was a decent guy, but he sold himself out to the right ticket [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everybody, you have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the other side's done the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, look who he chose as a running mate.  This woman is not qualified—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I love—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's not qualified to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I love—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mayor [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why?  Why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's an idiot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's, she's not from this century.  She's, she's in enigma.  She is to [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The problem is, the problem is these are, the people from this century are corrupt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She is to women what [NAME OTHER] is to black men.  She's like one in a billion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And don't tell me that as governor, she's not qualified.  I haven't, I haven't heard this yet, but they, they, to be vice president, but Clinton was governor and that was his only qualification to become president.  That was okay for them to make a gov, a governor president.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See this is the smartest, one of the smartest presidents we've ever had.  She took, it took her 6 tries to finish college.  She's not a brilliant woman.  This is a woman they say if Russia starts up with Georgia, should we attack them?  Oh, yeah, maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he, he, Obama didn't have as good, as good and, and while he may have been one of the most intelligent and I, and I will agree with you with that, um, he was the least principle and the most morally void, void guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only when it came to sex.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, he, to, today, to this day he sells himself to other countries, influencing other countries.  Um, absolutely.  He made $37 million taking an oil baron over to the, you know, one of the, you know, other countries just to make a deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's very welcome in other countries.  Bush is not welcome in any country.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why is that?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is that?  Because he's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, don't use Bush because I've lost my, I've lost my lust for Bush.  I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is it that every other country wants to see Obama—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the reason why we cannot elect him.  That's the reason because other countries like him.  That's the worse thing in the world.  The problem is, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't go with the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't need to be liked, you need to be respected.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's no longer, it's no longer the Cold War.  It's no longer we have to be feared by, we have to try and compete in the world.  We—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we have to be respected.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We, if we don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not liked, respected.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Respected, liked, doesn't mat, it doesn't hurt you and, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I think he will be liked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ultimately, it doesn't come down to military; it comes down to economics and we're losing the ability to compete in the world.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No question about that, but I think if you, I, I think, um, from an educational standpoint, better or worse, George Bush has done more than many have.  Made the [INAUDIBLE], but, you know what it boils down to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, you know what the bottom line though is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They test kids, but they haven't improved them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's because, that's because of the teachers' unions essentially.  I mean it really is and, and who bats, who's, who's backing Obama bigger than anybody else but the teachers' unions.  I mean there is a major issue.  If you're worried about that, there is a major issue there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a little complicated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's probably the, that's probably one of our biggest problems right now is the teachers' union in this country I believe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think they're problem is too much capitalism and not enough democracy.  You know, there's just so much grieve.  Look at, look at what happened to all these guys, you know, they, they've known, whatever they bring to the [INAUDIBLE] it always go to heck.  They said, you know, all the paradigms are out and that accounted for the [INAUDIBLE], you know, oh [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] financial level too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, and, and, it used to be you had to make so much money to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's the democratic congress that did that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it didn't.  No, I mean they said that this has been going on for years and years and years, but these guys sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Clinton was the one that took all the, all the rules out, away from them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that so?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd have, I'd have to look back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He, he just threw the rules, all the rules out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, I've not heard that before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know, and you know who the biggest, the biggest supporter of, of, uh, of [NAME OTHER] is?  And before he was, he was, uh, nominated, I, he was probably my least liked person in congress believe it or not.  When I heard it, I said, oh, uh, uh, uh, um, is, he, he single handedly, um, one of the guys who is created and is keeping the, the, uh, current status quo of the credit industry, the credit card industry allowing them to do what they do, the games they play.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is all new information to me and like every, you know, if you listen to [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't watch [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I don't watch [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you've got to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you don't watch [DEIDENTIFIED], you don't listen to [DEIDENTIFIED] I guess either which gives you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I watch all the others though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's the exact opposite version.  You hear how all the other guys do all things just, you know, for wholly, political reasons to keep their guns and their money and their religion—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, let's, let's, let's face it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And their power.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're all doing most of what they are doing for political reasons.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the problem is that, that is the problem.  You can't get elected unless you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You sell your soul.  I remember way back when [NAME OTHER], people were asking him to run and he goes, I can't because I'd have to sell my soul in order to do it.  Now I'm not saying you've got to like, I've lost my, I don't like him anymore either, but in this day, I did.  I did like hearing what he had to say, but that was the, that was, you know, that was his principle and it was true.  In order to do it, he would have to take money from others for a favor basically and he did not want, you know, subject himself to that system.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We will have to agree to disagree.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, absolutely.  We need to go out drinking sometime, buddy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We'd be, hey, you ever heard that the [DEIDENTIFIED] movie is out on any DVD or anything like that yet, have you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I saw that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you?  Because that was, I mean I was looking for it for the longest time and nobody was saying anything about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I think it's coming out.  We have to set up another time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One, one month from today exactly at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We, we hung today because I wasn't so busy, but we normally can't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  What do you mean hung?  Oh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean spent more time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah, I understand.  And well, we have to keep politics out of it too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we should.  It's amazing that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's pretty amazing.  I just don't understand how stupid you can be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, ditto.  Ditto.  I mean it's very interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean and this is coming from a guy who truly was the hippy type, truly, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One o'clock?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One o'clock, the, the only, I mean for the first 5 years of my life, the only people I would listen to in terms of music was Bob Dylan, Pete Segar, and Peter, Paul and Mary.  So, you know, I should have been indoctrinated pretty well on your side, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  I don't know what, what, what about being, having a huge surplus and being at peace you didn't like.  Uh, people hated Clinton.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the problem was there that somebody ran into a couple of buildings in New York.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but not, no one from Iraq did that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not going to argue with you.  I am not going to argue with you, um, but again it was, it was Clinton's people that were telling everybody as well that they, they had what, what we were going after and that was all the weapons of mass destruction.  I mean the whole government broke down there, the whole government.  I think, you know what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If we signed up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Read the account, if you read the accounts of everyone who's left this administration, they all say that, well [NAME OTHER] were banging the drum.  They were looking to go.  They were looking for an excuse to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you're even saying that, that, and I'm with you on this one.  They're even saying now that, that, um, Bush had people falsify documents to support the position.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they were determined to go and they took money and weapons and military out of Afghanistan and now that's going back to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For this little joy ride and which was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Joyride.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which was, you know, which is the greatest, you know, foreign policy—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Debacle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Debacle of the modern age.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's, you know, financially and, and ethically and morally it's horrendous, horrendous and all could have been avoided and they were determined to go.  So I think the great tragedy is it took 9/11.  We were attacked by Alchida and they spun that to the stupid American people that we should go attached Iraq.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and you just now nailed another one on the head, the stupid American people.  I think you need to take, you should need to take a test before you're allowed to, to vote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but, but what I try to explain to people when you say how stupid can I be, I try explain to people, the people that attacked us are the people that we should have continued to pursue.  We didn't do that.  We went after this impotent old dictator that couldn't shoot a missile out of his country and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's not what our intelligence was telling us including the Clinton's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, there was faulty intelligence, but you know what, Clinton you know, bombed them a little bit and this and that and they kept him in check.  They, they didn't, even his father put together a coalition of moderate Arab states to say look, you shouldn't attack another country and he was in check.  He was not a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What, I wish, I wish you could get his father to just, you know, to, to truthfully say what he thinks about what his son has done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really do.  I, because that would be the ultimate and, and I don't want to say judgment.  I don't know what the right word is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Objectivity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean truly I, because I know he's got to have some real, he's on, on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's incredible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Clon, clon, clonazepam too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's incredible.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is pretty incredible.  It really is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So for that reason alone, how could you reward the side that's done so much damage to this country?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not a matter of a side, it's, it's really not.  It's, it's an individual and a few people and the side that, the other side that's run—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Run us into the ground is, is the congress and you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But McCain supported them.  He supported it, supported it, supported it, supported it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So did many other people including [NAME OTHER] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They were, they were, they were—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was basing it on intelligence.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, but they were painted into a corner and they were—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you don't run away from this, you finish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] republican congress and president and they were painted, but you're not, you're not, they wouldn't have been elected again.  You're not, uh, patriotic, you're soft on terrorism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, we have to agree [INAUDIBLE].  Do you have any Klonopin around?</p>

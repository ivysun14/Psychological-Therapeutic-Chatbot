<p>ELIMINATING A COMPULSION: HOARDING</p>
<p>STEVE ANDREAS</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN VIDEO:</p>			

<p>STEVE: OK. I'm Steve Andreas. This is Carol. Carol called me last night and told me about her compulsion, which is to collect things, and that's about all I know about it except that also she has trouble getting rid of things. I deliberately didn't ask more about it, because I'd like to do it here with all of you folks. So can you say a little more about to the extent to which, you know-</p>

<p>CAROL: Well this particular compulsion is quite out of control at this point in my life. Two examples: when I go to a conference like this and I pass a table with a lot of handouts, I can't-I have to get one of every one-but not one; one isn't enough. I need two because, you know, maybe something will happen to the first one, or I might want to share it with a friend and then I end up having all these stacks, and stacks, and stacks, and stacks of papers that I can't throw away because they have good ideas in them, and I was just telling Steve that I have some boxes of conference literature from 10 years ago still boxed in different closets and places, and that's just one small piece of this. Another example is stuffed animals. I started buying stuffed animals for my daughter, and now I sort of have this feeling like they can't be lonely, so if I buy a mother bear I have to get a baby bear and so on. I don't know, I have so many stuffed animals in my house. They take up a lot more room than you would think.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK, and there's also something about not letting go of things.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh! It's just excruciating for me to let go of things. I wake up in the middle of the night-</p>

<p>STEVE: So a cup of water doesn't count though huh? (Steve holds out cup of water.)</p>

<p>CAROL: I guess not. That's a positive.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Let's try something here. I've got a couple things here, so how about if you take those into your hand. (Steve offers her a couple of handouts.)</p>

<p>CAROL: Well that's good. I'm glad there's two of them. (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: No. But you can't have these. (Steve takes the handouts back.) You can't take them home. OK. I think that's enough in terms of the current events, so to speak. Now let's imagine you're walking by the conference table and there's a handout there.</p>

<p>From the audience: Louder.</p>

<p>STEVE: I'm sorry. Let's imagine that you're walking by the conference table and you see some handouts there. Is there anything else on the table that you're not compelled to take? Something that's as similar as possible. Like if somebody's pen was there, would you take that?</p>

<p>CAROL: Hmm. If it was somebody's pen, no. But if it was a conference giveaway pen I might-</p>

<p>STEVE: Then you would take it.</p>

<p>CAROL: -take two.</p>

<p>STEVE: Take two? Right. OK. What I'm looking for is a counterexample; something that she is not compulsed about. So let's say there is some scrap paper there or scratch paper or something else that's more or less similar to a conference handout but you wouldn't be compelled to take it.</p>

<p>CAROL: I probably would.</p>

<p>STEVE: You would take that too? OK, well we have to search a little farther. What is it that you would not be compelled to take many, several of to bring home? Is this totally throughout your life completely?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK, we need to find a counterexample. I'm sure you don't pick up everything.</p>

<p>CAROL: Well. Yeah I couldn't pick up everything. </p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: If its too heavy or too big or- (laughter) I mean I wouldn't pick up-let's say on the table somebody left their old Coke bottle. I could leave that.</p>

<p>STEVE: You wouldn't take the old Coke bottle?</p>

<p>CAROL: No.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: Or half-empty glass of coffee. No I wouldn't take that.</p>

<p>STEVE: You wouldn't take that.</p>

<p>CAROL: No.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Well let's try that. I like to get something as close as possible and that's a little bit different but its-let's try for it. So imagine that you are passing the conference table. It might be easier to close your eyes but some people like to do it open eyes; either way. And look at the handouts on the conference table and then look at a half a cup of coffee on the conference table and I would like you to search for perceptual differences between the two. Compare them in your mind's eye and find out how they differ. Because the one pulls at you and the other doesn't. Is that right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: That's usually the case with compulsions. I'm kind of putting that in a little bit. </p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: You didn't say that but- (pause) And it might help if I describe the kinds of differences I'm looking for. One of them might glow a little bit, and the other not. One might be separated from the background a little bit, and the other not. Some might, one thing might be seen higher in your visual field, and the other not. Something like that. Just perceptual differences.</p>

<p>CAROL: Do you want me to speak to you?</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. </p>

<p>STEVE: Um hum.</p>

<p>CAROL: Well, I'm not attracted at all to the cup of coffee.</p>

<p>STEVE: Right.</p>

<p>CAROL: In fact it's disgusting.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Umhmn.</p>

<p>CAROL: But the brochures and the pamphlets, especially ones that are pretty-nice colors. I might take a handful of those.</p>

<p>STEVE: Right. But if you look at them before you take a handful. You're drawn to take a handful of them right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. But before you actually reach out, what are the perceptual differences? Because you don't reach out for the cup of coffee right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Right.</p>

<p>STEVE: So what is it about those handouts that draws you, makes you pull, you know, pulls you toward picking them up?</p>

<p>CAROL: I think its maybe a creative fantasy idea. "Oh I'll do this with that. Oh, maybe I'll go to that workshop."</p>

<p>STEVE: Well. I'm asking something different. I'm sure of that-I'm not denying- </p>

<p>CAROL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>STEVE: That may well be in your mind but I'm looking for something different. I want to know when you look-let's say you have this idea in your mind, "Oh I might-that might be a good workshop" and so on. What is it about when you look at those brochures, what is it that makes it different from the cup of coffee? Because the cup of coffee you actually have a repulsion for. Is that right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: You push it away in your mind.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. But the other pulls on you somehow. Right? Do you feel an urge to, I'm putting those words in your mouth; maybe you don't. (pause)</p>

<p>CAROL: I guess I'm just not able to come up with something solid here.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Do they talk to you? Do you hear something when you look, do you hear something different when you look at the brochures, versus looking at the cup of coffee-half a cup of coffee?</p>

<p>CAROL: No.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Well sometimes you have to fish around a little bit-find out more about it.</p>

<p>CAROL: I was thinking, "Well, maybe there's even a better example because I've been trying to control that at this conference this time.</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh I see. This is the Dr. Strangelove thing. (Steve raises one arm and pulls it down with his other hand.) (laughter)</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah something like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: Maybe a better example would be...</p>

<p>STEVE: OK, let's pick something else.</p>

<p>CAROL: Garage sales.</p>

<p>STEVE: Garage sales. OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: And I have to buy something, almost.</p>

<p>STEVE: So close your eyes.</p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh.</p>

<p>STEVE: You're at a garage sale.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhmn.</p>

<p>STEVE: There's all this stuff, right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. Ummm! (She smiles.)</p>

<p>STEVE: There's old furniture, and there's clothes, and there's ashtrays and there's all this stuff OK? Look around and find something that really pulls on you. Again I'm putting words in your mouth but is that an accurate description?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes. Uhuh. OK, what I saw was an antique crocheted apron.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Great. An antique crocheted apron. Now look around and find something else that doesn't pull on you. </p>

<p>CAROL: Tire chains.</p>

<p>STEVE: Tire chains. Right. (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. I'm getting a little (microphone) feedback I think. So, now close your eyes, look at the crocheted thing and look at the tire chains. How do they look different do you? There's got to be some kind of difference.</p>

<p>CAROL: (gesturing repeatedly throughout with her left hand. One is beautiful, clean, artistic, creative, represents a lot of work, maybe even a connection with the person who made it. Maybe even a fantasy feeling of, "Oh this was somebody's grandmother" and- And now I can be, I'm pushing it a little bit, but now I can be close to her. I mean what went through my mind is, I really- I didn't have a grandmother, so maybe part of the connection to old things is that and the tires are repulsive to me because they're dirty. Tire chains have grease on the box.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now you're telling me quite a lot here, and some of it's quite interesting and I may return to some of it. But I want to know what the perceptual difference is. Given that this crocheted thing is an antique that took a lot of work, that someone put a lot of careful attention to, and the tire chains are just mechanical and they're greasy and so on. Still, as you look at them how are they different? There's got to be a difference. I think. (Steve smiles.)</p>

<p>CAROL: Well, the texture, I mean I-</p>

<p>STEVE: Ahhh! You do it kinesthetically.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. So you imagine touching them?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Great. All right, so you did it kinesthetically. So you imagine touching the crochet?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: And you have a feeling?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: And you imagine touching the chains?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: And that's a different feeling?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. OK and it's not-</p>

<p>CAROL: Cold; warm.</p>

<p>STEVE: Cold; warm. OK. Now how long have you had this? This is a little historical question but I'd like to know how long have you had this? Just roughly.</p>

<p>CAROL: As long as I can remember-although I don't remember doing it as a child.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: But maybe-</p>

<p>STEVE: Just make a wild guess.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. Maybe college age, but just a kernel of it. And then a little more, and a little more, and a little more.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. So it's gotten kind of a runaway.</p>

<p>CAROL: Runaway.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. (to the group) Compulsions are a runaway by the way. It's normal to be drawn to certain things in life and to be repulsed by other things in life. Yeah, compulsions are essentially a system that got running and lost its governor and it just kind of keeps running off by itself and sometimes it kind of collects other things as it goes. OK, so you have the texture. So warm and cold. Is there any other difference besides the warm and cold? </p>

<p>CAROL: Yes. I guess I create fantasies about the apron. (gesturing again with her left hand.</p>

<p>STEVE: Umhmn. Well that's fine, and I'm sure you do, but I want to hear know the tactile-</p>

<p>CAROL: Any other differences-tactile?</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Is there some texture as well?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well the texture yes. I mean even the crochet isn't exactly soft it's-</p>

<p>STEVE: But it's something you'd want to touch. Is that right?</p>

<p>CAROL: I would love to touch it. Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Give a name to that texture, whatever it is. It doesn't matter-just a code name.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: It could be "blue" even.</p>

<p>CAROL: Art.</p>

<p>STEVE: Art. OK. Art. OK. Great. Now I already asked you just off stage if you had any objection to getting rid of this compulsion. Do you have any objection?</p>

<p>CAROL: Not any that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Are there any that you're unaware of? (laughter) Weird question huh?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well if I did get rid of it, my house would be pretty empty.</p>

<p>STEVE: Uh huh. Your house would be empty. Uh huh. You'd need something to fill it.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: I promise you that what we'll do here will give you a way to fill your house with something that is better than the stuff that you've been collecting.</p>

<p>CAROL: Thank you.</p>

<p>STEVE: Is that a deal?</p>

<p>CAROL: That's a deal. I believe you.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Good.</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm counting on it.</p>

<p>STEVE: All right. Good. Now I wantto take this cup out of your hand so you can use both hands.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because you just-mostly gestured with your left hand, but you would touch them with both wouldn't you if you were actually at a flea market or something?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. </p>

<p>STEVE: OK. I would like you to put your hands where you can easily do that touching thing. (Carol moves her hands as if touching something attractive, and smiles.) And first I need to give you a little warning though.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: What I'm going to do here is to increase the feeling compulsion for a while and then something will happen, and so don't worry if it increases, that's good. That's what we're up here for. OK?</p>

<p>CAROL: Um hum.</p>

<p>STEVE: So I would like you to feel that warmth in your hands and that soft texture? OK? Got that? (Carol moves both hands as if touching something.)</p>

<p>CAROL: I changed to a velvet item. Is that all right?</p>

<p>STEVE: A velvet item?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Sure. OK, so velvet?</p>

<p>CAROL: (softly) Velvet.</p>

<p>STEVE: (Steve reaches out both hands, demonstrating what he says.) Now what I want you to do, I need you to do this repeatedly a whole bunch of times. So I want you to imagine, if for instance my hand were the velvet item, is that you would feel it and then pull your hand away, and then feel it and pull your hand away, and feel it and pull your hand away. </p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: And do it, you can just do it in imagination.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh. Oh I see.</p>

<p>STEVE: This is just for teaching. OK?</p>

<p>CAROL: I see. OK. OK. (Carol moves her righrt hand as if feeling something repeatedly.</p>

<p>STEVE: And I want you to do it as fast as you can.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: And repeat it a whole bunch.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Only faster. Just a little quick touch and then away. Quick. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go. Yeah. Now do it even faster if you can. And the warmth? Feel the warmth as well as the texture? (Carol takes a deep breath)</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now let's pause. How was that for you?</p>

<p>CAROL: (sighing) It was nice. It was a little-</p>

<p>STEVE: A little too fast.</p>

<p>CAROL: A little too fast. </p>

<p>STEVE: Faster than you would rather, right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Well we have a purpose in doing this. OK now I want you to imagine again looking at that velvet item at the yard sale. What's it like now, as you look at it?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well I guess it's not quite as attractive.</p>

<p>STEVE: Uhuh. Thank you. (laughing) Now if you still like it you still have the-</p>

<p>CAROL: I still like it.</p>

<p>STEVE: -choice of buying it at the yard sale. But do you have the feeling of compulsion that you had just a little while ago?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: You do?</p>

<p>CAROL: But it's lessened.</p>

<p>STEVE: It's lessened?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: Let's do it again then.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Do this and you know you don't have to do large motions. It could be just a little bitty thing like "Ah" like that. (Steve gently touches her right hand briefly and repeatedly with his right hand.)</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Over and over and over again.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: As if you were doing it to the velvet.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. See if you can do it even faster, and feel that warmth and the texture; that soft texture. Over and over and over and over again. (pause) Great. OK. Now take a deep breath and pause again a little bit. Take a look out at the folks here for a moment. This is just a little interruption-or not so much interruption as a pause-and I'll explain why a little later. OK. Now imagine looking at the yard sale again and again there's a velvet item there. </p>

<p>CAROL: Can I change it to silk?</p>

<p>STEVE: Sure. (laughter)</p>

<p>CAROL: Silk.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Are you still compulsed to get it?</p>

<p>CAROL: (surprised, emphatic) Nooo!</p>

<p>STEVE: Good.</p>

<p>CAROL: I like it though.</p>

<p>STEVE: Now let's try a teddy bear.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: And now what I'm doing now is generalizing. </p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh.</p>

<p>STEVE: So try a teddy bear and find out, what I'm doing is finding out how far it's generalized, because it might or might not have generalized to teddy bears, to workshop brochures, and so on.</p>

<p>CAROL: Uh. I think it has generalized to teddy bears.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great.</p>

<p>CAROL: Its cute, but I don't really need it.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now if you see a really nice teddy bear at a yard sale there's still-there's nothing to prevent you from getting it, if it's a really special one, or you have a special friend to give it to. (to the group) But what we're after is eliminating the compulsion, so she doesn't end up with closets full of teddy bears that nobody ever gets to hug.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh they do get hugged.</p>

<p>STEVE: They do get hugged? By you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Good. Now try conference brochures now. You're passing the conference table.</p>

<p>CAROL: (Carol shakes her head.) I don't even want to stop at the conference table.</p>

<p>STEVE: Sounds good to me. Sounds good to me.</p>

<p>CAROL: Walk right on by.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Great. Now I'm going to pause and talk with them (the audience) for a moment.</p>

<p>CAROL: Sure.</p>

<p>STEVE: You're welcome to open your eyes and listen, and do whatever you want, but I'm going to do something else with you though because this is only part of-I mean-so, I'll just talk.</p>

<p>STEVE: Now this is a nice example, because usually you can get a compulsion in the visual system; most people are compulsed visually. And often elements are such things as brightness, or closeness, or zooming in, something like that. Often there is a figure-ground difference. Sometimes the compulsed things-things that are compulsions-glow, and that's what gives you the feeling. </p>

<p>And what we're doing here is using what's called a threshold effect. If you blow up a balloon a bit larger and larger and larger, it gets bigger and bigger and bigger until it pops eventually if you blow it up big enough. And what happens here is we're using in this case the tactile, kinesthetic system; the touch-which is like seeing, in that it's an experience of the environment. The feeling of compulsion is different, it's a meta-feeling. It's a feeling about the touch. It's a response to the touch or it's a response to what you see or what you hear. Now the kinesthetic meta-feelings have more duration. They last longer. So by either changing, by either repeating the visual image or the auditory or the kinesthetic as we did here, each time you do it, it builds up a little kinesthetic and it doesn't have time to go back down again. It's like anger. If you get angry and someone says "Oh I didn't mean it at all" you don't just suddenly get unangry. Right? You still have all those hormones in your bloodstream and so on. So we, what we do here is called the ratchet method where we just keep going one, two, three, four, five, really fast. By doing it fast you can build it up, and at a certain point it goes over a threshold, and it's gone. </p>

<p>Now unlike most NLP methods-this is an NLP method invented by Richard Bandler, or discovered or developed-and most NLP methods create a new response, or they create a range of responses, but they put in something new. This is unique in that it doesn't. All it does is eliminate an old response. Now there's nothing, as I've talked to you, there's nothing that says that you can't still buy something at a yard sale.</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm thinking about the silk dress.</p>

<p>STEVE: Thinking about the silk dress?</p>

<p>CAROL: But I'm not compulsed to go back in the same way I've felt before.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Well that's what I want to hear. Because if I erase, if I did something to totally erase her desire for silk dresses or something like that I would not consider that productive. But hopefully now the compulsion is gone.</p>

<p>CAROL: It is, because this is a beautiful silk dress, beaded, and I might go back in my mind but if I didn't, it would be OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. </p>

<p>CAROL: Which is quite different from the way I've felt in the past. </p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Sounds good to me, and you appear very congruent about it as well. Now I need to ask this question just because I'm following the guidelines here: Do you feel any sense of loss not having this?</p>

<p>CAROL: (deep sighing) Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Can you say a little bit about that?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well, it's not at all like it has been in real life where the loss has just-</p>

<p>STEVE: Have you had a lot of losses?</p>

<p>CAROL: Excruciating. Many.</p>

<p>STEVE: I had a hunch about that. You had a lot of speaking about, well you said a lot of things in describing compulsion about loss and emptiness, and how your house would be.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. And I find that when compulsions have to do with kinesthetic/tactile that is very often the case. Now I see that these losses are not resolved for you. They're still alive in you. Is that right? (Carol begins to tear up.) Yeah. Now we don't have a lot of time here with the camera but I want to promise you that after this is done, oops, I think we got too close we're getting microphone feedback. After this is done I will do a process with you that will help you with that, with the losses.</p>

<p>CAROL: Thank you. (almost crying) Thanks very much.</p>

<p>STEVE: And, well, maybe I'll get a time check; we might even do it here if you'd be willing.</p>

<p>CAROL: (hesitates) OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Would that be all right with you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now let me pause and get a time check. How much more time do we have? 40 minutes? 30 minutes. (pause) OK, are you willing to go for it.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK great. So this is going to be a back-to-back video. I would like you to think of a loss that you've had-the worst one. Just pick one, it doesn't-and you don't have to go into a big thing if three of them were all equally bad, then just pick one or something like that. And I don't need to know about it. I just want you to identify it.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. I'm trying to. OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Now was this a person?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now I'm just going to refer to this as "the loss." That's all right? </p>

<p>CAROL: OK. Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: So we don't have to give them the details. They're nosy; they'd like to know, but we won't tell them. (Carol chuckles) Now I'd like you to think again of a counterexample. Think of someone, perhaps from your childhood that you've never seen again, perhaps a childhood friend, but when you think of them you have a sense of them being with you. A sense of them being present with you. Whatever nice relationship you had with that person, that person was with you, is with you now when you think of them. Do you have one of those? </p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: You're nodding your head. OK great. Now I'm going to call that "presence"-just again a code word.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: So we don't have to go into who it was, and all that stuff.</p>

<p>CAROL: Exactly.</p>

<p>STEVE: Now I want you to compare how you experience those two. How you represent them differently. Often they will be represented differently in space. They might be represented different visually. Often one will be a distant picture and one will be like life-sized together with you. Could you tell me a little bit about those? And does someone have a Kleenex that we could have?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well you know, I think maybe I picked a bad example because-</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: I was kind of embarrassed to say that I couldn't find anybody from my childhood, who was really present with me, so I picked a second grade teacher that I liked, but I don't know if she's going to work.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: First grade teacher, yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: Miss Lutzy (chuckles)</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. When you think of this teacher, what is it like?</p>

<p>CAROL: It is a really warm feeling.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great.</p>

<p>CAROL: I think I was-</p>

<p>STEVE: That's fine. It doesn't-</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: That's fine. That will work.</p>

<p>CAROL: Good.</p>

<p>STEVE: So you get a warm feeling when you think of-</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Lizzy is it?</p>

<p>CAROL: Lutzy. </p>

<p>STEVE: Lutzy. OK. Lutzy. "Teacher" will be easier for me to remember. Is that OK?</p>

<p>CAROL: Fine.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. So you're getting a warm feeling from the teacher. Now again we have- concentrating on feelings, is it tactile as well?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: So you feel a tactile-</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. And is it like feeling that persons hands in yours or like touching her somehow?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well I kissed her a lot.</p>

<p>STEVE: Kissed her a lot?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah, so I can still feel her cheeks and..</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Wonderful. OK. Good. Now what I want you to do is think of the lost person. And I need to check something first. When you think of the lost person, give me a little bit of information about how you think of them. Well let me be more specific. Do you think of them in one of the good times that you had, or do you think of the break up or the time when the loss occurred or something like that?</p>

<p>CAROL: I don't think of the good time.</p>

<p>STEVE: Ah! Big mistake. Now, it's a common mistake-very common mistake. Now what I want you to do, and there's two steps, and I want you to listen before you do them, so don't jump ahead OK?</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: The first is I want you to think of a time when things were going well.</p>

<p>CAROL: Can I switch people?</p>

<p>STEVE: Sure. (laughter)</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: So this is another loss, right?</p>

<p>CAROL: This is another loss.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK good. Think of a time-now remember don't do it yet until you get the whole information.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: So I want you to think of a great time with this person, a time that embodied all that you valued in that relationship. Now initially this may make you cry because probably you'll represent it distantly. But as soon as you get that content, I want you to bring it in, in the same way, so that you can feel the tactile here, that you can feel the kiss or the hug or whatever the tactile connection was with that person, so that you can have that person in the same way as you have the teacher. Is that clear?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. You have your mission. Go ahead.</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm doing it but you want me to close my eyes and-</p>

<p>STEVE: Just do it, yeah. So you're doing it already?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: Do you want me to talk?</p>

<p>STEVE: Do it some more. No, just enjoy it. </p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh. Just-</p>

<p>STEVE: I don't need to know anything unless you have any difficulty. (pause) Because I want you to have that same warm connection that you have with the teacher.</p>

<p>CAROL: I have it.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great.</p>

<p>CAROL: Even better.</p>

<p>STEVE: Wonderful. Because this is a mistake that people make when they lose an experience that's important to them-whether it's a person or whatever, that's the most common one-that they think that they have to lose the feelings as well. Those feelings were yours and you deserve to have them throughout the rest of your life, as a resource to carry you forward.
The person is gone; that we can't do anything about I guess, but those feelings were yours. And by remembering the break-up or the end of it, or the death, or whatever, you robbed yourself of having those feelings. Now there's one more thing. Are you OK to go on?</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm fine. Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Great. Now there's one more thing to do and that is, you had something wonderful with this person right?</p>

<p>CAROL: Um. Yeah. The best.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Now what I want you to do is take these feelings of wonder and this relationship and whatever, and I want you to think about what were the values in that relationship. So some people value spontaneity, other people value dependability, some people value the kinesthetic contact, and others how their partner looked, and intelligence or humor and etc., etc. </p>

<p>CAROL: OK. Yeah it was the-</p>

<p>STEVE: I don't need to know the details.</p>

<p>CAROL: All right.</p>

<p>STEVE: Content will confuse me.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: So imagine those or represent those in some way separate from the person themselves. So this is something wonderful you had with this person. I want you to somehow separate those wonderful values, those qualities.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. And now take those qualities into the future and imagine, and you can imagine tactilely, you can imagine, auditorily, you can imagine visually, how might those values be actualized into the future? How might you reach out to others in search of other relationships like that one that you had. They won't-they will be different. People are different. People are incredibly different. But still there are lots of people who enjoy humor, there are lots of people who are dependable, there are lots of people who have whatever qualities you had with this lost person.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: And do you have pictures of that as well, or is it all tactile? </p>

<p>CAROL: Um.</p>

<p>STEVE: You have pictures?</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Because I'd like you to do one more little thing. How many pictures do you have?</p>

<p>CAROL: At least one.</p>

<p>STEVE: At least one. Let's make it more than one, and here's a magic way to do it.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Take one of those, take that one picture and make it glow and sparkle and then imagine that it multiplies into a deck of cards but as it multiplies, it will become a little bit different in each one. So the one might have been a female and the next one might be a male and the next one might be a child, different context, different possibilities, different ways that you could actualize this.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh this is fun.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. It's a great one. I love this piece. One of our colleagues here in Los 
Gatos, Robert McDonald, invented this little piece, and it's wonderful,</p>

<p>CAROL: It's great!</p>

<p>STEVE: So you have a deck of cards?</p>

<p>CAROL: Actually two of them.</p>

<p>STEVE: The best is yet to come. You can do a double deck if you want. (laughter)</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah, always take two. (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: OK now take this deck of cards, and just imagine actually that you had it in your hand. Close your eyes and wherever you keep your future, toss these cards out into the future so that some of them will land fairly close, some of them will land farther off into the future so you can so those little glowing, sparkling cards. You may not be able to see the content very well, but you'll see them sort of leading you off into the future.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. I did it. (big smile)</p>

<p>STEVE: Isn't that nice?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. It's great. (softly) It's really nice. </p>

<p>STEVE: Right. Now I want to do a little testing. Imagine you go back to your house and you have these rooms full of old brochures and stuff like that, are they still relevant to you?</p>

<p>CAROL: No.</p>

<p>STEVE: Would it be easy, you might want to keep some of them, but is it easy to kind of-I mean every once in a while I have old mail that piles up and at a certain age date I just throw the whole thing out and other things I sift through, and so on. Does that sound would be easy to you to do? Just imagine doing it.</p>

<p>CAROL: I couldn't quite use the word easy.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: But possible.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. What would make it easier for you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well, it might make it easier to picture that deck of cards, those two decks of cards and all the wonderful experiences that they would contain.</p>

<p>STEVE: Uhuh.</p>

<p>CAROL: And to get this other stuff out of the way.</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Keep those cards in mind. Good. And that's exactly what this little card trick does. Is it keeps people focused on other things. Yeah, cleaning out is, you know you could get somebody else to clean out for you. Have you ever thought of that?</p>

<p>CAROL: I've tried it and it didn't work.</p>

<p>STEVE: No, it didn't work in the past.</p>

<p>CAROL: But maybe now.</p>

<p>STEVE: Try it now. Imagine it now. </p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: In fact let's play a little thing. Imagine someone who's a possible someone to be in one of those cards that you could invite over to help you trash out some of this stuff.</p>

<p>CAROL: Um.</p>

<p>STEVE: You could do two things at once.</p>

<p>CAROL: Um! Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: That the very process of getting rid of things could be part of re-engaging.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. Yeah. I can see that and feel the fun of it.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Looks good to me.</p>

<p>CAROL: Looks good to me.</p>

<p>STEVE: Is there anything else you would like here? We've already done more than we originally agreed to, but I like people to get greedy.</p>

<p>CAROL: I was feeling greedy, but I didn't want to say it. (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: What would you like? I don't know if I can provide it but-</p>

<p>CAROL: Um. Well, I'd like to really, really enjoy the process of the dumpster getting full and the bags going out, and the garbage truck comes and I say to myself, "Ten bags this week".</p>

<p>STEVE: "Ten bags this week"?</p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Well and you'd like to enjoy it more?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. And I want to get rid of the fact of either the nightmares which I have a constant nightmare of trying to take care of my things and move them and they won't fit in the suitcase-</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Now imagine right now you go to sleep, close your eyes. Are you going to have a nightmare?</p>

<p>CAROL: No.</p>

<p>STEVE: I don't think so.</p>

<p>CAROL: No. OK, the other thing I want to get rid of is I don't want to have second thoughts "Oh my God did I throw away that red shirt?" and go back and start looking for it.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Close your eyes, and imagine, "Oh my God did I throw out that red shirt?" At the same time pay attention to those sparkling lights, the reconnections that are going to draw you forward.</p>

<p>CAROL: It works.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because if you think of those, the red shirt or the blue shirt doesn't matter, or no shirt.</p>

<p>CAROL: Really.</p>

<p>STEVE: Let's do one more thing. You love those card things. Let's do it again.</p>

<p>CAROL: Um.</p>

<p>STEVE: Think of another way you could reconnect and actualize those. I mean make another picture and make another deck of cards and spread them out into your future wherever your future is. Because I want your life to be full of sparkling, glowing lights.
I want everybody's life to be full of sparkling, glowing lights.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. I'm picturing myself flying into the future and dropping them off.</p>

<p>STEVE: Uhuh. And some of them won't work out, and some of them will, but you know where you're going.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Now imagine you're going through some of that stuff in your closet, and I want to integrate these even more. All those teddy bears you have, you could go to a children's hospital, individually, not just drop them off at the door.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh what a good idea! Oh I would love that!</p>

<p>STEVE: And go from bed to bed.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh that would be the greatest!</p>

<p>STEVE: And in that way begin to reconnect with other human beings more.</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh that would be the best!</p>

<p>STEVE: Now that was- (to the group) I got lucky right? (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: Can you think of other ways to do that? In other words, as you're cleaning out you think of who could use this. I mean the old conference brochures probably it's the dumpster right? (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: But in terms of clothes or other things or silk dress-</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Think of someone who would really enjoy it, and rather than mail it to them or send it to them or something like that, present it to them personally.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because they might be one of those points of light.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm. Yeah. That would be just so wonderful. I would love doing that.</p>

<p>STEVE: And will you love doing that?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah, I will love doing that.</p>

<p>STEVE: Verbs are important.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: So if you just imagine the job of cleaning out now, how is it like for you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh it seems to go smoothly. Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Is there anything else you'd like at this point? I think we don't need these (pack of Kleenex) anymore. Whoever gave me those, thanks. There's a key in there or something, better retrieve it.</p>

<p>CAROL: Maybe a stronger connection with the pleasure of giving it away because one of the things I've been-an example is, my daughter is 11 and I have boxes of costumes for her. Every princess, queen, gnome, you can imagine. And she's probably not going to wear them.</p>

<p>STEVE: Um hum.</p>

<p>CAROL: Formal dresses, bride dresses. Queen dresses. And there's a good friend of mine who's a play director. Bring her the whole box.</p>

<p>STEVE: Umhm.</p>

<p>CAROL: Boxes.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Imagine doing that. What's missing?</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm imagining it. It's great. I'd love it.</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh OK. I thought you said you wanted a stronger connection.</p>

<p>CAROL: Well I wanted a-I wanted even more of that feeling of delight, of giving it away.</p>

<p>STEVE: Let's try it out. Imagine you go to this person and you say, "Gosh, I've got all this stuff," and you watch the look on their face, and then touch them in some way that would be nice too. So you could go up to them and say, "You know, I've got all these costumes I've been saving for years and you know you have this thing" or whatever you would say, just imagine doing that so you make contact.</p>

<p>CAROL: Um hum.</p>

<p>STEVE: And you hear that person's voice. And the tonal qualities of that person's voice.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: How could you amp up your pleasure? It looks pretty good to me already.</p>

<p>CAROL: It's great. Maybe I just want to-you know-redo it or something.</p>

<p>STEVE: Well, there is a way to amp it up.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: Keep your eyes closed.</p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh.</p>

<p>STEVE: And imagine, this is going to be quite a tape I think. (laughter)</p>

<p>CAROL: Thank you. </p>

<p>STEVE: I'm going to do a lot of stuff here. (chuckling) Feel the feeling that you have of pleasure in meeting this person. Are you there?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK, great. Now can you feel that feeling? Its probably mostly in your trunk area or your chest.</p>

<p>CAROL: It's all over my body. I'm just tingling.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Now.</p>

<p>CAROL: And I want to kiss her, just like that kindergarten teacher.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Now all that tingling and that warm feeling, imagine that it's a wave and that its waving through your body and every time it bounces off your skin it gets even more intense. And just keep doing that until you're satisfied. (long pause)</p>

<p>CAROL: Could you give that direction again?</p>

<p>STEVE: Sure. Take that feeling that you described as tingling and pleasure.</p>

<p>CAROL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>STEVE: And the words don't matter at all.</p>

<p>CAROL: Right.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because you know what that feeling is.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah. </p>

<p>STEVE: I may never know, but that's all right.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: And as that feeling moves through your body, allow it to move through your body, and every time it comes up against your skin-so let's say it started in your tummy and went out through your rib cage and when it meets your skin it redoubles and bounces back.</p>

<p>CAROL: Back inside?</p>

<p>STEVE: Like a wave in a harbor.</p>

<p>CAROL: Ahhh.</p>

<p>STEVE: So that it keeps bouncing around in there and moving and increasing every time it meets the exterior of your body, it comes back in doubled.</p>

<p>CAROL: It's good. (paue) It's very nice.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Looks good to me.</p>

<p>CAROL: Looks good to me. Feels good. (laughter)</p>

<p>STEVE: Now I would like you to think of your friend again, the one that you lost. What's it like now?</p>

<p>CAROL: It's OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: I want it to be better than OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: So do I. (chuckling)</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Do you remember how you went back and you transformed it over to that presence so that they were with you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Not exactly. </p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Then we better do it again- because I see tears, and that tells me it didn't stick. OK. Do you remember the teacher?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: And you have the tactile?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: And the presence that's like they're right there kissing you and so on?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: You remember that mapping over?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Do you have any objection to having your-the lost person-in the same way that you have the teacher?</p>

<p>CAROL: Having, I don't quite understand what you mean?</p>

<p>STEVE: Earlier when we did the thing with the-I call it mapping across-where you take the characteristics of the person that you can hold in your heart with love and don't feel a loss from, even though they're not present in your life any more.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: And to have your, the lost person in that same way. </p>

<p>CAROL: Um.</p>

<p>STEVE: Do you have any objection to having them in that way?</p>

<p>CAROL: No. That would be good.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Well, either I missed something or something else is going on, I don't know. But that is why we test. So remember how you had the teacher?</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Close your eyes.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: And remember the good time with that-with the lost person.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: And then have it in the same way as the teacher, so that there's physical contact of some kind. They're right there with you in the same way that that teacher is. Because here all these years you've carried the teacher with you in your heart.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm.</p>

<p>STEVE: And it's been a resource to you. It's been a positive way of keeping a nice good feeling and balance, and just a way of helping build a foundation for coping in the world. And I want you to have that lost person in the same way. And if you have any objection I need to know about it, so that we can deal with that. That just as you have had that teacher for all these years, I would like to have this lost person with you.</p>

<p>CAROL: I can feel that. And I can feel it strongly.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Now do you have any objection to having that on into the future?</p>

<p>CAROL: Um? Not at all.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK.</p>

<p>CAROL: It would be wonderful.</p>

<p>STEVE: It will be wonderful.</p>

<p>CAROL: It will be wonderful.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because there is nothing to prevent you from having that as far as I know, and if some objection should come up either here or later, let me know about it. I'll give you a card or something when we're done here.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. Thank you.</p>

<p>STEVE: Because this is something-you mentioned you had many losses.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yes.</p>

<p>STEVE: This is something that you can do on your own with all the other losses. Or if you want, you know, I can arrange for someone to help you.</p>

<p>CAROL: Uhuh.</p>

<p>STEVE: But it's a very simple thing really, once you know what to do.</p>

<p>CAROL: And could you say the steps once again? </p>

<p>STEVE: Basically you think of another lost person and you think-well let's just do one more.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK.</p>

<p>STEVE: It will help you to generalize. So think of another lost person. And at this point it doesn't matter how bad it was or anything like that, just think of another one. This is just for learning more solidly at the conscious level.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. All right.</p>

<p>STEVE: So when you think of that lost person right now, what is it like?</p>

<p>CAROL: I'm sorry I didn't hear the-</p>

<p>STEVE: When you think of the-let's call this lost person number two.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. All right.</p>

<p>STEVE: When you think of them now what is it like?</p>

<p>CAROL: Well I'm sorry about the loss, but I am able to focus on the fun and the silly, giggling wonderful times we had.</p>

<p>STEVE: Is it like they're with you?</p>

<p>CAROL: Maybe that's stretching it a bit.</p>

<p>STEVE: Well make it like they're with you right now.</p>

<p>CAROL: OK. Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: Right. That's all there is to it. It's really very simple.</p>

<p>CAROL: Yeah.</p>

<p>STEVE: And if you should happen to forget just remember the teacher, and just go back, and however you perceive that teacher, take the lost person and perceive them in the same way.</p>

<p>CAROL: Umhm. It works.</p>

<p>STEVE: It works great. OK. I'd like to stop now, and would it be all right if people from the group asked you some questions?</p>

<p>CAROL: Sure.</p>

<p>STEVE: Great. Would anyone like to ask Carol a question?</p>

<p>(Voice from offstage)</p>

<p>STEVE: That's a question for me. I'd like to save that. First I'd like to see if anyone has any questions for Carol. There's one over there. Oh I think, do we have a mike there or is that not? OK, just do it nice and loud if you can and I will try and repeat.</p>

<p>MAN: I was wondering if you could picture yourself when you were giving away the costumes and clothes of your daughter having other little children see these and pick out one or two themselves that they'd like to wear?</p>

<p>CAROL: Oh, great idea.</p>

<p>STEVE: Nice addition. Yeah.</p>

<p>CAROL: Great idea.</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh I'm sorry. He said, "Could you, Carol, imagine as your giving away these costumes some children coming up and giving them directly to the children, rather than to the play director" and she likes that idea and I do too. That's a great addition. Sure. OK. Any other questions for her and then I'll take questions for me.</p>

<p>CAROL: There's one.</p>

<p>STEVE: Is there one?</p>

<p>WOMAN FROM THE AUDIENCE: I have a question.</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. Sorry.</p>

<p>WOMAN FROM THE AUDIENCE: When you kept changing from the velvet to the crocheted to the silk, what was going through your mind?</p>

<p>STEVE: OK. When she was changing from the velvet, the crochet to the velvet to the silk, what was going through Carol's mind?</p>

<p>CAROL: I kept wanting it to feel better and better. More sensuous, more soft. </p>

<p>WOMAN: Can I ask that question to you? Is that part of the generalization?-that it's OK for the person to move away and its not a way of avoidance?</p>

<p>STEVE: I'm sorry, I didn't get the question.</p>

<p>WOMAN: Is it not, is it-you allowed her to move and change and didn't object to her changing the objects.</p>

<p>STEVE: Right.</p>

<p>WOMAN: Is that the way of generalization?</p>

<p>STEVE: Many people-the question is, let's see if I can get it. "When she moved from the crochet to the velvet to the silk, I was OK with that, and does that have something to do with generalization? She is already generalized this very widely. She collects a lot of different stuff. Many people would only have one thing; pistachios or I don't know what and given that she's generalizing widely I'm quite happy to let her do that. And some people-sometimes people change their minds about what would be the best thing, and I want to get the most robust response that I can, so that we can deal with that one. Because if you get the big one, all the others fall through. If I took a very minor aspect of this, it might or might not generalize fully. So I'm quite happy to have her do that, and she was saying, "Oh I like this better" and so that means its even stronger, and so I'm fine to do that. It's more has to do with the strength sure but it has to do with generalization too and since she's generalizing widely already. And then I test the generalization by you know "Well how about the teddy bears?" and stuff like that, and it had generalized to that and I'm guessing it will generalize fully. And having done the grief piece and particularly assuming that you do your homework and do all these losses and it doesn't take that long right? And if you get tired you can save a few for tomorrow. (laughter)</p>

<p>That was the instigator of this, I'm convinced. I've seen several like this where there were a number of losses and it ended up being a compulsion-not only compulsion but compulsion that was tactilely driven rather than visually. TV is trying to get everybody compulsed all day long;they make things big and they make them bright and they get you to zoom in and all that stuff. All those are things that we do naturally when we tend to get attracted to things, and as long as it doesn't get into a runaway it doesn't become a compulsion. But the tactile one is relatively-it's not as common and in my experience it typically is connected with loss. So it was not a surprise, and she also said a bunch of things, if you go back over the tape, when I was asking her about it-the empty house, if she threw things out, and she was talking about the emptiness, and the warmth and so on so those were all clues. OK, a couple more questions in the far back. </p>

<p>MAN FROM THE AUDIENCE: Have you done this with hand washers and?</p>

<p>STEVE: I have not personally. See I've got a little confession to make. I'm essentially R & D. </p>

<p>STEVE: Oh repeat the question. Have I done it with hand washers? No I have not personally. I am an R & D person. I like to research and develop things and teach things, and then I send the troops out into the world.</p>

<p>MAN FROM THE AUDIENCE: About how many sessions do you use?</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh, just one.</p>

<p>MAN: Just one?</p>

<p>STEVE: Yeah. Now there's one little piece I didn't do with her that's on the sheet and that is sometimes there's a repulsion. Now she didn't have the repulsion to the- Sometimes when you clear up the compulsion, the draw, suddenly it changes and it's a repulsion. This you would find in bulimia and things like that where there are two sides to things. She didn't exhibit any kind of repulsion to the thing. She'd still kind of like that dress maybe, so that's fine. She was a little repulsed by the tire chains but I wanted to go on and do the grief-and running out of time-so I'll check with her later, and see if there's anything we need to do there. But if you don't, you can turn, you know, a bulimic into an anorexic, or something like that, so you need to do both sides if it is there. It isn't always there. Some times if you do this with things like alcohol and cigarettes then often there's a great sense of loss to the thing itself not to the other events that we dealt with here, and then you need to do the grief process with cigarettes, believe it or not, because you can do grief with things too. Yeah?</p>

<p>WOMAN: Do you believe that there is ever a biochemical base for obsessive or compulsive behavior?</p>

<p>STEVE: I don't know that, but I assume not.</p>

<p>MAN: Repeat the question.</p>

<p>STEVE: Oh I'm sorry. Repeat the question. Did I assume there was a biochemical base ever? I have a degree in biochemistry as a matter of fact. It's only a bachelor's but I wouldn't be surprised if there were some. I know there's been some research on dogs for some genetic component or some chemical component or something like that. But I think we're smarter than dogs, and so far our general approach is to see how much we can do without drugs and without biochemical and medical intervention. And of course sometimes that's not true, but we tend to take a more optimistic view. And I think we're about wound up. I will be glad to answer some questions as soon as the video is over. I'll stay around for a while, although they have another group coming in so- (To Carol) Thank you very much. (Steve reaches out his left hand and squeezes Carol's right.)</p>

<p>CAROL: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>FOLLOW-UP</p>

<p>STEVE: I called Carol several months after this session and asked her for feedback. She said that that session had really turned her life around. She still had some other difficulties, but the session had cleared up the hoarding compulsion.

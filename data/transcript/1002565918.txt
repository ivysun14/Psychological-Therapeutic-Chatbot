<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, was she nervous about you dropping out or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she just wanted, was trying to keep up on it.  She wasn't like nervous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just a routine thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just checking on you, okay.  All right, good, um, and you're getting enough sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.  I guess.  Not really, but yeah.  I mean it's not that bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Enough, huh.  Okay.  You're not falling way behind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I can go to sleep when I need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I have no trouble staying asleep, but not that much trouble getting to, like not that bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, like how long does it take you to fall asleep once you go to bed and turn the lights off?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like usually less than a half hour right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which isn't bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's pretty good, yeah.  And how's your energy during the day?  Do you feel like you have enough?  Are you dragging?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, probably enough I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you working out?  You look like you're getting bigger and stronger?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, kind of.  Yeah I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, just lifting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How often are you working out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know, every other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And how long are you working out for when you go into the gym?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, like 40 minutes usually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent, and are you rotating upper and lower body, or you just go in and do a full body workout?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I, I bike like an hour a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just because I mean even if I don't like, bike's my transportation in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like not like running around, just I have to bike an hour a day about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To get to class.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Forty minutes minimum—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Forty minutes just going to class and back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you in the dorms or you live in an apartment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, apartment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and how far away is that from school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it's 5, it's a 10 minute bike ride into my classes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then there's 10 minutes back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ten minutes to class again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it just adds up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well that's good.  That's great conditioning, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good, and how's your appetite, are you eating fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, not healthy, but fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A lot of junk food?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How many guys are you living with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, just one other person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just 2 of you, and so do you guys cook much or not much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, or is it more like fast food or just something quick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not fast food.  Like we, I, like we go to the grocery store and buy stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's not really cooking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's more turning on the oven and putting something in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, the microwave or whatever's quick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, that's a pretty normal cause.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So [PATIENT NAME] it sounds like you must be able to focus and concentrate pretty well if you're getting mostly A's.  You feel like you can, or is it a struggle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean in class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it's really hard in class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like when I go to class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well I drink a lot of coffee sometimes just, uh, not just for the energy, because it helps me focus in class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, like most of the times when I go to class, I don't get much out of class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I can't pay attention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I, I've been like reading the textbooks, which is all right, but I mean, I don't know.  Like I can focus if, sometimes like if I can get into it really, but it's hard to, to do that, and I can't do that with class.  Like with reading a textbook—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like when I read something—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anything, just textbook, if I get into it, I'm not going to get sidetracked, I can get into it.  And, but like when I'm into it, nothing around me like I won't even notice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how much coffee do you think you're drinking a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know, like 3 or 4 cups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well like throughout the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, so it's tough—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't drink it every day either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like it's not like if I don't have it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So it's harder to focus in class.  It's easier if you're just reading out of the textbook, is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, kind of.  I don't know.  I can focus reading.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, that's true, but that's not, it's because I can, I can only focus, I don't know, like I can't, in class I just, I get, like for example, the, like the other day it was, um, what happens is basically like the, like in physics, I'll give you an example, he talked about, you know, he wrote this formula on the board and I started to derive it with calculus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, like because I was paying attention and trying to do this, and then 10 minutes later, I'm like where I am, like I realized that I have no idea what's going on in the class and I totally like spaced out.  And then it started out with it just like doing this thing, but I didn't take 10 minutes.  That took 30 seconds, but after that it was just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom like and then 10 minutes later I'm like oh crap, I got to catch up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's how, yeah, that's how class works for me is that every 5, 10 minutes, I mean to, to be like all right, you're going to pay attention, and then I lose it again and then I have to catch up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is really annoying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  Okay, what about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it makes perfect sense.  What about, do you find yourself feeling anxious much these days or not too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean kind, well yeah, but not too much compared to, to usual.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just the [INAUDIBLE] a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm always a little anxious [INAUDIBLE].  It's not that bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, do you worry about stuff a lot or not too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What kind of stuff do you worry about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's, like still the social kind of, kind of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean obviously school too a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like when I got that B it really stressed me out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, even though I know it shouldn't, it does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What's your major?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, math.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not because like a B is a bad grade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It just, it just stressed me out because it's not as good as an A.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What were your grades last year?  What'd you get?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I had a 3.6 for the year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you did pretty well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I missed 2 weeks my second semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And still got a 3.6?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's real well then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What was your GPA in high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, pretty bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three one maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I didn't, I did not care at all in high school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just didn't really apply yourself that hard, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're obviously pretty bright, so it's just a matter of staying focused it sounds like and, and trying.  Which high school did you graduate from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I graduated in Massachusetts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.  Um, so and was it a public school or a private?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Public.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, so, um, so it sounds like if you try to focus it's tough, but you can do it.  I mean obviously getting As, you can do it, it's just a struggle to stay focused especially in class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  I mean kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, like I can, like I can never really like, I don't know, like I cannot stay focused.  The best I can do, like with the, when I'm like reading a textbook, I don't know, like that's kind of different just because I can, I can get absorbed in the world, but unless I do that, I total like, it's either all or something kind of I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  It just, it's like, it literally is like every class.  It's like 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every 10 minutes I'm trying to like catch up, like because I've been off in my head daydreaming for the last 10 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which sucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about, um, are you getting some enjoyment out of things you're doing like when you go to work out, do you have a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Enjoy yourself, if you're hanging out with friends, do you have a good time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't really have very many, any friends out there in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your roommate, is it somebody you knew before or is it just somebody—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just found?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, yeah, someone [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, just you found them like in a paper or something somebody looking for a roommate or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So are you starting making some friends like in classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet?  Okay.  Um, that makes it harder then if you don't really know anybody, doesn't it, because I'm thinking if you want to go do something fun on the weekend to a degree—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean when I, I mean when I say I'm not anxious, I mean that's relative.  Like when I go to class, I sit in the very back of the class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I won't, that's so that I can get out of there as soon as it's over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so that, because it's just when everybody's like up and around, it makes me uncomfortable to be like, that's, that's what does it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I know I'm not being very eloquent right now, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You get what I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Like if what if you're going to like, um, have to give a talk in class or a lecture or a speech or something, does that make you nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.  I mean I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't have to do that ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's no chance of that [INAUDIBLE].  You don't have to give speeches—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In math.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're not taking communications classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you or would you avoid taking those classes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would not take it if I had to, to give, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like that alone would be a reason to avoid it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and also like if you wanted to run for like student government and had to give a speech, would you avoid it just because you had to give a speech?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.  What about like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean not just giving, I wouldn't even, there's a lot of reasons I would avoid that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But a speech is one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I wouldn't, I, not just, I don't know.  I guess a speech is the only time I have to get up in front of people, but just to have my name like I wouldn't want to be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What about if you went out like just to a party on a weekend and there were a bunch of people around, would that make you nervous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So just being around people.  Would it be true if they were strangers or friends?  Would that matter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean strangers would make it, but friends, that's, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's okay with friends—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean a little more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just with the strangers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] nervous.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean if it's friends, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're still anxious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'd be a little worse, but yeah, I'll still, I'll still, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So really any social situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where you're around a lot of people, you just get more anxious, is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's not bad right now like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I can, I can go to class even if I sit in the back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like I, I like before like last year I mean I would skip class just because I didn't want to have to, just because it making me nervous, not, I mean not because I had anything better to do, I just didn't want to get anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I just avoided it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Um, what about, have you had any days where you got real down or felt like, felt suicidal or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I mean you have some down days, but do you ever get some thoughts of not wanting to live or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, so what else are you doing for fun, anything besides going to the gym right now?  Just studying and going to the gym pretty much?  Do your roommate—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do anything with your roommate socially?  I mean do you guys go out and see a movie or anything like that or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean, I mean I talk to him and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't hang out together and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's his major, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's undeclared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And is he a sophomore?  Okay, so does it seem like he's the kind of guy that you might get to be friends over time or is it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, like I'm, like I mean I talk to him, like I get along really well with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Is he the kind of guy you'd hang out and do stuff with later, do you think, go to movies or go to concerts or something or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe.  Okay.  Um, let's see, what about pot, how much pot you smoking these days on average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About the same like 2 times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and, um, about twice a week—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 3 times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two or 3 times a week, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Usually like sometimes after I come from the gym, that's one time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And how much do you typically smoke when you smoke?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know, not an unreasonable amount.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [LAUGHING].  Well I mean like a bowl or a few bowls or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a, a couple bowls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A couple bowls, okay.  And do you smoke by yourself or does your roommate smoke too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, usually I smoke with my roommate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, and do you feel like the pot's causing you problems at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean not, not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, in terms of making you less motivated or do you feel paranoid after you smoke or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean no, not really.  I mean I know how pot affects me, so it does have, I mean affect me, but it's pretty predictable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what, how's does it affect you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well I don't know, it just relaxes me.  I do get a little more anxious sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but I mean, yeah I mean [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But not, just mentally it'll make me anxious more sometimes, but it'll, it'll, I'll get really relaxed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you ever get like full blown panic attacks after you smoke pot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, that's rare, but some people do.  Usually if they do, they stop smoking pot because it's just so unpleasant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, what about, are you drinking much these days, beer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, not at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or just rarely?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I drank once in the last month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had like 3 beers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three beers like in a month, okay.  Uh, so not very often.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and use anything else, any coke—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meth or anything like that?  Okay.  Okay.  Have you had the opportunity?  Is the stuff around at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean has anyone showed it to me, no, because I'm not going out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I'm in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [LAUGHING] here it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING] if that was my goal, it'd take me like 20 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you just stayed away from it.  Do you have any desire to use any coke or anything these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean if I did, like I said, it's not hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go to the hill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's what I hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And what is it?  I've heard of the hill.  Do kids just hang out there and do stuff or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like right across from campus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's got all the bars that everyone goes to and like shops and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Oh, so it's, it's actually a business area?  It's not a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A hill of grass or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's like, it's a business district.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, right, literally right next to campus.  So it's just got all the college bars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so what, what is it, I mean because I know another kid that was up there that was getting into some pretty heavy drugs up there, and he said you go to the hill to get them.  What do you guys do, do you go to the bars and ask some kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't know.  I mean I don't know exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just saying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You haven't gotten into that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know in 20 minutes on the hill, I mean look for a hippie—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just start asking.  That, that would be the, that's, that's not how he does it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because he's the, I mean if you, that's what I'm saying is that's all it would take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I've always heard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I don't even know anyone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was just curious because I've heard other kids, you know, who are students up there, they said yeah, all you got to do is go to the hill and you can get whatever you want, and I was just man, how does that work?  So I guess it's just you just go ask for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well the hill is just, it's just where everyone hangs out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So there's just so many people there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see, okay.  Um, so let's see, what else?  Anything else going on that I didn't ask you about yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it sounds like you're not getting depressed off the medication.  That's good news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, are you feeling like you still want to stay off medication or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or are you feeling like, and I guess for depression it doesn't sound like you really need anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about for the concentration and focus?  Do you feel like you're doing well enough that you don't want to take medicine, or do you feel like you want to [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or for the anxiety?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I'm, like I'm getting good grades.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just because I have nothing else to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not because I'm focusing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Um, yeah.  So I mean I, I'm not happy with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So would you like to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The only thing I want to say—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About that is that well one is the setting off the, making the anxiety worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I know that sometimes treatments for it, because treatments for anxiety or, um, treatments for ADD and anxiety are kind of opposite.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they can exasperate each other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's kind of my concern obviously you already I mean know that, but I'm just saying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the one, not just [INAUDIBLE] but that worries me like that's what should, because that's, that's the thing that I really can't handle is when my anxiety gets out of control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like it does feel like I can't, I can't do, there's nothing I can do about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let me give you some options, and the options would be to do nothing with medication, just not take anything.  That's one option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Second option would be to take something for the anxiety and then if when the anxiety's more calm or stable—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's fine right, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not expecting it to ever go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I can feel, it's at a manageable level right now is what I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, so you don't feel like you need medication for it.  The other thing though is if you, if you took something just to keep it under control, then you could take something for ADD if you wanted to, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or you could just take something for ADD and not take something for anxiety and see if the anxiety stays at a manageable level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean that's what I think I'd like to do, like, um, do and I mean if it, if it does, I'll just stop taking it and then we'll figure something else out.  Maybe I'll take something for, but I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean at that point if you need to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean that's what I'm saying is that if because I, I can't, I couldn't, I mean it's not going to do me any good if I can't pay attention in class or I can't do anything to upset my [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so then the question is what do we use for the ADD.  I mean there are basically 3 major types of medications.  There are the stimulants which we'd want to try to stay away from, Strattera or Wellbutrin.  Have you heard of Strattera or Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I, I can't really remember what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"That's okay.  Yeah, Strattera is, um, it's been out quite a while now, several years.  It's a non stimulant ADD medicine that really helps people focus and concentrate, usually doesn't increase anxiety.  I say usually, it's possible.	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean like I'm not, I'm not like it's not a big, like a huge thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like if it sets it off, I'll just stop taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not, I'm not like, like totally scared like oh God, stay away from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Basically I'm just saying if it does make, I'm done and like no more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like that's more important to me is not having anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got you.  Okay.  Well Strattera's a good one because it usually works pretty quickly.  It usually is very safe, doesn't usually cause a lot of side effects.  The main side effect it had years ago when it first came out was a lot of people got nauseous with me, and what we realized is we were starting people on too low, too high of a dose, so now we start people on a low dose and build it gradually and almost nobody gets nausea now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's almost eliminated that side effect.  So the good news is most people don't really get side effects with this.  It usually works pretty well.  It works for most people who try it, not everybody, but most people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they just find it's just easier to focus and concentrate, and it's real simple, and, and we can adjust the dose.  There's quite a wide dosage range.  Um, uh, what else about it?  Um, so again, if, if you get nausea, we just have to back off and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Increase the dose a little slower, or take a lower dose.  If you take it too late in the day, it might keep you awake a little bit at night, but usually you take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you need to, you can take a second dose midday.  A lot of people don't need to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Once a day is often enough.  Um, what else can I tell you about it?  Um, well let's see.  I've got some samples even I can give you if you want to start on some samples to see how you feel on it before you get a prescription.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Want me to get you some samples?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That way you can try it out and see what you think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin is an antidepressant—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but also—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the bell that rung and I was like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's used for a lot of other things.  It's used for ADD.  It helps people quit smoking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, isn't, isn't Wellbutrin like not related to any other drugs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a whole new class.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's an interesting one.  It's not approved for ADD yet, but we use it because we know it works for some people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Strattera I think is more effective for more people—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to give you like 4 different strengths so you can start low.  Um, let me just give you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	An idea here.  The maximum dose is 100 mg a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We used to start people at 40, but that's where people got nauseous all the time.  So now we start you like at 18.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what you can do is you can try the 18s for a week.  If they're working, call me and let me know, I'll call in a prescription in for you.  If they're not working, go up to 25's.  If 25's don't do it, you can go up to, um, go up [INAUDIBLE] some 40's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You go up to 40, it doesn't work, you can go up to 60.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, um, so try it for a week before like moving up or down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because even though it should work the first day, even though it should work the first day, sometimes it just takes a week to really see what the effects are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, to, I mean to see [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so usually you'd want to give it about a week at each dose just to get a sense of how you feel on it.  Um, unless you have any problems, then you can call me, but I, I don't think you're going to have any problems with this.  It's real unusual for people to have side effects when we increase slowly like this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can just start with the lowest dose, and give it a week and go up until you find a dose that's working pretty well, and then you can call me if it's one of these lower doses, and then I can call in a prescription for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, um, if you don't, if this doesn't work that well, just isn't working and you go up to 60's and it's still not working, well we'll set up another appointment—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can go higher.  Yeah we can go to 80 or 100, but it's rare we have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most people find a dose somewhere in here that works pretty well for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So any, any questions about that one at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that makes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want me to get you a bag to put these in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To carry them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean if you have one [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And let's set up an appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Within a month or so to make sure this is working.  And if you have any questions [PATIENT NAME] in the meantime, just call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now having said that, I am going to be out of town next week on Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"So, um, but just for, you know, just for the —	"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The weekend, long weekend, but, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you had questions during that time, you could either call my office and get the number for the on call person or you could just stop it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean I'll figure something, I mean the only reason I'd need you on those days is if it's an emergency.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it's an emergency, I'll, I'll just call.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right, there's someone available if you need, if, if your, uh, hair turns green or something, you know, there's somebody available.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing is if you need a prescription for it, you know, if you find like the 18's are working great—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you want to stay on that dose, you don't want to increase it, just call me by next Wednesday and let me know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and then I can call it in for you.  You could always call the on call doctor, but it's just easier if you just give me a call.  So, okay, any questions about that at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, let's set something up maybe within 4 weeks then just to make sure—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is working okay.  So let's see here.  Today is the [DATE].  So 1, 2, 3, 4.  So something by [DATE].  Um, remind me, is there a time of day or day of the week that works best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, how about 7:30 on Thursday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seven thirty on Thursday, we can do it and we can do that on, uh, we can do [DATE].  Does that sound okay as far as you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah it should be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll just come the night before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, that's good.  Now what time do you have class on Thursday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eleven.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Today I have class at 10:00, so I'm going to haul ass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll get you out of here.  So that's Thursday [DATE] at 7:30.  Okay, there you go.  All right, so if you have any questions, give me a call—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But hopefully this will just help you focus better and make—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	School a little bit easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's not like there's the material that's hard or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  No, you're obviously bright enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just so fucking frustrating going to class—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like all my classes are like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I can't pay attention long enough, it's extremely, you know, like it just sucks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right [PATIENT NAME] take it easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

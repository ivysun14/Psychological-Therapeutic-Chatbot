<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you?  Oh, Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Homemade goodies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're welcome.  A little bit of each.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hot or cold?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cookies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, cookies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And candy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.  How are you today?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, how are you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  The snow is not too bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wait till later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's a bad accident down on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Smashed, 2, 2 vehicles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Just now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just as we turned off of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just happened.  You saw it happen?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's been there a little bit.  Nothing serious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They were putting the tires up, towing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Doing nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's tough weather.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, everybody wants to be first.  Can't wait.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess they what, predict about 3 to 6 inches.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's what they're saying, 3 to 6.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's cold.  You're doing okay.  Your mood seems bright though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The winter doesn't get to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like being outside when it's cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You don't like being outside.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I do.  Not when it's as cold as yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what was it, 4 degrees.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went out for the mail and I thought I'd clean off, you know, some of that ice on there.  I went out for the mail and paper and came back in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  It was too cold.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Too cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You worked yesterday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you can be happy in this weather, you're, you're cured, so.  Is she doing good?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm exercising too.  I want you to know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  I knew that would help a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three nights a week, 30 minutes, well maybe 35 minutes with that jazzer, jazz exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Doesn't that make a difference?  Don't you feel better mood wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I still have trouble getting up in the morning because I do the exercise maybe at nighttime because, you know, nighttime comes fast, so you want to get the work inside done, and we've been doing, baking cookies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You and your sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, she's come over to your house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she picks me up and she takes me there and then he picks me up on his way home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he's not that far from my sisters.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And it gets her out of the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you back to 5 days a week or no?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, with remodeling going on, but they made me take my vacation, so I had to take it all this month since they screwed around most of the years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you needed to get it done by the end of the year?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.  They're being jerks about it, so fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're on vacation this week?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I've been taking days.  So I took the first week of the month and then 2 days this week, 3 days a week, 2 days a week, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have any left?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.  I told him I'm going to be first week in, uh, January too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you could do that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, they don't want to, but I told them I'll take the whole month off.  What do you want to do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why are they doing that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's just how they are.  Everything's too difficult to, uh, administer anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They won't let you carry it over.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You can't carry it over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They won't give you the money for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, oh they used to do that, now they don't do that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, they won't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> In fact, they would have had to give me more time, but I told them, you know, as a partial solution, why don't you pay me for all the family days I took earlier in the years that's not compensated time, they'll get rid of the vacation days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they do that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, it took them a month and a half to decide.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if there's renovation, don't you need to be there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, that's part of the problem.  Well, they had no assistant there for me for 6 months.  That's their fault, not mine.  How am I supposed to go on vacation when there's nobody there?  I can't leave people there alone for two, a week and a half or 10 days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you just take a day here and there.  Well, you like it when he takes the days off, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you spend the days together, but you don't really go out much.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, it depends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We went out shopping together.  We bought him a Christmas present.  We bought me a coat and some slacks that I needed for Christmas, you know, just get stuff we want, and then we were shopping for, um, I'm a great aunt.  I've got 2.  I got little [NAME OTHER] and I got [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, little, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Little [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how old are they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going to, she's the [AGE] one that's going to be [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she better turn better by [AGE] because, my sister said she's getting better, but no.  She got, she got mad about something.  Here's what she does.  She gets mad about something, and she took the bowl of popcorn and she went like this and threw it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's what they do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hate, you said [AGE] are bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [AGE] that was what they said, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Developmentally they improve at [AGE], so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They thought she was, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hyperactive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think she's just, they're not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's really, it's interesting because 30% of people [AGE] and under, children can present with hyperactive behavior, but by [AGE] it falls to 10%.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> What kid isn't hyperactive?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's a high percentage I can say, but, but there is -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> How did we survive as kids?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There is, no, there is a change from [AGE] to [AGE].  There's a reduction.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But what kid isn't?  Like I said, 35 years ago, it's no different.  The kids are the same.  I'm sorry.  If you ask me, it's the adults taking care of the kids that are the problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yeah, not creating structure and limits and things like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They give in to them.  They give in to her I should say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not good.  I mean kids do better with structure.  They feel more secure with structure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She does, my sister said she does pretty good with her because she, she does, like you say -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Structure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She has a paper and crayon, and she lets her scribble.  Um, when we're baking cookies, we let her do some things, but she's really too little to do much.  [NAME OTHER]'s the one that's going to be [AGE].  She can roll the dough and stuff like that.  She can do some of that, and she can put sprinkles on the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they don't live with your sister though, do they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER] gets babysat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> By your sister.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> By my sister.  When, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you're -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] works part time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does she do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, oh, I don't know what she does.  She works at [DEIDENTIFIED] where my sister used to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they've been, um, they've been, she's been working part time too.  She's been working on Fridays and Saturdays.  So she gets a little Christmas money, but, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your sister's been working for [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Through, through the, uh -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Temp.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Temp agency.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  Not her old job though, a different job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's her -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Her old job?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh sure, it's cheaper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She went back to her old job through a temp agency?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Through temp because they only want, need help a couple of days a month probably, so that's how they save money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She said well I, she didn't really want to, but she says it's money for Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, she did it.  And I told you she's got [NAME OTHER] and her husband and theirs is [NAME OTHER], okay, and then their little girl -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they're not the same -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's the youngest one, and the middle girl [NAME OTHER] lives there too.  So the, [NAME OTHER] and her family lives in the downstairs part.  The basement is done up, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there are 3 of them and [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, she's the middle daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, she's a single woman or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's single.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's busy there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you go over how often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not always.  I'm going over Sunday because it's [NAME OTHER]'s birthday.  She's going to be [AGE], so we're praying that she's going to be a little different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you're back to your old self.  I mean you feel stable.  You don't have moods ups and downs anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, like I said, the only thing, he knows too, is getting up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Depakote is very low now.  What is it, 500, right?  Yeah, that's a low dose, but it's enough to control the symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We won't go any lower though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well I'm glad you're exercising though.  That's definitely helps give you more energy.  Once you get up and get going, then your energy's improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Except I don't get up in the morning to exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, as long as you do it during the day, that's all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I do it, I do it during the day, and I, I have, I told you I have a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tape.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> DVD.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Richard Simmons, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  It's, I don't know who she is.  I've never heard of her.  So, but they do jazz exercises, stretches and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you seen her do it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to do it with her or no?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She doesn't want, I sat there one day and she said I was laughing at her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Were you laughing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, I was just sitting there chuckling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's healthy though.  I mean you're glad she's doing it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So nothing else is new.  The economy, you're holding up with the economy or, how are the sales?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Soft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're down.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Slowest they've ever been?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> For me yeah because you got that plus the remodel going on, so you got a double whammy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then they want you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're not on commission base, so that doesn't -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah, I get a bonus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you do.  So that'll be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> But it doesn't matter because it's all frozen anyway because of the remodel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're not giving any bonuses?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well no, they just, they just give you a set amount and that's it, a guarantee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so it's not based on incentive anymore?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, it's a guarantee.  This is what you get, and that's what it's going to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well actually that's better because it takes away some of the pressure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.  Well I prefer incentive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'd rather add more to my pay based on what I do versus just paying me for being there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, this economy though is tough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I made a whole lot more money when the bonus structure was set up where it was paid on what I performed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you don't feel well enough to go back to teach, to substitute again, or have you thought about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't want to go back to that.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I don't want to wake up at 6:00 in the morning, get the telephone ringing at 6:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what, how you would know until the day or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I could, I told you I didn't get my certificates renewed, but I could still sub because you can sub as long as you've got a BA degree or anything better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  In the public schools?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, but not, I did a lot of writing Christmas cards.  I wrote that out and I had letters to write because some of these we only talk at Christmastime and some of them don't want to call because it's long distance, and I don't have computer where you email or any of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you don't have that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How come?  You don't have a computer at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> There's no need for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For e-mailing and stuff.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I call.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Make AT&T rich.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I call.  I make phone calls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You prefer that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At least at Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  The one, she's, she's by herself, okay, so she doesn't have that kind of money to call.  So I call and I talk, we talk for quite a while.  It's okay at Christmas.  He doesn't mind.  [LAUGHING].  And then I got another, a relative that I call at Christmastime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not bored.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, and I only had 25 units of my 100 units, so I have to start making more phone calls.  I have 100 units for a call pack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, and I only used 25.  So I said I'm going to start calling more people.  Get on the phone once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's good for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hear what everybody else's problem and how they're doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.	</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I called my cousin, and she had, I have to tell you this one.  She had 17 teeth left in her mouth and they were loose, okay.  She had all 17 taken off, not by the gas that they, with the needles, all 17.  [LAUGHING].  They told her they didn't think it was a good idea because that's a lot of teeth even if they're loose.  She said no, they went halfway through and she said keep going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, many years ago they used to treat depression by pulling teeth.  There was a theory that if they would pull the teeth and decrease infection -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People who had depression improved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was back way to the 1800's or the early 1900's they did things like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she have a history of depression or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, they were loose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said I'm [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ask her if her mood is better after [INAUDIBLE].  Seriously.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  No, her mood, her mood, her mood -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wasn't a problem before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's pretty good.  She's had cancer and she had a breast removed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, she does pretty good.  She's, in fact, she's, um, working now for [DEIDENTIFIED] and she was working part time and now they want her to work more hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's [AGE].  She lives, oh, she lives up in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Near [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, because there's one right here in [DEIDENTIFIED] I think.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's one in [DEIDENTIFIED] too.  What is it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].  I know the one in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, there's, they're all over, big business.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did you notice the bag I used for you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], went there today because they had butter on sale.  They had flour on sale.  They had, um, eggs on sale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where, at -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, today you were there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they have a lot -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Eggs was $.88.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the one thing that hasn't come down yet in price is food from what I'm looking at.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Food is still up there, but gas, and you know, heating is going to reduce, but for some reason, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, once they get it up, it'll stay up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, actually I hope that comes down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My sister said the cost of peanut butter was so high, and both of the girls that live there want peanut butter and jelly.  I said tell them to just have a jelly sandwich.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's over, at one time, you could buy, I think it was a 16 ounce peanut butter for $.99.  Well, now it's about $2.00 on sale, on sale, but you're right, it doesn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It hasn't come back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Butter is $1.88 on sale.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I know I bought it cheaper than that before this time, but, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to cook for the holidays or your sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my, um, my sister's oldest is going to cook for Christmas and I'm going to cook for New Year's Day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That is if he gets me up early enough.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you'll be home for those days, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> New Year's, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Christmas you'll work?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Christmas they're closed I think.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We're closed Christmas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank goodness.  Otherwise -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well that's part of my vacation, the 4, 3 days after Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then New Years.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And New Year's Day too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Well, you get along well with her family, right, her sister?  So you look forward to it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, [INAUDIBLE].  Let's, uh, let's not go too far.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we, see we have a problem with [NAME OTHER]'s husband because he doesn't work.  He only does gigs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he's a musician?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he does what do you call it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He claims to be a disc jockey.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, a disc jockey.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't think he is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he doesn't do it all the time, and he should have a regular job Monday through Friday, and then do that on the weekends.  Well, he doesn't.  So -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So this guy's [AGE] and he's never been gainfully employed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, does the wife work or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, she's the one that works at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She babysits.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No, she doesn't work at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, she works, oh I don't know what the name of that place is.  She worked somewhere near [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's all I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That works at [DEIDENTIFIED], your sister or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> The oldest daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The oldest daughter.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> This is the youngest one.  She works and he stays home as Mister Mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But now that he's at my sister's house, he wants my sister to babysit while he goes out and has his smokes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When he goes out, he expects my sister to babysit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Unfortunately she does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hey, your sister's really easy going and I can't her objecting if somebody is going to do something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She told me, I have to tell you this.  She told him that he needs to go see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  He doesn't have the money, you know, because he's not working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's something he can do.  He's supposed to be, um, learning disability or some kind of thing.  That's what the mother claims, I don't know.  He looks like he could do something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't they get social security?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I don't know what they do as far as that goes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She can't get social security.  Remember you mentioned that.  She doesn't have enough credits.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's too young or -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> She doesn't have enough credit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You looked into that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It's on her statement that you get annually from social security.  They tell you how much you're eligible for.  She's not eligible for disability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because he didn't work enough.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Didn't work enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I substituted.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well you just didn't work enough years, that's all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is it like 10 years you have to have?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I don't know what the, what the time frame is, but it just says you're not eligible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You could still collect at 62.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And hopefully, hopefully in January, they're going to make it so that the health insurance, the mental health insurance is going to be with the regular insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I heard that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's a law.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's going to be law.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's a law.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It is.  There were questions about -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's definitely starting, and that's a federal?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I think it's federal law starting January 1st that mental can no longer be separated from medical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I remember they were talking about that for years, but I didn't know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They have -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It might solve some of my issues with the insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Because they do it separate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That would be great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because you know they have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh no, I know.  They've been fighting for a long time, but, uh, I didn't know it was passed.  I know they were talking about it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I think it passed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  But you're okay though, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, on that coupon thing, that was good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> For the Stavzor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it worked?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.  It's free.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It covers the co, the copay is $40.00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can use that ongoing then?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  So the way the thing reads, it's good as long as she's using it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Do you need refills on everything, anything?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there were some you said.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> We need the Abilify and the benztropine.  I just refilled the last on those, so, and then the Lexapro's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Samples of that, but you have enough of the, uh, Stavzor.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, there's 2 refills on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's the one that they only had 5?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They're both 5.  I got to wait for it to come in.  Well, we're not going to keep it.  It's too expensive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's 5 mg.  You break them in half.  Is that what you've been doing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have a sample if you want.  Do you have some left?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  No, I got -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's got some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They gave him -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> They'll be in today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They gave him some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  All right, sounds good.  Well, enjoy your holidays.</p>

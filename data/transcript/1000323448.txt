<p>PATIENT:(Silence) One thing that has sort of bothered me about my attitude in what I say here uhm, I think sometimes I'm thinking in terms of what I should tell you because then you can figure me out and then you'll, you'll be sort of the active one I helping me.  I don't know if I'm making it clear but it's almost like I'm not accepting the responsibility of it.  Because very often when I'm thinking about things during the day I'll think well, that's something I should talk about and I think part of my reason for thinking well, I should talk about it is that uhm, it's something that has occurred to me enough so that I know it's either a problem or could lead to something that is a problem with me.  But on the other hand I also think in terms of well, this will explain me better to you and then I'm, then I must be just, you know it's almost like I'm going to tell you everything (chuckle) and sit back and wait for something to happen.  But then I'll say to myself, well, it keeps me able to talk, so perhaps I should look at it that way until I am feeling stronger about it.  Because on the, I think I do at times also feel the responsibility about it and can see how just understanding things better uhm, I can take a certain responsibility.</p>

<p>For instance, this week-end we were with some friends and we were going bicycle riding in the part and we ran into some other friends on the way and uh, the two sets of friends we had introduced previously and one girl had been very anxious to meet this other set of friends again and this had upset me terribly when I realized that.  And I knew it was absolutely stupid of me to be so upset but I, I could see I just wanted to keep each of them separate and somehow I felt if they began to get together I would be the one left out.  That I, I don't know, that I couldn't keep up with them and if I could see them each on their own without the other uhm then they, they enjoyed me, but that the other one would be too much competition for me.  And so when we met them on the way to the park I was very upset but I tried to uhm, well, just not think about it or convince myself I really was being silly.</p>

<p>And sometimes I, I, in the past or probably even now still, very often I would get extremely moody over something like this and then I just end up saying well, I don't care and I withdraw anyway and sort of prove to myself it really did happen that I couldn't compete.  But yesterday I just, just kept telling myself well, it's me and my view of it that's wrong and that uhm, they aren't going to change toward me because they've gained another friend and things worked out, in a way that very rarely have they worked out before.  And that kind of pleased me because it was really one of the few times I've sort of controlled this emotion that I have of, well, it might be something different than feeling that I can compete, but I'm sure that's part of it.</p>

<p>And I do have a problem about competition anyway because uhm, well, just playing tennis or something, as soon as it's a game I can't play.  I just end up practically thinking throughout the whole game, well, if I loose fast then it'll all be over and I won't have to worry about it.  And so I, it's almost as if I'm consciously loosing, although at times I think I'm trying.  And party games and things like that I used to dread and again feel I'd make a fool of myself and that I wouldn't be able to think of things if it were a game involving thinking of something and if it involved acting or moving about in some way I'd decide looked foolish and never enjoyed those at all.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that I, something made me feel very good after being here Friday.  And I don't know exactly what it was.  I think I was feeling a little bit freer about saying things.  And maybe just that feeling that (clears throat), well again it's not really having the courage to say that, but in a way it is.  Because I've always been, well I'd, I'd tell myself I'm afraid of hurting your feelings so then in the end I wouldn't have the courage to just be honest and say something.  And just in terms with dealing with parents and having to tell them something unpleasant about their child or something I know they won't want to hear.  It doesn't necessarily have to be unpleasant and I f—, I find it extremely hard to just come to the point and be very succinct and say it, and I keep beating around trying to think of some other way to say it.  Which in the end I think is kind of confusing to the person you're talking to and doesn't do anybody any good.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you were thinking about Friday and your feeling of fear did you have a particular or some particular things in mind that you felt?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckle) There's one that I still find very hard to say but I think I'm, well, it's going to be on my mind (chuckle) so I'll say it.  I thought after if, if I'd been here long Friday I would have said it.  Sometimes when uhm  I'm not saying anything and the room is very quiet so any little noise will bother me, I sometimes hear something which makes me think you're doing something with your nails and, this bothered me.  And I think the reason it bothered me, whatever the noise was, is because of, uhm, well it may not just be that but whenever I used to be with my older sister and, and she'd be, and I'd be standing in her room saying nothing because she was very unhappy that I was there but somehow she wouldn't tell me to get out.  Then I would start you know, picking my nails or doing something to them so they'd make little noises and she would get absolutely furious.  And I think that in hearing what seemed like a similar noise to me made me feel nervous in the same way she must have felt when I did the same thing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you felt reluctant to say it when you thought it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Simultaneously) I didn't know how I could say it.  (Laughter) Well, it seemed such a personal thing to say and uh, it's one of those things that I've just rained myself never to say those things to people.  And I don't know whether it's out of fear because I don't have the courage if I just, if it is bothering me just to ask somebody not to do something or whether it's just simply because I think in terms of how I felt when my sister used to say those things to me and I don't want to make somebody feel the same way.  It's probably a mixture.  And the other thing would be sometimes when I couldn't think of anything to say, and then my stomach or your stomach would start rumbling and that would be all that I could think about.  But again it seemed like such a personal thing to say.  But it, but leaving on Friday and thinking that well, I referred to my sister at one point because I couldn't come out directly and say anything but I felt I almost was there and it just made me feel very free and therefore very happy.</p>

<p>In fact, that seems to be so many times when I'm not feeling happy it's just simply because I'm not feeling free and uhm, well, it's not that I'm aware that I'm not feeling free but uh, either I'm just not feeling free that I feel under pressure from something or else I'm not sure what it is, what direction I want to take, so I don't feel free about moving.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But even then, whe—, if I'm feeling sort of free or happy and able to respond to people, just, you know, in kind of a superficial way but still more than I sometimes do, uhm, then I'll see MSCZ and I, I go in cycles on how I can respond to him.  And sometimes it just seems as if he's asking something of me that I can't give and I end up withdrawing and being moody with him or maybe being nasty, grouchy or something, and also feeling guilty that I can't give him what ever it is that he's asking from me.  It's almost as if I, if I feel like showing him any kind of love that I want him to accept it and be appreciative but the—, if he's asking it from me or, or if he responds in any way that's at all overwhelming to me, I just have to withdraw again.  And I have to be sort of the one who's initiating everything and if I'm in a good mood then I can get him in a good mood or if we're of there's any kind of physical response to each other I have to be the one too, that is more initiating it.  (Pause) And I think a lot of time too when we're together I'm just, in my mind always this thing that somehow our relationship isn't what it should be and that somehow I'm failing.  And then I just seem incapable of doing anything and I just make it worse.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think too sometimes the feeling I have is just simply that I don't, when I am not able to respond to him then I think well, I must not really love him and I question whether I can really love any one because in so many ways I'm very happy with him and, and, just seems if I can't love him then whom could I love.  But then there'll be a period when I feel I really do love him and (stammers) you know, I don't have any questions and feeling of inadequacy and then it'll, and then I think well, maybe things are changing and then we'll just go back again and it's just this cycle all the time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But something that does happen to me and it's not just in our physical relationship but just in the whole attitude I have toward him and, and the way I treat him if I'm busy for instance, with teaching and uhm out a lot and just have a lot to do, so I have to just kind of make myself keep going.  I cannot really relate to him then and I have to sort of withdraw from him and be cold to him.  And it's almost like he's in my way and, and if I take time to treat him like a human being then I won't get done something that has to be done.  And when I have free time or if I'm not feeling under pressure, because sometimes even when I'm teaching and if things are going particularly nicely and I'm not feeling under any pressure well then this happens too, but then I seem to take time and think about things that might please him and want to please him, I think that's part of it.  I sometimes know I don't even want to, doesn't really even function with me really pleases me to just have him be happy and then I can feel some relationship with him.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Something that struck me this weekend is that there are just time when I just can't open up to him and you know, that's both literally and figuratively.  And it's uhm, I, I just get, it's like a mental block and, and, I can just get past that it's fine but sometimes it means we have to have a huge fight before I can or before having intercourse it just means having an awful time for a while.  Till I just make up my mind I'm going to and then it, even if I know I might enjoy it once I do, I can't do it.  I didn't think I'd ever say that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: The word?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhum, or just talk about it in more of a, in a specific way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And after you fight, something changes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well, it seems like once we're having intercourse (chuckle), there's no point in fighting anymore.  Or I don't know, it's just beginning it that I just cant, say—, sometimes, it's not always, but sometimes I just, I don't know what the feeling is I try to figure out what it is that bothers me because if I know once we're having intercourse it won't bother me, then, then why can't I, why do I feel this way before, right before?  And I just don't understand it.  But it just does seem, that's why I use the word opening myself up to him because in so many ways I withdraw from him and sort of try to keep within myself.  Although I tell him a lot of my problems and things like that, but it's not the same thing.  And, and this, I guess inability to really love him, and at times like this, again, part of not opening myself up to him.  Because in a way, I don't fully understand it, but I think you are quite vulnerable if you do love somebody, maybe not in the way now I think you would be vulnerable, but I still do think in a way your opening yourself up and you can be hurt.</p>

<p>Of course the other end of that is when, well, anybody who ever was interested in me, I never could believe it but when he was, and when he first was telling me that he loved me, I just I couldn't believe it and I'd always want to know well, why.  And I think that's one reason this feeling that I was unlovable made me cling to all those other boys or men that in the end I knew I wouldn't really be interested in or that I knew would lose interest in me because somehow I thought well, who else is ever going to feel this way about me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just wondering if I ever really tried to be loving and lovable to my parents, you know even when I was young enough so I'd still keep trying.  Because I keep thinking back to this feeling that I had of suddenly becoming something different and that whole thing about daring to do things and I think of myself as, as remembering anyway, having sort of an exuberant personality, too the whole thing that goes with it, just being kind of free and daring and adventurous and then I, I don't know whether I really was all that but I must have felt somewhat that way inside in order to think I was.  And then suddenly I was thinking of myself as being fat and ugly and shy and afraid of everyone and inferior and all those other things and why would I suddenly change?  (Pause) And I, I'm sure that whole change happened right around 1st and 2nd grade.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I'm thinking what I did to that girl that I spoke of before, FN, when I sort of lead in ostracizing her from a small group of friends we had.  I was just remembering in, in one of the first three grades there was a girl that was very bossy and uhm, not always that popular with adults, so I would hear it, but certainly not from my parents.  And uhm I can remember one time there were a lot of us walking on one side of the street and we wouldn't walk on the same side of the street that she did and again it was sort of the same thing, she was the scapegoat.  And I don't know how much I had to actually do with the decision to do that but I imagine I must have had some amount.</p>

<p>And then when I was younger, before I went to school there was a girl that used to uhm, play a lot with me and I think she was a little bit younger than me and a much slighter girl and, and sort of malleable and I used to do things, just horrible things to her from what I'm told.  I don't really remember too much, except I do have this impression that she was easy to push around but I'm told I would do things like walk on her stomach, make her lie down so I could walk on her which is (chuckle) again, literally doing something I felt and then, or, she'd have some nice new dress, going to church, and I'd push her in a puddle and you know, just do awful things to her.  And I think I was almost aware then when I was doing them that I was taking out on her what I was feeling because of what my older sister was doing to me.  Because even then she used to push me about a great deal and we had to share a bedroom and it just seemed like I was a little slave of hers and once in a while I'd rebel but generally she just made me do whatever she wanted or just cut me out, depending upon what her purpose was.  In fact, I, it was years later, but at one point uhm when we were having a fight, and we really fought physically a lot, uhm I made her cry, which was the first time I'd ever done it.  It was like a major victory for me.  And then I think she, she let me alone a lot or else I just felt more confident in handling her.  But before then she used to really plague me.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I wasn't a child who bit, but one time I know I bit her right on her chest and really, I don't know if I, it was a very serious one but it was very shocking to everybody that I would do such a thing.  (Pause) And I think that's one reason why I used to, after I, think it was after this that I began to withdraw from my other brother and sister, because it seemed like our relationship was more just fighting physically and very rarely much of anything else.  And I don't know whether it was because I didn't want to or I knew I would lose control and start having a fight, physical fight if I was with them for very long, or just what it was.  But it made me want to withdraw and the times I can remember having anything to do with them always seems to have ended in some kind of a fight or violent feeling and activity if, if it were allowed to go that far.</p>

<p>And my parents used to always complain about us, and how much we fought, which again I suppose made us feel guilty in a way, because it's what we did do.  But lately I've sometimes wondered.  Although children will fight anyway why did we fight so much and in such a physical way.  Because and, and then again I was just drawing a parallel to my teaching and the fact that I think I'm becoming aware of how much an adult can set the atmosphere in the room.  I think part of it does depend on the individual but I think adult, an adult can too to some extent, just in the way they treat the individuals, set some kind of an atmosphere so that the children will respond by being more or less pleasant to each other depending on how you're being.  So then it made me wonder what in the atmosphere of our home made us be the way we were.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think it must have had a lot to do with the kind of hateful way my father would have of talking to us if he were mad.  But also to my mother, I think that upset me more than anything else.  That he would treat her the way he did.  And it was almost as if, if she didn't count, and if he could treat her that way, then what must he think of us and how much should we count?  And then of course, the fact that she didn't fight back and didn't, I took it as she didn't have enough self-respect to, so then for a long time I used to fight back and have a horrible relationship with my father and, but then when MSCZ and I were married I went to the other extreme and, in order to not have fights and not sort of recreate that feeling I used to have that was so upsetting to me, I wouldn't fight back.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's funny too, I can see how I really kidded myself.  When I went to PEC and had some problems in just the way things were working out for my job within the family, I was constantly telling myself, well, I'm willing to control my temper and myself this year and so I'm not going to say anything, and I'll just make the best of it.  And you know, and I was thinking oh, how wonderful of me to do this and of course, the situation just got worse because I didn't say anything.  And anyway, the PEC like people who are very open and sort of yell and scream about whatever is bothering them and then they all forget it.  And when I realized that I had made a mistake this way, I used to just think well, here at least I controlled myself but isn't it ironic that this is the one situation where it would have been good if I hadn't.  And really I think all along I was just afraid to say anything because I might incur their displeasure.  And one thing I wonder how I ever stood it and I thought of leaving the family at the time and I still think it was just a matter of not having enough courage that made me stay on, was uhm, when I was beginning to suspect that, I don't know how far he would have ever carried anything if I'd be willing, but, but the man was not completely interested in me as just a sort of a daughter.  And one day I was talking to another friend at a PEC class I'd been going to and she had been on, there'd been some discussion about all these people who were tutoring in families and how they were supposed to be acting as a mistress for the man of the household too, and so I just said something to the effect that I was beginning to get a little worried about what his attitude was toward me.  And another girl who had been listening, and later on, she for some reason either didn't care about me or just didn't realize what she was saying but later on she repeated this whole thing with other remarks that I might, may or may not have made, probably did.  But anyway she repeated the whole thing to some people she met that knew this family I was working with and they immediately came to the family telling them all these things with, with probably embellishments and out of context.  And, it was just a horribly embarrassing thing for me and of course, the man after that could hardly speak to me.  And at the time I thought well, maybe I should just leave because this is ridiculous, it's no, it's not being good for anyone, but I just didn't have the courage to do it.  In fact, I think in thinking about my attitude toward a job and once I've taken a job and signed a contract and have said I'll stay for a certain amount of time, I will stay.  And I think again, if it got really unpleasant I would stay more out of lack of courage than, than a feeling of responsibility for the job.  Although my parents have ingrained in us that you stick something out but again I think it's lack of courage to look at that value and say sometimes it may not be really a valid one.  Or just like going to school when maybe admitting you shouldn't be in school right now or at this particular school or you just don't want to be in school for a while.  I would never have had the courage to admit any of those things either and just leave.  I think I'm, (clears throat) I was partly afraid of admitting that maybe I was feeling at that time or just agai—, again, going against any standards my parents had.  But it was also a fear of how would I cope with myself and my life if I weren't doing these things where the patterns are established.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Anyway, um, are we, I know you're leaving when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thursday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thursday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That seems to be a good, uh, a good date for people.  My niece is leaving Thursday, a different place, but she's going north.  She already is north of here, but she's going more north.  You're going in a different direction, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  Are you excited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's good.  Um, so are you going to get, I know I need to give you scripts, but are you going to get the stuff filled here or there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That I don't know.  I need to find out what they have down there.  I know they have a Walmart and stuff like that, but I don't know what else they have.  So it's kind of TBD at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Sounds good.  All righty.  So you're doing well?  You're not sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, well, mood wise you're doing well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] probably not.  Um, how did that go?  All 4?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.  Um, this one might be infected.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we're going back at 1:20 today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you had all 4 pulled out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would never do that again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't have to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, like [INAUDIBLE] I wouldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How bad was they?  You know, was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hurt really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you had them pulled out on the 19th?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it hurt pulling them out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was asleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  [INAUDIBLE].  Probably did, but you'd never know.  Um, the top one or the bottom one's infected?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bottom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The bottom one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's probably better.  The topper ones, the top ones are nearer to your brain.  I don't know.  Um, let's see.  Well, dental floss would be easier.  [INAUDIBLE] made this stuff, making this little flosser thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I still have my, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I still have my wisdom teeth.  I have to get big ones because it doesn't, it's like, you know, to get back in there.  At least I don't have to stick both hands and, you know, floss and choke myself.  Um, all right.  So when do classes start?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Labor Day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On Monday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They give classes on Labor Day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's just stupid.  Not that I have an opinion, but, um, really?  On Labor Day?  Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know, there's all, all sorts of, uh, union leaders from the past rolling over in their graves.  Um, so, um, all right.  Well, are you having any suicidal thoughts or attempts since I saw you last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  Except you want to kill your tooth or something, but, oh, it's not there anymore.  Never mind.  Um, any worse depression or anxiety?  Agitated?  Restless?  Panic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Difficulty sleeping?  Yeah?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] had to do with the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Since you've had the, uh, all right.  Any worse irritability?  Um, [INAUDIBLE] smack her for that, right?  No, no, that was aggression not irritability.  Never mind.  All right.  Aggressive, angry, violent, acting on dangerous impulses?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Extreme increase in activity, talking, or other [INAUDIBLE] changes in her behavior?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No talking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No talking.  All right.  Keep an eye out for these.  Tell me if you see any.  Don't stop taking your medicine suddenly and all that stuff.  Um, so you're doing, except for this stuff, you're doing well.  Are you excited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to do well there?  I know you will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's like 15 students to the class.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fifteen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's like what, 300 in each?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] enrollment in the whole school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She'll do well.  She's nervous, but I told her that's to be expected.  Have to go through the transition period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you weren't, there is, there'd be something wrong with you.  Everybody's nervous.  A lot of people wouldn't admit it, but they are.  Um, all right.  Um, well, I guess when do I see you?  Fall break?  Thanksgiving?  Christmas?  Something?  Depends when you're here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think she has a fall break sometime in October, but I forgot to bring the paper with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then she'll be home I think Tuesday before Thanksgiving [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then exams after that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she'll get exams.  I think she gets home around the 13th or something like that [INAUDIBLE].  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Very good.  Um, all right.  So the Xanax you probably haven't used, but I can't even remember when I wrote it last, but I'll write another one.  How many did I give you?  Twenty?  Thirty?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	For what?  The Xanax?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, that was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I never gave it to you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, hum—um.  You never gave it to us.  She got that when she went and had that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Brainwave scan thing done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  You want some?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, if I could get a prescription.  I won't fill it because I've got some, we have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So much left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  I mean if, uh, yeah, but it's only good for I think the script may be good for 6 months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know you can only refill it within 6 months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  And you get, how many did you get?  Thirty?  Twenty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twenty.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think you gave us 20.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  And Zoloft [INAUDIBLE] mg.  Um, and I guess these, you're doing, um, wait a minute.  Here's that.  All right.  So things are good.  You'll do well after you fix that.  Hopefully they'll fix it today.  All right.  So you're going to call back and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I mean do you want—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Schedule?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you want to see her sometime in October?  Because she's only home for I think the weekend plus like 2 days for a fall break I think it is and that would be sometime in October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That'd be 2 months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like in early October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is the only day she's home then at Thanksgiving—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then Christmas break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let's do, it probably sounds like it'll be easier to do it in October than November.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'll do that.  If you're around—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Let me go home and get the dates and I'll call [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And schedule that.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, a number of things, uhm, are sort of coming on my mind together and, uhm, one is something that I was thinking more outside than when I came in.  Except I was thinking I should mention it first thing or ask you about it.  Uhm, and that is I don't recall getting a bill for last month or what I'm wondering is if I've lost one or, uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   No you didn't lose it.  I didn't give it to you.  I was planning to give it to you the week you were gone and then I forgot about it and I thought I'd just wait til the end of the month.</p>

<p>Mm.  Yeah, because that was the other thing I was wondering.  And, but I kept, I, I kept thinking, well that must be it but then I kept thinking no, I probably lost it.  And, I don't know, it was sort of my uhm,, my attitude, I guess, today, you know, or, or for a while.  And then it was my attitude yesterday too.  Not that I was thinking this yesterday but it seems like, it, my attitude sort of continued.  And that's 1 way to, to just think of it in terms I've lost it and I don't want to admit to you that I've lost it.  Even though, uhm, I don't know, as some point maybe it was over the weekend I thought of it.  And, and then I thought well, that probably was what it was.</p>

<p>But also, the other thing that, well, several things.  Uhm, when I, when I just came in here, I was thinking something that — I mean once I got in here I was thinking something that I was thinking this morning.  And I hadn't, I hadn't thought it uhm, consciously so much yesterday or the day before, but it must have been happening.  Because I, I must have put on weight near the end of last week and over the weekend, not that much but a couple of pounds but at this point my weight's high enough so that a couple of pounds make a difference.  And I really felt fat today.  And I felt as if I looked fat.  And when once I came in here it was very much on my mind, you know sort of fat and ugly and I don't know, all the ways that I was just thinking well, am I just going back again to how I used to feel in what I was doing, what I've been doing for quite a while now.</p>

<p>And, and then I started thinking about something that, uhm, FHYZ said today.  I was talking to her on the telephone and she was depressed because of something that had happened recently with this guy that she's been dating and, uhm, that she's upset about because it looks like it probably cannot be any kind of a relationship that will work out.  But she can't just, ah, close it off.  And so I was just saying some things that I don't know, just seem like obvious things, except that I know when you're in the middle of a relationship it's not so obvious.  Uhm, and, and more I think with the intent of just giving, you know, helping to strengthen her position that I, I think she has.  I wasn't trying to give her a position that I, that she hadn't already expressed but just try to make her feel more confident or stronger or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>And, anyway, she just suddenly said, "Oh, you've helped me so much.  I feel so much better."  She sounded it because she'd really sounded awful when I first was talking with her.  And then she said — you know, she was kind of going on about that and, and I began to feel sort of uneasy.  And then she said, "Oh, I love you."  You know, just sort of, I think, meaning, you've made me feel so much better that I really am responding to you.  Uhm, but I, I don't know, I, I, I could feel myself just drawing right back.  And it's almost as if I wanted to do what I could to help her but I didn't want her to acknowledge it at all.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you think you're afraid of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, uhm, now I was just thinking again of that feeling I had and it was a feeling of jumping away from an immediate feeling of pressure of some sort.  And, uhm, I don't know, I think maybe at the time I was thinking sort of, well, that it's a little bit too intimate or something.  But that's not really it because in other ways FHYZ and I have been quite close and said things that were quite personal and, uhm, you know, so, so the kind of intimacy that there could be between us probably there already is, more unspoken.  And, and, and for her to say something like that, uhm, even though I know, she's, you know, liked me, I, I would put it more, I suppose, in those terms.  But I wouldn't even like her saying "I like you so much," or something like that.  I mean it would be the same thing.</p>

<p>Uhm, I think it's because I, I feel some kind of pressure of having to maintain, ah, a level of friendship, or you know, a level of our relationship that I don't want to be committed to.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I was thinking of it in another way, too.  Uhm, because when, because I thought of that after thinking of just feeling so fat today and ugly.  And, and, and then I thought of my reaction that, in a way, should have made me feel good because I wanted to say something that would make FHYZ feel better and clearly I did.  And so I should have felt happy about that.  Uhm, but I didn't want her to express it much more than maybe just say, "Oh, I feel better now."  And not even to say, "You made me feel better."  Or, you know, I think I would have preferred it as impersonal as possible but, you know, sort of an indirect recognition of, you know, something I'd done.  And, uhm, I, I was just wondering if, you know, there was just some desire to keep everything negative.  And for her to say something like that, it means, uhm, I don't know, just in some way, anyway, it didn't, it wouldn't fit into my thinking negatively.  Uhm, —</p>

<p>I think the on—, the comparison I, uhm, didn't actually think out but it comes to me right now, is the way, the, the kind of pattern that, uhm, I used to go through so much and maybe still would, to some extent, or, you know, maybe still will some times is when MSCZ wanted to make love that I would first have to get him angry at me, uhm, you know, or fight him until he shouted at me and got really angry and, and really, in a sense, rejected me or turned away.  And then I would feel loving and uhm, that just to have him come at me saying, I love you and I want to make love with you and, and you know, expressing positive kinds of feelings, agai—, you know, it seems similar: I pull away.  And, I don't know exactly what it is that I'm afraid of or I can't handle but uhm, (pause) but it just seems to me it might be something to do with this feeling maybe I will never be able to repeat the performance and make whoever said that feel that way again.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I ended up thinking — I was just thinking some more about the way I felt today on the phone today with FHYZ but uhm, somehow I ended up thinking about uhm, something that I just started to do.  Well, we're going to have some people in for dinner Friday and then MSCZ's parents on Sunday so I was looking through a couple DF recipes that I'd already cooked and then some that I knew I'd clipped out.  But these were all recipes that I clipped out of magazines or, you know, some source.  They were not in cookbooks and, uhm, then I decided that I should get back to doing what I had started, I guess it was right after FSO was born.  I only did a little bit of it and then I stopped and never had picked it up again — which was to collect the ones that I wanted to keep in a loose-leaf notebook and, you know, sort out and throw away.  Because I have a whole lot collected, although the last few years I've been much more selective.</p>

<p>Uhm, and so I was just thinking about well when, how much more time will I have?  Because I only did it for about an hour today.  Uhm, then how much more time during the vacation will I have to do it.  And then I was thinking about my approach which is very different this time than it was the time when I started doing it.  Because this time I started with uhm, well, I started with the recipes that I'm considering for the 2 different occasions, just because it will be easier to handle them.  But they're also all ones that I want to keep and some of which I've cooked.  And then there are some that I haven't ever done but that look very interesting.  Uhm, and the time before when I did it I think I did it mainly with, uhm, you know, just sort of going through whatever order the pile of recipes was in.  So that meant I was going through an awful lot of stuff that maybe I'll never use and then, you know, I cou— I couldn't select so I was pasting everything in, which is partly why I probably got stopped and never went back to it.</p>

<p>And this time my attitude was after finishing the ones that I might do just for, for these 2 dinner parties, or ones that I've done, well favorites , is to do the ones that I know I'm interested in because I know there are a whole lot there that I'm really questionable about.  And I don't know whether I'll be able to throw them away this time.  And I sort of ended up thinking about, uhm, I think my approach is better this time but will I be able to throw away what I know I'll probably never use or at least it won't be worth keeping.  And then I began to feel really tense and, uhm, you know, sort of a feeling of conflict that at this point I want to be able to throw them away.  Uhm, but will I be able to do it?  And I suppose it was, it's really similar to the kind of conflict I was feeling yesterday of wanting to have more confidence in myself and, you know, at least feeling I, I didn't want to copiously copy all these books that, uhm, are around that I've been reading or want to read.  But I couldn't quite — well, it isn't exactly having confidence.  In some cases the books would be necessary for reference.  But I didn't even feel the confidence of just saying, well, I know they're in the library or I know, you know, for as long as I'm teaching at the school I am at, that some of them are owned by Mrs BBF and, ah I could get them from her.  My feeling was I want them around me.  Uhm — (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm, I'm mainly thinking about, uhm, that incident with FHYZ again and, and, you know, thinking of the comparison that makes me think of with MSCZ, uhm, only now more just thinking that whenever MSCZ says he loves me, which I never can answer, uhm, I think I always think, "Well, yeah, right now, right this minute you feel this way but you don't always feel that way."  And, uhm, I don't know what I've thought in the past on why I think that way except that uhm, you know, I think of the discrepancy between when he's mad at me and then the way he's feeling right then.  So, I don't know, I think of his loving me as, as something very uhm, I don't know if fleeting's the right word — but you know, something that can come and go.  And it seems to help me when he says that to think that way.  And again, I guess, because then I'd feel less pressure or, or less whatever it is that uhm, is part of the way I reacted with FHYZ.  And I just think of, of what happened with FHYZ more, z,,,,, maybe partly because it was, you know, it would be simpler for me to get at.  And then it just happened.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then I just started thinking about something that ha—, I had noticed on Friday, that sort of disturbed me.  Well, I suppose it's really the same kind of thing.  Uhm, and, you know, various times when we were having lunch and FHYZ was talking to me she would put her hand on my arm, or something, you know, somehow touch me.  And, uhm, you know, I mean there was nothing offensive about it.  It was just and it came out very naturally.  Except I realized that, that I was physically sort of withdrawing and that I could not do the same back.  If something natural came up so that it would be natural to touch FHYZ, you know, I, I would do it in a very uhm, I don't know, superficial way or, you know it would be almost as if I were not touching her.  Uhm, — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I just don't know what it was except I knew, you know, if, if well, the only thing I can think of is that, uhm, with a lot of Jewish people whose habits are quite different and they're much more, you know, sort of physically effusive or whatever the word would be I can handle it.  I mean Mrs BBG, I just think of her, who, well, you know, and how much does she really care about me?  But she's always sort of, you know, taking a hold of your arm and, and whatever things she does it's really very similar to the way FHYZ was touching me on Friday but uhm, well, I don't, it's, it's more, uhm, I don't love it when Mrs BBG does it but, you know, I just sort of accept it that that's one of her ways of expressing herself.  But with FHYZ it's really more she's more free and therefore can do it.  And it does mean more because she's, she would—, she wouldn't just be, be doing it with anybody.  But yet, on the other hand, it doesn't mean as much as it would for me to be able to do it.  Uhm, but I'd, I don't know, I'd, well, I mean essentially I found myself sort of withdrawing from that too or, you know, just being very aware whenever she did it, even though it seemed like a perfectly natural uhm, you know, physical reaction to whatever she was saying or, or you know, whatever she was feeling.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then I just became aware when it would have been a natural thing for me, I withdrew again.  And maybe what it was today was that after she said, "Oh, I love you," uhm, you know, some kind of response was necessary on my part, whether it was joking, or, you know, whatever.  And, I think maybe I just felt I cannot respond.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so here you are ah, in effect, ah, saying that the way you reacted to FHYZ really reminds you of your reactions to MSCZ.  You can't respond to his saying he loves you.  You don't know what to answer, you don't know what to say.  And you say this at a time when again you tell me how you feel fat.  Last week you were having stomach aches and feeling all swollen and pregnant and wanting to be pregnant.  And so the question now is, seems to me, the same question that it was last week.  What are you holding out for?  And I think it's what you've always held out for.  You're saying you can't have any relationship unless you can have your father, unless you can have daddy.  And here it's been unless you can have me.  And when you're feeling fat I think that it says, just what it said when you were a little girl: you want to be pregnant and you want your father's child and that's it.  And nothing else will suffice.  I think you were saying that all last week and now there are echoes of it again.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, uhm, I immediately think of something that FHYZ had said on Friday when I saw her.  And it was really how, in a way, I got into saying any of the things I did that had to do with, you know, more directly with my problem that I'd ever said to her before.  Uhm, and I thought of it now when I was remembering how I feel when MSCZ says he loves me.  And you know, how I feel I cannot say "I love you," to him despite all, many good feelings that I have toward him.  And, uhm, you know there's that 1 element that's missing that I imagine with my father and with you.  And on Friday when FHYZ and were talking, and I was saying you know, I'd, you know, the usual thing of feeling such a conflict over wanting to finish and then resisting and, and being very frustrated.  And she said something about, well, look at what a wonderful marriage you have and what a wonderful guy MSCZ is and that she, she sort of was saying well, you idolize love too much or, you know, something to the effect that I'm setting my sights too high and I don't see what I have right there.  And, in a way she was right but I think, you know she was kind of getting at it wrong.  And anyway I just said, well, I mean essentially said, "Well, in a way you are right except what it is is I have this, uhm, fantasy."  I guess I used the word fantasy — still, you know, I'm still holding on to it — of, of what I wanted with my father and, uhm, what I feel about you when I come here, that is getting in between me and MSCZ and, you know, why I can't feel I love him.</p>

<p>Uhm, and that did come out, come to my mind again, just now, but I, I couldn't put it together.  Because then, well, then I get back to something that was bothering me before.  I mean, it still may be but uhm, it might just be in a whole other trick that I'm using.  Because when I start thinking well, couldn't put it together the way you did and yet when you say what you just said, then I see how it all works together uhm, you know, I think well, when I don't come here any more how will I put all this together?  I can't imagine that things aren't going to bother me and that I won't be upset.  Uhm, and that I won't be depressed sometimes.  And, you know, — but I guess it's just another way to say I can't live without you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Just as you felt you couldn't live without your father when you were little.  You've always had this fantasy if you could just find the right tricks, you can make him love you.  You're still thinking that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Yeah, except, (sighs) you know, I, I, I just think, well because of some of the ways I substituted what I was really feeling, you know some of the ways I thought I would find answers and, and find the right tricks.  I mean it was, you know, if I'm, I mean, well, I was trying to say, I (tsk sound) I don't know, substitute isn't quite the right word — but you know, in, in trying to be a good student or be the best teacher or, uhm, have all the recipes that I ever think I might ever, ever, ever cook and that anybody ever has done that was good.  And all these things that are substitutes.  Uhm, I don't know, I don't believe in it any more, except I still go through the pattern, I still feel the compulsion to collect it but I don't feel that it's the answer.  And, and the other thing I was just thinking is that I was sort of, I suppose, comparing well, here I am just refusing to accept something is not possible, I cannot have something that I wanted.  And so the only sensible course is to let something else suffice.  And I'm refusing to do it and I've refused to do it all my life.  And, uhm, it made me think of FSO, when — and, and it wouldn't just be FSO but, you know, dealing with more and that I see myself in her whenever she reacts this way, the way she becomes just adamant that, you know, she has to have something.  And, uhm, and yet I don't know what I'm wondering except just sort of how to, how do you, you know, stop not accepting something.  And I know with FSO the best way is to indicate to her that her feelings are recognized and, and then, you know be firm about what she cannot have if it's impossible that she can have it and also recognize," I know it makes you feel, makes you feel unhappy that you can't."  And, uhm, I suppose this just gets back to was it yesterday, or whenever that you said well, unless you look at whatever you're feeling , you cannot stop feeling it.  And, and I suppose that's it.  I, I have to keep recognizing it.  But, I don't know, I, maybe I just think well, once I recognize it then it'll go away and, you know, it keeps coming up and coming up and it doesn't go away.  And, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, you know, it strikes me that, uhm, today eh — last night I was quite clear — anyway, when you were going through the recipes, quite literally, yeah, I think ah, you know, recipes are after all to fill up your belly.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And if nothing else works, maybe you can get your father's baby in you that way.  Just find the right recipe.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I, I was just mainly thinking of how that literally has been my feeling about dinner parties.  Which I suppose is just all back to the same thing.  And why I found dinner parties sometimes such a strain.  You know, because it's more the planning of it and deciding what recipes to use and uhm,— (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And I don't think it's accident that the time you felt especially close to your father was at the dinner table.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, but that just, uhm, (sighs) I mean then I think of something that it would just add to that but I think of it as being the whole reason uhm, why that was when I felt so close.  Because my father very definitely, uhm, when he's eating something he likes, becomes quite gay and talkative and, uhm, pleasant, you know, and attentive.  And I don't know, many times that might have been the only time that really he saw us, or me.  And, uhm, after dinner he would be maybe reading the paper, or something, but he'd be very absent-minded and, uhm, very easily irritable.  But at the dinner table, if he was eating something he liked or, you know, when he got ice cream he used to always get ice cream and like somebody to join him and then it would be very much of a comrade kind of experience.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I, I was just wondering about, you know, a certain reaction I have when MSCZ and I eat together that, uhm, for a long time, I've understood that it has bothered me.  Although once I guess I understood it, it bothered me less — that MSCZ did not do what my father used to do.  I mean my memory of my parents' conversations, my father telling story after story about things that happened during his day and maybe jokes he heard, or, you know, stories about people he saw, and just what he did and concerns he had and what business things were going on.  And I don't know how much my mother understood uhm, and how much she liked hearing it but, it, to me it indicated a great rapport and you know, a closeness and, uhm, just something that, that it really used to bother me when MSCZ reacted the opposite way.  He definitely did not want to talk about the office.  Uhm, if he talked about anyth— he'd talk about anything, almost, than the office.  And so very often, it that were all he did all day and that was what was on his mind, uhm, he'd want me to tell about my day.  And if my day hadn't been particularly interesting it would get down to that we'd have little to say.  And of course then I would feel very depressed because he wasn't doing what I thought he should be doing if he liked being with me, which is what my father did.  And, uhm, but then after I think I understood that I stopped being bothered so much.</p>

<p>But just now I was thinking, well, maybe sometimes I'm still bothered only much less.  And I'm not so self-conscious about eating with MSCZ.  But still sometimes I, you know, sort of wonder why do we have to say to each other than other people or, and I think mainly I'm thinking about my parents.  And, uhm, you know, because I think I expect if I feed MSCZ things he likes to eat why is he not sort of bubbling over the way my father used to?  And, in fact, what MSCZ does then, is he eats.  And he's, his family, he was used to, uhm, his father never saying a word when he ate.  And so I suppose for MSCZ to say anything he's, you know, broken a pattern he was used to.  And I'm expecting the exact opposite, or wanting.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then, well, then I was just thinking of something that MSCZ said that did not really occur to me until he said it.  Uhm, but I think, ah, again, I'm looking forward to it.  And I think of it now in context of my impression of the way my parents were together.  Uhm, but I don't know, at 1 point I must have asked MSCZ how he felt because this is his last week of analysis.  And, you know, it was a while ago that I asked him how he felt about knowing it was pretty close to the end.  And, you know, he would, he said it was bothering him and said some things.  And then he said, well, maybe he'll talk to me more, you know, sort of bring his problems to me.  And, I don't remember his exact words, the way he said it.  It was sort of half as a joke and then half, you know, serious — thinking well, you know, I might have to be his relief if he doesn't — because he knew that, you know, very often he went and just sort of talked things out that were temporarily disturbing him and had to be talked out.  Uhm, but I think I'm really looking forward to that.  Because again, that was an aspect of what my father was doing.  And it's something that MSCZ almost never does.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Coughs) Well, our time's up.</p>

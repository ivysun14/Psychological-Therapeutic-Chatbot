<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0324-006, interviewer number 16, client 0324-006, interview number 16.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) stops over periodically. It's really funny I spent all day Sunday I guess, avoiding people, like I just really felt shitty, I'm not quite sure why except that February 14th has always had some really bad connotations as far as part experiences and I also (inaudible) [00:01:30 ] if I could get more (inaudible). It takes too much energy to avoid people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not enough to do the work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah to the point like that I just wasn't answering phones and my boyfriend kept calling and I just kept not being there and I-then he came over last night, last evening for dinner and I thought, sometimes he comes over for dinner because he has a class, like a law school again and it's sort of easier than going all the way to his house. So I didn't really want to see him but I sort of-I was in a good mood and I sort of said, "Okay you can come over," or you know, "Do you want to come over for dinner?" because I knew that's what he was calling about. And it turns out he wasn't even-didn't even have a class to go back to last night which meant he was just coming over to see me which was (inaudible) and it ended up just being a really good talk. Partly about why I've been feeling so bad, I guess the day before. Partly with me being able to stay at (inaudible) [00:02:55 ] . </p>

<p>I'd sort of made a resolution that I'd done a heck of a lot of writing the day before that I wasn't going to see him anymore but not so much that I wasn't going to see him anymore but that I wasn't going to let him come in here anymore and so yesterday I felt pretty secure in that because I realized that I can't just avoid him (inaudible) [00:03:23 ] but I can keep myself from running to him. I know I'm just, you know escaping something else or something like that. So I ended up going to his house later that night. At first I just thought, you know I wouldn't go. </p>

<p>Actually what happened Sunday night just after refusing three phone calls or something like that, I finally made this Valentine for him which was in a sense was really a good one. I used to make just really kind of funny poems or verses or something like that for Valentine's day and I realized I couldn't do that anymore so I just sort of wrote the reverse as to what I felt and I had this present or just something that he had asked me to buy for him at the (inaudible) [00:04:22 ] because I can get things cheaper there. So I just decided well I'd just make that into a present, so I just-I went over, I just called him, my watch had stopped and I didn't realize how late it was, after his third call and my roommate had told him that I was probably asleep because she couldn't think of anything else to tell him since it was 1 o'clock and I said to him, "Can I come over?" And he sort of winced and said yes, I think he probably felt well she's sort of coming over crying on my shoulder and is going to stay again or something like that.</p>

<p>So I went over and I talked to him for five minutes and I gave him what I was going to give him and I left. And it was really a good feeling to be able to do that and he told me the next day he was really surprised and-such that I really could go over there the next day and only after we'd spent a long time together just talking and I knew that he really wanted me to come over, which was great, very different from my situation. [00:05:44 ]</p>

<p>Anyway so I just-I felt really good talking to his roommate today and just to the fact that maybe (inaudible) [00:06:05 ] really get better and just talking to people and not wait and specify really good friends kind of, like wait till I find the perfect person male or female to talk to that I can empathize with and that, because I have had some really good friends like that and I guess in a sense it's made me so choosy that I wouldn't-I'm not now talking to anybody except very, very superficially because unless they're in the category of just very, very good friends, then I don't feel like I'm able to talk with. [00:06:45 ]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's almost like deciding well okay, you don't have to wait to have a deep meaningful encounter with every person, there are things you can, I don't know, do with other people too and it's like really closing yourself (inaudible) [00:07:02 ] and that's the way, if you don't try to meet people then (inaudible) [00:07:07 ] I'm gathering that's sort of what it's like with this roommate?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because for the most part I really close myself off from her. She really needed friends to listen to her a lot and but never felt right about talking because we were just really two different kind of-and I never really felt that I could consider her a really close friend. So I would talk to her as a last resort if I just had to have somebody to talk to. This was like last year when she's still officially a roommate but she's going over to her boyfriend's so I don't see her very much but when she was still there and so forth.</p>

<p>Late at night if things were just really too terrible I would talk with her but it would kind of be a last straw kind of situation and I almost resented the fact that I had to talk to her and today I really-it was really a good thing. It's partially why I was late because I didn't want to stop talking to her, I didn't realize what time it was. She sort of felt-because she had done the same thing that I had as far as just cutting herself off from people and getting really hurt by a few good friends and therefore avoiding all people. [00:08:25 ]</p>

<p>I really decided that it's a really important thing to have sort of medium good friends that you can just talk to and listen to and not-like I tend to very easily get angry if people, like Saturday night, I really wanted-I came home from the library early-well as soon as it closed and I was going to eat dinner early and then I was going to start working and I didn't want anybody to interrupt that. And this girl that I know came over and I was just really mad at her just because well she just felt like going for a walk and she stopped over and ended up staying and talking for two hours and I sort of had to stay and listen and I didn't want to at all. And I just could kept feeling myself getting so upset and ended up more than anything else just sitting there listening while she and my roommate talked. </p>

<p>And afterwards I realized, you know, and I just talked to her for a few minutes by myself and I realized it was really nice to see her and I was really angry at myself for my kind of mad, resentful withdrawal that I really felt when she came. So I'm not-it's like now, or at least as of today, which changes all the time, you know I feel like I know what I need to do which is a lot easier than actually getting out and doing it and like I need to get in to some more things that I'm interested in and I need to get into some situations where I can meet some more people (inaudible) [00:10:32 ], like I really need to start dating some other people. And it's really a hard thing to make myself go on out and do it [inaudible] Tuesday. You don't know (inaudible) do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't say in (inaudible) [00:10:53 ] anymore it used to. I think they used to anyway (inaudible), we'll have to see. Anyway stuff like that I used to do in the first quarter I was here all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and it's like, it's a matter that you're saying, oh well, I might as well see people you know on this level because-even though that is second best. I hear something and like look, there's something really positive about knowing people on a different level and not feeling I have to, you know, I don't know I have to be deeply involved in them and I'm not knocking that, I'm not saying that that's not important.</p>

<p>PATIENT; I think it's something I'm really just learning and it would have been nice if I'd learned it when I was about ten but I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like that's an old pattern? Really having to be-or is like having to have it be just right between you and another person before it feels like a good relationship to you or a satisfying one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of always being afraid that I was really left out of the group kind of thing. Unless people really, really, really wanted me in the group and I was really close to them and really in on everything and really close to each person, that I just totally isolated myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that sort of what you were thinking of that happening the other night when this girl came over? Like she really came over and was talking to you and you then sat there and sort of got resentful while she was talking to your roommate and later you realized, "Look I was the one that did the sudden withdrawal business." Was it that kind of thing there or was it more of just being really feeling disrupted and out of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was first of all feeling really disrupted and kind of resentful. I don't know (inaudible) [00:12:57 ] and I guess afterwards feeling that I couldn't relate to the both of them and to her the way they were relating to each other. Partly because I didn't want to. I don't really know exactly what was happening there except that it was like my own kind of withdrawal preceded my inability to connect the way I would like to. It was like kind of starting out in a bad mood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well certainly it seems it was not a good time for somebody to feel like (inaudible) [00:13:43 ] and drop in on you, that's kind of-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The first straw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean that was another thing that just kind of precipitated and I just not wanting to see anybody the next day and just pondering (inaudible) [00:14:01 ] you know (inaudible) I'm not here. But I feel like if I could number one start working in [something interesting] and have it not be-because sometimes when I do tend to-when I do start working it becomes such an obsessive kind of thing that it's like I either have to be with people or I have to be working. I can't integrate the two or alternate the two in any kind of a decent way. I really need to be able to do that. </p>

<p>My boyfriend can do that, he's even more obsessive than I am but-and if I can just get rid of these damned mood changes which I really don't understand and a lot of times I really don't know why I'm in such a rotten mood or why five minutes later I'll be really high and really feel like I can do anything that I want. And I mean that sort of happened last night while I was over, we must have talked for two hours at least and in the course of that time I would be crying, laughing, happy, sad and everything in between. And by the time I walked over to his house I was just (inaudible) [00:15:39 ] something like that. I was really, really in good spirits and just sort of immediately I wish it would last kind of feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds to me like there's something very treacherous feeling about having run the gamut in two hours and when you finally do get to feeling good then, I don't know some sort of gnawing away thing about it. I'm not sure whether it's exhausting or whether you feel like it doesn't-you don't-you just can't trust it or maybe whether you feel almost disoriented. I'm not-not in the classical sense anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like once I do feel good and I have a feeling that I could do anything, then it-unless there's something right there then that needs to be done and is very obvious, by the time I got down to sitting and planning okay what shall I do now that I have this good feeling that says I can do all these things, I can't do them. By that time the feeling is gone. Or and part of what this good feeling means is very often it accompanies kind of a feeling of, you know, I can do anything and then I start thinking of all the things that need to be done that I can do and that becomes so overwhelming that immediately I'm out of the good mood. [00:17:01 ]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's almost like if you could find something concrete and actually get it done, that would be reinforcing but what ends up happening is you start seeing how much there is to do and there's no way of effecting any of it and-</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I guess I would-I guess now I started feeling, gee I really feel like finishing this course work I need to do and I feel like writing these letters and writing these resumes and I looked at the clock and I had like a half hour to do all of these things or 45 minutes or something like that. I don't know. So like I sort of feel like there's hope now, I feel like the first step is getting out of myself. But that it's really hard to do and it's hard to stop - to start, you know, to stop crying over all sorts of past worries and stuff and feelings and everything else without at the same time stop and feeling (inaudible) [00:18:45 ] which unfortunately tends to happen so often. </p>

<p>It's like when I left my boyfriend Sunday night after just going over there and coming back home, I was really frustrated, angry, everything else and at the same time (inaudible) following that I felt really good in that it was sort of a catharsis in that I sort of done my, what I had to do about him at the time and sort of then felt like I'd stopped running from him and I didn't need to see him anymore. And sort of gotten rid of all these feelings that were inside me and I felt comfortable about it and be able to go to sleep and I assume-I was writing about whatever I felt when I got back and all I remember writing was kind of, you know, thank goodness I don't feel angry, upset, hurt, dependent and I feel really separate kind of from you and I don't feel worried about whether I'll see you again or something like that.</p>

<p>Kind of the last one I wrote was (inaudible) [00:20:19 ] and which of course you know in a sense changed somewhat but, and I know they don't have to go together but they did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did? Say that again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Getting rid of negative or of not healthy kind of feelings doesn't mean you have to get rid of all feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right okay, yeah I was going to say it sounded like you were saying it as resolve-everything revolving around a negative pull and it was presence or absence of the negative pull kind of. That's where you were worried about orienting yourself so that when you got-when you weren't feeling negative feelings, the alternative almost felt like well maybe we're just pushing them away and making it more complicated than it needs to be (inaudible) [00:21:20 ]. But I gather what didn't feel good was seeing that void there. Like what was there, I mean, like it was almost like you felt there should be something there rather than not feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. It was like somehow I'd gotten a whole bunch of feelings and there's really nothing left to feel about. Happy, sad, anything else. It was sort of-there are two problems that I've been dealing with and I'd like to (inaudible) [00:23:35 ] or that I realize that I need to deal with and one I mentioned was (inaudible) trust. Kind of how to deal with [life I guess] or with not having somebody there that I'm really close to-kind of feeling that I can be independent and alone and at the same time somehow satisfied, or somehow able to keep functioning and to deal with things. And kind of how to deal with that really strong kind of need which shows itself in like getting really upset whenever anybody I care about is leaving, kind of a real sense of loss and desertion and emptiness so that I'm in a sense feeling secure enough within myself to keep functioning. To not withdraw and to be ready to meet new experiences and to want that and be ready to meet new people which is-I mean it's really kind of a sense of security without anyone (inaudible) [00:25:47 ] which is been a lot of what's been involved in the stuff with my boyfriend, the dependency thing, or the over dependency thing. </p>

<p>It's like needing a secure base from which to go off and work from and somehow needing to change that secure base from having however brief good relationship with my boyfriend, which when that happens to be I can (inaudible) [00:26:28 ] I can do things and get interested in other things to-since that is so temporary and since there's so many weeks of paralysis in between when things are going bad if I don't have that base. Of somehow shifting that inside myself which I can see doing, I can comprehend doing and I can feel that I have done at various times in the past but it's kind of hard to keep it there without in some sense giving up the very what I consider positive sense of wanting another person. Or needing another person or being able to reach out emotionally to another person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying you want both, or you want to have that sort of core that makes you able to go along (inaudible) [00:28:14 ] about by what happens with other people but you don't want to lose the-like the ability to reach out the-even in some sense the need for other people, like that feels important and has really good parts to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and it's-I really have trouble balancing the two and yet maybe I shouldn't. Maybe in some sense and I felt it myself of when I feel really secure in myself and I'm able better to reach out to some other-to other people and I guess it's hard to draw the line of having that security, maybe because you broke up a wall or have it be because you're just avoiding secure kind of (inaudible) [00:29:28 ] open without being vulnerable in a person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's like you said, you're struggling with two dimensions. One is the business about look there's a way of being solid and secure and I'm not sure yet where that blends into and becomes isolated and (inaudible) [00:29:51 ] maybe and about the reaching out to others, when does that become so needful or-I don't have quite the right words because they're more important-it's more important than these sort of standard words that I'm using but I don't know how else to put it. It's like how can I still be free to reach out to people without this quality that I feel drives them away or-I just-I can't quite describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact on the other hand, there's a-there can be a quality of being too strong so that you become sort of unfeeling, rigid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So self contained almost that nobody ever gets in that there aren't any (inaudible) [00:30:39 ].</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you don't need anybody and you don't-as a result nobody needs or wants you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess sometimes that looks pretty good momentarily but really when you look at it, you don't want that. Like you don't want to be walking in (inaudible) [00:30:56 ] without people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't know, I think it's probably something I'm just going to have to experiment with, recognizing those alternatives.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was sort of thinking-and even if you sit down and try to conceptually get those things worked out, it's quite a different matter to figure out what the quote behavioral distinctions are. Like that's a whole (inaudible) realm in the (inaudible) [00:31:41 ].</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe to kind of just getting out and try it has got to be the best way to really figure out how to balance that except that it's really hard to relate to people when you don't have any kind of secure basis for relating. I mean when you're so completely ambivalent as to well should I be strong or weak now and knowing full well you have the ability to be either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess also not knowing which one will come up or which one you'll-which end you'll be at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess somehow that's related too to how well I feel about myself or within myself and how strong my mood is within myself because if I'm not secure kind of then I have two alternatives. The one of really letting loose my feelings and being very weak or the other of deciding that it's not a good time to let loose and being really impenetrable kind of. Each of these seems to be an opposing dimension of a basic state of anxiety and insecurity and so forth whereas in a really secure state and we don't necessarily know the right thing to say, there can be kind of a free openness and at the same time, a vulnerability that goes with that openness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's like you can take the risk of opening up but you're not going to-it's like being free to take a risk without expecting to be devastated every time or something. There's something in that word vulnerable like, you know, it is-it seems to me like you never really get used to that or it's always has a tinge of danger to it but the need for that thick wall or the fear of what will happen if there is a chink in it just somehow isn't there (inaudible) [00:34:19 ] like it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like then with that kind of security to start with, you can experiment with all kinds of ways of being with people. You can just sort of be like you feel like being without-and you can sort of see how your openness versus your closedness affects other people without being devastated by it. Ending up having to draw back in a completely defensive ball or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you make it sound sort of like, isn't it (inaudible) [00:35:11 ] perfect times (inaudible) it's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something like that, I can really feel myself doing it sometimes in fact. If I'm really vulnerable to start with and whatever tendrils, tentacles, whatever you reach out with, that are (inaudible) [00:35:27 ]gets hit, you know, and just completely not having another route to take, another (inaudible) just contract.</p>

<p>Yeah somehow that's probably the best way to begin dealing with that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the best way? You mean making efforts to meet-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Making efforts to talk to people, to meet people and but basically making efforts to be secure in myself to start with. If that were only as easily done as said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible) [00:37:02 ] take the time (inaudible) in a way to start out because it's like you're saying I need to feel secure and when you're starting out, you're starting out exactly without what you were saying is essential in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that sort of came out sounding like a truism or something but I really-that's really very feeling in it and it really is hard at the beginning to-that's where the (inaudible) [00:38:10 ] really, really [inaudible] from the bottom it would sometimes, really starting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Kind of the other thing that I was-that's in a sense related to this because it keeps coming up in my own mind and it was really, really on my mind a lot last week and it was when they finally legalized abortions and just the whole thing about there being fewer and fewer babies available for adoption and it's kind of a really scary thing to me just because I want kids so badly and it's kind of part of the whole loneliness thing and self-fulfillment kind of thing and everything else. Of feeling like that's so out of my control and which makes me feel very much more dependent on society than I would like to feel and I-producing the proper kind of behavior kinds of things rather than just figuring out who I am and experimenting with different kinds of lifestyles and stuff. And it's partially resentment of being so dependent on society and so dependent on the fluctuations according to the laws as to how many babies are available in a kind of a way and more than that, just a real kind of longing or wanting that would not be so bad except that there's this tremendous fear that it will never be real almost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well part of it, or at least the way I took what, one of the things you said was sounding like it's so horrible to think of kind of an impersonal, legal societal control over something that's so vitally important to you. I mean it's like inhuman or something and this sounds like one of the most warmly human (inaudible) [00:42:40 ] oriented, I don't know what kinds of things that you would like to have and do for yourself. Well you know, you could go on for hours talking about kids and all this kind of thing and it's like being eaten up in a machine types of thing and it's like they have the power. Impersonal they have the power to-both to judge whether or not I get it and for God's sake maybe they'll cut off the supply even. It's a horrible irony it feels like as you talk about it. In fact you know I had never even thought of that aspect of it. Is that really something that people think is going to happen? I always think of like there's always going to be so many kids that needs homes kind of thing and I've never-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there's-in the papers last week or whatever, accompanying every article on, "Is this hospital going to start giving abortions," were articles on New York's available babies for adoption are down drastically or something like that in the last however long and then prospected figures for how low those will go down if in fact this law goes into effect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hadn't even thought of those implications.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I'm very much in favor of abortions and, you know, it's a hard thing because-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not wishing suffering on all those women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and I'm not wishing that there be tons of unwanted kids around. At the same time I'd like there to be one or two available for me and more than anything else it was just, you know, that that sort of raised the question again, that those articles just sort of, you know, increased a worry that's sort of always been there. It's been there for a very long time and at the same time, sort of increased the feeling of pressure that, damn it you better get married and get a kid now because five years from now there may not be any available. As soon as all the states get abortion laws and that kind of thing and, you know, the-I think if I were, you know, (inaudible) [00:45:18 ] I keep thinking maybe if I would have stayed with some kind of stability I would just go on and adopt a kid now because you can adopt kids even if you're not married in New York. But I resent and don't want to do that as kind of a emergency measure. It's something that should be done when you're ready and when it's the best time for you and for the kid and everything else and more than anything else, it's just brought up a whole bunch of worries and feelings that have been there for a really long time. </p>

<p>But were I a little bit more secure about things, I would probably find it easier to get over but-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean this prospect wouldn't create such upheaval or you somehow could take it better or-I wasn't sure what you meant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I knew that it would be very easy to get kids and to get as many kids as I want, then I wouldn't worry so much about not being able to have kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be, you know, pretty easy to deal with but just dealing with environmental things right now as far as maybe it's going to be harder and harder to get kids then it doesn't make it easier to kind of resolve those feelings that have been there for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now are you talking about a medical fact, that you cannot-are you saying that you cannot have your own children, and that's a proven fact?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forgive me for asking, I didn't know that. Okay so I see what you mean, of course. Yeah that would be hard enough to deal with but it's like all this business about babies being less available somehow, I don't know, it just cuts off a vital access route or something for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe even something as simple as highlights how awful it is or how awful it feels sometimes to have to accept that fact. That's kind of (inaudible) [00:48:06 ].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that hurt you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I was-no I didn't, I don't think anything could hurt me at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that because you're feeling sort of armored over or-</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I've been armored over for a good while but I just-it's just something that I know I've got to figure out how to deal with because it keeps coming up and sometimes if I'm in a weakened state as far as mood and stuff like that, it comes up even worse. And I know damned well this is why I can't write to this girlfriend of mine whose anniversary was yesterday, Sunday I guess. This is the girl that I've known since I was four and we used to-both of us (inaudible) [00:49:13 ] kids and both of us were only children and, you know, and we used to spend the night at each other's houses all the time and we decided we were each going to have-we were going to have a great big farm and we were each going to have lots of animals and ten kids apiece. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She got one? Did she have - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah she has-(inaudible) [00:49:39 ] better now, I have not written her since, since I got the letter from her last year that she was pregnant. I have not written to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just sort of paralyzes something inside you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's a strange feeling because I'm really happy for her I'm happy that she is just ecstatic and she really wants to have kids and she's had a really rough life as far as her father being an alcoholic and she's had to work really hard and she never went to college and she-she's just-she's been a really good person and she's always been a really good friend. And she's got a good husband now and I think will make a really good mother and in a sense I guess I feel so alienated from that situation whereas if in a lot of ways it's the situation that I most want. But I cannot write to her, I just-I feel like I'm so outside of it and I don't know, it affects a whole bunch of little things too and just my ability to deal with that (inaudible) [00:51:00 ].

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How are you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Cold.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It is cold out, yeah.  They say this is the coldest week of the year here.  You know that?  This week is the cold, [INAUDIBLE] the coldest week of the year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because it's been cold, then it warmed up, and then it's cold.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This time of the year usually.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, in January?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, has the lowest [INAUDIBLE] this particular week in January.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't know that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So what do you do, just try to stay in and stay warm.  Yeah.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I make the oven going, cook something in the oven, keep the house warm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember to shut it off?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't keep it on all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just, yknow, bake in the oven to help warm up the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you cooking again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I still cook.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not as good as I'd like, but, yknow, not every thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You used to cook more, did you used to cook more?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't know if she cooked any better.  I don't think that's changed.  That ability didn't change.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You like to bake, that's different.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I like to bake cookies.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You don't like to cook.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I did that before Christmas with the girls, with my sister and her daughter.  And we did a lot of baking.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did she get a job yet, your sister?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's still not working?  So what's she doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's babysitting for her oldest daughter and she's working part time at [DEIDENTIFIED].  And she's trying to get a job.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's getting disability now though, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Social Security.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because of her eyes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's the matter with her eyes?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's got that mac -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, right, you told me.  So that's good.  So she has enough to support herself then, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that'll help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you spending time with her?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I spend usually every Saturday with her.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  And you're working Saturday now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  So you back to five days then?  Still four days?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I work five if I have to.  Like today is New Year's Day for me, my New Year's Day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You really don't want to go back to the five days?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, that's, I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does he work four full days, right, when you work?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, they're thirteen hours.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's enough.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How did your father turn out?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He died.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you get to see him?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, I missed him by forty eight hours.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you should have flew.  If you had flown, would you have made it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not even then?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He went to quick.  He really went downhill at the end pretty quick.  So thanks for asking.  Sorry I missed him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You did the best you could to get there.  He was in your thoughts just like I was thinking about you when you said you went on the [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Seventeenth, yeah, he died on the fourteenth.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Well, we can't always make it, unfortunately.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They took a picture of him actually right before on the cell phone, yknow, they have those cameras [INAUDIBLE].  Kind of eerie.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Part of life I guess.  Probably the most painful part of life is to lose the people you love.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We lost a friend of ours to lung cancer, [NAME OTHER], and she sent on the computer, as sick as she was, she sent a note out to everybody that she was going to pass away.  And she sent it out on the, yknow, the computer, what do they call that, yknow, where they send it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Email.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, email.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Email.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How old was she?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Sixty.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Heavy smoker though probably.  In her younger days I imagine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Smoker, yeah, that's terrible, smoking is so disruptive.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She was skin and bones.  We saw her right before she died.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Two days before isn't that right, two or three days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, a day before.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Was it a day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was bad to have to see her, but she was up to snuff as far as brain.  Yknow, that was all function really good, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She died at home or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's sad.  It's part of life.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You can't live forever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't think about that, but I guess, yknow.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's the only guarantee you got.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What is it, pay taxes or something?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, you don't even have to do that.  You gotta pay the consequences if you don't, but the other one there ain't no getting away from that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how you spending your time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not so good.  I can't exercise 'cause I fell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You fell?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got out of bed and I don't know what, if I was half asleep or what, and I hit the, we have an end table on each side of the bed, and I must have hit that end table and I got a huge bruise from it.  And both my knees for scuffed and there was even a bruise on my foot.  But he got out of bed right awake and he helped me up so I could go back in the bed.  Or did I?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You went to the washroom.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're lucky he was there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then I went back to bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're lucky he was there to help you up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Otherwise you wouldn't have been able to get up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I did have a hard time getting up 'cause it was hurt right away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You put ice on it or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what he said, and I said, no, I just left it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, you put ice on and you made me go down and get you ice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's right, you did.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I told you, just put it on, can't get hurt with ice.  Ice works on everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that'll decrease the swelling.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Ice works on everything.  Heat is the problem.  Ice is safe for anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still in pain or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it still hurts.  Not as bad.  Every day gets a little better, except I swept the floor because he always gets on his hands and knees and he wants the floor clean 'cause he says when I use a mop it goes into the cracks and then it gets dirtier.  And so I was sweeping, and when I'm sweeping it started hurting again.  But it's been only a, what, a week, over a week, so.  What are you gonna do?  Things happen like that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm just glad she didn't hurt her hip.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And missed the dresser by two inches.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Now you don't shovel outside, right?  You're careful, you don't go outside when it's slippery or it's icy?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, not after that foot.  That's why I got boots on.  He sent me with boots on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But that's not bothering you, you're not pain in your feet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That bothers me sometimes when it's cold out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, it was cold, it was minus seven last weekend.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I'm inside.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you didn't go out, you just stayed in?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I stayed in.  He's the one that has to go out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you driving now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm going to wait 'til spring.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The weather.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When the weather's better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So when he's at work, you just stay in the house?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you stay alone, you don't need the worker anymore?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You feel confident and comfortable being alone?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not now with this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can't do as much.  You go to move and you can feel it.  Yknow, 'cause it's about, what like this?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's right here on the side.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't break any ribs though?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, she'd know that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said you'd know if they [INAUDIBLE].  But like laughing now I can feel it.  But I know it's getting better, so that's the main thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Don't laugh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Laughing is good for you, remember?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Emotionally it's good for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Emotionally.  They have that class on laughing.  It was on, oh, they were showing it, the people get together and they laugh and it makes them feel better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's true.  You ever go to that [DEIDENTIFIED], the comedy club there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You watch TV though, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know what's on TV anymore 'cause the writers' strike.  The reality shows, you watch reality shows?  You don't watch that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The only reality show we watch is the dancing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I don't care for that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Dancing with the Stars?  You like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, Dancing with the Stars, that was nice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were they good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like this continuation thing though, whatever that's called.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Some kind of war or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't care for that.  But the Dancing with the Stars, that was nice.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> They tried to get Ditka on there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, he had a hip problem, I don't know if he could dance.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, he said, don't even consider me.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I knew somebody who met them recently.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On a business deal and they said he was very gruff and - </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, yeah, that's how he is</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and he was, and when they were talking with him they told me he was getting like one phone call after another on a cell phone, yknow, he was so busy 'cause he had so many of these like business ventures.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, he's got everything going on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, did you watch the football?  You didn't watch the football?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I watch some of it when he watches it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> 'Cause I don't watch it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't like it or not really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Eh, just that Green Bay lost.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you like the Green Bay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't, the cheeseheads?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you like that they lost?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I felt sorry for them, but it was, I guess, who did you want, you didn't care?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Ah, it didn't matter.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It didn't matter.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I don't like either of them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You gonna watch the Super Bowl?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I usually don't.  It's usually a boring game.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's like a big show.  Yeah, it is, the only thing it's so good.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b>  I don't know, Brady's hurt though.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, is he hurt?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I read in the paper he was wearing a boot yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he hurt his leg or foot?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> His ankle I think, 'cause he was gimping around and they said.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ah, he's so good he could play with a broken ankle.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Got everybody else around you good, it doesn't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe that's why he played terrible that game.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, he wasn't real good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, they still won by so much.  You don't really follow football.  Do you follow any sports?  No, not really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If he watches it, I watch it, but football I don't care for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's too violent.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I like the basketball and I like baseball.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Baseball, I like baseball.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I like that.  But the football, I don't know the calls, yknow, when they says, oh, pass interference, this and that.  I don't know all of that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Neither do the refs, don't feel bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Some of them don't.  You like baseball.  This year the Cubs are going on a hundred years they say.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We'll be stuck for the next hundred, they ain't going nowhere.  They keep getting older.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you seem good, though.  Your mood seems good.  You seem, yknow, happy.  You seem in control.  Do you feel improved?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I, the mornings are still bad.  The afternoons, as I told him, are better, right?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't seem tired like you used to, you're not tired anymore are you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're still tired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just in the morning or all day long?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I feel tired, not like now I don't, but in the morning I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just when you get up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How much Depakote are you taking at night?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Two 250s and one during the morning at breakfast.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we can't go any lower.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The Abilify's only half a mg, yknow, 5 mg.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you take that at night?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't think we should change anything.  You seem good.  And you're exercising at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I was doing it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, she was until.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then this I couldn't move to do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm waiting 'til it heals enough and then I'm going to start back.  The only thing I can't do is I can't run in place because of that ankle.  But at least I was doing some, yknow, like pushups, modified pushups and situps and stuff like that.  So that was good.  But now it's bad.  But when it heals I'll go back to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You'll go back.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I know this routine now.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're stretching?  Now you're not doing anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't even stretch.  I can get my arm up and I can feel it.  But pretty soon because it's not as bad.  Before I didn't even want to put my hand up in the air.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you going to travel at all this winter or no?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He didn't want to.  He says I don't wake up early enough to travel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't want?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She doesn't get up, [INAUDIBLE], she gets up, if I force her to get up, yknow, at nine, nine thirty, yknow, then she goes, she'll make breakfast and then she wants to take a nap, yknow.  If I'm traveling I'm not going to sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He says no [INAUDIBLE].  But I do.  See, I get up, I get cleaned up, I get dressed, I go down there, I make hot cereal or whatever he wants to eat, then we get done, do the dishes, and then I want to rest.  And I go back and I lay down on the couch.  And I'll sleep for like an hour.  And then after that I'm okay.  But the morning's gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you don't get started 'til about ten or ten thirty?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, later than that.  Eleven o'clock maybe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But then you're up the whole day after that, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you feel less tired?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's fine in the evening.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the evening I'm okay.  But the morning, oh, morning, I keep hoping that, I keep praying that it'll change.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you sleep straight through the night?  You don't wake up?  Do you wake up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just wake up for a pitstop.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then go back, yeah, I go back to bed.  No, except when I had this, then I had trouble sleeping.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She sleeps pretty good 'cause she snores pretty hardily.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nah, she seems a  lot better.  She seems more animated and that flatness is all gone that used to be present.  So I think you came out of this okay.  Took a while, but you came out of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, tell me that the mornings will get better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't want to cut the dough.  I mean, I mean.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> One of the pharmacists told me that the Depakote, the side effect of the Depakote could wear off with time, some people it does.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but she's on such a tiny dose anyway, I mean, you wouldn't expect, I mean.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I wonder if it's the combination with the Cogentin too because that can make you tired too.  All three of them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Could we cut that back?  How about the tremors, they're gone with that, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're still there?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, even with it, there's still some.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You taking it once a day or twice a day?  Twice a day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're still there.  Especially in the morning, when I got to brush my teeth, it's like this.  Yeah.  And then sometimes when we go out to eat, I go to eat soup and I gotta be careful so I don't feed myself with the soup.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think what we'll do is we'll wait 'til the spring and in the spring maybe we'll cut the Abilify a little more.  Maybe we'll go to half of the 5.  She's taking half of a 10 now right?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, go to half of a 5.  That's expensive, that Abilify?  Do you see that?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You don't have to tell me, I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Somebody was telling me they went there and it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's the same, well, yeah, retail.  I mean, I pay $105.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> With the insurance?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  Well, because I'm maxed out.  They can't charge me any more than hundred bucks for a script.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's the way the insurance plan is.  The maximum they can charge you is a hundred bucks a dose, so a hundred bucks a script.  That's why I told you to give me the tens and I'll cut them because that lasts two months instead of one month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that makes sense, yeah.  Boy, it's so expensive though.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, see, it's non formulary because according to the insurance there are other alternatives out there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but some of the others have more side effects.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I know.  I know what the problem is, but it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Weight and stuff like that, you're not gaining any weight from this, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I put on weight and I can't get it off right now though.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's when you're up on the higher doses of the Depakote, but now you're stabilized.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, it does, yeah, it doesn't increase.  But I haven't been able to get it off, since I put it on.  I haven't been -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Can't lose the weight when you're sleeping twelve hours a day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But he just says I'm sleeping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You burn the calories, I mean if you exercise.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She hasn't exercised.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He says [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She ain't working up a sweat.  Her exercising, exercise that you're thinking of aren't the same thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I exercise, so I figured it's, yknow, right now I'm not.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's something.  I told him, I says at least it's something.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's tough in the winter.  Yknow, she can't get out.  Yknow, when it's nice, when the weather breaks and it's nicer in the spring and she's out a little more, she won't be as tired either I don't think.  'Cause the darn daylight [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We're starting to get.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> A little bit more everyday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then the sun feels good.  Like being in the car with the sun out, it feels good.  Or when the sun comes out in the morning, well, it's almost afternoon when I get up, I got sit where the sun comes in and sit on the floor 'cause I know that feels good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nah, I think you're doing pretty good.  I'm comfortable where you're at.  So are you comfortable where she's at right now?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I just, yknow, she gets worried about being sleepy all the time.  I just tell her, yknow, if that's the alternative, yknow, that's a lot better than some of the other things.  I mean, at least [INAUDIBLE] health wise and not beating up your kidneys or.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's that going?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She's [INAUDIBLE] now, she's stable. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's nice.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Nephrologist thinks it's pretty good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I go to see her again in March.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> March.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Every six months or how often?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Four.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Four.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Four because she's, has moderate disease.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's good though if it's held for the last eight months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, knowing the it finally changed was, that was prayers answers, yknow.  We all have to pray sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That other girl wasn't as lucky as you.  Remember, I told you about the other girl that had the same problem.  [INAUDIBLE] yeah, the kidneys went.  So, yeah, are you doing anything special or nothing, just watching your diet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  You're supposed to watch, what, the salts?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Caffeine, salt.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Caffeine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She watches that, right?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She doesn't drink.  She doesn't over drink caffeine, but she can.  She drinks too much iced tea, so I try to, she drinks a lot of water though, and that's a good thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I got the water like you had.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> She goes through a gallon a day of water, so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it flushes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know the one that [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, the [INAUDIBLE], I like them better, but [INAUDIBLE].  I like that water better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Did you?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I like him because it was a small company too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was more personable.  This one is like a huge company.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But she goes through a gallon of water a day, pretty close.  That's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So we won't make any changes.  Do you need refills?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I need all kinds of stuff.  I got a list.  We're just about out of everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Are you sleepy?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Are you sleepy.  I mean, if that's the worst thing, if that's the worst thing that comes out of everything, we didn't do too bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have those at home?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Not like those, you got special ones.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We got cork ones.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we got wooden cork.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's wooden cork on the bottom.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's just colored over.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  All this time and I didn't know that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You wanna weigh on the scale just to see what you are?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, not with boots on.  And all these heavy clothes, no.  [Physician and patient leaves the room with recorder still going.]</p>

<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So right, right now, just kind of, uh, you are, you are out of the Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, two weeks now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  And I'm just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two weeks.  And you noticed a difference?  You know, it seems to, you, you, you, you, you took it all the time, like in the morning —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You took in the morning.  So what did you notice when you are on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just my whole, my whole attitude changed where I, you know, wasn't yelling at the kids any more.  I could actually deal with somebody coming at me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I didn't get angry right away.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could actually calm myself down, and it was weird.  I just, I felt good.  I felt good about myself.  I felt good about being up, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you notice that the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I focussed more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And able to focus more?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since I've been off it, I've already forgotten a couple of important things, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, your job was easier on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how about your sleep?  Would you get, would you see that your sleep got little bit better on it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I slept great.  I was, did not have a problem with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because one of, one of the advantages of Provigil is that it gives you energy during the day —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Day.  Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, little bit structure your get, so when you go to bed at night —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You feel rested.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that, that's one of the advantages.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, my whole being felt so much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt happy.  I felt —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt like I used to when I was [AGE] again, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I said —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it, it, the good, are you, I know that we tried a lot of others that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this one was kind of, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Our last resort.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And, and it really helped me.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Felt very good on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So r, because we don't have samples of it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think Nuvigil would be the, be the, the Nuvigil will come in two dosages.  The 150 mg and 250 mg.  I would say, i, in this case, let's do the 150, because that could be equal to the 200s of the Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Use it for a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then see how things go with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You notice that, uh, you are not as energetic with the 150, then go up to 250.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you notice any side effects with it, any headaches, nausea and vomiting or anything, just let me know, as usual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't have any with the Provigil.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I don't anticipate that with the Nuvigil.  It's a kind of a form of, derivative of Provigil, so it could be very similar side effects profile.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just, you know, I went, like, "Wow!  Huh.  They found it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I told my boyfriend —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even my boyfriend said, "Wow.  You're so much nicer."  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, he noticed it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I said to him, "I feel better."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't feel agitated or depressed, or feel like I need constantly be, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just it could be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt in control, finally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.  So that could be what was missing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In, in the, uh, in the treatment of depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could feel —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you say that could be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the Cymbalta, you take two a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  How, how's it going with your pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, I've always got pain, but, you know, we, it helps, like, my muscles don't hurt as bad [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  So an —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My back always hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any news about your pain management and the back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I quit going to that, because —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You stopped it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All they wanted to do was give me the Percocet, or the Vicodin, or hydrocodone [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pain pills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, or you know, shoot me in my spine with pain medication.  And I don't want to do that, you know, not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you, you didn't want to do any more of the pain management.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.  I don't like taking pain pills.  I'd rather take a couple ibuprofen and call it good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good strategy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because of there's some, I mean, there's a lot of problems with pain meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like the way they make me feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They, they make you feel little bit more depressed, actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The pain pills by itself, the opioids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would make some, uh, people depressed and sedated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if you're looking for energy, like you are a mom, you are a busy woman.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need to be going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a lot of thing going on —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you get something sedating —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't want it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you can feel just the opposite when you get activating —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like the Nuvigil —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or the Provigil.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll notice the difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you need something to activate —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Rather than something to sedate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  And, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Make sense?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the hydrocodone, I mean, that's all that I wanted to do, was just sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, I get really grouchy, or emotional.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I, I can't do that.  Not, that, I don't like bing that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  So.  I just quit it altogether.  I don't like pain pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you are not on any pain pills any more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take ibuprofen or —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As needed, or do you take it every day?  As needed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I usually at night to help me, kind of, sleep, because that's when it really starts hurting my back, because I've been up and going all day.  I'll take, uh, one Tylenol PM, just to help me kind of relax, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I don't do that every night, either.  It's just when —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's just as needed basis.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is amazing, that you have start all this have, like, the heavy duty pain pills, and doing just ibuprofen p.r.n.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that's good.  Over the, overall I think you did the right thing for yourself.  Coping with pain and managing it as needed —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is better than —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, there's days that I even walk around like I'm 90 years old, because I hurt, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you back to coaching or anything this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Uh, my daughter is doing travel ball right now.  In fact, we have a tournament in [DEIDENTIFIED] this weekend.  But I'm not coaching.  I'm just driving —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To and from practice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, well, [INAUDIBLE] just attend the activities with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just go to the games.  I love watching them.  She —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really got —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Can't believe it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She was, when we started she was [LAUGHING] —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  [AGE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [AGE] or something.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  [LAUGHING].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have a teenager.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I have two.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two now.  [INAUDIBLE].  You, you need the energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need the energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do.  And it was, that's the thing.  I mean, that Provigil really, because before I was, like, always angry at them, you know.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because you didn't have the ability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They'd pick at me, and I was tired, and didn't want to deal with them.  I'd get mad.  But when I was taking that, it's like, "Okay.  Let's talk about this."  You know, let's calmly, I don't know, it just calms me down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's weird.  I liked it.  It was a good weird.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  I know.  Because, it's amazing.  We, we, we tried have, several anti—depressants, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was, like, all, all the anti—depressants, and we always get to the same point, we cannot get any further —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Same point.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Than that.  But we, we do something, but the rest of the symptoms stayed there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think what was missing is the energy part and the concentration part.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That what was the missing piece.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it was helpful with your, uh, weight management.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you need that, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For weight management you, you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need energy to work out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't anything sedating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to be —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still go to the gym, and?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're still —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I go in the morning now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're still going with the group?  Strong?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I go in the morning, now, because my daughter is doing softball, and that's from six to eight every  night —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it was getting too late.  Going home, eating too late, and that's not good —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When you're trying to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To lose weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To lose weight.  So, um, I started changing that to the morning, so that while she's at practice, I'll run home and cook dinner —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm not eating at 9:30 and then going to bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then when she gets home at 8:30 she eats, and then, you know, because it's summer right now, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she's staying little bit later.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She can stay up a little bit later.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, me, I have to go to the gym and to work, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you start your day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  What time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 5:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 5:00 AM?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll go —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how many hours of sleep would you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Manage to —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, I sleep, like to sleep so much —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try to, like, average seven to eight, you know, because they say seven is, like, the best.  But sometimes I'll go eight.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is good.  I think that's a good number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that's about right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If that's what you need, that's what your body needs?  Seven to eight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well my body needs more [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what you've got it for —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I've got to work with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Do you catch up over the, uh, the weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I u, um, I get really lazy, and, like, I'll get up and I'll get lazy and sit on the couch —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I may as well sleep in.  I'll sit on the couch, and you know, I know I've got to clean my house, but, a nap just sounds so much better.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll fall asleep for, like, two, three hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would  you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes four.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's see when did we check your thyroid last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's been a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I believe it's time to do your lab work.  I think it's time to do that.  Because you're some, we don't want to miss a thyroid problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that, that's very common for the, uh, for energy.  Okay?  So we will do the lab work.  It's fasting blood work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't eat after midnight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then in the morning.  You come.  We'll have nurse here every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So any day at 8:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't eat a, you can still take your meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Take your meds and don't drink, uh, any, like, sodas or anything, just water.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you have breakfast after your, you do your lab work then.  What we do is, like, some blood work, liver function test, kidney function test, platelets —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then the thyroid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'll come in —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The office —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I'm pretty healthy.  They never find anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just, Yeah.  But, uh, uh, it's just a routine thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not to miss anything.  Uh, do you need refills on Cymbalta?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.  I think I have one more on the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Prescription I have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So I'm going, I think I'm going to give you prescription for the, uh, lab work, and then samples of the Nuvigil 150 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been meeting with [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was talking to him about the meds.  Um, he makes me feel so good, because he says he wished he can clone me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Clone you?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He can, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  That's a good, that's a good way to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well for all his other patients.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.  Well, actually, I, I agree.  I mean, you, you have been a very good patient, to, uh, I mean, you, you, you do your, your best to, uh, I mean, you are doing your part.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's exactly what we'd like to do.  I mean, if you do your part, at least we know what we are dealing with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well I can't really not do my part, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got kids —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a house to run.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [COUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any plans for the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, just travelling with softball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You have the tour, how far do you go?  Do you go to [DEIDENTIFIED] sometimes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.  Um, in fact, I think the second weekend in July we are due to go to [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, is that right?  And how long is the, for the weekend?  Do you go there for a weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For the weekend, yeah.  And then we, uh, go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, they're talking about maybe going down to [DEIDENTIFIED], and possibly going to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  Some nice travelling going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well the coach wants to, they think, softball is categorized into two categories.  You have your A teams and your B teams.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] is a B team.  The only difference is, is the A teams, well they play, that's all they do is tournament play all year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They go to these tournament, and that's what they play.  B teams, they'd have a regular ASA season.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like when I was coaching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, um, then we do, you know, only so many month of travel.  Well, he wants to turn us into an A team, where we do it all year long, just tournaments.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tournaments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It will be a little bit harder on you, because it will be more traveling, but maybe more fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, and the kids would like that more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It get them more interested and more competitive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And it's, do I sign here, or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, on top of my signature is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, here.  Oh.  Um, I enjoy it, and I don't mind, I mean, it gets hectic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I printed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but in this town, there's not a lot for, um, kids to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I agree with you.  Yeah, it's good to keep them busy with something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Keeps their minds off trouble, and, uh, and for parents, too.  I mean, you need to be involved with your kids.  And that's a good way to be involved, going out.  If you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, it also has helped my daughter with school.  It takes a lot of thinking.  She's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that, that's what keep her, like, train, like, keeps her focus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's math involved, there's, you know, all kind, there's knowing signs, it, it's there's a lot involved.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She makes more friends, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, that will build her self esteem —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Social skills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  And being part of a team.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It teaches her, too, later on when she gets into the work force, that, you know, that working as a team is better than working as one person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it, it, it helps a lot [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and for you it may be kind of a way to socialize, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, we like, because otherwise you are going to finish work, then go home and do nothing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that would be, it is, it is opportunity —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To meet people, and, and talk about all the other things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well like her friend that she's really good friends with on the team, her mom and I, we'll sit together at the games and everything, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Talk and, now we've started text messaging each other, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're making friends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and the kid is [INAUDIBLE].  Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I, I have really backed off from my one friend that I was telling you about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  How is that, be, because we talked about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have backed off a little, because it's just gotten so, when I was on the Provigil, it helped me notice some things, and she's a very negative person.  And I tend to, when I'm around a negative person, be that same way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then with her husband always having to be there, I felt maybe he was feeling a little bit insecure about our friendship, so I just decided I need to back away.  Well, mainly because of the negativity.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and, I, that's good strategy for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you don't want to be around any, uh, negative influence.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You would like always to have this, uh, positive en, energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you, you get energy from people around you, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, and you don't need that, I mean, you have your own issues going on —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't want to complicate things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's the thing, she was always talking to me about her problems, and I'm thinking to myself, "I've got my own problems, but I'm, I'm not being a good friend if I don't listen."  And, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Right.  You can still be friends, but maybe you're right, maybe, kind of, mix it with, with other friends.  Or you can always talk to her about that, because then, maybe that's something that's going to help her, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's not the kind of person, she does, I honestly think she needs help, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She might be going through, uh, depression un, untreated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I honestly think she is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Untreated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she takes everything so personal, and, and, everything upsets her, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So she do, doesn't listen to simple, or like an advise from you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  No.  It's always, if you're trying to tell her something, it's a direct hit at her, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  And her daughter tried out for this travel team, but she didn't make it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's a direct hit at her, so she goes off crying about it, and is mad at the girls that did make it, you know?  And d</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She can, she needs to understand that she can work with her daughter.  Maybe next time, she make it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's what I told her, I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, she needs to learn, I mean, what happened, and otherwise, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My daughter didn't make it her first year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing going to happen.  What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  And I told my daughter, well, we'll just try again next year.  You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Keep working on it.  See what, what's happen, how you improve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then next time do it better.  And then they going to select you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's not the main reason why I kind of backed off on [INAUDIBLE].  And, you know, was the Provigil just, you know, like, woke me up.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's kind of pro, it make you, it make you focus more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It did.  And I just was, like, "Wow.  I don't want to be around that."  You know?  I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, [PATIENT NAME], very good.  So would you like to check your weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See how [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always take my shoes off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You go right ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  These probably don't weigh that much, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's, just giving the feeling that you're doing whatever.  Actually, you lost some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were at 217.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two hundred seventeen.  Last time —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was 221 then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two twenty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you are losing still.  Okay.  Well, that is perfect.  Actually, that is great, because at one point we were going in the other direction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you were always gaining, like one or two pounds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Every three, every three months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now it's going down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For, for the last nine months, you have been going down.  Every time we check you are losing —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A few pounds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.  Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was stuck for a while.  For about two weeks, I was stuck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Actually in the beginning, you were gaining.  So that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I mean here recently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what has, like, like, years ago —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you started you were always gaining, adding pounds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you stayed where you are, and it was very hard for you to lose.  Now we're seeing the opposite.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you are losing, so what —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm working very hard at it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.  I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am working very hard at it.  Going to the gym.  Making sure I eat, you know, what I'm supposed to, and watching my portions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> More water.  Less sodas.  I noticed once I gave up having soda all day long, I started losing it more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Soda, I mean, sure, sure.  I mean, you are adding, like, empty calories —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like hundreds of empty calories every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, more vegetables and fruits.  Less bread.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Less pasta.  No more red meat, once in a while I have red meat, but it's mostly turkey, chicken.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Chicken, fish.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fish, uh, pork chops once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it, it's been hard, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not giving up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I think, finally we can tell that whatever you are doing for weight management, you have something that you need to keep, because it's working.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Weight Watchers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, of course.  [LAUGHING].  You —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need to do ads for Weight Watchers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and, and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I think it, it's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm, uh, the guy that I work with, I got him doing it, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Him and his wife.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he just came up to me, like, "I'm at 11.3 pounds," and I'm like, "That's awesome."  And it's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He lost 11.3 pounds?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's just, some people, I guess knowing this is all you can have for the day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm the same way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you need, need some structure.  Some, some straightforward directions.  Rather than leave it to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because this, this is what's good about this program, that they give you exactly what you need to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's clear, and uh, straightforward.  No —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, uh, not left to you to pick up what it will —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His wife has actually lost 15.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good.  So you have a team around it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have, it, it's kind of good to have some support.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  When I find something new, like I just found a Fiber One.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I love muffins.  And I love banana—nut muffins.  But you know, you load them up with sugar, and it's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But Fiber, Fiber One has a pre—made mix.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you, you just mix it up and make it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And two points for a big, old muffin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So when I find something new, I call her up, hey.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you're not, kind of, losing what you like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just finding it.  Finding what is healthy for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, the other was his birthday.  And she was trying to figure out how to make cupcakes, but Weight Watchers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I said, "Well, what you do is just take a cake mix, and instead of adding the eggs, and the oil and stuff, you add a can of diet soda."  Like for a white cake, diet 7 Up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's good, and I'm going let my wife know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.  And it's only two points for a slice.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you are right.  I mean, for the cake, you add the oil —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The oil, and the eggs, and the, I think it's water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  But you can do the diet soda instead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You, you take a can of, just a can, a 12 ounce can, and pour that in your bowl first, and then you pour your mix in, and you just mix it gently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not, not vigorously</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just gently.  And bake it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And for the chocolate, you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can do all different kinds for that one.  I've done a chocolate one with a diet cherry Dr.  Pepper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it, does it gives, it tastes different, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The flavors, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Flavors a different taste?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A good taste?  Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that's a good way to look at it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you can still have your cake, but not with the high —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or the high calories.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it takes those calories and just cuts them —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Slash them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you, that is from all the things —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's just —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  Yeah.  So, yeah.</p>

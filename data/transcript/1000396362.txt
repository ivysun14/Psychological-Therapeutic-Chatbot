<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, (clears throat) the thing that's on my mind is, uhm, that I don't, I don't know whether I really just have this question or if it's that I want to hear you repeat this or, uhm, for, I don't know, reassurance or something.  But, uhm, when I got home yesterday and looked at a calendar I realized I forgot whether you said the 5th or the 6th.  So I was wondering which it was because I, I guess I hadn't really paid much attention to what September was before I asked you.  And, uhm, I noticed when I looked that the 5th is a Tuesday.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, I said the 5th.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The 5th, yeah.  But, but then I don't know why I began to think, well, maybe you said the 6th.  I couldn't remember.  Well, I don't know (clears throat) whether it has anything to do with the fact that, uhm, when I realized I had this question I was looking at my contract with the school and, uhm, because I'll be away when the calendar comes.  And I knew I'd be coming back in time, it's just when I was away I wanted to know, I guess, just so I knew what to expect when I got back.  And, uhm, the contract dated, dates from the 6th.  And so then I, I don't know, maybe that's why I, uhm, — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, uhm, I was just thinking about next fall.  I guess I was wondering first, if, uhm, I hadn't confused the 5th and the 6th because it was wishful thinking that you'd said the 6th although, uhm, I suppose it might be, uhm, because I, I don't know, I guess we'd be getting in on Monday night.  So then I suppose in my thinking, though I don't see where it would really make that much difference, uhm, that I would want a day before I started.  But I'd also, if I'm starting at school on the 6th, I like, I'd rather start in a staggered way.  And, so I don't know, I don't know whether that's why I forgot or if it really matters.</p>

<p>Uhm, but then I was just thinking about next fall.  Uhm, and, ah I don't know, I think mainly just thinking back getting in touch with Mrs. CDB which I've already arranged with her.  Uhm, but it, I think I got the feeling it's almost as if — well, I was thinking about this in another way, earlier today but this time anyway it was almost as if well, this is the last day so, uhm, I don't, well, I don't know exactly what except that I'm, I felt very much I was concentrating on when I'd start again rather than the fact that I'm leaving.  Or, or, I don't know, maybe it's more that you're leaving because I'm leaving because you're leaving.  I mean, I want to go to PTN.  But, uhm, if you were going to be here next week I'd be here next week, so — (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I don't (clears throat), I don't know, I — oh, I know how I got onto this, uhm, because I was just thinking about, uhm, next year, uhm, when I'd be looking into, at some point I don't know when, but, uhm, looking into what I, where I want FSO to go the year after.  And then thinking if I'm still teaching where I am and I have FSO going somewhere on the PDSW, how I'd get her there, which really is kind of far-fetched.  And I guess the reason I started thinking about that was, uhm, something had made me think about when I was at the park today uhm, I was sitting with, uhm, the girl who lives under us and then some people that she vaguely knows I've never seen before.  And, uhm, at one point FLO was talking about nursery schools because she'd been indecisive about whether to send her son or not.  But then I think the thing that — she was beginning to think she would and then the thing that decided it was the boy he played with most just moved and, uhm, he's been quite upset by this.  And, uhm, I don't, I don't know whether she would have decided anyway to send him but, uhm, so she was just talking about some things she'd done.</p>

<p>And another mother who has a child, I guess about nursery school age, was talking about what, both of them were talking about what they want in schools or no—, they don't want.  And, uhm, when I was thinking of it right now, uhm, I don't know, I (clears throat) I don't, I think maybe it was a feeling of impatience to a degree or something.  Because I think I must have felt it at the, the time but except I was curious to know what they were thinking.  Uhm, well, and I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this impatience except I think it has something to do with their, ah, thinking that a school is either all one or all another way according to what they say, which often really isn't what they are.  Uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why do you think this is occupying your mind now?  Why, why are you thinking about this?  Why are you telling me this?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I think I've had the feeling — or maybe I did this morning when I was thinking about it — uhm, that this being the last day it's just too late now to do anything until next fall or, uhm, I don't know because earlier this week I think whatever else I was doing, I felt much more, uhm, I think that I wanted to try to understand or, I don't know I didn't have this feeling that, that, I mean I had the f—, I was anticipating what I feel now, I guess, is more what I was doing then, of if something doesn't happen before the last day it'll be too late.  And, and then here it is the last day.  Or, I don't know, because then it, because, because, then I think of just other times, uhm, when there'd be well, I don't know if weekends I'd do this so much — but when you were going to go away for a while and, even if it were only a day or two but that I'd always get this feeling of, uhm, closing up, I guess, or —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, as though, eh, somehow, ah, if you don't come to see me you really don't seriously think about yourself, or question yourself or examine your motives or wonder what you're doing, or anything.  It's only if I keep a whip on you and then under protest and with great dragging of feet.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, uhm, that might be it all alo—, I mean just simply that, but when, when I think of the way I feel about this and, and sort of feeling I need to get myself under control and close up anything that might be uncomfortable, uhm, to think about and, uhm, I don't know, to, to think of leaving here — and I think this is true of any time when you're going away, uhm, well I don't know exactly in what state but where I, I suppose it's mainly where I'm coming to realize something and, and usually it isn't that I completely do or, uhm, I mean if I realize one thing then, then usually something else comes next.  And, uhm, I don't know, because I will think of things when I'm not here sometimes.  Although uhm, it seems like lately I haven't wanted to more than other times.</p>

<p>But then I, then I just feel I'll get off the track and I'll get on to some aspect of it that's really, uhm, well, I, I, I just get all upset over something that I'd lose the perspective, I guess, which is what well, I don't know, it just seems like often I'll be work—, I don't know, going over and over something then you'll point out that the perspective is somewhat different or, or what it is.  And, uhm, well, the, the way I think of it I have this feeling if I don't close up all this now, then I'll go away and then I'll get myself all tied up in knots.  So I don't want to have anything that I don't think I can handle, I think that's it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What can't you handle?  Besides murder and rape?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Your penis.  (Pause) And feelings that I don't — I mean they obviously are connected with all that but, uhm, I can't be specific right, I mean right this minute it doesn't come to me that, uhm, any specific thing that in the past I've felt I couldn't handle in feelings.  But, uhm  — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I suppose, suppose lately, too, it might be, uhm, feelings of frustration which probably have to do with my wishing or my fascination with destructive things and actually trying to castrate you or castrate MSCZ.  If, if I'm away with MSCZ then I guess it would be mainly him.  And, uhm, but then it's mixed up with, I g—, I think not wanting, uhm, to upset this balance that I feel to a degree I've achieved.  I don't know, or maybe this is part of the way I feel I have to stop now and, and not go any further because if I go any further I might upset the balance, or something.  And I have the whole summer, or at least a month more, to get through.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, what do you imagine can happen in that month?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think it's more that I don't want to feel the way I can feel sometimes.  Because then that does affect how I am and, uhm, makes MSCZ unhappy and then he, I don't know, then we get even more distant with each other and, or he nags me or I'm nagging him.  And, I mean the whole thing just becomes very unpleasant.  And, and, and the undercurrent of it all is this very —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You mean that what's real really come out then, instead of your being able to successfully hide it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Maybe, I don't —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And mask it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I suppose that might be.  I mean I just, the way I think of it is just a very unhappy feeling on my part.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But that unhappiness is there whether you obscure it or hide it or not.  And your eh, antagonism to him is there.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And you may mask it for a while but it doesn't get rid of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You know, I'm thinking of two things.  One is just that, well, if it's going to come out I'd rather it come out while I can come here.  Uhm, but then it ma—, that makes me think of well, also the fact that the way I envision it is it would come out more during the summer so well, then I wonder if, well, again, I mean this is something that has come up before but — uhm, I don't quite see how I've managed to do it.  I mean, sometimes I think well, maybe it's because then I'm concentrating on fighting you and not MSCZ.  Or you're the object of all these feelings.  Uhm, so maybe that's how it works.  But, I mean, it would seem like if, it's almost as if, if com—, that coming here keeps me from letting these feelings break out.  But then I, I don't know, maybe they're breaking out here.  I'd, uhm, but I don't have that kind of feeling that is what I'm imagining I could have this summer.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I suppose what I'm imagining, too, is the way I felt last summer and the way I felt last summer, I think, is the way I used to feel so much at home.  And in a way the situation was back to that because my parents, or my mother anyway, was there most of the time.  My parents, my parents, my father was there quite a bit of the time.  And for a while MSCZ wasn't there so — although I don't know if that m—, I mean, the, the point is, I suppose, that it's (clears throat) the feeling is there whether or not it was the feeling I used to have.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think, well, I mean, I, I basically just when, when I think of that particular feeling, I don't like, I mean the, the a, that kind of unhappy feeling is, is just one I like to avoid whenever possible, I guess.  Which is, I gu—, I, I think somehow I think that's what I'm doing by, uhm, thinking I should start closing everything off right now.  And, uhm, but then, well, a part of it is that, that really right now, makes me feel just I'd want to avoid it if I could is, uhm, I don't know, the way, I, I maybe I'm afraid of what I would do if I did what I want.  I mean it must be.  But, anyway, the way I'd get almost, uhm, well, lethargic isn't quite it and paralyzed isn't it, it's something in between.  But, uhm, I mean on the one hand it's as if all my energy is gone and on the other it's as if I don't dare do anything anyway.  And, uhm, well, I don't know, it's just an awful state.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's (laughs) I kind of laugh when I think of it this because I was just remembering that when I came back last fall, it seems to me well, I had a burst of energy, which was in contrast to the way I'd been feeling in PTN.  So I guess that it felt pretty good.  But that I, I kept resisting starting off here again as if this burst of energy was something that I could continue if I didn't come here.  And yet it was right on the tail of that horrible kind of feeling that, uhm, well, I was going to say that clearly showed I needed to come.  Except then it seems like I've, well, I just don't know if I've used coming somehow so it hasn't, so that it sort of submerged that again.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was just thinking again of, of, uhm, really feeling almost a panic that I might start feeling that way again this summer.  And, uhm, and then the next thought occurred to me was well, uhm, I don't know how much of the summer — but uhm, certainly the first two weeks we're up there my parents probably won't be there at all since that's right when they'll be moving.  Uhm, and then I know they'll be having to, to be at PBD other times too.  Although my father does then start taking a vacation.  Uhm, so I was thinking well, MSCZ and I will be alone at first and maybe I can establish something so that I, I thi—, I guess I seek refuge in routine then.  Only I'm hoping now at least I can set up a more, uhm, I mean routines before used to be very, uhm, well, I think of the word anal, or I don't know, I mean meaningless kind of routine.  I suppose I'm hoping now I could set up a more meaningful one but one that made me feel secure.  And, uhm, but then I just got this feeling that here I've been so pleased with this balance that I've had with MSCZ.  And I think as soon as I leave here and go up to PTN that'll disappear.  I mean that's what this sort of feeling is of, uhm, I don't know, impending trouble or something.  And the only way I can think of it is as if I'll concentrate everything on him as soon as I leave here, that I've been concentrating on you.</p>

<p>And, uhm, well, the other thing that I was thinking with this, though, that kind of surprised me because it seemed like it would be the opposite but, uhm, when I was thinking my parents wouldn't be there at first, I also had kind of a, uhm, loose ends type of feeling of that it, that it would be better if they would be there, although in reality it's always better if they're not.  But, uhm, I don't know whether in this frame of mind I'm in right now then I'd think they'd be a buffer or, uhm, I could scatter these feelings amongst all of them or what.  But, uhm, — (Pause)</p>

<p>And the thing that kind of, uhm, well, I don't know, I mean it's certainly, I suppose it's not a surprise to me but, uhm, it makes me feel more powerless, I guess against this feeling that I'm right now not wanting to have.  But when I think of the whole balance going as soon as MSCZ and I get up there and, and sort of having a, well, I can't when I imagine it, I, I'm not directly imagining the feeling toward MSCZ, which must be behind the feeling I am imagining which is that one of feeling very unhappy and, and all up in knots and unable to do anything and thi—, unable to think or, uhm, but, but I did get sort of I guess a, for a minute, brief second, I could imagine anyway that it was feeling against MSCZ.  And, uhm, I don't know, that here he i— he'll be the same up there as he's been here but suddenly I'll visit this very strong feeling on him.  Which I s—, I mean I'm sure you've, you'd say, "Well, you are now," except that now, anyway, I've managed to keep some kind of a balance or at least direct it towards you and not toward him or do something, anyway, that I'm afraid I can't do when I'm up there.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and just that it's reckoned against not what he's doing but what he is.  Uhm, which is so futile or (pause) well, I guess it's the other side of my not accepting that I'm a woman is that I can't accept that he's a man that I'm not going to castrate.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, then, then I just got this feeling of, uhm, I guess because here I was when I started today thinking, well, I'm not going to get involved in anything.  I mean I don't know whether I thought it directly but I had that kind of feeling.  And, uhm, and then I'm getting at something that's kind of crucial and, uhm, but then I thought well, I'll lose it again, the way I've been feeling the last few days.  And, uhm, I mean then I remembered having had this feeling of wanting a recording, although today I didn't want it in this — I mean it, it occurred to me but then I thought well, it wouldn't do any good, I guess that's what I thought.  Uhm, because, I don't know, somehow it seemed that the other day I might forget whereas today I don't think I'd forget this.  It's just I don't think I'd, I, I think the feeling I just had was that, uhm, if I tried to recall this I could but that I won't really think about it any more, uhm, except I might.</p>

<p>But, uhm, but I don't, I don't know, there was something about, uhm, there was something about the way the last few days have gone of my forgetting and then the next day recalling and somehow that was very — I mean I can remember other things that came out about that — but uhm, it struck me just now, that, ah, well, I'm sort of lost again, but that, I don't know, the process in itself was meaningful to me in some way, I guess that's it, of, of, uhm, only being able to recall when I was here.  And then thinking that after today I won't be coming back to recall things.  I won't be able to keep that process going.  And, well, I don't know, maybe it's because I, I understand that forgetting is an antagonistic thing toward you and maybe that's what I'm regretting.</p>

<p>But, well, there was something I liked about being able to recall things again here after I'd forgotten.  It's somehow again, reassured me or something.  And I, I just, I guess I just don't know whether it's all part of doing something very antagonistic or if it's something else also.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So in any case for eh, at least a little while here you eh, are worried what would happen when you're left alone with MSCZ without me to eh, be a buffer.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You know, I, when you paused before you said, "to be a buffer," I, I filled in with, "to distract me."  I mean not that you're actively trying to distract me but that I, I mean, it made me think of ways I've tried to distract you and that here I'm, seems like, using you to distract myself from, uhm, feelings toward MSCZ.  (Silence)</p>

<p>You know, FNAO BBK came to my mind again and, uh, I think uhm, did in the way of — I mean, clearly I'm still fascinated with it but or drawn to it — but in v—, uhm, it's almost like uhm, I felt well, I can't think about it because if I did, uhm, I don't think I'd do the same thing she did, I think I would never go so far.  Except then I, I get so I'm not sure.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and the next thing that comes to my mind is, I hadn't read that article on the, uhm, women who were raped in Bangladesh but I'd kept the thing, uhm, I guess always with the idea that I was curious enough so at some point I would read it, although I didn't want to read it at the time.  And last night I was just cleaning up some things and throwing them away and came across that.  And, uh, so I did, I did read the first part and then I skimmed a bit of it and then I just stopped.  But the thing that came to my mind just now is that in several cases, because the man was sort of giving different cases, uhm, and you got the feeling this was something that occurred a lot, the, ah, husband, or some male member of the family, but I guess it was usually the husband, was forced to watch while the woman was raped.  And then either he was terribly upset over having had to watch and being restrained in that way, or else they killed him, but that they made him watch first.  And, uhm, I'm sure I'm thinking of something else about the raping, but it almost seems like the way I'm thinking about is, that is another way to castrate a man.  And so it's almost like I'm welcoming the idea of being raped and having MSCZ have to watch because that would be another way to destroy him.</p>

<p>But of course, in the end, uhm, part of the whole thing with these women was that no matter how much they had no choice in the matter, then they were outcasts.  Well, I, I guess that just gets me back to what I was thinking yesterday of, of, uhm, I'm not sure when I was just imagining it that whether or not I took into account what came next for those women as something that would come next for me — but then I thought again of the, uhm, book that I mentioned yesterday.  And, as it turned out, uhm, the man had not killed himself.  He had been planning to wound himself and somebody had seen him with the gun and had struggled to get it away and then realized that he was going to be killed by the man.  Because his whole plan involved, uhm, having nobody know he'd done it to himself.  And so the person struggling with him actually ended up killing him.  But it seemed, the thing that seemed most real to me is that in his plan for revenge, he would have been willing to destroy himself.  And it's almost like, I mean I know these women didn't choose this, but it's almost as if the way I'm thinking of it, again, is that that would be a kind of destruction for me, but it would be worth it to have MSCZ have to watch and therefore be destroyed.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I'm just thinking of something else, too.  Uhm, FBB stopped by last night, they'd co—, she and MBD, the Frenchman that she lives with, uhm, stopped by.  They were in PKW.  And uh, she'd already told me over the phone, I think it was she'd already told me already over the phone, that, uhm, her brother-in-law is leaving her sister.  And years ago there'd been other problems and her sister had considered leaving her brother-in-law, although I don't know whether he knew it.  And then she decided not to.  But, well, the, she was pregnant before they got married and I don't know that it was ever the right thing for either of them.  Uhm, so it wasn't a surprise to me that now he's come around to finding somebody else and thinking of leaving.  But then apparently after he announced this and he set up living with somebody else, he is, uhm, staying at home and not moving out.  And I don't know, I just got kind of a picture of that he's kind of weak and indecisive and he doesn't, in a way, really want to go.  And she's accepting him.  She's not, she's letting him stay once he's announced that.</p>

<p>Uhm, and she was talking about it again last night and then MBD just suddenly said, "This is all very boring."  And he meant it in a very specific way that he then clarified.  But the feeling I had when I was listening to FBB was well, on the one hand it's their business and I don't even really know them.  So, I mean I was int—, it was a curious thing to hear about at first but I didn't want to know all the details of it.  Uhm, but then I think I kept feeling, why doesn't FBB's sister just kick him out and be very aggressive?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, this is time for me to kick you out, then.  Our time's up.</p>

<p>??</p>

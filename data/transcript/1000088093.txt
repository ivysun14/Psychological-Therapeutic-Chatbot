<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>PATIENT: Scared. If I think about it. I just don't feel I have a good grip. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh - huh. Like if I knew for sure what I was feeling, and if I knew where I was at, I'd feel solid. But if you're so piece-

</p><p>PATIENT: Even when I feel I know where I'm at I don't feel great. I don't feel like I have a good grip on things. It feels lousy and I just don't know what to do about it. [But panic]. (ph) (long pause from 0:00:36.1 to 0:00:42.6) I don't know what to do about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. [You know you hurt.] (ph) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you know that this, isn't (inaudible at 0:00:51.6) livable, kind of situation. For you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel [like bogged down.] (ph) Like this should be good. Being a (inaudible at 0:01:06.7) not going to be fun. It's going to be (inaudible) and maybe scary. And it could get really dragged in stuff because then (inaudible at 0:01:16.7 due to outside noise). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible - response muted by car noise outside). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:27.6)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) satisfaction. Not because it's any less true. (inaudible) I just can't get (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:02:00.3]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And not have to live with panicky feelings and needing to reach out and touch. (long pause from 0:02:06.7 to 0:02:15.4) (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Mmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:02:17.5) feeling? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I feel like going to go to sleep. (chuckles) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Not get away from it and sleep? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No. (inaudible from 0:02:30.2 to 0:02:36.6 - muted by outside traffic noises) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm so tired too. (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well in a little. I mean that doesn't bother me. I accept that feeling. (inaudible at 0:02:51.1)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I just wanted to know what kind of feelings you were having. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Yeah. Okay. That's sort of true. Yeah. Mostly tired. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Mm-hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:03:02.9) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:06.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: Like it isn't really what I want to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I'll feel the same when I wake up. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So I'm not doing anything to stall. Maybe I'll feel (inaudible at 0:03:30.7).

</p><p>PATIENT: I just don't know. Like all I can think of is going back and talking it over again. Which never gets anywhere. Or else just making a firm decision. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:44.0) 

</p><p>PATIENT: A little. But it's okay. (long pause from 0:03:52.4 to 0:03:59.8) I just try to say what's on my mind. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I've heard of a conversation (inaudible). That's what you try to do in general, but -  like a for instance conversation, like how you might tell your- [0:04:10.9]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Last night I just told her what I felt. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible from 0:04:15.4 to 0:04:28.7) And she responded by saying she's sorry. (inaudible) Sorry in the sense that she's hurt because I was hurt. But like she isn't really sorry in the sense that she'd certainly do it again next time too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sorry that you're hurting but I don't have to do this.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) kind of sorry. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A sorry that doesn't give you anything. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I mean she just talks about, she can't stand (inaudible at 0:05:08.8 to 0:05:17.5). We have (inaudible) all the time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: It feels like (inaudible at 0:05:31.6) but it's true. But like it annoys me that on the other hand she doesn't seem to be acting (inaudible). She keeps doing what she wants anyway. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: Mmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How there's no bars on her? You don't understand that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like on the one hand I should like to believe her and she seems honest. But on the other hand I don't think she really knows what she's feeling. I don't think she's being that honest. I don't think she's being fair. She doesn't think I'm being fair. We end up telling each other that. [0:06:15.3]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. You come away with the feeling that you're (inaudible at 0:06:22.8). 

</p><p>PATIENT: It just doesn't progress very far. Because she doesn't (inaudible). She's not much more insightful than I am. We don't really get very far. It's the same standard too. She's upset. She doesn't like being a B. Demanding of her time. She doesn't like being accused. I can't do that to her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. You don't want to do that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't want to do that, but I just feel lousy about the way it is. You know I really don't, don't feel cool about her running around with David and all. I mean he's a good kid - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you said you don't feel cool about it?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't think it's a good thing. I think it's, I think I'm being used. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel? Okay. Because like I don't know exactly what you mean by cool. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. Like I feel like it's taking advantage of me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because it just seems like she's trying to do something there with the knowledge that I'll be home waiting for her when she gets back. So she really has nothing to lose. And like but if she decides that -  But I do. (chuckles) It just doesn't seem fair. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's off having good time and somehow she's off having a good time because she knows you're at home and it doesn't make a difference? 

</p><p>PATIENT: What?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow I get the feeling you're feeling like you're somehow boosting her up or something? [0:08:05.1]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well yeah. It's like she'll know she'll have me to come back to no matter what else happens. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because she's not risking anything? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean she's risking something but she'll always have me to fall back on. It just seems unfair. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:08:30.7) I don't get what exactly - 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm just sitting around waiting. And being forced to accept whatever she says. But she says she can't control her feelings. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're being controlled by her?

</p><p>PATIENT: No I control me. I don't think she controls me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you're forced to sit home? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't have to sit home. I could sit somewhere else. But what I'm going to be doing is sitting around waiting for her. And she, it's like she knows that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She knows exactly what's happening inside you but - 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And all she can feel about it is - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're just waiting for her.

</p><p>PATIENT:  - is guilt. But she doesn't want me to feel that when she's not doing the same thing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You come away feeling used. She's decided, "hey, I'd much rather go off with David." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then going home and being with you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're sitting there watching the time and waiting and waiting. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And wanting to come home (inaudible at 0:09:48.6). [That you're feeling it the same or - ] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah but I don't really feel like going out and doing anything else except sitting around and waiting. Do I really [shape what] (ph) she did? I don't. So it's a dilemma. I don't feel like just getting up. I don't feel like waiting. I don't feel like being in that situation. [0:10:16.6]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You might like feel like doing something with her. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What about your other son? Susan?

</p><p>PATIENT: What can I do? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't say, "oh well, Pat's not here I have to call Susan." I just can't do that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:45.0]

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I can't do everything. Because she can't stop at that. I just couldn't do it to her. I don't think it's right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It feels crummy to do that?

</p><p>PATIENT: No it doesn't feel crummy to do it. It just, she wouldn't enjoy it. She wouldn't put up with it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you know?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I know how she feels about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. [I take it] (ph) this, is something you've talked about?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's just like (long pause from 0:11:10.4 to 0:11:17.5) - I just can't do that every night. I just feel too little. Too small. Too childish. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you can't respect yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you must be creepy or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No it's just that I just can't, I just don't want to feel that desperate all the time. I don't want other people to have to put up with my desperation. What's to be gained? Because nothing comes of it. It's just turns into the same thing over and over and over again. And when I'm really desperate, yeah sure I do. Like if I thought something really positive could be gained out of it, yeah I'd do it too. But just to take up time. And to pat me on the head. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't solve anything. It doesn't solve anything. It doesn't get anywhere. It doesn't make any sense. [0:12:11.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Could you read?

</p><p>PATIENT: I try. (inaudible at 0:12:17.3)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What could you read tonight?

</p><p>PATIENT: What can I read tonight? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: I could read this novel that I'm reading. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you enjoy it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: For awhile. Till I start thinking about what else is going on. I start worrying about where Jenna is. Thinking about where she is. (inaudible at 0:12:37.1) I don't know. I think if I had to do the same thing as last night, I could very well enjoy it up until midnight. And then I just start looking at the clock. (inaudible) every night. (inaudible) I don't know if it's going to happen tonight. I'm just judging - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it feels like that's what would happen till midnight. And then when she should be coming home. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You get thinking. 

</p><p>PATIENT: About what's going on tonight. What is it tonight. When's it going to end. And then once I start feeling that, there's no hope. Because I still want to feel those things. I mean, it's, you get up and she walks in the door. Suppress all that. But then it won't come up again until the next time. And it'll happen again. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:13:27.6)

</p><p>PATIENT: And then eventually one night I just get really pissed off. (inaudible at 0:13:33.2) (long pause from 0:13:35.5 to 0:13:48.9) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is part of it, her, the problem? Finding something you'd enjoy doing and that you could respect yourself for. (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm. [0:14:05.2]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What won't you respect yourself for doing?

</p><p>PATIENT: Just sitting down and being happy to have her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:18.5)

</p><p>PATIENT: Anything. Listening to music, reading a book. I can respect myself for doing that. [I'm just not doing them.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you do either one of them?

</p><p>PATIENT: Mmm?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did you -  pick something out? (inaudible at 0:14:24.9 from overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. Sometimes I can. Sometimes I can't. Sitting around talking to somebody. I can respect any of those three. It's just I'm not enjoying it. It's not a matter of offending her that I do that (inaudible at 0:14:43.9). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I could even watch television. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You could feel right about it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. On the whole, I don't. But if (inaudible at 0:15:00.1 to 0:15:06.5). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How's your (inaudible at 0:15:06.8)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Slow. It's okay. (inaudible at 0:15:12.3 to 0:15:15.6) Not too crazy about doing that. Just for the heck I could do that. Just a matter of sitting down and getting started. But even so, the more I do, I can find two solid hours of work. (inaudible at 0:15:33.9 to 0:15:52.2) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling now?

</p><p>PATIENT: I just feeling that it sure would be easier to work on that if this other thing were really slow. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And comfortable. Just to be able to work on that without having to worry about this other thing. [0:16:04.5]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Without having to worry about whether she likes you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right now I have to worry about what's going to happen tonight. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. (inaudible from 0:16:13.7 to 0:16:15.8) Is she going to want to be with me? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is she going to prefer to be with somebody else?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Is she going to be here when I get home. (inaudible at 0:16:27.5) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:31.9)

</p><p>PATIENT: It ain't no good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. What's wrong?

</p><p>PATIENT: Mmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Pretty crummy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (long pause from 0:16:40.3 to 0:16:59.8) Just thinking again about what's, what to say. So. But then she (inaudible). It all boils down to the same thing. (inaudible) Am I going to stay here while she goes out tonight. (inaudible) leaving. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. But that isn't really what you mean to say? Is it?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I keep saying it to myself though. It keeps being in my mind. What I really want to say. Tell me you want me to stay. And -  (chuckles)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it that she wants you stay or that she feels a certain way about you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well to tell me that she feels a certain way about me isn't going to mean very much until she acts towards me. So she might as well just tell me to stay. Which means (inaudible at 0:17:54.9)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you wanted, I thought you were showing that you wanted to believe. (overlapping voices)

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not going to believe that - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:59.6 - overlapping voices) That she was coming home because she really wanted to be with you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I can only tell that when she came home. [0:18:05.9]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean I can't tell that right now. I couldn't tell that (inaudible due to loud ringing). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hello? Hello? Okay. Theodore Branch. We are going to have to stop. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Theodore Brance is coming to put a under rug under the rug. And how are you feeling there?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, up in the air. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The same as you were feeling when you came in here. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Pretty much. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does this feel like a good stopping place or you want to talk more? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's going to matter. Go to the next. Well I just don't feel anything's going to get totally worked out. That quickly. I guess I'm not all that panicked yet. I felt (inaudible at 0:19:15.2) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Call if you do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. Same time tomorrow afternoon then? (inaudible from 0:19:25.0 to0:19:41.7) I'm going stir crazy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're going stir crazy, I'm sorry. [0:19:46.2] [end of audio]

<P><B>DR:</B> You’re very demoralized, and discouraged?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I’m so [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, is your mood low all day every day or is it…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> More demoralized? Is it sadness that comes from your brain or life is just bad?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Both.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you’re both depressed and demoralized? Do you feel hopeless?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Helpless and overwhelmed?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is it hard to concentrate? You can concentrate, you can read?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I can’t read too well because Vicodin makes your eyes blurry, so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But your concentration is fair, you can have conversations without being easily distracted?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you able to get pleasure from anything?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but it is the [INAUDIBLE] and the [INAUDIBLE] . </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you enjoy the game?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes I did.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who’d you watch it with?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I watched it alone, but I had ten bucks on the game and I won $500, so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You did really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes I did.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’d you win $500?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Watch the [INAUDIBLE]. Well, you know they put out those, have you ever seen those grids that they set up?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well we had one at the local neighborhood supermarket, you know, so what do I know, you know, I’m, you know, putting this in and putting that in and then I had my brother walk it over and submit it. What did I know, you know, it’s just, what to do with $10, here submit it for me, you know, and he explained how you go about…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and so when it came up in the four quarter, when the numbers came up and the game was over, he said [NAME OTHER] says to me you just won $500. I didn’t even know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s great. He should take a cut. How’s your, that’s very nice and you’re able to enjoy it. You look better than you’ve looked before.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I do. Maybe it’s the Xanax because this is the second time I’ve gone to a meeting.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Taking Xanax before?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve been taking half a Xanax. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your appetite?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m, you know, I’m starting to lose weight, but that’s a concentrated effort, that’s not from sadness. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you able to exercise at all or you just can’t lose the weight?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can’t, I just can’t, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What’s your energy level like?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it’s zero.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re tired all day every day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and, you know, I don’t like the Nardil anymore. We can talk about that later.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, all right. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I don’t like Depakote anymore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I know. Listen…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know the Nardil makes me like this and I have to take the Xanax, you know, bite off a little piece of it and I’m turning into a Xanax problem along with the Vicodin problem for the, I’m like, oh here I am now, I’m on two controlled substances. Isn’t that nice.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re turning into a junkie. Well, let’s keep talking then we’ll figure it out. Do you have suicidal thoughts?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have any right now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Any plan to hurt yourself? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No plans, but I’m thinking that’s the best because I’m just too sick. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How’s your self-esteem?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Zero. I told you, until I lose 100 pounds, it’s zero. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you’re no good? Do you feel guilty?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I feel like I’m too heavy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel like you’re no good that…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I always felt that I was very thin, and I always was</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re okay, so your self-esteem is fine.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, it’s not.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You just want to lose weight.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, but I don’t want anyone to see me. I won’t let relatives come to the house. I won’t, I don’t want to be seen.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re socially withdrawn?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I won’t talk to anyone on the phone. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you, but you’re getting some pleasure. Are you crying at all?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, a lot.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Every day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and the pain is, the pain up my back and legs is a big part of it. I’m in a lot of pain.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, it may be time, all right, let’s go through what you’re on. You’re on Nardil 60 which is rocket fuel, but not doing it for you. You’re on Lithium… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not doing what?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it’s not containing your depression.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No and it’s a little speedy and even with the, you know, with the Xanax, the Xanax it’s just like I just don’t like it, it’s just not doing anything for me. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re on Lithium 600, Depakote 3000, Trileptal 1200, and that’s it, and Xanax. All right, let’s do this. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I do think that the Trileptal and the Lithium work, okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well we know they work.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It terms of getting me through the night.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you know, the other two work also but we can still.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Depakote makes me sick as a dog. I have to take an anti-nausea. I have to take, what’s the thing that women take in their first trimester for nausea? </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Compazine?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. I have to take that before I have to take the Depakote, that’s how sick the Depakote makes me and I don’t think it does enough to warrant making me that sick. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Well, we don’t know at this point because the good part is you haven’t been cycling much. The bad part is you’ve been rock solid depressed forever.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you’ve got to remember, I’ve got irritable bowel syndrome and with migraines that run twenty days out of thirty, okay, and very sick, I’m very ill when I get that so that’s something that makes me depressed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. You know, the Depakote is a treatment for migraines also, so off the Depakote they may get worse. I’m actually in agreement with you that we should get you off the Depakote. It’s time for a change. We may have to balance out the Trileptal in return. So we may have to lift the Trileptal a touch as we go down on the Depakote or we could just go down on the Depakote and see how you do and not lift anything else. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, and one thing that you need to know about the meds I take at night which is Depakote, Trileptal, Lithium. I have to take Xanax at night with those other guys to be able to sleep through the whole night. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What’s activating? Those all three should be sedating.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not enough. I am up all night unless I take two Xanax with all of those other guys and I will tell you that we tried a third Trileptal before we started Xanax, we tried a third Trileptal and I was so loopy, you know, I mean, you know…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You mean oversedated?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not energized? Oversedated?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was one of the worst feelings I ever had.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Now the biggest problem is getting you off the Nardil because we cannot have you on anything else. You know, I had success lately, I just had a patient on a massive dose of Cymbalta do really well.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, have you heard of Cymbalta?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah we talked about and I saw it on TV. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know, the indicated dose is 60, but all of us are finding that 120 works much better, but I just had a patient who accidentally took 180, three of them, and found that blew away the other doses. It really was the dose for her.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> For depression?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> For depression, yeah, she’s doing really well. You’d be someone like that, and you know, in that realm…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> How severe is her depression?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No one comes close to you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But it’s because of the other problems I have.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, that’s right but I can’t fix those other problems.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, but maybe I’m wrong, maybe my depression chemically is not as bad as I think and it’s there because of the other problems that I have and the cocktail, maybe the cocktail is right, but I have other problems that we can’t fix.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The cocktail is close to right because you’ve been much worse and you could be much worse given all these medical problems you have. Right, your head is above water at least.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right but you know why my head is above water?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Vicodin.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re probably right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m taking four 7.5 a day and higher if I get a migraine, higher if I get a really bad migraine, higher than that. Four 7.5 Vicodin and I’m telling you that in the morning when I take it for my back and for my legs, etc., my irritable bowel, etc., when I take it, it makes the difference, it takes me all the way to like evening. We know what happens with Vicodin, you know, you get to a point…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re an opiate addict now but you’re, have you been increasing the dose?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not under normal circumstances, the only time I go up is when I get a really bad migraine and then it’s the only thing that works on a migraine.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, so you’re not really using it in a dependent way. Dependence is often you have to keep increasing the dose to get the same effect, you know, have you heard of tolerance?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You get tolerance. Those are people who are using it for euphoria. It sounds like you’re just using it for…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I’ve been on it for, do you know that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] put me on Vicodin for the irritable bowel twelve years ago?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Why would he do that to me?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why not?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because he couldn’t find any solution to it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it’s the end of the line treatment because it slows the gut down. Are you unhappy that you were put on it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If he was in front of me, I could strangle him and kill him.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and it depresses me that I’m on Vicodin because I know ultimately I have to go off and when I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] they pulled me down and I know what it feels like and it’s really really bad to go through withdrawal. It’s really bad. Now, I know I have to face that at some point.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You know there’s another opiate called Buprenorphine, have you ever heard of it? It’s used for, you know, the guy in the other office here is one of the world experts on this. [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] with a patient? Do you have any breaks?He’s with a patient. Well, when the time comes that we want to handle the opiate dependence, we’ll involve him. We’ll call him in and we’ll talk about what to do. We could put you on Buprenorphine which would prevent you from going through any withdrawal and it’s a bit of an easier opiate to manage over time. There are some people, some people with severe refractory mood problems who only do okay when they’re on an opiate. Personally I’m gun-shy about putting them on and I don’t. If I ever would think of doing it, I’d bring him in but we end up deciding not to do it. It’s very unorthodox treatment. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What do you mean by refractory?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing works.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That medications don’t work and I think you’re in that category. You’ve tried everything, nothing works for you, where nothing gets you into remission. We have some response from the MAO inhibitors and mood stabilizers but nothing gets you into remission, correct?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, and there are a few others like you who have taken Codeine or something else and said that’s what works, that’s the only thing that can lift my mood, but it’s so unorthodox to addict someone to get, because if you put them on it they’re going to be dependent.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That we don’t do, it’s not standard, it’s not…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Even with the quality, with the people yelling quality of life, quality of life. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it should be okay because, you know, I mean the other end of it is ECT, shock therapy, or vagal nerve stimulation. I mean very aggressive invasive treatments that also don’t work for a lot of these folks so, you know, it shouldn’t be such a big deal but it is and it puts all of us, you know, at risk and no one wants to do it but probably it’s the only antidepressant on board that’s working for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What the Vicodin? I didn’t know it was categorized as an antidepressant.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s not, it’s not, but in your brain it is. Now it probably interacts a little bit with the Nardil.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh absolutely, that’s why I take them together. I already figured out that a long time ago.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You get a little high from it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s just a nice, they play off of each other. They play off of each other.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s soon time to get rid of the Nardil. Too much juice, too much juice. You know, I had a bunch of people who I just can’t get better. I get everything, they’re bipolarish, I give them everything and just can’t get them better. Often then I will say all right, let’s half give up and clean out your brain. Just get everything off. They end up doing better when we just pull things away. Now of course the last things we pull away are mood stabilizers. We want stability, we don’t want much cycling but it looks like throwing antidepressants into these unstable brains is probably a bad thing to do. It’s like throwing fuel on a fire, probably not good for these brains. It’s very hard not to give antidepressants when someone is sitting there so so depressed but eventually we say that’s it, let’s just back off, tolerate whatever depression comes and see what evolves. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> When I started on the Nardil, it seemed to be right before they took it off the market and then brought it back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was so great. It was so great for me. I don’t know what happened. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it petered out.But it wasn’t always great and at the higher doses you get very unstable…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, forget it, I go on 5, I’ll be up for a week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I think, let’s not do it now, now I think we should back off of the Depakote because we have you covered on the Lithium and Trileptal anyway.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And how do you feel about me taking Xanax, two or three Xanax with the other guys to get my sleep?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Take as much as you need. When the time comes, we’ll get you off of it. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is that one hard to get off of?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. It’s not an opiate. What is it?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s called a Benzodiazepine. It’s a Valium type medicine. We’ll want to get you off when we can put you on a longer acting one like Klonopin or even Valium and then slowly taper you down on that. You’re such a wreck that Xanax is the least of our problems.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Is that how you feel about the Vicodin right now?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> As long as I can…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I am not crazy about you being addicted to an opiate.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am not either. It scares the heck out of me. I can’t even think about it without flipping out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but it’s, without it you may have killed yourself by now, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s what I tell [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. He writes the prescription. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I think that’s not, I mean that may be true. You have such severe depression that, you know, anything that works we should give you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s what he calls, for him, what you just said is what he calls my little quality of life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> My little piece of quality of life.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. Even though in a court of law it wouldn’t look so good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Look at what he’s writing. He writes, he writes like the capacity up to take eight, eight, eight 7.5 a day. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I would suggest you…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He knows I’m not going to take it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I would suggest that’s a good doctor, that’s a good doctor, that’s a doctor who cares about you and wants to do what’s right by you, even though…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Twenty five years.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Even though it’s not really, it could be challenged as a standard treatment. It’s not a standard treatment. All right. So what do we do now? Let’s get you off the Depakote, let’s continue the Xanax, continue the Lithium, continue the Trileptal, and let’s start to think about backing off on the Nardil. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. What would you do, would you do the one with the C after we…?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Cymbalta.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, after we start to come down on the Nardil?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Or another MAO inhibitor. We could try the new one, Selegiline, the patch, the MAO inhibitor patch. We could… </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m scared of MAO inhibitors because I had such a bad experience. You know…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What happened to me with the...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> With the Parnate, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m so frightened, I really am.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you’re on them. Nardil is an MAO...</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know but I didn’t like it when I was on five and I was flying around.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you’ve been on it for years now, so you’re not allowed to be gun-shy anymore.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know but I really would prefer not to try to take a new one unless you could tell my why.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, the, this is not going to be fun getting you off the MAO inhibitor, it’s not going to be fun because you’re going to need to be uncovered for a while because we can’t add anything to an MAO inhibitor.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So why can’t we keep me, I thought, I don’t know, you know how you usually or sometimes you go down on one thing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And go up on, do a cross taper, can’t do it with an MAO inhibitor. You have to be off it, off it, off it for a good week.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Even if you introduce another MAOI?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Especially.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Especially. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Another directive [INAUDIBLE] </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What about if it’s Wellbutrin?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Bingo, that’s the one you’re allowed to be on at the same time and often I cross people over using Wellbutrin.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So maybe we could do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Let’s not do it now. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t want to be on Vicodin I’m telling you right now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> When’s the back surgery?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m having trouble. Until I resolve the diabetes, I can’t get the new MRI and meet with the internist and, you know, have all the presurgical, all that stuff taken care of so I’m really moving out. I’m moving out, like it could be four or five months from now. You know, it could be the summer.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. If you do okay, I’ll give you a taper on the Depakote. If you do okay when I see you next we’ll start your taper on the Nardil, okay? At the same time we’ll start Wellbutrin to bring you over to transition.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And if I have trouble with the anxiety on the Wellbutrin, I can take Xanax.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s right. But we’re not going there now. I don’t want to do too many things at once. Right now we’re staying with Lithium, we’re staying with Nardil, we’re staying with Xanax, and we’re staying with Trileptal. Do you need prescriptions? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, just Xanax, the thirty day guy.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What dose of Depakote do you have?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Depakote?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have the 500?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Six of the 500’s?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so Depakote, every week I want you to drop one. All right, so 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, then stop. Weekly.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And what if any side effects might I feel as I start to come down.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Less stability. Remember Depakote is a mood stabilizer.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you’ll feel a little more cycling. I don’t think you’ll get manic. I don’t think you’ll…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well if I’m sleeping and I’m on, you know, if I take the Xanax and I’m sleeping…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You get the 1 mg Xanax?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I think you had it set up for three a day. I want to know if you want to reconsider that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, considering the fact that I’m going down on the Depakote, that’s up to you...</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s fine if we have to reconsider it. I’d rather not do it in advance. Keep on the dose you’re on and then if you need more you…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t take three actually, although sometimes I have to take one during the day if I have an anxiety attack which I did before I came here for some reason. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, she’ll fill that out. Let me…</P>

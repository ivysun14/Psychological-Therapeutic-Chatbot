<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, bad and I did, I just got out of bed to get up and get here.  I was awake at four o'clock this morning.  I couldn't go back to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What time did you go to bed last night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, maybe eleven thirty.  Between eleven thirty and midnight at least.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you went to bed at midnight and woke up at about four o'clock today you said?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how was that sleep between twelve and four?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I just couldn't handle being cold, cold and that's all I remember.  I don't remember dreaming or, or anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you didn't have to really get up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh-uh, huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How much time did it take for you to actually go to sleep, like you went to sleep at midnight, at what time did you go to bed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I, I, it was somewhere between eleven thirty and midnight when I went to sleep and I went right to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you didn't have much struggle to go to sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You didn't wake up sad just today, or been going on for the last few days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been going on for over a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me a little bit more about that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I've been trying to get out more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took the kayak lessons that we talked about last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've begin, I had about three dates and, um, the things that are just required, it seems, for you to date now are, um, I feel pressure and a little concerned and my sense that nobody's gonna drag you out the side door.  You're gonna be safe.  Because I called, because he works at [DEIDENTIFIED], and I said please ask the guys on the floor to watch out for me, yknow, because and I just feel uncomfortable in that situation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean by that situation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's a [DEIDENTIFIED] up on [DEIDENTIFIED] where [NAME OTHER] is head bartender.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, all the kids that work up there know that I'm [NAME OTHER]'s mom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've gone to see him and, um, uh, I, yknow, I tried doing other stuff, but I just hate it and, um, so I tried to make myself happy and I'm just, I got up this morning, I watched Good Morning America for about an hour.  I went and laid back down.  Fell back asleep 'til twelve thirty.  Went back and sat in the living room chair and slept until two twenty.  I got up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you not go to work?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's my day off today.  I go to work tomorrow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are things at work?  Here's some tissues if you want.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're okay.  They're, and, they're not out of control in that the firing I was doing last time, remember we talked, I only had about two days before I did that and then I don't remember if it was stressful, I just remember my shirt being, feeling damp on my back, but that's, that's better, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are a [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is the [DEIDENTIFIED], really busy now, or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's very slow.  About thirty seven cases a day and, of course, I always get the longest day because I work so long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thirty seven cases a day, that's slow?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what's busy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sixty four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how many you work on altogether?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let's see, there's twenty four, twenty three operating rooms and one, two, three, about four of them don't operate so about twenty operating rooms going on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a pretty busy one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's pretty busy, but, it used to be much busier before all the surgery centers were built, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And now everybody's taking their business to their particular surgery center, so, and, on a typical Friday when I'm not there, they'll have sixty four cases.  Sixty, sixty four with add ons and everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But because I'm, because I'm a [DEIDENTIFIED] and I can do all the specialties, neuro and cardiovascular and then I always get assigned the longest day because I work twelve hour shifts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I'm usually in a room until six thirty in the afternoon.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, work then is very demanding and stressful, or no?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's always demanding, but not really stressful.  Easy cases, yknow.  Routine kind of things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Routine cases.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  This is all about my personal life, I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are being treated for major depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, mostly for, I think, mostly for obsessive compulsive.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's part of that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, but by its nature, major depression is a recurrent disease.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What it means is that so far we really do not have a quote unquote cure for it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But we do reasonably good in controlling so that the two cycles are farther apart. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My target is maybe one or two cycles a year.  No more than that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you get more often, do I get it?  Yes.  How do I feel about that?  That we are not doing well because cycles should not be that [INAUDIBLE].  This is some typical individualized standard you can say.  I cannot expect that you will have a period of two to three weeks of sadness every month and then a week or two of good times.  That's not desirable.  Most of the time, you should be in control of your mood, as well as your activity.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, the sadness that you are noticing for about a week or so, I can see the tears so that is pretty overwhelming.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can you identify anything happened that might have brought it in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, and I went out on, I went out on a date.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That man who's a [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was a blind date on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum, um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, had a nice time, and then it was about eight o'clock so I stopped over at the [DEIDENTIFIED] where my son works because um, I hadn't seen him for a while. He's got a busy schedule.  The other son's in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and my dad passed away in May and, um, and I'm just tired of running up and down the road to make sure my mom's doing okay.  So, I decided to stay in town.  Well, I sat over there with [NAME OTHER] and several of his friends and one of his prom dates came in and we, she and I were talking.  And I started talking to this man next to me and [NAME OTHER] goes he's a nice guy.  He comes in here and he's just pretty quiet.  So, we went over to [DEIDENTIFIED] where it's quieter and to talk and when he walked.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You and this gentleman or you and your son?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, no, me and the gentleman.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so, when we went over there and sat for about and hour, had some salsa and I was walking to my car and he said I'll walk you to your car and I said all right.  And he said, yknow, I've enjoyed meeting you and he kissed me.  And I put my hand up and, um, and he said does that bother you and I said I don't know you, I don't know you.  And so, he apologized and I said you have my number, give me a call, yknow.  So, then, I didn't like that, I didn't like that.  And.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, why is that saddening now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  Because.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it fear?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or a sadness?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A sadness of what this world, or this environment makes you feel like you have to give up your, that that's required.  To kiss somebody, you didn't even, I didn't know him and, um, and so then I just, yknow, that just bothered me.  I called, went to [NAME OTHER]'s last night and I talked to him and I said I don't, yknow, that's not me.  That's, that's just, um, he said mom, he said if I was with somebody and I liked her enough to wanna kiss her, he said I'd be offended if she didn't kiss me back and I sure wouldn't call her again.  Well, I don't care about that.  It's just like things like that are required.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have a point.  Um, so, did you perceive that this was kind of, um, a violation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I perceived that he was testing my limits, yknow.  I, um, I didn't consider him the gentleman that I thought he had been and it just bothered me to be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, I don't know the gentleman, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I sit in this chair and I listen to so many people and I kind of have to agree with your son that it was not a minute or five minutes.  You actually felt comfortable enough to get out of the sight of the son's vision, if I may say </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you said that he, this guy is nice.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And went somewhere and sat down and talked over an hour.  That itself suggests, this before the kissing part, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That itself suggests that both of you had some element of comfort, it was night and you could've had right at the beginning said no, it's dark and I don't know this guy and [INAUDIBLE] go out with him, maybe I'll talk to him over the phone one or two times, see what kind of guy he is before I go out with him.  That is one form of approach.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you did go out with him when there's nobody else was there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There is a subtle message there that I'm feeling comfortable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In this situation, and I'm looking from it on his side, and I don't know this guy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm telling you why.  In this situation, if he had not done something to show me affection or, um, infatuation or whatever the term.  I do not use the term love.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because that will be too much to jump into that.  A lot of ladies would be offended afterward because that hour of one to one time, gives the message and were you wrong in objecting it?  No.  That's your style and you are fully entitled to.  Was he wrong in what he did?  Possibly not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That is his style.  Clearly there was a conflict in two different styles.  Imagine this hypothetical scenario.  You didn't like the kissing.  He didn't offer it to you.  Both of you don't like it.  That would have consolidated the relationship because you didn't expect it, you didn't appreciate it and he didn't think that that was necessary, but it was too quick.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That means two types of chemistries are coming close to each other, but it just so happened that two people's approaches are different.  If it had created a fear in you, oh my God, if I go out this guy will be kissing me or maybe asking something more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then I can understand.  Tell me why it made you sad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's not the only reason.  When I went to talk to [NAME OTHER] last night, he just said mom, he didn't tell me before, but he said mom, I don't have a problem with casual sex and I said well, I do, [NAME OTHER].  And, and, so I know [NAME OTHER], I said you don't wanna know, you don't wanna think your mom is out like that.  He said no, I don't want to, but he said mom, it's the real world.  And so it just seems like to participate, this situation where I'm at with being divorced is that there's some things you have to compromise and I hate that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not really.  Not really.  You can maintain, yknow, your talking with your son who is at least fifteen, twenty years younger than you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And there's a term you have heard called generation gap.  Their line of thinking, you're in your [AGE], right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum, [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm in my [AGE], too.  We look at things differently and when I have conversation with my teenager and the kind of thing, we talk sometimes, he knows how conservative I am.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But whenever we talk, [PATIENT NAME], I kind of say, oh, my God.  When I was a teenager, I couldn't imagine that I would be talking like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean it blew my mind.  I might be grounded for the rest of my life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You're at least [INAUDIBLE] behind the door.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's a fact of life is ma'am, kids are different.  You do not have to change.  You can absolutely and you're fully entitled to maintain your standard.  This is who I am and that is why this is my needs are.  That might clear some anxiety, but, and the sense of insecurity too, but I don't think that you have to think that if I do not compromise I'll be staying alone for the rest of my life.  That may not necessarily be the truth.  And the other reason here I might find little grandeurs or, um, narcissistic or whatever it is, we are professionals.  You are a [DEIDENTIFIED] and you didn't receive your position just like that.  You worked hard on that to reach a professional level where you are.  Your standard, expectations, might be very, very different from average people.  We are as such medical persons, very perfectionist.  We're obsessed with some of those things.  When I teach my students, I tell them that you [INAUDIBLE] but you have to master it.  It's not a disease, but in the trait and if you don't have that trait, you will see that your papers are piling up and your disability papers are not signed and you're behind on your medicals, but you cannot afford do that.  We are obsessed about it, now it has to be done to it.  General people don't want that.  They take life much, much more casually.  We medical professionals don't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because do we enjoy what we're doing.  It's not necessary, but we do not have a choice.  What I suggest ma'am then is that the days of sadness, oh my God, if I don't meet that standard, then I'll be alone for the rest of my life, that may not necessarily be the truth.  You might have to wait and find out the right person but there are a whole bunch of them there.  If they don't meet your standard, reject them.  Don't feel bad about it.  You have actually your standard nobody gave you free.  And you should not give it up just like that.  Feel good about it instead of feeling sad about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I mean, there had been the one guy that I had lived with yknow a couple of years ago, so immediately what you do is you want to talk to a friend.  Well, he's in [DEIDENTIFIED] with somebody else.  So, that friendship is, yknow, I mean, he's, he hasn't answered emails or and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he has his own life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I knew that and I'm the one who set that free.  Yknow, you just sorta sometimes wish you were back where you were before, yknow, and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a sense of loneliness and there's no other way out of it ma'am then but to fight it out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just do not think that you are inferior or that you have to compromise.  If you think that I want to act like a twenty two, twenty four year old and be casual with sex and a relationship and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, then you might have easier time mingling into society because that's almost become a norm now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, if you want to maintain your standards, the way I have been raised, the way I have been taught, and the way I have practiced, and the way I want to maintain, you should feel proud about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I don't know why I feel sad then, 'cause I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The way I'm looking at it and it's just a matter of interpretation.  I have been right most of the time, but I have been wrong before, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That there might be a sense of insecurity.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Big time.  For me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what I'm talking about.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That if I do not go to that standard, maybe the rest of my life I'll have to be alone.  Not true.  Because I have seen, sitting in this chair, and I have heard both side of the story so what you are describing, ma'am, is nothing new.  I have heard it.  Rest assured that you are absolutely, absolutely entitled to your standards.  No compromise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You might have to wait.  You might have to see who finally meets that standard.  Be proud about that, that I don't compromise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, one thing that bothers me when you are really sad in the afternoon or the evening or at night, all of those discussions I just had might fit.  But if an individual is sad enough in the morning to go and have another three to four hours of nap, that bothers me a little bit because early morning sadness is one of the features of what we call melancholia and that is one of the serious types of depression.  So, I'm not gonna jump into the medication because of what you just described is based on an incident.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if this depression continues, then I might have to increase the medication.  How often are you seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER], I'm seeing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, [NAME OTHER], I'm sorry.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've not seen [NAME OTHER] for a couple of weeks because of her schedule.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  When do you see her next?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I don't know because I was scheduled Friday, but her schedule is changed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, uh, try to talk and see if you can get some relief.  If you don't, I would like to see you back in a couple of weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If, in the meantime, you came back with the impression that you are steadily going downhill, let's hope not.  If it does, call and I'll make room to see you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yesterday you would've put me in the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me why.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I told [NAME OTHER], I said [NAME OTHER], I just feel like there's just not, it's just an unhappiness and, um, he said mom if I was here you'd come over ten thirty at night and you're talking like this.  It's hard for me to let you go home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is he?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So yesterday, if I had saw you, last night you'd have put me in the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not necessarily, ma'am.  I am not, um, discarding the fact that you are stressed and depressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've been trying so hard.  Oh, my goodness, kayaking and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your last session did suggest that you were making an effort.  Keep it in mind, that will be ups and downs as if we're an aircraft that's trying to take off.  Until it's steady at thirty two thousand feet, there will be bumpy rides because it's taking off.  They're in the taking off mode.  You are doing something that's fun in life.  I'm proud that you went out for a date.  You are doing your work.  After [INAUDIBLE], I'm very optimistic.  Have we reached where we want to?  No.  Maybe we are at the eighteen thousand, nineteen thousand feet and we have another ten, twenty, thirty thousand feet to climb before we get there.  But just as an interim.  Psychiatric illness start slowly, build up over a period of time.  It doesn't come like a myocardial infarction over night.  And it resolves slowly too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's just beginning to tear down my self esteem so bad to be sick and, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is just the nature of the illness, ma'am.  It's not you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not you that you are being foolish.  It's just that it's an illness that has not been addressed for so long and you came into the focus the last two or three months. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just need a little bit more time and I just don't want to throw ten drugs at you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> To adjust, so let's see which one works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, let me ask you this.  Is this something that I, um, acquired because of the profession I'm in, or is this something that is due to my inner makeup, yknow, the genetics?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Both, both.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Both.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  We have our some form of vulnerability for every single illness.  Some of them overwhelming when we are under stress and we succumb.  Sometimes we are not under that much stress and we don't succumb, because you have gone through the divorce, because your profession is demanding, you are not really getting a break.  You are kind of under sustained pressure.  You are not maybe getting time to breathe.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have to pretend that I'm okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And why do you have to do that?  I know that.  Because that's what our profession demands.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even, even at home I do.  I'm happy.  I'm gonna go kayaking and.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you at least try to impose it to yourself, then you might want to start to believe it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Practicing sometimes brings in the belief.  If you tell yourself day in and day out how miserable I am, how sad I am, how hopeless I am, you will start to believe that.  You go the other direction, and start to believe that I'm happy, I'm going to do things.  I'm trying to be happy.  You will start to believe that.  That's what I tell everybody.  There will be half an hour, forty five minutes to an hour a day when you'll be yourself, you'll be totally, totally honest to yourself.  You give up all the fa�ade and makeup and outside appearance and be yourself and feel it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you'll be honest to yourself and know exactly where you are.  How far away are you from the thirty thousand feet flying in altitude.  And then you can make decisions as far as these are the things I have done.  I have reached this far.  How much more do I have to do.  Does it involve a medication change?  Does it involve more exercise?  Does it involve more counseling sessions?  What do I need to do to catch up and stop the problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I will see you back in two weeks.  If you need me in the interim time, please don't hesitate to call as I mentioned we provide care twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  It doesn't matter shower or shine, day or night.  Either me or one of my associates will take your call and we'll do whatever needs to be done.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  At this time, you are taking Wellbutrin XL, 150 in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, we stopped that last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had an.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are on Anafranil only now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see.  [DATE].  That's right.  On [DATE] we stopped the Wellbutrin.  I'm sorry.  You are Anafranil only.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, so that's about a month ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you look back, the period that you were on Wellbutrin and Anafranil until last visit, and then since last visit until now, you were on Anafranil only.  What's the difference you noticed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the with the Wellbutrin, I perspired so bad at work, yknow, from, it, I, it increased my anxiety, I think.  If I had not perspired this much, maybe once or twice and that's all.  And so, I think it was stimulating sometimes, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about mood wise?  How was, what was it doing to your mood?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't see a lot of change in my mood when you took me off of it.  Because I had so many plans to look forward to and another thing is now, my summer, I am scheduled for work now, the biggest part of the summer, I have one weekend off the rest of the summer and that's it.  And I have to pay back a week to somebody who worked for me, the weekend my dad died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have to reciprocate that.  And then in August, one weekend that I'm off, I have to take to prepare for a colonoscopy.  And since my stomach is really small because of the banding, it's gonna be a longer prep.  So, the whole weekend's gonna be used for prepping.  So, I really have only one more summer weekend to go out.  Except for September and that's always a nice month, too.  But, and that's a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is July, and past August, then you go back in September to your usual routine, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I might have to, next time I see you, I might have to look at replacing Wellbutrin with something if the depression persists.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it doesn't, then you can stick it out only on the Anafranil this time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need any prescriptions today, ma'am?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  I'm almost out, I have enough for, uh, the rest of this week and two more and that's it.  So, if you want to wait until I come back, I'll probably have enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How, how much time do you have?  How much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have, um, I have just a little over two and a half weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's then wait, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because I'll see you in two weeks.  And if we need to make some decisions to change something, we'll do that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thank you for allowing me to record this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you're welcome.  That's fine.  If it helps somebody or it helps you.  It's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Call me if you need me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

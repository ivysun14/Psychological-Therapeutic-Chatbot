<p>PATIENT:   (2-minute silence) Well, I, I, I've sort of been thinking of 2 things.  One is, not coming yesterday and, and running into the boy today.  And that my reaction, when I ran into him, and he into me, well to say I'm sorry.  But I don't know, there's something about (Sniff) I suppose there's nothing wrong with saying it.  But I don't know, somehow it bothered me.  As if uhm, (Sigh) well, I was just thinking, if I'd known him, I, I probably would be more inclined to make a joke, rather than just say I'm sorry.  I don't know, somehow my attitude was, it was me who was in the way.  And uh, so sort of, it was my fault, or something like that.  Instead of that it was sort of a joint thing, that uh, we both ended up in the same place at the same time. </p>

<p>Uhm, (Sniff) I don't know, maybe I'm thinking about that more because I don't want to — well, I don't know how much yesterday bothers me, uhm.  It was bothering me that I couldn't come, when, when it became clear I couldn't.  Because what h, had happened, was that uh, I had to return the dairy farm that I'd borrowed yesterday, because it had been due the week before, and I'd been unable to return it at that time.  And they had extended when I could return it.  And then, yesterday was uh, the best day for me to do it, because I had to either shop yesterday, or today, (Sniff) because we're going away this weekend.  Or at that point, we were definitely going away.  Now, it's uncertain, but I didn't know that it might become uncertain. </p>

<p>And uhm, since it was pouring, so it seemed like it would be better to do something that I'd be in the car.  And I, I knew traffic would be bad because of the rain, but it, uh, what had happened that I hadn't thought of — because I guess I just wasn't aware of how steadily it had been pouring — was that everywhere that I had to go was flooded.  And uh, I mean, mainly to get across to school to pick up the farm, I had to go through the park, or it would take forever, which it ended up doing.  And then come home again.</p>

<p>And uh, I kept having trouble getting through, going to school, uh, because of flooding.  And I, I just thought I might have been one unique place.  And it wasn't until I was coming home again, and I still would have made it if I'd — although it was taking me a lot longer — I'd, it should take an hour, and I'd allowed uhm, at least 21/2 hours.  Because I would prefer to have been home early enough, so I wouldn't worry about finding a parking place. And uh, then just in case anything took longer.  And uh, I still would have made it, except when I came to go back through the park in a place I hadn't tried when I'd come over, that, too, was closed.  And I don't know, the traffic was just impossible, and so it took about uhm, well, 3, or 31/2 hours to do the whole thing.</p>

<p>And so, I don't know, at first I couldn't accept that I wasn't going to make it, and I was just sure that I would.  And when it, then when it became clear I couldn't uhm, (Sigh ) I don't know, I suppose I had mixed feelings.  In that, it was an awful night, and I was soaking wet — I'd already become soaking wet, just when I'd had to load the farm into the car — uhm, then I had a, I had s,s, something, I don't know whether it's just a throat thing, or what.  But anyway, I was not f—, I was feeling worse yesterday, and uhm, so knowing I'd be coming here wet, because if I had been able to get back in time, I wouldn't have had time to change my clothes. </p>

<p>And all that didn't make me feel like I really wanted to come, but uhm, I don't know, yesterday I'd felt very nervous, and uhm, it had seemed as if I'd really been wanting to come.  And I hadn't, I don't think I had any feeling about hoping this whole thing with the farm would take too long, because it was very unpleasant being out in the traffic, and I don't know, our Volkswagen you can hardly see out of.  And so, there was nothing that made being there more pleasant.  So, I just can't believe I was thinking really, I didn't want to come, and then feeling guilty. </p>

<p>Uhm, but then I, I don't know, I feel as if well, I'm protesting too much, or something —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Yeah, and you were feeling guilty for no apparent reason about running into the boy.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm.  (Pause) Well, I'm not sure.  I mean, at this, when I fin—, when I finally had to accept that I just coul—, I mean, I could have come, and I would have been able to get here for about 20 minutes.  And maybe I'd, I don't know, maybe because I decided not to, uhm, I'm feeling guilty, I don't know.  But then I was just thinking that, when I called, uhm, it would have been very easy to just leave a message.  But I, I don't know, I just had the feeling that I had to talk directly to you, because sometimes I've found that very hard.  And uhm, and yet, when I did, uhm, I don't know, I was feeling differently enough, so th—, so that I could even think about talking directly to you.  But then, when I did, uhm, I began to, I think, feel guilty, or ill at ease, or, I don't know. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I kind of mixed you up there, a little, because I thought it was just FEN calling, say you were here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Oh. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   So I told someone, just take the message.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Oh, no, well I realize that you thought something else.  Yeah.  But then, I don't know, when I actually tell you I wasn't coming, that's what I mean when I uhm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why, have any reason, really to —</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting) I think I wanted you to say, "Oh, okay, that's alright," or something like that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What did I say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Uhm, that was part of it too.  Because I know you said something, but it seemed to m—, the way I was reacting was, that you didn't say anything, that you were just quiet, waiting for me to say something more.  And (Sniff), or that you just said, "Oh."  I mean, i—, i—, s—, uh, I don't know what you said, is actually it.  But I think of it as you just said, "Oh." Or you didn't say anything, and then you were quiet, and then, then I became more and more nervous about it, or feeling guilty, or whatever, uhm, (Sniff, Pause). </p>

<p>Actually, when I say I could have gotten here for 20 minutes, I, that's sort of the way I'm feeling about it now, and, and I suppose even then I was thinking, well, maybe I should make an effort.  But when I called you I hadn't th—, at that point, parked the car.  I had left it double-parked outside our apartment so I could run up and call you.  And uhm, I didn't know how long it would take, and then, I knew the trains would be slower.  So, uhm, I don't know, at the time I think I really felt, well, I couldn't have even made if for more than 5 or 10  if I were lucky.</p>

<p>And, yet now, when I think of it, I think of it as having had a bigger choice of uhm, well it made me think of the time when I was out in PNY, and instead of calling to say, well, I was just going to be too late, or whatever, I was determined to get here, no matter for how long a time.  And uh, so it seemed like it was exactly the opposite feeling for me yesterday.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Mm, well, what conceivable reason do you think you might have had for, one way or another, not wanting to be here, so that you're feeling guilty?  That's the real question.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm.  Well, this seems like getting at it backwards, but what I think of is that uhm, and I mean, there've been other times when this has been a factor, but what I kept thinking yesterday too, was when I was feeling this nervous feeling, and not feeling, I me—, I just, literally, was not feeling good, because I guess whatever cold, or whatever it is that I have.  And so I had that sort of feverish feeling yesterday. </p>

<p>But on top of it, and I, and I for a long time didn't distinguish it.  I just kept thinking, well, I'm really just feeling nervous and awful, is all part of uhm, the way I've been reacting lately and, to what we've been talking about.  And right now I'd have to remember, I mean, I, I don't just think of it.  And uhm, I mean, what I think of is not exactly what we've been talking about. </p>

<p>What I think of, is MSCZ saying, one time recently, I mean, like maybe not l—, I don't think last night, maybe the night before, that he feels with my working that, that it's not good.  Because I'm getting very uhm  — forgotten the word he's used — but implying egocentric, or uhm, anyway, feeling there are things I have to do, that maybe I, I don't really have to do.  And uhm, and I, and I know what he means, uhm, I feel a little differently about it, although probably he's really right. </p>

<p>But there is something about, well, I just feel there are so many things I have to do, then I'm justified to uhm, I don't know if I like the word, not being as responsible within my family, but something like that, anyway.  Being more egocentric.  And uhm, I mean, sometimes I th—, I think of it as well, there are just too many demands from different directions, and I can't answer them all.  But then, part of that comes just from feeling there are just too many things that I have to do, that I've decided I have to do in this fashion.</p>

<p>And uh, but anyway, getting back to, to what I was saying at the beginning.  Uh. so yesterday, I kept thinking about this nervous feeling, and the fact that I really wanted to come, because it just seemed to be building up and building up.  And I'd had, and I had a, uhm, I'd felt that way on Tuesday, too.  And uhm, I don't know, I'd found Tuesday a really bad day, and I couldn't quite understand it, except part of it came from not feeling I couldn't handle certain things that really weren't that difficult to handle.  I mean, I was feeling tired, but maybe I was feeling tired from this. </p>

<p>And uhm, MSCZ's great aunt had stayed, had been there for supper, Monday night.  And I'd even found, well I hadn't found it that difficult to get the meal on the table, and all.  But I'd, I'd been feeling tired, and uhm, and I, I guess I just was tired, anyway, because I found it very hard, even after I'd done everything I had to do, to stay awake, when we were just sitting around talking and MSCZ's cousin was there. </p>

<p>And uhm, and I like MYJ, so that, and I usually find MYJ quite interesting, and then, I like MSCZ's uhm, aunt.  She gets a little repetitious sometimes, and (Sniff) so that sometimes, it's kind of hard to keep listening to her, and keep things going, because she doesn't always listen, either.  And uh, (Sigh) but she was in good form on Monday night, so that it wasn't that I was bored, I, I guess I just was tired, yet there was something I was finding very hard to handle, in being the hostess and making sure she had things she needed, once MYJ left, and she was going to stay overnight.</p>

<p>And then in the morning, I just uhm, I had nothing I had to run out to do.  There were a number of things I wanted to do that day, but it was all a matter of, I could have chosen.  And I really found it very hard to function.  And then of course, FSO I think, reacted to that.  And she began uhm, (Sigh) crying a lot, and having all sorts of problems, and may have come partly because we were home, and FDO was there trying to help.  And FSO didn't want FDO to do anything for her if we were there. </p>

<p>And I don't know, the whole thing, I don't, I don't know exactly what it was, but I think FSO was too reacting to my just feeling it was all too much to cope with.  And in the end, uhm, MSCZ really did most of getting the breakfast.  Because I just, I don't know, I think if I'd had hours, I would have eventually gotten the breakfast.  But I just was finding it hard to do anything.  And uh, I sort of felt that way about the day. </p>

<p>Uhm, and so I kept thinking yesterday, well, it would be, I really feel the need to come.  And yet, maybe also what it was, was I was thinking, I didn't come yeste—, on Tuesday, uhm, because you weren't here, and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How did you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Uhm, (Sniff) well, at the time it seemed to me that (Sigh) I was sort of assuming you weren't going to be here, and I didn't make any plans that meant that I couldn't have worked in coming here.  But yet, it made it easier not to.  And, well I don't know, that was another thing, as it turned out, uhm, FTPZ and MVE were going to come by, and uhm, she'd asked if I were coming.  And that would change her timing of things, and that the time she asked, I said I didn't know.  Uhm, but on one hand, I knew she would probably want to go home around the time I'd have to leave, anyway.  So it really wouldn't have mattered.  And yet on the other hand, I was thinking well, it would be nice to feel relaxed, so in case she can stay longer, that I won't have to say, well, I have to go, so then you have to go, which is kind of the way it works. </p>

<p>And anyway, when she did come, she did want to leave early enough, so that it was no problem, and then, I, I, again I felt at loose ends, even though I went to vote after that.  Because it just worked out better for me to go then, than in the morning.  And uhm, then uhm, well, it was sort of uncertain until after I got home from voting, but we did go up to see MW's father, who's having well, FNI says she doesn't think there's any hope. </p>

<p>But apparently, what they're, the doctors are doing is working out different treatments that, they're strong, so they have to find which one he rela—, reacts least to.  Because he's having some bad reactions to some of the different treatments, so that it can't, I suppose,  just delay the growth of the tumors.  And uhm, so anyway, we went up to see him.  And it was something that we both felt we wanted to do.  And, and again, it worked out that it was best to do it then, so that, the, I don't know, but I had the feeling that the whole day was a waste, and it wasn't, really.</p>

<p>But uh, well I had had some furniture I wanted to finish doing the staining on, that I didn't get to.  And I don't even know, I think there were some things that I just had this feeling, I can't even think what they were, except I had the feeling I hadn't done things that then would have made me feel the day wasn't a waste. </p>

<p>And I somehow have this feeling, that not coming here, uhm, made me feel more at loose ends, or more that I had to be doing something else to replace it.  And, and so that I could say, well I did this and this, and so then I really feel better about the day.  Or I don't know, it just uhm, because, because on the surface, it seemed like I was thinking, well, I was expecting that you wouldn't be here, and uh, that it would make a more relaxing day for me.  Because I didn't have to go to school, either. </p>

<p>Uhm, so then I had a day where I could plan things the way I'd like them to be.  And maybe that's it, that a, as it turned, out, the day didn't work out that way, because uhm, FDO was going to be there in the morning.  And I had told her she could have the afternoon off.  But then, when we found that (Sniff) Tuesday might be the best time to go to the hospital, and she wasn't planning anything, she said she'd be willing to stay.</p>

<p>Uhm, but I had, I don't know, I guess I just hadn't even thought about MSCZ's aunt, when s, she'd be leaving.  And it wasn't that she stayed all morning, but she stayed enough into the morning so that it kind of changed how I could do things.  And well, I just don't even know if I would have been capable of making much of a choice, or uhm, it just s—, I feel as if, although I didn't, literally, but I feel as if I fell apart on Tuesday.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>But it was sort of the attitude, I don't know, uhm, because I was just thinking of the other thing I did, uhm, when we had had dinner with the BFMs on Friday, and th—, the friends of theirs who were in town from PAIO.  Uh, FNI had said that she and FN, the girl, were going to be doing something together on Tuesday, and would I like to join them. </p>

<p>And, at that time, I just was completely not thinking about MSCZ's aunt being there in the morning.  I don't know quite what I thought she was going to do, but anyway, all I was thinking about at that point I guess connected with her, was that I had to plan things so I could get home from school in time, and do everything to have the dinner ready for Monday night.  And then it just seemed like, well then after that, I'll have time.  So I wasn't even thinking about it.  And so I'd said that I would like to join them. </p>

<p>And, then when FNI called Monday to arrange our meeting, at that point, it just looked to me like I was already in this state of mind, whatever it was, and uhm, so it just seemed to me, well, it wouldn't be possible.  But she said she wasn't sure what they were going to do, and she'd call me back the next morning when she knew, and I'd know better too, when MSCZ's aunt was leaving. </p>

<p>Uhm, and so then, when she called back, I decided I couldn't go if they did so—, well, they had thought they might go to the TNB, and I wouldn't have been able to be back in time to go, to be here for FTPZ.  And uh, and then, FNI said, well no, they were going to the museum.  And I thought, well I could go over there and then come back again, and it would be, RXE would be very easy.  And I said I'd join them, and I, I don't know, I felt as if well, then I'm not going to be doing anything that I thought I should do.  But I was sort of feeling, well, I don't care, and maybe it would relieve this feeling of tension, and sort of falling apart. </p>

<p>Because I really felt then, I guess, even if I'd stayed home, I wouldn't have been able to direct myself.  But maybe it was because it wasn't really, I mean, there were a number of things, but there wasn't anything maybe so crucial that I kept thinking there was.  Uhm, well, I was going to make myself do some work for the children's conferences, and the reports I have to write.  But I, I guess I knew I really would never have done that in the state of mind I was in.  So I did join them.  But then, it turned out the museum uhm, the restaurant in the museum was closed, so we had to go somewhere else.  And we went somewhere that took awhile to get to, so it just was making everything later and later.  And then I couldn't, because I was kind of worried about getting back in time for FTPZ, I was not as relaxed maybe as I would have been.</p>

<p>And then when I got back, FTPZ had called.  And I'd left a message that I'd be home between 1:30 and 2:00, and I did get home at 2:00.  Uhm, but FTPZ had called, and then decided to do something else, I guess, while, since I wasn't home.  And so then she didn't come for quite a while after I got home.  And so I don't know, I was just feeling, everything was going wrong with the day.  That, even where things were planned and could have gone correctly, they weren't.  Because then, when FTPZ did come, MVE was really tired, and they had just a few minutes before they had to go again.</p>

<p>And uh, (Sigh) I don't know, I, then i—, i—, I suppose the day could have been exactly the same, and I could have looked at it, even with things going wrong on the timing.  As well, wasn't too bad, or that's the way things sometimes happen.  But I just had this attitude about the day that I felt like I was falling apart, and that the day just didn't work out, and I didn't do anything.  And uh, here I had a day where I had all this time, that was unusual, and I didn't get anything done.  And uh, and it was very much on my mind yesterday.  And, and somehow feeling if I came, that would help me.  And then, I don't know whether I really was reversing it, because uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, but the real question is, what's all this tension you're feeling about?  It seems to me, it might well be connected with what we began to talk about on Monday.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Sigh) Yeah, I was going to say, I can't remember.  But then, uhm, then I thought, well, what we were talking about on Monday had to do with my can't remembering, and uhm.  And that I just feel as if I am doing as much as I can remember of Monday, which is talking about my playing stupid, and uhm, part of it being not understanding, and I suppose, not remembering.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I know I put something together.  I had difficulty, but that I understood something when I left, that now I feel as if I can't put it together again, if I think about what we talked about then.  Because, I remember talking about, thinking about uh, what could have been involved in my reacting to that Sunday, when MSCZ and I made love with FSO napping.  And then, uh, the, my, one time napping and seeing the rabbits. </p>

<p>And I remember clearly having the feeling, but I think I told my mother, at least your saying that, implying anyway, that probably I hadn't, and then I wanted to hid having seen it.  And my feeling, well, I had told my mother.  And then somehow, something I understood, it (Sigh), I think I began to feel, well, it wasn't so important whether I actually told my mother, or not.  But now I'm just back at the stage where I'm thinking it was. </p>

<p>And uhm, I know I understood something too, about how all this worked in with the way I reacted at the BFMs' on Saturday.  And uhm, well I, I, I, I don't know, I, I think I have the feeling that something that I was putting together, I didn't feel so upset immediately, as or, or, I mean, I wanted to understand it Monday — maybe that's why I did — or uhm, I don't know, but somehow, t—, for me to remember it now, then I have to accept a certain responsibility that, that I didn't enjoy, so I've forgotten, or I can't do it now, or playing stupid, or whatever it would be.  But that uhm (Pause) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So there's, in effect, something that you knew Monday that you don't know now.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, I think so,  I mean, I, I'm sure I know it now, too.  It's (Pause) well, I just recalled something else about it, that, because I was thinking, the reason I feel as if it must have to do with my having a very uh, I don't know, reluctant feeling about remembering it, because of having to assume more responsibility than I want to for myself, uhm, because I was thinking of the fact that there was something in connection with my coming to understand what I'd done at the BFMs, that I didn't like admitting.  Because it did affect other people, and uhm, I don't know, somehow some of the things that I do, and the way I react, I guess I'm thinking it doesn't affect others, because of course, it's mainly only affecting MSCZ.  And then, sometimes FSO, too.  And, and I clearly don't put that first.  I put, I'm putting, it upset me more to know I might have affected the BFMs than MSCZ.</p>

<p>And uhm, but then I was remembering, h—, th—, I mean, just now I remember that another thing that I talked about, was having that feeling of responsibility when MSCZ reacted the way he did on Sunday, when he oh, had, whatever he did to his nerve happened, so he couldn't move his arm or hand.  And uhm, well then I think of possibly having had a feeling of responsibility when my father shouted, whenever I'd come in and see — well now, I remember (Laughs) more, I am remembering, well, thinking about maybe I felt responsible for my father shouting, because I really wanted to see him nude, and so he knew it.  Or I wanted to actually have him make love with me, instead of with my mother, and so, and he knew that, and felt threatened.  Because it was as if I were attacking him, to come in when he was undressing. </p>

<p>And, and then what I remember just now, was my teasing him by letting him see me when I was undressed enough so I knew it would bother him, and, and then coming to the table with my slip on.  And I remember that last, because I know on Monday, I had difficulty with that one, and I suppose, right now I would, too.  Of uhm, (Pause) well, again, seeing exactly what I was doing, what I was intending.  Uhm, because I, I mean, I knew on Monday, too, it was something beyond just teasing him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I know I had trouble with this on Monday, and I am again, because I'm remembering that you uh, first asked, well, what was I doing by doing that.  And, when I couldn't think of it, then you said, well what would I be intending if I did the same thing here.  And I just felt, well, it was entirely different.  And I remember that too.  And, and I'm still, I guess, or I've gone back to, because I think I understood something after that.  That uhm, — (Sigh, 2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, uhm, I started thinking about FSO, while I'm still trying to think about, well I don't know whether I'm trying to recall, or think about it all over again.  It's kind of a combination, I guess, this thing of uh, what I was doing, coming to the table with a slip on, when I knew my father would be so upset.  And then, how this fits into what I was doing at the BFMs too.  And uh, and then I, right in the middle of thinking about it, I thought about uh, again, that feeling I had on Tuesday, and Monday night, but mainly Tuesday, when especially in the morning, FSO was so upset.  And how I just was feeling, I can't cope with anything.  And uhm, I had the feeling, in part, she was reacting to my moods, so that after that I tried to be better with her, or, or I don't know, just hide my feelings, or I'm not sure exactly what.  But anyway, so that she would not find so much to react to.</p>

<p>And uhm, and so I was thinking, well, coming here has made me aware enough, so that if something gets bad with FSO, often I can think about it to the extent that then I can be better with her.  Uhm, well maybe I would anyway, I don't know.  But then, then that leads me to wonder if this not remembering Monday is, uh, well, so I won't make progress, or if really there's something that I just find too disturbing to remember readily.  Uhm — (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I guess first I was thinking, well, it must be a combination.  Because I found things hard on Monday, and I'm, and I've, I guess maybe I just didn't get to a point where I understood thoroughly enough, so that I could retain it, after leaving.  Uhm, or that I wanted to retain it, I suppose too.  But then, then also if I don't it will mean I'm not progressing, which would fit into well, (Sigh) I keep thinking that I want to progress, well, I don't know.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I mean, I just have mixed feelings about that, I guess.  But uh, and then I started thinking about a poster that uhm, I've seen, I, I guess mainly in the trains lately, of uh, a fetus, I think it probably is.  And it, it's about smoking harming the unborn child, or possibly harming the unborn child.  And uh, whenever I see that poster, it really isn't, except for suggesting a fetus, it isn't at all like something I did once, for an art course.  We, it was really an art history course, but every once in a while, they'd have us do certain exercises, and, or handle different media.  And one time, we were to do an oil painting.  And I don't know, I left the assignment until quite late.  And I'd never handled oils before, and, and I felt very uhm, well I had no confidence in any artistic ability at all, so I wasn't really, I guess I didn't go with the attitude I really might be able to do something, either. </p>

<p>But in any case, sud—, I guess I did something, and it wasn't at all, it didn't come out at all the way I wanted, or, just didn't seem right.  Or I don't know, anyway, it got very late.  And uhm, if I were going to bed at all, I only had about an hour to do this thing, eventually.  And uhm, it w—, at this point I started over again, and I just did this thing that, I thought of it as uh, I don't know, having some kind of intellectual thing, like of coming from "The Thinker" by Rodin.  And then having circles of colors going out from around it.  And it was sort of like the birth of thought, or something. </p>

<p>But really, what it looked like was a fetus.  And very much of a fetus, and I don't know if I, I think I used from purples, darkness down to the center where it would be kind of like the thought being born, uh, warmer red and yellows.  But it really, when I think of it in connection with this poster, was uh, (Sniff) as if it were a fetus in a womb.  And uh, that painting always bothered me, and yet I didn't want to throw it away, but I felt very disturbed by it.  And finally I did throw it away. </p>

<p>But then, when I saw this poster recently, and, and it's s, sort of 2 days in a row now, when I've thought of this painting I did.  And I see the poster, and I think, well maybe that painting I did wasn't so bad, but it really was terrible art.  And uhm, and I don't know, just thinking about sort of wondering what, what had led me to do that, too, and have it — I mean, I was pretending it was something else, but it really wasn't.  And uhm, I'm not sure why I think of it right now, either. </p>

<p>Because I'm no—, I don't know whether it's uhm, well I guess I could think of 2 reasons why I might think of it now.  One would be if it's suggesting a feeling I wanted to be a fetus again, or safe in my mother's womb, or I don't know, a very dependent kind of thing.  And, and not progressing, and being able to keep coming here might be something similar to me, in my mind.  And uh, the other thing would be if I'm wanting my father to make love with me and give me a baby, it could be that I'm thinking of it from that standpoint.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know why I have such trouble with why th, the whole thing of going to the table with my slip on.  Uhm, except that I know I started doing this on Monday, and then I got beyond it, and I just feel as if I can't now.  Feeling, well, I was just trying to uh, annoy him, and tease him.  And, and yet I know it really was more, because I remember on Monday, uh — now I'm not having that feeling I had Monday — but I know Monday I had some kind of a feeling of uh, thinking of the other times when he would see me with less on, in a very different way than thinking about coming to the table.  As if I couldn't believe I'd done that about going to the table.  Whereas, I could think of teasing him in the other ways.  And uhm, well still, I guess it m—, I find it hard to imagine that I actually did it.  So, I mean, I know there's something more, and I just feel so resistant to thinking about it.</p>

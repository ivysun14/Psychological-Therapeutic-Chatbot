<p>COUNSELOR: Grogan. Interview 17. Grogan. Interview 17.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not essential.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. It's not. Is it all right if I end early today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Because I have training. And this train (inaudible at 1:11:49.8) And I'm going out to dinner then. So. Is it like 10 minutes? I was trying to time my walk over here but actually I (inaudible at 1:11:59.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you have to allow 15 minutes. [1:12:09.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't tell. I was trying to look at (inaudible at 1:12:15.2) on the train but —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. You — I'm talking about the walk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. I'm just — I was trying to time it and I couldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like where are you taking (inaudible at 1:12:26.5) to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Downtown.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get to the north side?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about taking the L?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine. (inaudible at 1:12:40.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that it goes (inaudible at 1:12:45.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't that the long way that way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:12:52.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's all right. [1:12:53.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think — probably the — to get to about where you live, it's quicker to take the L than the IC, right? Okay. What do you do? You mean go — when you leave here, is that the 63rd and University? Yes. Go straight to Belmont. (inaudible at 1:13:46.4) right around where you are. So that's that — how long does that take about? Forty five minutes or something. Forty minutes. Okay. How many — what's the (inaudible at 1:14:15.5) Oh. The (inaudible at 1:14:19.7) Okay. Okay. And then you'd get off at Willington (inaudible at 1:14:46.5) Okay. And Belmont (inaudible at 1:14:58.3) Yeah. No. No. This is for a client. I'll pay you. I think I have enough to get her — at least get her home. And then we can figure out what to do from there. Okay. Here's a (inaudible at 1:15:27.1) Okay. Thank you Beth. [1:15:28.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Got it. It's better that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's what she does.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:15:35.4) Go to 63rd and University.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there you take the train (inaudible at 1:15:47.0) train.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Right. The L is right there, isn't it, on 63rd?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And you take it to Willington.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's — yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you (inaudible at 1:16:02.4) the rest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Wow. That's wonderful. I never thought of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:16:07.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: 63rd isn't any farther than the IC I'm sure. No. If it is, it's not much farther.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think almost the same.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it's four blocks verses about eight blocks or six blocks.</p>

<p>(Phone ringing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:16:28.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She had to tell me exactly (inaudible at 1:16:30.2) Yes. Yeah. No. She's up — it's 55th and (inaudible at 1:16:46.7) Oh. You mean take (inaudible at 1:16:49.5) at 55th and University and get a transfer. Yeah. Okay. You will be? Okay. Thank you. If you don't like the neighbor at 63rd and University, you can go to 55th and University and take a cross town bus across the Park. [1:17:14.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. That would be a lot longer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think they're both (inaudible at 1:17:18.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure I can walk (inaudible at 1:17:24.9) Thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You bet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My feet are (inaudible at 1:17:32.4) in these shoes (inaudible at 1:17:39.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now is that your hard walking shoes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wasn't thinking clearly. So, my mind has just been full of that. I —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Full of getting around (inaudible at 1:17:50.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) Full of getting around. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know (inaudible at 1:17:55.5) but I'm just used to having them in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. So all of the sudden, you discovered things have (inaudible at 1:18:05.6) [1:18:06.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's horrible to depend on the IC too because it's long (inaudible at 1:18:13.9) running late. Okay. I could switch that off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I want to talk about. I know I'm talking about therapy (inaudible at 1:18:52.2) I don't know what I want to say. [1:18:58.5]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just not sure what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm uncomfortable too because I didn't come last week. A little uncomfortable. Because I felt guilty about not coming. Guilty (inaudible at 1:19:40.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you say you were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You didn't do anything. You were quite the opposite. But I nonetheless felt like it's something that I should have done and I didn't do. And (inaudible at 1:20:16.8) just horrible. (inaudible at 1:20:19.7) [1:20:21.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel guilty. You sounded guilty for it because - guilty for me you said. And that sounds like I was feeling like you should have come or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I — I'm sure that you were. But anyway, that's the feeling that I had. Maybe I was feeling guilty for you but I thought I was feeling guilty for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And it's like okay so you said you know it isn't true but —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your fantasy is something like I had bad thoughts about your not coming. That I feel you should have come. Yeah. And on one hand it's like you're feeling or mad (inaudible at 1:21:09.5) like I'm sitting here now. And I think you're mad at me. But (inaudible at 1:21:16.8) coming back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I thought that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's true. Maybe that's why I feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:21:27.0) That's a gross exaggeration because I don't know (inaudible at 1:21:47.5) Part of it was that I was think — kind of angry at myself because I thought of things that I wanted to talk about too. But that was probably like on Friday I was feeling (inaudible at 1:22:15.5) And I was just angry at myself because of something that I didn't do that I — I did want to do it by Friday. Thursday afternoon I was hot and I was grouchy. And I was angry at (inaudible at 1:22:43.5) I didn't feel like coming at all. But by Friday, I kind of did and I was berating myself. And not feeling too guilty yet but not feeling — now I can't talk. I felt guilty (inaudible at 1:23:03.7) [1:23:03.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm just tired and spacey and —</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that it took me so long in here to be more accepting rather than expecting things of myself through therapy that I feel like I wasted a lot of time. And I'm — I feel short changed. [1:24:21.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? You spent so much time kind of feeling negatively (inaudible at 1:24:35.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you cheated (inaudible at 1:24:40.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I cheated — oh, yeah myself. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you know you could be judgmental of therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like more out of therapy. Like more should be happening or I should be (inaudible at 1:25:00.8) or something like that.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm really coming down. It has nothing to do with Drew really. I'm just coming down. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:25:43.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Just physically relaxing and I feel like lying down. (Laughs) That's (inaudible at 1:25:50.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:25:50.8) You make it sound like you've been all tense all day in some way and now (inaudible at 1:25:57.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that usually occurs after school but I'm dizzy because I was on the train and stuff. [1:26:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That must feel pretty (inaudible at 1:26:10.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not here. (Laughs) No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's because you're tense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not tense. I'm not — I'm just not thinking or —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:26:24.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disorganized in your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Extremely. Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's 5:18 p.m. I've been sitting here telling you about how I feel for 18 minutes. Wow. That seems like a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. You mean like that's an accomplishment or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It isn't. It's horrible. [1:26:59.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:26:57.4) Yeah. You shouldn't be telling me how you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not how I feel but that's all that I can think about right now is my physically feelings. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. I didn't understand you. Yeah. What you've been doing is you've been sitting here giving me physical symptoms.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. My feet hurt and all that like of stuff and I'm coming down. And, I don't want to take the train.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I heard you say that you feel kind of cheated (inaudible at 1:27:30.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you, therapy is over.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you just messed it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I know that before I thought I was doing that to myself. You know like I knew that was going to happen. And I — well I have no idea if something like that is true. But it just occurred to me. And, anyway it's happened (inaudible at 1:28:00.0) whether I wanted that to happen (inaudible at 1:28:03.2) I don't know. [1:28:04.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. Wait a minute now. We — what's happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel (inaudible at 1:28:23.8) Maybe I would feel like that anyway. Like I think that I messed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's doubly hard.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (inaudible at 1:29:29.2) we've talked several times (inaudible at 1:29:33.3) more than just one or two about how — like how to just (Laughs) inappropriate or something like that —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or (inaudible at 1:29:52.9) I must have been thinking — it's like an immediate dream and I woke up right after it (inaudible at 1:30:01.6) how that wasn't true. And I — oh, I can't remember this now. This might have been when I was (inaudible at 1:30:12.4) I don't know. [1:30:13.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was some — it was all black and the inner core was black. It was a full black (inaudible at 1:30:24.3) for the flames. But it was — I can't remember the importance of it which was that it wasn't good which was why it was (inaudible at 1:30:34.5) But anyway, that's basically, I guess - I think I'm leaving out something important that I don't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it sounds like it was important to you in that it — it isn't that it's on the periphery. It's like it's inside and it's not good. Like it's a (inaudible at 1:30:59.6) in sort of the gloss over (inaudible at 1:31:02.9) [1:31:04.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was your dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might not have been a dream. I mean it might have been a -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Semiconscious kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the time — this has nothing to do with it - but at the time (inaudible at 1:31:48.3) and your mind must be relaxed. Right? This is —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:31:56.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we're — it seems like that's the kind of — I don't know — it has to be (inaudible at 1:32:06.5) and it's like (inaudible at 1:32:15.0) I've said like things that were kind of (inaudible at 1:32:19.0) with all of these (inaudible at 1:32:22.1) And I don't know why I'm talking about it. [1:32:29.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So wondering because of or wondering if it was supposed to have some source of (inaudible at 1:32:34.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know that I had actually. Yeah. (inaudible at 1:32:43.5) you talked about them. Yeah. Oh gosh. Well I'm in bad shape to be here. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for you because I'm just — I'm sorry for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you said you're like at least three things. One is the — it sounds like you're perceiving yourself as coming off very scattered and disorganized and that, in some ways, I'm not clear how. It also sounds like okay, that's (inaudible at 1:33:24.2) A. B is that's like I'm not liking how you're coming off. It's like I'm perceiving you (inaudible at 1:33:34.4) and not liking it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like my time is wasted or I (inaudible at 1:33:41.1) You kind of feel like —</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's the sense then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think (inaudible at 1:33:47.7)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, the third is you don't like how you are. [1:34:02.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean I stopped thinking about how I feel (inaudible at 1:34:09.2) I feel like I'm mumbling which I think I am. I feel like I do in the morning when I first get up and I have a lot of trouble talking. Or thinking (inaudible at 1:34:22.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:34:22.9) That's how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that makes it — like in the morning, it feels like not so much having trouble thinking (inaudible at 1:34:40.4) but it's more like — sort of like thinking of everything. It would be —</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's concentrating on one minuet thing at a time that (inaudible at 1:34:52.2) (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. So like slow and painful and mobilizing yourself. [1:34:57.2]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't seem those ways to me right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been a little (inaudible at 1:35:55.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. No. I meant when you first said that. [1:36:01.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I started thinking like this, you were feeling like I'm perceiving you as. Now I started thinking like well like am I doing that? (inaudible at 1:36:14.1) thinking it or —</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really the way I'm perceiving myself. And I couldn't imagine that you couldn't. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I project a lot like that. I know.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said — yeah. Okay. I am perceiving you as you — like impatient with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm getting there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 1:36:46.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I am.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm impatient with myself because — not because — part of it's because I have one and a half times left. But it's like — but I'm not sure because I have all of these things that I would like to talk about it. And when I come in here (inaudible at 1:37:25.4) And when I come in here and talk about something that I want to talk about, I've made a big effort all the way here to think about things - at least to start off with. If I don't do that like today, I just drift around. [1:37:47.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay. One reason is that you're impatient with you is because it's so timely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that (inaudible at 1:38:04.3) the way I count it, the way I —</p>

<p>[Break in tape]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're (inaudible at 1:38:12.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't make it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm — okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then (inaudible at 1:38:15.3) I didn't know until this very moment. So this is your next to last hour.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't realize that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought you did. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I may have and not realized I realized it. I think. (Laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now let me take that in (inaudible at 1:38:35.1) and think about that. Can you? Now there's something else I want you to know about. The door is cranking shut and you don't know what — forgotten now what the rest of it was. [1:38:52.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: At this point, I'm not here. I just —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Think of things for us to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing Earth shattering. Just things that I think about. That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens when you come here though? What -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I come in here and usually if I (inaudible at 1:39:18.6) don't have something to say (Laughs) my mind like thinks well, come on, think about what you wanted to talk about. And, there's no response at all. And then it thinks again come on now, there are a lot of things that you thought of over the past day or two or however long it was. No response.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then it's like — something like you're using up your time again. You dummy. [1:40:00.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. The way you say it, it makes it sound like you're so busy — kind of beating yourself over the head and coxing yourself and prodding yourself with hating yourself that you can't think of anything to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so when I stop and stare, I think that I'm not — it's not (inaudible at 1:40:25.7) It's just blank.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like (inaudible at 1:40:30.8) will drift in. Once in a while that happens (inaudible at 1:40:35.6) I mean after I leave after a while then I start remembering things that I wanted to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes it even worse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 1:41:03.4) defense mechanism but it's not (inaudible at 1:41:06.1) that I want to (inaudible at 1:41:08.4) horrible to me necessarily. [1:41:13.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the (inaudible at 1:41:18.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not being able to remember them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you're saying this sounds like — well what I said is not so much that you can't remember them but it's more like — it's not so much you can't remember them in a vacuum. It's more like you're so busy doing something else. You're just feeling stupid and all those things that — [1:41:43.1]</p>

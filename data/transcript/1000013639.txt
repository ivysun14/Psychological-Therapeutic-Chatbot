<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You always conscious of weather or what? Every so often?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every so often. I thought I would come in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like you were expecting me to say something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just waiting for you to say something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It doesn't bother me much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except that there is a little more pressure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just sort of think to myself when I am talking. I kind of mumble and I don't talk about it. It doesn't (inaudible 1:13) anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't worry about it, no. Like I said, I expected you were waiting for me to say something else. I could (inaudible 1:38) over all this. I don't give a crap about school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that kind of over and done with, or at least is that the way you feel about it now? There is nothing new that you want to get to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it is probably nothing really - but it is still there. Kind of, I have screwed up. I am still not dealing with it very well. (inaudible 2:13) dealing with it very well. (Inaudible 2:28) Why don't I go back out there? You know, sit down and do some work so I can go about my business (inaudible 2:40).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here you feel real optimistic about how you are going to deal with this now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm. And then when I get back out there, it is just the same as always.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hard again or you don't think about it? You cannot change it. I mean, is it just a matter of snapping back into old habits or is it trying and ...they are still not different. 0:03:04.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I haven't really done anything which would be called trying but I think I am trying a little bit. It is not like snapping back into old habits because I never really left them. It is just like I get back out there and it is the same...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The same old thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I tell myself sometimes but I don't really think I am doing anything. I am trying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think sometimes...mentally, you think something different is going on but you don't see yourself, making yourself (inaudible 4:11) or making different decisions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think (inaudible 4:17)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then I don't understand this thinking that you are trying. You said, well, you think you are trying to be different but you are not so sure you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just sort of tell myself I am trying but I told myself that I was trying before - before I came here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, like saying: "Look, don't be so hard on yourself: you are trying, after all?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I was trying before and now I am trying now, in fact. I am trying but it is not showing much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is that kind of way where the main thing is, it is something to tell yourself, to push aside. If you stop to think what is really true...so that is clear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I cannot even sit here and say that I try. Rather than disregard it completely - disregarding what I think I should be doing completely - I sort of think about it. In some vague way, I am trying to get myself to do it but so far it is all in my mind. I have reached the stage where I am not actually doing it...doing something specifically about it. It hasn't affected my actions yet but... 0:06:28.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the fact that you have set your mind on those problems is something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it would be a lot more pleasant just to say "to hell with it" and not put my mind on it. Disregard it completely - that would be more pleasant. But, you know, when I start thinking about something, it is unpleasant and I am submitting myself to this unpleasantness - this unpleasantry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems to me like a mental pain that you undergo to try and stop you doing something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it is not pleasant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and not only is it not pleasant but it is also...it is irrelevant to you - to the (inaudible 7:42). I could go out and beat my head against the wall; that would be unpleasant but it wouldn't be relevant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you said before that you kind of see this as a stage: does that mean to you - this thinking about it and not having that (inaudible 8:00)- does that mean to you that you want to go...that there is a direction that you are going in; that you want to be acting on it ultimately? Or was that just a manner of speaking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't understand what you are saying?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you said that what you are doing is that you are kind of thinking - more than acting - on the problem. You are thinking on it and you count that as a way...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, and essentially...from the time I was nine, I think, I was expected to express this open action that may be a little optimistic. I look at it as if I am thinking (inaudible 8:50).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Basically, really what I am asking you is do you see it as a stage; do you feel good about it; about being in this thinking? 0:09:00.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because I think I should be doing something. I don't really expect it (inaudible 9:13) doing something. It is better than nothing but it is not (inaudible 9:20).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We got back to talking about school even though you said that it was...at the beginning you didn't know if you really wanted to do that and I was wondering was it a dead thing to talk about school? Like (inaudible 9:54) expecting or did we just kind of happen into it or did you have something to talk about or what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of think that...well, it was sort of said once and it is not that much different now than it was the last time I was here talking about school. For some reason I hated school. As much as I could, I just went along with it hoping I would get out and then I wouldn't have to talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said that to yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I told myself I don't think I should be talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if someone said to you: "If you hate it that much, why don't you just leave?" Did you say: "Yeah, that is right?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty much: saves me having to complain about it - constantly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but here you are and you haven't left school; and you don't like it; and now to...your situation at the moment, right? So someone just said: "Well, if you hate it so much why don't you just leave?" And you don't leave: then you have got to find some other way of dealing with that criticism.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it could be that I am no longer not leaving. If I am going to (inaudible 11:36), you know, complain about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But here is the thing: what I don't see is how not to complain out loud as a solution to that criticism.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I know what you mean: I shouldn't be complaining in my mind either. I don't know. I guess I don't think too much (inaudible 12:11). 0:12:11.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Slowly, or it is just not connecting, or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just try to focus my mind on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing: I am just trying to think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 12:24).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is probably a matter of getting (inaudible 12:29). It is also probably something to do with the fact that I don't feel quite natural to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you are under some kind of strain all of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strain? I think I know what you mean by strain. It is just...(inaudible 13:05) situation, sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you are saying in various situations you find it difficult to talk or just to think or just to...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To talk and think, and I am also sort of...maybe I have some sort of feeling: "What should I be saying?" And not really knowing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there are things you ought to be talking about: that kind of thing? There is an agenda: "Oh yeah, there are things?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It is like when we were talking about what I am saying already: I just don't know what I should be saying about that subject. Like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of options do you see that you are thinking you have to choose between?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not a matter of choosing between options, it is just sort of choosing between several things that I don't see them fitting into any broad category. Like you say "yes" to a question and another question. Some questions it will be "yes" and some questions it will be "no." There is no broad category. 0:15:05.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you give me an example? I am not really following.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you can give me a made up example if you cannot think of one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think that I can give an example exactly. When I say something or when I am thinking about something before I am going to say it, I just sort of wonder, maybe, what should I be saying and what should I be talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, is that all like thinking: "Well X, should I be talking about it or shouldn't I? Should I even bring up X?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it seems pretty credible what you thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, are you losing hold of it or are you just like: "Well, I cannot understand it?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I cannot explain it. When I go to say something I just sort of wonder is this what I should be saying. I don't know if I can make it any clearer than that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like: "Is this the right thing?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: More like that than the thing you said previously. It has got that element of: "What am I talking about?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just spouting off things or if I am really saying something it has true meaning - so that I am not just spouting off things. 0:18:07.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you cannot tell me that you are just operating on the surface sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm-hmm. Yeah, sort of maybe that I am expected to say things to you as opposed to something that I am spouting off on the surface. And so when I try to think of something, I am trying to think in such a way, say something true (inaudible 18:47) something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something (inaudible 18:48) and not superficial (inaudible 18:51).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So then when you try and think to something to say here, it is not just a matter of thinking of something that you think you want to say, but it seems to you like you also have to examine your motives and make sure that that is a really serious thing. Deep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is not nice having no motive. It has to be real. It just cannot be a thought that somehow wandered into my head because it sort of wanders in and out again. It is not really a part of me. I have sort of got to talk about things that have more significance with respect to me. It is just something that is in and out and then I will forget about it in two minutes. It has to be the sort of thing that I can come back to because it is me (inaudible 20:18).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has to be about the subject matter with you. It cannot just be a thought about anything. Also, your thinking has to be thoughts that are more continuing (inaudible 20:41)to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that from your own point of view or from what you think therapy is supposed to do? 0:21:00.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is, you know, my own point of view and it is what I think (inaudible 21:28) different. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder about the value of whatever you do. I mean, if we were dig a lot into things that don't have any real relevance in continuing the issue. I just don't see what benefit it can be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think - although I am raising this question - should we be...what kind of things should we be talking about: you don't see the sense of that. The only thing that I am really raising the question on - that I am really concerned about - I am not sure that a lot of the things...well, what should be talked about. But what I am concerned about is the sense of constraint you seem to be laboring under with this; that has something to do with what you think we should be talking about; what you think you should be bringing up. It seems to have put some kind of a constraint on you and make you keep on seeming like you are in an unfamiliar situation, where you don't know what to say or how to think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see what you mean but I don't really know what to do about saying other things because I just don't think...I wouldn't feel quite right coming here and talking about some TV show that was on last night or something like that. Maybe that is permissible, or something, but that would seem strange to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that would seem strange to me too - that has been done - but there is a kind of wide ranging between doing something like that - which is really outside - and your most deep thinking - which is what you keep on checking for. It is like there ought to be some way that you could feel that you don't always have to be monitoring what you say for it being significant to you - which it sounds like, which I am concluding is something that you do do a lot of the time. 0:24:26.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it is a deliberate sort of thing. I am trying to think of a condition that I think (inaudible 24:38).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of keeping on checking back: "Is this real?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but like I said, I don't think it is deliberate. I think, as a matter of fact, that I am sort of realizing today that it may have been going on briefly. I think I do that more when I think I am looking for something to say rather than (inaudible 25:26)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can get...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Relatively (Inaudible 25:31).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of when you are more involved or just thinking something through. And then you are conscious of the fact that you are saying something that is a fact of how involved you are in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is that also saying: "Well, it is not such a big problem. It is not such a completely overriding thing." Especially if you may have been talking about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is not like completely overriding. It doesn't sort of, you know, make anything we have talked about sort of dubious, but it sort of does, I guess, feel like what we talked about now - something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like: "What are we going to talk about right now?" 0:27:00.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: In counseling, I just don't feel like I have a lot to say. It will probably bear more significantly on how I feel being in this room than when I have a lot to say (inaudible 27:17). There are some things that are sort of bothering me (inaudible 27:35). They need talking about but yet I wouldn't feel this comfortable discussing it with you, like it is now, because the situation still feels unfamiliar.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That discomfort would be what? What kind of thing? I mean, like is it that you wouldn't know how to say it. You feel awkward or embarrassed. You don't know whether you get anything out of talking about those things here or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is sort of an embarrassment. There is no (inaudible 28:28) real personal (inaudible 28:29). I feel like a (inaudible 28:35). I just feel uncomfortable or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that, like, not knowing how I have been reacting? Or worrying about how I have been reacting? Or thinking you knew how I would be reacting and not wanting it? Those are all really the same thing - kind of elaboration. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It is sort of not really how you have been reacting. It is sort of the possibility that with the things that I would tell you, you might realize something that I didn't realize about me in my situation. All of a sudden you might make me see it as something and I might not want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be the kind of thing where I would be trying to convince you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you wouldn't try to convince me, you just might point...make me see something that I haven't seen before and I might not like what I see. I would rather feel like I understood everything and explained it to you. 0:30:08.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to feel like you, kind of...well, not really having control is really quite right for you. Like, you know what is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know what I want. I sort of feel I know what is happening but there is always a possibility that I don't know what is happening and you could point out what is happening and it might be quite the opposite of what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then how would you feel? Like having a rug pulled out from under you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It would feel like having the rug pulled out from under me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of crash?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might be left in a worse condition than I am before I go into it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Worse for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean less happy: maybe I am more unhappy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes it is easier talking about those things you like...you are made to realize something that would just...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is more unpleasant than the situation now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is something kind of risky about thinking or talking about those problems?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you know, it is like not only the risk. You just sort of figure that (inaudible 32:00) personal problems or something like that and you just don't talk to a lot of people about them. I don't talk to my friends about them; I don't talk to my family. It would be very hard to talk to anybody about these sort of things because I have never talked to anybody about them before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like those things have always been so private - kind of locked inside. There isn't really...you don't know how to even go about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is (inaudible 32:41).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it is just not done. There is also something about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just don't do it - some people might. It is just something that I am not used to. I might be able to talk about some (inaudible 33:08), like it is out in the closet somewhere and nobody knows and if the door was closed I might be able to talk to the closet - just like telling it to a human being. 0:33:21.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are saying maybe you do have the words for it, you know...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I did, I still don't know whether I would want to talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like something too open about doing that - you are too open to the other person then? Something sounds intimate about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, something too open. Not in the sense that there is any actual standard that says that is too open and never do that, but I am not used to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and you get an uncomfortable feeling about the idea of doing it; somehow edgy about it and like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sort of makes you vulnerable to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to you like it would be a dangerous kind of thing to get into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the danger of? Can you get a hold on that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Part of it is the specific thing about...in your case, you might tell me something that may be true but that I really wouldn't want you shattering my illusions, sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible 35:11) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I have lost track of the question: there was another part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The question was that: what are the dangers? Did you know what is the danger of..?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably the dangers would be like, in general with any person, you just sort of have some control of these things. Like, know your weak links (inaudible 35:43).You are vulnerable once you have told somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you have told them they could hit at those weak links.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, they could hit at you (inaudible 35:58). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:36:00.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is sort of...I sort of (inaudible 36:10) several times. I haven't been this close to people. Like if I tell them something they are going to use it against me. Sometimes they can use it to their own advantage. 0:36:27.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to you that people mess things up (inaudible 36:38) or that they hold up things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything that they think could be worth having for some time (inaudible 36:46). Yeah, I am sort of using this. I want to (inaudible 37:16). I sort of thought that that was the way that, sort of, work into something, talk about the way I deal with people. That is why I (inaudible 37:23). I mean, having things that I don't want to talk about. It is interesting because it sort of works, because now I don't feel like talking about some of the relations I have with people. There are these things that I want to hide but they just...when we talk about it, I really don't know how to talk about my relations with people. This is sort of like working into it. And now, like, there are maybe a couple of things that I have noticed. I tend not to get along with room mates - that is a specific thing. I sort of feel that they just store these little points and may use them against me. Little things that I don't like; the little personal knowledge they have of me; they sort of use it to turn on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not just a sense of they would use it but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have really seen them do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Mmm-hmm. I am also beginning to wonder about myself because, well, I guess my first year I got (inaudible 38:45). My second year, it was (inaudible 38:56) Sometimes I went along with it; sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I really figured (inaudible 39:02) with it; sometimes I just went along with. But now he is not my room mate anymore. I like that (inaudible 39:14). Third year, one of my room mates - I started off the third year in dormitory - I didn't really have any reasons to dislike my room mate because he never did anything wrong to me. He never hurt me or anything like that but there was something about him I didn't like. I didn't like him because he was happy or something. He generally was pretty happy and had a good deal of friends. 0:39:53.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: His manner just grated on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because he had friends!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were jealous of him too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is probably why I disliked him. Third year...well, then after that I moved into an apartment after a few weeks. I had three room mates and I sort of managed to pick out one of them to dislike.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Pick out" makes it sound like it was a very conscious choice on your part?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just didn't think I needed that room mate. I didn't consciously pick out one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you meaning that it really strikes you that there was one of them that you (inaudible 40:47).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, now that I am not really with him any longer, it just strikes me that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something funny is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He actually wasn't as shitty as (inaudible 41:05). And then I say: "Yeah." For instance, my room mates this year are a lot worse. Then I start to wonder if it is really true that my room mates this year are worse and maybe it is me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if next year you ought to move back this...this year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just start wondering about whether you really justify your feelings about these guys now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I want to sound justified. Now, I want to justify the way he is now. I talked to the guys from last year last night and (inaudible 42:01) I don't think I feel any great dislike for them. But my room mate this year: I think feel worse about him than I have felt about any of my room mates in the past. Each one I sort of feel worse about. Although I can say to myself, "I was wrong about the ones in the past," I sort of reserve the position that I am right about this one. 0:42:38.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You try to convince yourself to reserve judgment about this one because of those mistakes that you made before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not trying to convince myself that. I am trying to convince myself that I am right about this one but I have to sort of...there is a (inaudible 42:57) voice in the back that says: "Well, you know, you were wrong about those other ones."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At one stage, everybody, in a way...you really want to hate this one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel that I am really justified in (inaudible 43:12) But yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So looking back on those other times weren't wrong?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I may have been wrong. If I was wrong, then a lot of the end prognosis was my own making.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say "wrong," only I am (inaudible 43:33) clear on what you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I may have been mistaken in thinking how to do relationships. I mean, I have seen everything about them; I may have been disinterested but I saw; or I may have blown up little things into big things; and I may have looked for things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are all things that you kind of put on it afterwards and this is like saying, well, the one fact that you do know is that these guys haven't seemed so terrible after you haven't been living with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing you hated disappeared. You see them again: "Well, how could I feel so strongly about them?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel so strongly about them now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, the thing I keep thinking is that you consider that it is different living with people than just talking to them, or does that not seem like it matters? 0:45:02.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is true...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you don't even think about them when there is a lot more contact with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is true but I don't know if it matters that much because I don't think it is acceptable to go on hating everybody that you live with. It is very unpleasant to continually hate the people you are living with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, and if it is just because of the...yeah, it is like saying it doesn't help you to say: "Well, maybe it is the fact that living with somebody that brings that hate out of me." Because you are going to keep on doing that. So then, are you asking yourself: "Well, if something (inaudible 45:58)? How come? What is there to (inaudible 46:06)? Or is that much more a specific question to yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is more specific. I tell myself there are people I would like as room mates; that I would get along with. No one specific but I mean but I tell myself that these people exist somewhere. I just always happen to get so far with people I can get along with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you tell yourself it is kind of bad luck and chance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I figure we're off the track.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you remember what the "track" was because I don't see how it is off the track?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can you think of where we got off the track? 0:47:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just before I said the last thing I said about things were bad luck, sort of thing. (Inaudible 48:28) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were saying something about, well, maybe people are this but there is kind of...the problem being, well, if it is, we were saying - I don't know if this is the thing or not; I don't know - if the problem is because somehow when you go with people these things happen to you, that really doesn't take any weight off of you; that doesn't help what you are doing. You are going to keep on living with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just sort of...when I say that I am off the track, I just sort of feel almost I have hit an end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You hit an end?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is nothing more to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there are more things to say but there is like a gap between where I am (inaudible 49:26) But that is just something I am going to have to jump over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is no...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is no (inaudible 49:33). I don't know, I guess I sort of want to...I feel this need to start spouting off how I am going to (inaudible 49:49) with my room mate and I keep on thinking that you really don't need to hear it!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't need to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I need then to talk about why: why am I this way? You don't need all these concrete examples.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean that I don't want to hear them or that I am...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of. You don't want to sit down and listen to somebody tell you about all of the times that you are wrong. (Inaudible 50:30). I will tell them all of the things that are in my mind. You know what (inaudible 50:48) room mate this is. I would talk to my girlfriend and I would tell her the current things that everybody was doing to get on my nerves. I seem to get some sort of enjoyment or pleasure out of complaining about somebody. About how (inaudible 51:15) or whatever bullshit that comes from me. I don't think so. 0:51:22.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You like doing that; complaining. It makes you feel kind of good about yourself. A kind of outrageous outrage. "I have been outraged."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoy doing it but I don't like it, do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that it is good to run around bad mouthing my room mates, saying: "I have been so good and I have been so wronged. Oh, how I have suffered."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it that you don't like about it? You don't like the person you appear to be then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way it looks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The way I appear when I say it like that. It appears that I don't get along well with people - me talking like that. It shows and, in fact, that is true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is hard for you to keep on doing...to let people have that impression of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to have to show it any more than it should. A certain amount of it shows automatically but I don't want to make it more evident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want people to think you are worse off; not the same as us?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not worse off but...Well, there is always the possibility that the person whom I am complaining to will say: "You know, you are crazy. You are just looking for things to be irritated about." It is like he is not dealing with shit: you are dealing with shit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I sort of acknowledge the possibilities already. I acknowledge already that maybe things aren't as bad as I make them out to be. But to have somebody tell me that: it wouldn't make me feel (inaudible 54:12) 0:54:12.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it mean having the rug pulled out from under you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is sort of, it would make me feel uncomfortable for a while. That I am the unreasonable one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is a way in which you kind of, you don't want to not like that person or be made distant from them; you don't want to put yourself on the line for something that would do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somewhat. As a matter of fact, I don't what I would feel if (inaudible 55:11) the main thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The main thing is something more on the main track. It is just to complain like that, it just isn't right and you just don't like that you do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is sort of it, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you (inaudible 55:32) of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sort of have an idea of somebody (inaudible 55:43) and why (inaudible 55:44). I don't want to be (inaudible 55:49). You know, self pity. Just not saying it doesn't change it for me. I have to make the change also. Not complaining to everybody else doesn't change the fact that I am only kidding myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you (inaudible 56:23) by saying maybe you keep those complaints private but you are still experiencing them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so maybe it is not such a bad thing to say them. This whole thing is about why I feel bad; why I don't want to obey my impulse; telling you that all the things that I hear about my room mates (inaudible 57:05). I came to the conclusion that maybe I shouldn't have to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unfortunately you do it today (chuckles).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to do it today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But maybe you do want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is like a football game.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like (inaudible 57:36) there is a minute left to play and you hang on to the ball and don't let (inaudible 57:41) get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, actually you could, if that sounds...like it is going to be the 18th...you could call time yourself! 0:58:21.9</p>

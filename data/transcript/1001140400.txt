<center><b><P>COUPLES THERAPY FOR ADDICTIONS</P>
<p>Introduction</P></b></center>

<P>Barbara S. McCrady, PhD is a Professor of Psychology at the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology at Rutgers University and the Clinical Director of the Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies. Her primary clinical and research interests include alcohol abuse/dependence and the ways in which families and social support systems can assist in the recovery process.</P>

<P>Dr. McCrady reminds us that alcohol and drug problems always exist in a context that includes families and relationships, and that couples therapy is an important model for working with addictions. Dr. McCrady uses a behavioral approach that helps the client change his or her addictive behaviors, helps the partner learn to respond differently, and helps the couple change the relationship itself. In this transcript, Dr. McCrady works with a young couple trying to change behaviors related to alcohol and marijuana use.</p>

<P>McCrady 1: Okay. I've said this before, you know, it's really, really nice that you've decided to come here today.</P>
<P>Claudette 1: It's good to be here.</P>
<P>McCrady 2: Yeah. I'm hoping that, you know, that we can do some talking that will be helpful to the two of you. And, you know, by doing this you're also helping a lot of other people. You know, this will be used to help train counselors and people who will be trying to help a lot of people who have had alcohol and drug problems. So it's, hopefully there is going to be a lot of benefit from this.</P>
<P>Claudette 2: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 3: Okay. So we've been chatting a little bit before we started. But let me tell you a little bit of what I'm hoping we can do. We have about 45 minutes and I'll ask you a few questions at the beginning. And then what I'd like to do is see if we can pinpoint some of the things that have been going on associated with your drinking and the marijuana use. To think about are there some ways that the two of you can work together to try to keep going with what you've done. You said you've both been clean for a month now.</P>
<P>Claudette 3: Yeah. Well we started, I started when I was 18.</P>
<P>McCrady 4: Okay. How old are you now?</P>
<P>Claudette 4: I'm 23.</P>
<P>McCrady 5: Okay.</P>
<P>Claudette 5: And I got three kids. I had my first child at 15. And when I started the marijuana smoking I was just hanging out, you know, with the girls and stuff like that. And that's how normally at that. You normally get into drugs by hanging around people that do it.</P>
<P>McCrady 6: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 6: The best thing for you to do is just try to stay away from their influence.</P>
<P>McCrady 7: So after you started, did you, were you using pretty much continuously until a month or so ago?</P>
<P>Claudette 7: It started off like getting high every Friday.</P>
<P>McCrady 8: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 8: Then it started every day.</P>
<P>McCrady 9: Okay. And that went on. When did the alcohol come in?</P>
<P>Claudette 9: The alcohol came in like about 19 years old.</P>
<P>McCrady 10: Okay. So a little after the marijuana.</P>
<P>Claudette 10: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 11: And you'd said to me that before you stopped you'd been drinking pretty much every day.</P>
<P>Claudette 11: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 12: And how long had that been going on?</P>
<P>Claudette 12: That was going on for like, like from 19 to now.</P>
<P>McCrady 13: Okay. So when you started, almost right away you started getting into the daily drinking.</P>
<P>Claudette 13: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 14: And the amount you were drinking when you started? Did you start out big?</P>
<P>Claudette 14: It started off with one beer here. Then it went to two beers, three beers.</P>
<P>McCrady 15: Okay. And then before you stopped you said to me you were drinking six 40s in a day? Is that what it was?</P>
<P>Claudette 15: Yeah. Well, recently until a month ago. Yeah, it was six 40 ounces a day.</P>
<P>McCrady 16: Okay. How about you?</P>
<P>Ricky 1: Well, I started around 17.</P>
<P>McCrady 17: And how old are you now?</P>
<P>Ricky 2: Twenty five.</P>
<P>McCrady 18: Okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 3: It's just like mine came with watching my father. Because while I was growing up I always wanted to be like my dad. And I thought if my dad would do it, it's cool. I could do it too.</P>
<P>McCrady 19: Was this the drinking or the marijuana?</P>
<P>Ricky 4: The drinking.</P>
<P>McCrady 20: Okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 5: And the reason why I'm here today is trying to find out and see can I get some help. Because I don't want to, right now I see how my father is. I don't want to end up like my father. And with my alcoholism and me smoking my marijuana, me and Claudette are having a lot of fights. And it's just like, it's making me in a rage. And what's, I don't want to be that way. Because I'm a nice person but it's just like when I get the alcohol in me and the marijuana, I'm like a whole different person just like if I don't even know myself. Like I don't love myself. 
McCrady 21: Hm. How do you change?</P>
<P>Ricky 6: Right now it be like she said. It been a month. I've been clean of smoking the marijuana. And I'm trying to get clean of drinking.</P>
<P>McCrady 22: Oh, so you're still drinking some.</P>
<P>Ricky 7: Yeah. I'm still drinking. But it's not as much as I was because I see how I'm acting around the kids and what I've seen my father do with us. I don't want to do that around the kids.</P>
<P>McCrady 23: What do you see yourself doing?</P>
<P>Ricky 8: It's just like I get mad. I get frustrated. Every little thing they do, it ticks me off. And sometimes I find myself, you know, my voice getting louder and louder at thenm and then it make the kids scared of me. And I don't want that.</P>
<P>McCrady 24: And then do you react to that then?</P>
<P>Claudette 16: Well, the only thing I do is just say to him, "Calm down." You know, since I ain't been drinking and he still drinks. So it's like, "Calm down. Go outside. Take a walk or something." And he'll do it.</P>
<P>McCrady 25: You'll tell him to do that and he will.</P>
<P>Claudette 17: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 26: Do you end up getting in arguments back and forth when he gets like that?</P>
<P>Claudette 18: When we both was doing it the kids normally wouldn't be around because normally I have a babysitter. So it's like it would be me and him going at each other. And I get tired of having to say, "Well, Ricky, I don't want to argue with you." And then he tell me, "Well, I don't want to argue with you." And then I say, "Well, both of us need to stop. If one stop, we both stop." So we both decided to do that.</P>
<P>McCrady 27: Okay. And you stopped completely and you've stopped the marijuana. But you're having trouble with getting off the alcohol, huh?</P>
<P>Ricky 9: That's correct.</P>
<P>McCrady 28: What's your drinking like now?</P>
<P>Ricky 10: It's like, I use to drink like two pints of Remy Martin every day. Now it's like I limit it down to like a half a pint a day.</P>
<P>McCrady 29: Okay. So you've been, have you been doing that gradually?</P>
<P>Ricky 11: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 30: Okay. And how, that's been over the last month you've gone from the two points to the half a pint.</P>
<P>Ricky 12: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 31: But even now when you drink you still are finding yourself--</P>
<P>Ricky 13: Yes.</P>
<P>McCrady 32: Getting angry and yelling at the kids and still yelling at Claudette but now you say, because you're sober you say, "Calm down. Take a walk."</P>
<P>Claudette 19: Right.</P>
<P>Ricky 14: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 33: Okay. And you don't get angry when she says that? It doesn't make you angrier?</P>
<P>Ricky 15: I just takes the walk.</P>
<P>McCrady 34: Uh huh.</P>
<P>Ricky 16: Because I know if I continue to do and I get too intoxicated it make me want to take out all my anger on her and start getting physical. And I choose not to do that. Because I don't agree with a male putting his hand on a female. So before I get that bad, I just walk away.</P>
<P>McCrady 35: Mm hm. Has that happened sometimes?</P>
<P>Ricky 17: It got pretty close to it, but I always caught myself. And another thing I found out is my drinking and my marijuana use has sent me to the penitentiary.</P>
<P>McCrady 36: Oh it did, huh?</P>
<P>Ricky 18: And I didn't like it. Because it make me spend time away from the ones that I love. And then it was just like when I came home I'm back out there hangin' with the same old gang like I use to do I would. And I fell back off into the lunacy.</P>
<P>McCrady 37: How did you end up in jail?</P>
<P>Ricky 19: I was selling marijuana.</P>
<P>McCrady 38: Okay. Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 20: And then it escalated to selling rocks. Then I got caught.</P>
<P>McCrady 39: Were you using rock also?</P>
<P>Ricky 21: Uh uh.</P>
<P>McCrady 40: Just using marijuana.</P>
<P>Ricky 22: Just marijuana.</P>
<P>McCrady 41: How long ago was that that you got caught?</P>
<P>Ricky 23: Ninety-six.</P>
<P>McCrady 42: And how long were you in?</P>
<P>Ricky 24: To '98 of August.</P>
<P>McCrady 43: Okay. Uh huh. Now did you guys know each other before?</P>
<P>Claudette 20: We was friends.</P>
<P>Ricky 25: I been, knew her, we was friends before we became lovers. She was my best buddy. My kickin' it partner.</P>
<P>McCrady 44: How long have you known each other?</P>
<P>Ricky 26: Since '93.</P>
<P>Claudette 21: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 45: And then you got more, you got involved with each other romantically after you got out of jail?</P>
<P>Claudette 22: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 27: After I got out.</P>
<P>McCrady 45: Did you have contact while he was in?</P>
<P>Claudette 23: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 46: Not at all?</P>
<P>Claudette 24: He didn't even know I was still living in the same place.</P>
<P>McCrady 47: Oh yeah. Yeah. So how did you get together when you got out?</P>
<P>Ricky 28: Well it just like.</P>
<P>Claudette 25: A very long story.</P>
<P>McCrady 48: Okay. Can you tell me the short version. We have like, we don't have a lot of time here.</P>
<P>Ricky 29: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 49: But I'm always curious.</P>
<P>Ricky 30: It was like I got out, you know, like I say I got a previous relationship with my other, with my baby mother. And all the while I was in jail, she was not there for me. I haven't seen my son. She wasn't sending me no pictures. I wasn't getting no letters. No Father's Day cards. No nothin'.</P>
<P>McCrady 50: And he was really a baby when you went to jail.</P>
<P>Ricky 31: He was a baby when I left.</P>
<P>McCrady 51: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 32: And then when I came home her mother hooked us up. I been knowing her but I never knew that she liked me.</P>
<P>McCrady 52: Oh.</P>
<P>Ricky 33: She never told me. And then when her mother came to me and told me I got a secret admirer, I'm like, "Who?"</P>
<P>McCrady 53: Did you put your mom up to this?</P>
<P>Claudette 26: Well, she started saying that we was getting along fine from when he first got out. I was like the shoulder to cry on with.</P>
<P>McCrady 54: Uh huh.</P>
<P>Claudette 27: His girl friend was on something. And we've just been together ever since.</P>
<P>McCrady 55: Mm hm. And you guys, you're engaged now, right?</P>
<P>Claudette 28: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 56: Do you have a wedding date?</P>
<P>Ricky 34: Hopefully.</P>
<P>Claudette 29: We're supposed to get married July of 2000. Like on the 8th.</P>
<P>McCrady 57: Okay. Is that what you were going to say?</P>
<P>Ricky 35: Yeah. We have a birthday July 4.</P>
<P>McCrady 58: Okay. Okay. And what is it that has you guys together? What is it that you like about each other or that you love about each other?</P>
<P>Claudette 30: Because we so much alike.</P>
<P>Ricky 36: We're both Cancers.</P>
<P>McCrady 59: You're both what?</P>
<P>Ricky 37: Cancers.</P>
<P>McCrady 60: Oh, really?</P>
<P>Ricky 38: My birthday July the 4th. Hers July the 14th. We've got that in common.</P>
<P>McCrady 61: Okay. How does that make you guys alike?</P>
<P>Claudette 31: We just like the same things.</P>
<P>Ricky 39: I'm like the male version and she's the woman version of the Cancer.</P>
<P>McCrady 62: See, I'm a Taurus. And I know this, we're stubborn. But I don't know anything about Cancers. I don't have any of them in my family. So you guys have some traits in common. But what? Give me an idea of like a little bit of what those are.</P>
<P>Ricky 40: Like ... she can cook.</P>
<P>McCrady 63: Uh huh.</P>
<P>Ricky 41: And I'm a good, I'm a big eater. She can cook.</P>
<P>McCrady 64: Uh huh.</P>
<P>Ricky 42: And plus the way how she got a good head on her shoulder. She want things out of life. You know? And I want the same things in life that she want. And her kids love me and I love them. So I felt like if I could love the woman I got to love the kids too because the kids come with the package.</P>
<P>McCrady 65: Okay. So there are a lot of things about her that you really love. How about you? What are the things, a couple of the things about him.</P>
<P>Claudette 32: Well what I like about him is that he's strong. I like having like a male role model around my sons because the other two kids' father, they're not in our lives, so. And another thing, I feel kind of safe. I don't have to be at home alone. And I got somebody to talk to when I don't got nobody else to talk to. And when I talk to him it's just like one of my best friends. Somebody that I can confide in because everybody needs someone to confide in.</P>
<P>McCrady 66: Yeah. Now are the, is the alcohol and marijuana the main kind of wedge between the two of you?</P>
<P>Claudette 33: Yeah. Because it's like if, how can I put this? If we use, if we both use together it starts a fight. But I notice if we not using we're like peas in a pod. We're so much together. But when we're smoking marijuana and drinking it's like we're lavishing at each other. "Oh, you did this." "No, I didn't." "Are you lookin' at her?" And, you know, stuff like that it starts.</P>
<P>Ricky 43: A lot of jealousy come into play.</P>
<P>McCrady 67: Is that a big thing that you guys argue about?</P>
<P>Ricky 44: Yeah. Because the marijuana use to find me so gigged up and she would say, "You lookin' at her." And, "You did this." And, "Who, this and that?" And, "How did this hair get inside the comb?" And, oh!</P>
<P>McCrady 68: Okay. So did you go both ways?</P>
<P>Ricky 45: Both ways.</P>
<P>McCrady 69: I mean, is he right? You get jealous with him? Okay. And do you get jealous of her too?</P>
<P>Claudette 34: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 70: Huh. Okay. So that's, and when you guys are straight, are those feelings and thoughts still there or?</P>
<P>Ricky 46: It's just like when we straight it's like we just connect. Ain't no argument, no fights, no nothin', we just are bond.</P>
<P>McCrady 71: So, do you have any other areas that you have concerns about between the two of you when you're straight?</P>
<P>Claudette 35: The only other area I have a problem with us is it's more like me arguing about money. How are we going to get the next outfit, shoes, whatever we want. You know, that's a big major in our relationship that gives us a down fall too because sometimes I feel like I can't give him what he want. Like when birthdays roll around, you know, you want to buy your loved one something.</P>
<P>McCrady 72: Right.</P>
<P>Claudette 36: And if you don't have the money to do it you just get flustrated about it. And the same for him. He gets flustrated.</P>
<P>McCrady 73: I mean do you guys end up arguing about it?</P>
<P>Claudette 37: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 47: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 48: And they get to the point sometimes, like money is the biggest actual cause. Like she said, there's things she want and there's things I want. And I'm trying not to go back the wrong way and try to go the right way for a change but it just like I fill out all these applications. I go every place there is to go to further look for the job, but all they can see is the "X."</P>
<P>McCrady 74: You mean the X from having been--</P>
<P>Ricky 49: The X from the penitentiary, yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 75: In the penitentiary. yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 50: And I'm like, that make me want to use more too. They get more use. Pick up back up the marijuana and use it because, like you say, it calms me down. I have to think about nothin'. And I'm trying not to do that. And if I continue to smoke marijuana, I'm going to go back that wrong way instead of going the right way. So like now I'm just trying to basically be a family man.</P>
<P>McCrady 76: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 51: I'm trying to be something that my father wasn't to me.</P>
<P>McCrady 77: It sounds like you have really, you both have really, really strong reasons to be straight.</P>
<P>Ricky 52: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 78: And those, you really feel those very deeply.</P>
<P>Claudette 38: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 79: And the hard part is figuring out how to make that happen it really sounds like.</P>
<P>Ricky 53: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 80: Now I'm going to ask some questions, when you were using did you mostly drink together and smoke together? 
<P>Ricky 54: Together.</P>
<P>Claudette 40: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 81: Ever, did you ever, were you ever using separately or?</P>
<P>Ricky 55: It was like when I'm not around her--</P>
<P>Claudette 41: Sometimes when he get with his friends.</P>
<P>Ricky 56: Right. Where my friends are. Smoke my marijuana with them. Drink with them. And the same for her.</P>
<P>McCrady 82: Okay. Because, you know, when I think about recovery, one of the things, especially when, you know, with both people using, one of the things that's important to think about first is like how much is your using kind of intertwined with each other. And if you're using together most of the time then it's really good if you're both clean.</P>
<P>Ricky 57: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 83: And, you know, we can really talk about some ways that you can support each other and be able to stay clean. But the other side of it is, if one of you, you know, like if one of you has a slip and one of the things, you know, we know with alcohol and drugs is a lot of times it takes a few tries to get it right.</P>
<P>Ricky 58: Uh huh.</P>
<P>McCrady 84: That you get clean and sober for a while and maybe you go back to it a little bit. And then you get, then you go back to being clean. So you may slip up three or four times. And you really don't want to have both of you slip up if you one of you has a problem.</P>
<P>Claudette 42: Right.</P>
<P>Ricky 59: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 85: So I guess what, you know, I think might be really helpful to talk about is first kind of some of the things that you have been doing already that have been helping you stay clean.</P>
<P>Claudette 43: Yeah. We like go to walks to parks and stuff like that.</P>
<P>Ricky 60: Yeah. That helps a lot.</P>
<P>Claudette 44: It helps get us off on our own. Go out to eat. Something to take our mind off, you know, getting high all the time.</P>
<P>McCrady 86: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 45: Because if you sit around the house, that's the first thing that gonna come, "Oh, go get me a beer." Or, "Oh, go get me a bag of weed."</P>
<P>Ricky 61: Because I'm bored. So we try to keep active.</P>
<P>McCrady 87: Okay. Do you have beer in the house?</P>
<P>Claudette 46: No.</P>
<P>Ricky 62: No, we don't have no beer in the house because you know--</P>
<P>Claudette 47: I'll drink it all.</P>
<P>Ricky 63: She will drink it all.</P>
<P>Claudette 48: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 64: Because we don't want none of that stuff around the kids. Because it's so easy for a kid to see that up in there that not know no better and say, "That's a pop." And he'll open the can and he'll drink it. There you go. You got a messed up kid. So we try not to do that.</P>
<P>McCrady 88: But the Remy Martin is in the house?</P>
<P>Ricky 65: That there is like it don't get a chance to be there because I drink it so much, drink it so fast.</P>
<P>McCrady 89: Okay. So you don't stock up. Like what do you--</P>
<P>Ricky 66: It's just like I go, I go to the store. I buy one and I drink it. When that gone I go to the store again and I buy another one and I drink it.</P>
<P>McCrady 90: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 67: It's like two a day.</P>
<P>McCrady 91: Okay. So you're keeping beer out of the house.</P>
<P>Ricky 68: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 92: Does that help you?</P>
<P>Claudette 49: Yeah. It help me.</P>
<P>McCrady 93: Mm hm. Okay. And you're not stocking up. At least you have to go back and forth and get it.</P>
<P>Ricky 69: I go back and forth and I drinks it before I even get in the house.</P>
<P>McCrady 94: Okay. So now you're--</P>
<P>Ricky 70: And then I go back to sleep.</P>
<P>McCrady 95: Okay. So now you're drinking, you're not drinking at home anymore.</P>
<P>Ricky 71: Uh uh. I drink outside. Throw it away. Drink another one. Throw it away. Then I come in the house and more. I lay down and go to sleep.</P>
<P>McCrady 96: Is that an agreement that you guys made?</P>
<P>Ricky 72: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 97: That you wouldn't drink in the house anymore?</P>
<P>Claudette 50: Because if he drink it's gonna make me want to drink.</P>
<P>Ricky 73: Right. And I see she trying to stop.</P>
<P>McCrady 98: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 74: So I don't want to influence her to go on back to drinking her beers. So me I stay outside and I drink mine. Then I come in the house.</P>
<P>McCrady 99: Mm hm. When he comes in when he's been drinking, does that make you want to drink?</P>
<P>Claudette 51: No. That don't make me want to drink. That just make me see how I was a month ago.</P>
<P>McCrady 100: Have you given him any feedback about that? About the way you see him when he's been drinking?</P>
<P>Claudette 52: Not really.</P>
<P>McCrady 101: Give him an idea. I'm curious about what you see.</P>
<P>Claudette 53: I just see him waddling through.</P>
<P>McCrady 102: You can tell, tell him.</P>
<P>Claudette 54: "Fix me something to eat." And I'll be like, "If your stomach hurt, you should have ate before you drunk." Then he like, "So what? Just fix me something to eat." Then he'll go in there and lay down and watch TV.</P>
<P>McCrady 103: Is that the way you think you were also when you were drinking?</P>
<P>Claudette 55: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 56: I was worse.</P>
<P>Ricky 75: She was worse.</P>
<P>McCrady 104: Really? How so?</P>
<P>Ricky 76: It was like after she get through drinking or smoking the marijuana, everything make her mad. Everything.</P>
<P>Claudette 57: If somebody leaves a dish, the littlest thing in the house, that would just tick me off. Somebody leaves a dish or somebody leave water on the sink. I would just say, "I, I clean up this house all day and this was out." And that would start us arguing like, "Oh, well I'll get it up." You know?</P>
<P>Ricky 77: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 105: Okay. So in terms of the things that have been working so far, you've been trying to keep busy.</P>
<P>Ricky 78: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 58: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 106: So taking the walks. Going shopping.</P>
<P>Ricky 79: Right.</P>
<P>Claudette 59: Or going out to look for jobs.</P>
<P>McCrady 107: Going out looking for jobs. Going out to eat. Those kinds of things.</P>
<P>Ricky 80: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 108: So you really, do you kind of get up each morning and have a plan for the day?</P>
<P>Claudette 60: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 81: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 109: Okay. That's really good. So that's one big thing. You're keeping the alcohol pretty much out of the house.</p>
<P>Claudette 61: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 110: And you've got his drinking out of the house also.</P>
<P>Claudette 62: Right.</P>
<P>Ricky 82: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 111: And you're not buying weed.</P>
<P>Claudette 63: No.</P>
<P>Ricky 83: No.</P>
<P>McCrady 112: Okay. What else are you doing to help yourselves right now? This is a great start.</P>
<P>Claudette 64: Oh, what else are we doing? I gotta say we more focusing on us instead of the outside. Like we try to keep the negative company away. Like the company that brings marijuana, we try to keep them away.</P>
<P>McCrady 113: How do you do that? His friends?</P>
<P>Claudette 65: Just tell them that we busy or that we either gone or just spending family time. There's no time to circulate and listen to music or worry about who was on the soaps yesterday. Because that's what start the drinking.</P>
<P>McCrady 114: Okay. Now since you've gotten out of jail, are there people that are kind of coming back looking to you as somebody who's gonna sell?</P>
<P>Ricky 84: Yeah. They be, the guys be asking me things like, do I want to jump back down. And do I want to continue to gang, do I want to gang bang some more? And do I want to sell this. And we give you such and such amount and you make some money and give us this cut. But I choose not to.</P>
<P>McCrady 115: Had they been coming around the house at first?</P>
<P>Ricky 85: At first they started coming around the house but I've been putting my foot down and snapping like, "Man, get away from here. Don't come back."</P>
<P>Claudette 66: Or when I come to the door I say, "He sleep. He don't want to be bothered."</P>
<P>McCrady 116: Okay. So that's another really important thing that you're doing is you're keeping, the people who would like you to get right back into it you're keeping away.</P>
<P>Ricky 86: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 117: And other people just who might be tempting for you to drink with and smoke with, you're trying to avoid them.</P>
<P>Ricky 87: Trying to avoid them, yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 118: Okay. What else? You guys are doing, I think this is really, it's really impressive. You said you hadn't gotten any kind of counseling or anything.</P>
<P>Ricky 88: No.</P>
<P>McCrady 119: You're just doing this.</P>
<P>Claudette 67: We just decided on our own. Sometimes we just sit back and just think about all the things we did do and what we gotta do to make a change. Because it's not gonna change if you don't let it.</P>
<P>McCrady 120: So when you think about the things that you did when you were drinking and smoking?</P>
<P>Ricky 89: Mm hm. Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 90: And we'd think like all that money we was spending on marijuana and alcohol--</P>
<P>Claudette 68: Could have been going on trips to Kiddie Land.</P>
<P>Ricky 91: We could have been going on a trip taking the kids to Kiddie Land and doing something worthwhile with the money instead of doing the negative stuff.</P>
<P>McCrady 121: Mm hm. Okay. Do you have that written down anywhere?</P>
<P>Ricky 92: Mm mm.</P>
<P>McCrady 122: I'll tell you, that's my first piece of advice to you is that you each spend a little time and just write down ten things that you didn't like about, you know, yourself or the way your life was going when you were using.</P>
<P>Ricky 93: I never think about it but now that you suggested I will start doing it.</P>
<P>Claudette 69: It's like a picture in my mind.</P>
<P>McCrady 123: You know, a suggestion you write it down, it's the weirdest thing. You like, you can be clean for a while and it all starts fading away. You start kind of forgetting. And, you know, I mean I can see people that come in to see me for counseling and then, you know, say, you know, somebody came in because he had missing work a lot because he was, you know, because he was drinking. And a few weeks later I'll say, "Let's kind of review some of the reasons that you wanted to, you know, stop drinking." And he won't even remember the work thing. It's really, like you don't believe it could happen--</P>
<P>Claudette 70: When you want to stop.</P>
<P>McCrady 124: Yeah.</P>
<P>Claudette 71: If you really true about stopping, one thing you can do is keep it right here in the back of your mind. And you don't have to write it down because if it's something you want, you gotta get it. Ain't nobody else gonna get it for you. And then sometimes you'll get tired and have a nervous breakdown it's like, "Oh, I never had this. I never had that." And you just want to just say, "Forget it. I'm gonna get it." And that's just it. I'm gonna go to work. I'm gonna do this. And you gotta put a goal there and you gotta do it.</P>
<P>McCrady 125: Mm hm. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you the kind of what's inside and what's in your head is really important. But sometimes getting it kind of out on paper is it sort of makes it even more real.</P>
<P>Claudette 72: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 126: It's just a suggestion.</P>
<P>Ricky 94: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 127: All right. But you've been doing a lot. So you've been really focusing on your motivation and your reasons. You've been doing a lot of very concrete things, it sounds like, that have been pretty helpful. Um, what happens when you, do either of you have times where you feel like using but you don't? Do you miss it or?</P>
<P>Ricky 95: It just like sometimes I feel like, "Man, it's boring. Maybe I should go away and go to the liquor store and get me a drink or something."</P>
<P>McCrady 128: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 96: Or like, "Man, should I go over there onto the next corner and buy me a bag of marijuana."</P>
<P>McCrady 129: Do you, often times do you usually, are there logical reasons why those feelings come up? Or those thoughts. You know we, in my business we call them triggers. You know, there's often, there's like something out there in the world.</P>
<P>Claudette 73: Something out on TV or something like that.</P>
<P>Ricky 97: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 130: Yeah. Something on TV or a person or a certain situation.</P>
<P>Ricky 98: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 131: Can you predict what are going to be triggers for you?</P>
<P>Ricky 99: It's just like when I come in and there ain't no food or nothin' ready, then it make me want to go okay, maybe I'll go get some marijuana.</P>
<P>McCrady 132: Does she know that?</P>
<P>Ricky 100: Yeah. She know that. I got, she know I gots to eat. That what helps me the most.</P>
<P>Claudette 74: That's what he be worryin' about.</P>
<P>Ricky 101: The more I'm eating, the more I won't smoke marijuana. Eating and working out. That's it.</P>
<P>Claudette 75: For me, when I look at the TV and I see a big Budweiser can. I say, "Ah, that look cold and good. I want some." Then I say, "Nah, that's okay."</P>
<P>McCrady 133: Okay. So, for you being hungry is a trigger. For you, seeing it is a trigger. Are there other triggers?</P>
<P>Claudette 76: Not really.</P>
<P>McCrady 134: Other things that you notice that you miss it or?</P>
<P>Ricky 102: No.</P>
<P>McCrady 135: Mm hm. When you go, are there times like when you feel discouraged about the job hunting or is that a common?</P>
<P>Ricky 103: Now, that there--</P>
<P>Claudette 77: Sometimes.</P>
<P>McCrady 136: Yeah.</P>
<P>Claudette 78: But it don't make me want to use.</P>
<P>McCrady 137: No?</P>
<P>Claudette 79: It just make me want to kill the people there--</P>
<P>McCrady 138: Oh, okay.</P>
<P>Claudette 80: That won't call me.</P>
<P>McCrady 139: Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me.</P>
<P>Claudette 81: And I'll be like just give me a fair chance. You know, I'm hard working. I can do things. More than one thing. But if I'm taught, I can do it.</P>
<P>McCrady 140: Mm hm. Let me ask you, I want to ask you to try to talk to each other about something. And what I'd like to ask is for you to each think about one way. It sounds like you've been doing a lot of things to try to help each other and to help yourselves. But I'm wondering if we can talk a little bit about some ways that you could actually, additional ways that you could help each other.</P>
<P>Ricky 104: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 141: Okay? So you just think about that for a couple of moments here. And what I'd like to ask you to do is each of you--I don't care who goes first here--but to tell the other person something that you'd like them to do that would be helpful to you in staying clean and sober. And then you don't have to say yes, you're going to do it. You don't have to agree. But I want you to kind of get started and sort of thinking more about what are, you know, because you've been doing a bunch of things but it sounds like, you know, there is, you're still having some tough times.</P>
<P>Ricky 105: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 142: So maybe focus on some of those times when, that are tough. Like when you're watching the TV or you're feeling hungry or that kind of thing. To think about like some ways to make some requests of each other some ways to help.</P>
<P>Ricky 106: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 143: Okay. Who wants to go first?</P>
<P>Claudette 82: Well, what I want you to do is go get your I.D.s, go on out there get you a job, and stop being so jealous all the time. That's all you gotta do. And then that will keep you from being around the house seeing your guys out there on the corner making you want to be out there.</P>
<P>Ricky 107: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 144: What are you, you can react to her a little bit.</P>
<P>Ricky 108: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 145: Tell her what you think of these requests.</P>
<P>Ricky 109: The request is, you know what I'm saying, A-Okay. But the jealously part, that's gonna be hard. That's gonna be hard. Because my male ego gets in the way and I'm pretty sure any male would feel the same way I feel. It's just like you got a lot of male friends. And I know they're your friends, but that man part in me be like, " No, I don't want you walking my girl friend home. That's my job."</P>
<P>Claudette 83: Okay. And what else.</P>
<P>Ricky 110: And when I see you do things like that there, that make me want to pick up a drink and then go out there and start a fight with the guy.</P>
<P>McCrady 146: You can say how, what's your reaction to that.</P>
<P>Claudette 84: I told you that I was going to stop. I'm not gonna hang with no more guy friends, okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 111: If you would stop doing that, then maybe I wouldn't have to all the time pick up a bottle and think, "Is she cheating on me? Is she doing this or is she doing that?"</P>
<P>Claudette 85: But answer this question, if I was doing something with them, why would I bring them around you? That would be the least thing I would do.</P>
<P>Ricky 112: But you know how it is, when I'm drinking that don't be on my mind. When I'm drinking I block out anything. And I want to get physical and it make me get violent. So if you know that's how it make me feel, don't even do it. And then maybe I stop some of that drinking.</P>
<P>Claudette 86: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 147: Is that an okay solution? I mean because I guess, I, you're both being really clear. You'd like Ricky to be less jealous. And you'd like her to--</P>
<P>Claudette 87: Not have male friends.</P>
<P>McCrady 148: Not have male friends.</P>
<P>Ricky 113: Not too many. It's okay to have one that we both know. That we both kick it around. And I know what he on and he know what I on. Not when you just got you know the guys and I don't know them.</P>
<P>McCrady 149: Explain this to her.</P>
<P>Ricky 114: I want to get to know these guys.</P>
<P>Claudette 88: You don't ever give them a chance. When they see you coming, you look, " Grr, Grr... Who is that with my woman?"</P>
<P>Ricky 115: That's any man reaction though. If any man--</P>
<P>Claudette 89: You don't walk up like, "How ya doin', brother? How you doin'?" You know.</P>
<P>Ricky 116: The first thing that come across a man's mind.</P>
<P>Claudette 90: He don't do that.</P>
<P>McCrady 150: Why don't you talk one at a time. Then you'll hear each other better.</P>
<P>Ricky 117: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 151: I'm having trouble hearing both of you. So just one at a time.</P>
<P>Ricky 118: The first thing that comes across a man's mind is this, "Okay, when you left you was by yourself. You didn't say you was going to kick it with your guy friend. You say you was going with your girl friend."</P>
<P>Claudette 91: I was with my girls. Go back there later at night, they was coming my way, so they walk with me. It's 12:00. What you want me to do? The bus stopped running.</P>
<P>Ricky 119: But I was on my way to come get you.</P>
<P>Claudette 92: But how did I know that?</P>
<P>Ricky 120: Because I know that. I know that. And you know wherever you at, I'm gonna come to get you. I get upset when you stay out since past 10:00. So you knew I was coming to get you. But then when I seen the two guys walking you home and they didn't want to come up and walk where I was walking, they just turn the corner. Yeah, that's making me mad. Like I said.</P>
<P>Claudette 93: And what did I tell you, I was sorry.</P>
<P>Ricky 121: Right.</P>
<P>Claudette 94: And then I told you their names.</P>
<P>Ricky 122: Okay. But if you work on that more, and I promise you I might slow down on some of my drink because, you some of the problem.</P>
<P>Claudette 95: Oh, so now you want to blame it on me.</P>
<P>Ricky 123: You some of the problem. You some of the problem because this is like I want to be able to get you anything. I seen guys out there, you know, that got more than I got. You know what I'm saying? Driving the Lexus truck and the Expeditions and I don't got that. I'm still trying to be the family orientated man type stuff. I want to sit up there and get you stuff the right way. Where here there's a guy I cannot compete with him and he got $20, $30,000 in his pocket and a Lexus truck and he offering to get you the world and I can't. So that make me want to go pick up a bottle or pick up the marijuana.</P>
<P>Claudette 96: So you actually think cause he offer to give me the world I'm gonna go?</P>
<P>Claudette 97: I'm going where my heart at. Not because of what they offer me. Because I figured if I had things that they can give me, you can give it to me too, only a little more. Cause I can trust you. And that's all I be asking you to do. Trust me.</P>
<P>Ricky 124: I can work on it.</P>
<P>McCrady 152: You have a lot of, both have a lot of feelings about this, obviously.</P>
<P>Ricky 125: Yeah.</P>
<P>Claudette 98: Yeah. We do.</P>
<P>McCrady 153: Mm hm. And it seems like you have, in a way you have, you're listening to each other pretty carefully. You have very different solutions. Your solution is that she should stop hanging with anybody else.</P>
<P>Ricky 126: Or at least let me get to know them. Know them as a person.</P>
<P>McCrady 154: Okay. Okay, so you at first was like don't spend any time with any of them. The second was let you get to know them. And you're asking that he trust you. To trust that you really love him and he's the person you want to be with.</P>
<P>Claudette 99: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 155: So you're in a little bit different places here about this. You have kind of different, a little bit different--</P>
<P>Claudette 100: Because he don't got no trust in me.</P>
<P>McCrady 156: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 101: If he just gave me a little trust then maybe he would see the type of person I am. If you don't trust me, that make me look like the villain because you're gonna always square me in a corner. Like, "Oh, you is doin' it." When all along I may not be.</P>
<P>McCrady 157: What would be, if we can, I wonder if there is a way that you guys can get closer together about this. You know, if there's some kind of middle ground where--</P>
<P>Claudette 102: That's the whole point.</P>
<P>McCrady 158: Where you don't have to give up every male friend but you don't have to be kind of constantly thinking, "Oh my God, there's another one. I don't know who he is. And I don't know what they're doing. And I feel bad." I'm just wondering if there's something that Claudette could do that would be less than giving everybody up. Can you think of something specific that she could do that would help you?</P>
<P>Ricky 127: Spend more time with me than with your friends. That's it.</P>
<P>Claudette 103: Now you didn't say spend more time with me.</P>
<P>Ricky 128: Spend more time with me.</P>
<P>Claudette 104: Then I'd be with him 24-7.</P>
<P>Ricky 129: The time we spend together is, you know like I know, if we right there together in the afternoon, why do your friends come over? Why do your friends come over and say, "Girl, let's go do this. Girl, let's go do that." You jump up and you up. I ask you, "Let's walk to the park." Sometimes you be like, "I don't feel like it. Not all day. I'm tired." But it's just like when they say, "Come on let's go. And wooo ooo ooo, you up in the wind."</P>
<P>McCrady 159: Is that a guy thing or is this something--</P>
<P>Claudette 105: No this is girls.</P>
<P>Ricky 130: This is girl friends.</P>
<P>Claudette 106: This is just one specific girl.</P>
<P>Ricky 131: This is the girl friends. She don't do it with the male friends like with the girl friends.</P>
<P>McCrady 160: Okay. Let's just stick with the guy thing for a minute. Cause I think that, you know, it's one of the things that happens if you try to kind of talk about six problems at once, we're never going to solve any of them.</P>
<P>Ricky 132: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 161: But if we try to focus on one, you might have a better chance.</P>
<P>Ricky 133: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 162: So let's go back to the guy, the guy thing. Okay? I think you had an idea which was to see if you could be introduced to these people</P>
<P>Ricky 134: Right. That would help me out more than anything. Let me get to know these guys.</P>
<P>Claudette 107: How you gonna get to know them when every time they walk up you be like, "What is you doin' with my woman?" And then they be like, "Man, dude, I wasn't even, you know, I was just walking around." You be like, "I hit you in your ass." Or, "I'll stomp you."</P>
<P>McCrady 163: Yeah, is his idea okay? Is his idea okay to have the guys that you're friends with get to know--</P>
<P>Claudette 108: I'll try to introduce them.</P>
<P>McCrady 164: So you don't mind the idea?</P>
<P>Claudette 109: Mm mm.</P>
<P>McCrady 165: How could you guys make that happen then?</P>
<P>Claudette 110: Only thing I could do is just stay away from the guys.</P>
<P>McCrady 166: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Claudette 111: Which I have done.</P>
<P>McCrady 167: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 168: Is that a complete solution?</P>
<P>Claudette 112: Mm hm. Just stay away.</P>
<P>Ricky 135: It sound good to me.</P>
<P>McCrady 169: Yeah. Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 136: Sound good to me.</P>
<P>McCrady 170: Completely. Never talk to another man.</P>
<P>Ricky 137: No. I'm not saying--</P>
<P>McCrady 171: Never ever?</P>
<P>Ricky 138: She can talk.</P>
<P>Claudette 113: Nah, I just wait.</P>
<P>Ricky 139: She can talk and say, "Hi." And, "Bye." Or whatever. That's acceptable. But all of that havin' 30-minute conversations and, uh uh. When you're walking down the street with me, you're with me. Don't wave at your friends and say, "How you doin'?" And he waving at you. No. Now you just keep on walking. When I'm not with you, okay, cool.</P>
<P>McCrady 172: You should be telling her this, not me.</P>
<P>Ricky 140: You know. When you all walking down the street together, you know what I'm saying? It's like if me and you walking down the street and one of your guy friends be like, "Hey, what's up shorty?" And when you talk back, "Hey, how you doin'?" That disrespectful to me because I wouldn't do it to you. If you walking down the street--</P>
<P>Claudette 114: What about the time we was in Goldblatt's? "Oh, hi, Ricky."</P>
<P>Ricky 141: But that's somebody that I went to school a long, long time ago with.</P>
<P>Claudette 115: It don't matter.</P>
<P>Ricky 142: And you was with me.</P>
<P>Claudette 116: And you would be with me.</P>
<P>Ricky 143: And I told you and the girl herself, she said, "Excuse me. I don't mean no harm or no disrespect to you." She told you this, right? Right?</P>
<P>Claudette 117: She didn't disrespect me by speaking to you. I don't go off of that.</P>
<P>Ricky 144: What I'm saying is what she said was, before she spoke she said, "Excuse me. I don't mean no disrespect. Didn't you go to Bay School?"</P>
<P>Claudette 118: No she said, "Excuse me."</P>
<P>Ricky 145: Right.</P>
<P>Claudette 119: To you.</P>
<P>Ricky 146: Right. But--</P>
<P>McCrady 173: Not to you?</P>
<P>Claudette 120: Not to me.</P>
<P>Ricky 147: But your guy friends don't do that. They don't be saying, "Excuse me."</P>
<P>Claudette 121: Because they be walking past and they say, "Hey, shorty." I say, "Hi." And you be like, "Why do you have to say it like that all sexy?"</P>
<P>Ricky 148: All I'm saying if you know it's a problem in our relationship, you shouldn't do it.</P>
<P>Claudette 122: I don't do it anymore.</P>
<P>Ricky 149: Right. I ain't saying you do it now, but you used to. You used to and then that make me more like mad. Let me go over there and get me a drink. Alcohol could be my girl friend if you did it. That's why I do that. And maybe you would stop doing it, you know what I'm saying? Like if you stop doin' it so much then maybe I could put that bottle down.</P>
<P>Claudette 123: So you're trying to blame it on me.</P>
<P>Ricky 150: Yep.</P>
<P>McCrady 174: I think there's a fine line in here. You know, I think that there are situations that make people feel like using and it sounds like this is a big one for you, is that feeling of jealous and that feeling of, you know, not being good enough. But at the same time there's a decision that each person makes about, you know, you can feel that way and you can say, "I feel really hurt and jealous. And, you know, damn I'm not going to drink just because of that." Or, "I feel really hurt and jealous and I'm going to drink." So there's still, there's the situation and then there's still something that goes on, you know, in each person's head about a choice and a decision about how they're going to react to it.</P>
<P>Claudette 124: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 175: If the situations aren't there, it's a lot easier to stay clean and sober.</P>
<P>Ricky 151: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 176: If it doesn't happen, it's much easier. And that's what you're looking for is kind of, I don't want it to happen.</P>
<P>Ricky 152: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 177: But I think the other half is it's probable, I mean you guys could be together a really long time. It's probable in the next 20 years that sometimes you're going to see men that you know.</P>
<P>Claudette 125: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 178: You know, or old friends and you're gonna say, "Hi." And you're gonna look really friendly. And you're going to have this, "Oh!" You know, this hurt.</P>
<P>Ricky 153: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 179: And the sort of other half of it is to say what is it that you can do inside of yourself to say even if I have this feeling for a minute, I don't want to make that, I don't want to drink. You know, that shouldn't make me drink. I don't, do you know what I'm saying?</P>
<P>Ricky 154: I understand what you're saying.</P>
<P>McCrady 180: Because I think that, you know, there's kind of a give and take here. You know, that you're saying you're willing to, you know, not hang out with other guys and, you know, not spend a lot of time talking to them when the two of you are together.</P>
<P>Claudette 126: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 181: But unless you kind of get put in a closet, it's probable, you know, you could put her in a glass case or something, but--</P>
<P>Claudette 127: And walk with me on his back.</P>
<P>McCrady 182: Yeah. Unless you do that she's probably gonna see guys she knows, you know?</P>
<P>Ricky 155: But not when it's like your ex-boyfriend. Those you aren't suppose to talk to period. That ain't suppose to be no, "Hi." No nothin'. No conversation. No nothin'.</P>
<P>Claudette 128: All of my ex-boyfriends from previous time, I never make a enemy. So if after we did break up I don't leave them like, "I hate her." You know and stuff like that? So that I leave them with a sense, "She a sweet person." You know?</P>
<P>McCrady 183: You get along with people.</P>
<P>Claudette 129: I'm glad. You with this brother. You know? I get along with everybody. I could meet somebody on the street. I don't care. They like me for me.</P>
<P>McCrady 184: Mm hm. So it sounds like this, the jealousy thing is something that's like a trigger for both of you in terms of making it hard to stay clean.</P>
<P>Ricky 156: It is.</P>
<P>McCrady 185: Yeah. Are we coming to a solution that would make it easier? Because you asked, this all started with her asking you not to be, act so jealous.</P>
<P>Claudette 130: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 186: And it seems like we've gotten to like you should change some of your behavior.</P>
<P>Claudette 131: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 187: Okay. So where would you like, so you gotta be fair about this. That's the deal with the two of you. At least that's the way I think about it. So if she's saying, "Okay, I'm going to really, you know, make it a point not to spend much time with these guys. And if I see people I'll just say, 'Hi,' and nothing else." But if she's kind of feeling, if you're feeling kind of jealous at some point, what can you do differently that's going to help her? Instead of like going off, which is what you do, right?</P>
<P>Ricky 157: Yes. Okay. I'll work hard on trying to stop drinking so much. Because, like I said, that is the biggest, that's one of the biggest problems why I drink is that I'm going to lose you to another guy who got more than I got. And if you can work on what you're working on as far as your male friends and I can work on what I'm working on, you know what I'm saying? My drinking. That's a deal?</P>
<P>Claudette 132: That's a deal.</P>
<P>McCrady 188: Mm hm. Okay. How you gonna do that? I'm such a nag. You come up with this really good thing and you guys are feeling good. I'm saying, okay. What's the next step. How are you gonna do that? You've gone from two pints to a half a pint.</P>
<P>Ricky 158: It just like I'm gonna try.</P>
<P>McCrady 189: Okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 159: I'm gonna try to just go ahead and stop permanently. I'm gonna try to get like a week or two week basis with not drinking nothin' and none of that for two weeks. And if I can make it through two weeks with not drinking, then I can stop. And then maybe our relationship would get better and we could have that trust. Because it's best for us to have that trust before we get married. Because I don't want to have that same jealousy rage in me when we get married.</P>
<P>Claudette 133: 'Cause then it will get worse.</P>
<P>Ricky 160: Then it gonna get worse and worse and then we're gonna be out of thousands thousands of dollars going through counseling and therapists.</P>
<P>McCrady 190: Do you like this idea of him saying he's gonna stop now?</P>
<P>Claudette 134: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 191: Do a lot, put a lot of effort into it.</P>
<P>Claudette 135: I believe him. From now on just go out for milk.</P>
<P>McCrady 192: Okay. So this is good. You're as bad as I am. Like, okay let's keep going.</P>
<P>McCrady 193: When do you usually start drinking? When do you go out and get that bottle?</P>
<P>Ricky 161: About 12:00. And it's gone like at 12:15.</P>
<P>McCrady 194: Okay so you just do it fast.</P>
<P>Claudette 136: Just drink it like that.</P>
<P>McCrady 195: Okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 162: So when I go in the store I get it, bust it down, and it's gone.</P>
<P>McCrady 196: Now what are you feeling like before you go?</P>
<P>Ricky 163: Like, man.</P>
<P>McCrady 197: Are you restless?</P>
<P>Claudette 137: All his thoughts and pressures.</P>
<P>Ricky 164: I think about everything. There's all, the peer pressure with my guys, and the peer pressure with her, and the peer pressure with the kids.</P>
<P>McCrady 198: Okay. So your head's kind of going a mile a minute.</P>
<P>Ricky 165: It just like, it's just spinning. It's just spinning.</P>
<P>McCrady 199: Yeah. Yeah. How about your body? Are you feeling edgy or restless?</P>
<P>Ricky 166: My body it just feel like if I don't take that drink I ain't got no energy. I'm laid back. When I ain't drinking I'm laid back and it's all good. When I got that drink, I'm all energetic.</P>
<P>Claudette 138: He'll like want to go rake the grass, mow the lawn.</P>
<P>Ricky 167: Like thinking I lift cars and--</P>
<P>McCrady 200: This is after you've had--</P>
<P>Ricky 168: Yeah. Make me feel like I'm Rambo. That I can't be touched or bullets will bounce off me and everything.</P>
<P>McCrady 201: That's a great feeling. Do you like that feeling? I mean it sounds like it.</P>
<P>Ricky 169: It's like, that feeling, yeah. It's just like, it make me feel like, "Man, I'm untouchable. I could walk through a wall." And I like that feeling.</P>
<P>McCrady 202: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 170: And it's like I can take all my pressures away like I don't got none. All I could think about is going and lifting up a Volvo or a Cadillac.</P>
<P>McCrady 203: Or an Expedition, right.</P>
<P>Ricky 171: Right, Expedition.</P>
<P>Claudette 139: Expedition.</P>
<P>McCrady 204: But I guess, so I guess what I'm thinking about is like when you stop if you say like tomorrow you're not going to go out at noon, okay, I think that's going to be a really hard time.</P>
<P>Ricky 172: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 205: Because it's like you're used to it. You've got a real habit going.</P>
<P>And there's something you really get from it. It's like this incredible feeling. So I'm thinking that's going to be a hard time. And I'm wondering if, we've got like a couple minutes left that we can talk. If there's some things that might help you because, you're right, if you can get through a couple of weeks without it, it will start getting a little easier.</P>
<P>Ricky 173: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 206: But especially those first few days, your body is going to be going, "Where is it!" You know?</P>
<P>Ricky 174: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 207: "I'm so use, I want my alcohol."</P>
<P>Ricky 175: And the only suggestion I can say is to, if my body get to feeling like that going out, like I said, fix me something to eat. Go to the store and get me a couple of candy bars and some soda.</P>
<P>McCrady 208: Why don't you tell Claudette.</P>
<P>Ricky 176: You know? A couple of candy bars and some soda.</P>
<P>Claudette 140: You got that anyway.</P>
<P>Ricky 177: So, well, I have to go out and get it. And I probably, I'm gonna try to do my best.</P>
<P>Claudette 141: Only thing--</P>
<P>Ricky 178: To stop all that drinking.</P>
<P>Claudette 142: Reroute from the store at 12:00 noon and that will stop.</P>
<P>Ricky 179: And I'll just go to the park and jog around.</P>
<P>Claudette 143: Because see what I did? I just stayed in the house. Minded the kids like I normally do. Watch TV. Work around the house. I do all that.</P>
<P>McCrady 209: So you think that would be good for him?</P>
<P>Claudette 144: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 210: Stay in?</P>
<P>Claudette 145: Not stay in but when you go out at 12:00 noon, just have a goal. You know, go out to do something better than, "Oh, I think I'll go to the store."</P>
<P>Ricky 180: Or I could like I did when I was in the penitentiary up in there. We had homemade alcohol and I could just look, look, look, look, look.</P>
<P>Claudette 146: Then you want to make--</P>
<P>Ricky 181: No. I'm not saying make any homemade alcohol. I'm saying up in there it was kind of hard for me to do it so I stayed in the gym working out.</P>
<P>Claudette 147: Right.</P>
<P>Ricky 182: I would just go into the basement and work out with my weights more, you know. And that would help me because it's like when I work out that relieve all the stress and the pressure. I don't need no drink. I don't need no marijuana. I don't need no square. I don't need none of that. So I just work out more.</P>
<P>McCrady 211: You think that sounds like a good idea?</P>
<P>Claudette 148: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 212: Yeah.</P>
<P>Claudette 149: Because then I'd work out with him.</P>
<P>McCrady 213: Mm hm. Okay. I'll suggest that if you're gonna do that, which sounds like a really good idea, that you do it, start a little bit before the time you normally go out to get to buy the alcohol. So if you normally go out at noon--</P>
<P>Ricky 183: Go out at about 11:00, 11:30.</P>
<P>McCrady 214: Yeah, 11:00, 11:30. Have a really good work out. You know, have something to eat together. And that may help you get through some of that, you know, that period.</P>
<P>Ricky 184: Okay. That's the stuff that I ain't knowed. That I learned here today.</P>
<P>McCrady 215: What did you learn?</P>
<P>Ricky 185: I learned that if I don't get my jealousy together, I ain't gonna have her for long. I'm gonna lose her.</P>
<P>McCrady 216: And make it hard, then it would be hard for her to stay clean.</P>
<P>Claudette 150: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 217: Let me, since we're almost at the end here I want to give you guys a little bit of feedback.</P>
<P>Claudette 151: Okay.</P>
<P>McCrady 218: And hopefully make a suggestion or two. I think, you're trying to do something that's really hard. You know, because you've both been drinking, you've both been smoking marijuana. You're both in a position where you don't have jobs right now. You've got that, you said the "X," you know, from the penitentiary. So, you know, you're in a really difficult place. You've got the kids. And the fact that you've both completely stopped the marijuana, that you've cut way down on the alcohol, that you've stopped is incredible. And it's really, really, it shows a lot of commitment on both of your parts. You know, you're both very clear about the reasons to stop. You have really, really good positive things that you want and you have things that you want to get rid of. And having both of those, you've got goals and you've got things you want to put behind you, I think that's really an important part of, you know, kind of staying clean. And you've already started doing a lot of very, very smart things. I mean really smart things. You know, you've gotten the beer out of the house.</P>
<P>Claudette 152: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 219: You've gotten a bunch of activities that you're doing that, you know, kind of distract you from it. You're out there looking for jobs even though I know it's frustrating but you're going in that direction. And, you know, I was, I've been really impressed today that the two of you are talking to each other. You know, you were, that, I'm sure this was not an easy conversation about the jealousy.</P>
<P>Ricky 186: Right. It wasn't.</P>
<P>Claudette 153: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 220: And--</P>
<P>Claudette 154: But we always do talk.</P>
<P>McCrady 221: You always do talk?</P>
<P>Claudette 155: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 222: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 187: Well it's just that today--</P>
<P>Claudette 156: We didn't get into an argument.</P>
<P>McCrady 223: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky : We didn't get into any argument about it.</P>
<P>McCrady 224: Why did you think it was different? I know the cameras and lights and another person.</P>
<P>Ricky 188: It just like, it can't be the camera because we use to do this in public around, I didn't care who was around. So it was basically like with the cameras away it's the same thing.</P>
<P>McCrady 225: Okay.</P>
<P>Ricky 189: It's just like right now we're talking more openly about us having a therapist there, you know. And it's like it's better. I see this stuff. Dream about this stuff on TV.</P>
<P>McCrady 226: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ricky 190: I see lots of these shows and they had the therapists on them and I'm like, "Man, we need that." But I ain't had the money to go to see Montel Williams, their therapists, and all the other people so.</P>
<P>McCrady 227: Yeah. I'm not sure he's the best therapist. But I'll tell you, I think you guys did something. I helped you a little bit with it but you did something that I think really helped you talk differently.</P>
<P>Ricky 191: Right.</P>
<P>McCrady 228: Which is first of all you let each other talk. Because at first you guys were like, you both had so much to say you were both talking at the same time. But you, the simple fact of like taking turns makes it easier. The fact that you listened to each other and you did, you know, you were hearing what the other person was saying was really, I think, very important. And you, you know you made some very specific requests. You made some very specific requests. And neither of you laughed at the other person or blew up about it. You know, you took the request seriously. You didn't necessarily completely agree, which is fine. It's like two people are going to have different views even if they are both the same sign. You know, you're going to have different perspectives. But the fact that you both could think of there are things that I'd like you to do. And the other person could say, "Well, let me think about that. That might not be exactly what I want to do but I want to listen to you and I'm going to try."</P>
<P>Claudette 157: Mm hm.</P>
<P>McCrady 229: And, you know, I mean I was really encouraging you to try to compromise and you were both, you know, you were both there. You were both listening to that. So I think that that, you know, letting each other talk, listening, making requests, compromising is really an important, that's what really good communication can be. And it seems like you, it wasn't very hard for you to do that. I wasn't working real hard to get you to do it. I just gave you like about three or four suggestions and you guys went off with it. So then I think you got a lot of work ahead of you.</P>
<P>Ricky 192: Yeah. I know.</P>
<P>McCrady 230: And as I said, you may have some dips in it, but, you know, in terms of--</P>
<P>Claudette 158: But as long as we work together.</P>
<P>McCrady 231: Mm hm.</P>
<P>Ricky 193: Yeah.</P>
<P>McCrady 232: Yeah. I think that that's really important that you do work together. So I think we're pretty much out of time. Any like questions you want to ask me before we stop stop?</P>
<P>Ricky 194: I just want your autograph.</P>
<P>Claudette 159: Uh uh.</P>
<P>McCrady 233: Do you have any questions?</P>
<P>Claudette 160: Not really.</P>
<P>McCrady 234: Well, thanks again.</P>
<P>Claudette 161: I think you did a good job.</P>
<P>McCrady 235: Well, thank you.</P>
<P>Claudette 162: Helping us listen to each other.</P>
<P>McCrady 236: Well, as I say, thank you again for coming in and doing this.</P>
<P>Claudette 163: We were glad to be here.</P>
<P>McCrady 237: I think that, hopefully it helped you but I think it will also help other people.</P>
<P>Ricky 195: Thank you.</P>
<P>McCrady 238: Okay. Great.</P>
<P>Ricky 196: That's it?</P>
<P>McCrady 239: Uh huh. Yeah.</P>

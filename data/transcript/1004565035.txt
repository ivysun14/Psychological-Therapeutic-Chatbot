<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I graduated last weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was amazing. It was so fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm so glad for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My grandparents, my mom's parents, were here. The week before I had talked to my stepmother about coming and told her I'd love for her to be there. But she doesn't drive, so I don't know how she would've gotten there anyway. So she did not come. But we said we'd go out for dinner and drinks [when we go on that trip together in July]. So that was fine. My mom, my stepfather and Kyle and my grandparents were there, and we all went out to dinner and it was great. It was such a nice weekend. My grandmother was here for Mother's Day, and my mom hadn't been with my grandmother for Mother's Day in, she said, 17 years so that was great. It was a great weekend. (laughter)</p>

<p>[01:25.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm so glad you had a nice time celebrating with your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think we had talked about this before, I was totally not — I wanted to skip the whole ceremony altogether. But you know, I was sitting there in my cap and gown and it was great. I was glad I went. I took a ton of good pictures.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure they were really happy to have the opportunity to see you in official garb. It is such a big moment, not just for you but for your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now we leave for vacation tomorrow. Things could not — like, I mean, this week is great. (laughter) So I took today off cause I had a ton of things to do, so I'm hoping my new schedule is going to be four 12-hour days, Monday through Thursday, and I have Friday off. That would be ideal. But I don't know yet. So after this, I have a manicure and a pedicure with my mom and that's my day. (laughter) So it's beautiful out, and maybe we'll go for a walk. It's like zero complaints. (laughter)</p>

<p>[02:49.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were due for some nice things to happen and some relaxing days. You worked really hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just cannot wait to swim up to the swim-up bar and get my frozen drink. (laughter) You know, this week is going to fly by though. So I'm just going to be doing everything and relax.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really enjoy the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Even today, I woke up and went to the gym and I'm here. I was looking forward to — I was telling Kyle that my vacation was going to start today. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The location is different. You run from school to work. You haven't really had time to just do things for yourself, and taking some time to do things for yourself and relax and enjoy them.</p>

<p>[03:48.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I thought I was going to have more free time when I graduated, but —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you've been working a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — has been the total opposite. I feel like I shouldn't have told them I graduated, like I had to take a summer class or something. (chuckles) It's the nature of the job, I guess, because if I'm not there, then they can't go to their meeting that they scheduled. They are two very busy people, and sometimes — you know, the husband is a lawyer and he can't get home, so I can't leave.</p>

<p>[04:33.6]</p>

<p>But I did say to them yesterday that when I get back, we have to set down a schedule. Because in the morning when you say "Okay, today is going to be from 8 to 6:30, and then it's 9:00 at night, I need to have my free time too." That would mean they would have to hire a part-time babysitter for Fridays and Saturday mornings, which is fine. I'm sure they have friends for the summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is the time where it's usually easier to find somebody because there are teachers or students that have a lot of free time. That would be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I got the job. Did I tell you that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't tell me that, and I didn't want to ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. So they offered me — they were saying I'm not ready for the original position as of today. So they are creating an internship, they're calling it, because they don't want to lose me.</p>

<p>[05:45.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they really liked you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if I'm going to take it, because of a few reasons. So the woman I'm working for now has also offered me a position —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the one you nanny for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She is a consultant. She works with huge new companies. It's amazing and she was very successful at it. She also writes for <i>Architectural Digest</i>. She used to be the lead writer. She's very successful. So she offered me a position as her assistant for her company, to start next month or so.</p>

<p>[06:43.2]</p>

<p>And she has offered me more money than the other position. So I have to go in and talk to (inaudible at 06:52.9) because what they're offering for the internship, which would be six months, I would be taking a large pay cut. It's still paid, but it's a pay cut. And I don't know what it is at the end of six months. Like I can wait it out for six months and then if it's going to be worth it, then fine. But when I go from making $10 an hour to $12 an hour, I don't know. It's still health insurance that I need.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would the internship give you benefits?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I can still be on my parents'.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Until you're 25.</p>

<p>[07:35.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Until I'm 25, when I was on my dad's. So I'm now on my stepmother's, but their health insurance is terrible. So the kids have health insurance through school. I don't think it's federal, but it's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's something different for (inaudible at 07:59.2). But you could do that probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you make too much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I don't qualify for the federal either because I make too much. But I'm still broke. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're in that in-between where you're not quite broke enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your choices are stay on your stepmom's, which you don't feel like is good coverage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not. But I'm still technically on my dad's through — I don't know how. I don't know if they had a shared — because it hasn't expired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't yours a program through school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, is that the one — yes, I have that too. But that's going to be out.</p>

<p>[08:44.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that stays until August, I think. I think the academic term goes through August 1st.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I do have that. It would just pay for my grandfather, because he — but, so that goes through August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. I think most of the student plans run that way, because incoming students get it just before they usually start school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so I have to look into that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there any concerns about relationship overlap, working for the woman that you nanny at? I mean, right now you have such a personal familial-type relationship that I wonder how that would cross over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [That's what my mother said I should think about]. Because if I do take this position with her, she's going to be hiring another nanny. But she's like "I want you to spend time with them for the first few months." So I want to be able to do a great job for her and be there.</p>

<p>[09:55.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't be there —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I can be creating out of spreadsheets while doing play-doh. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because there's a reason she has a nanny, because she can't do her job and do — I mean, she can be a mom but she can't be a stay-at-home mom. And you can't be a nanny — you can have a relationship with the kids. You can't be a nanny and an assistant at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel so lucky that I have two —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have two good offers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: — offers, and a lot of my friends who I graduated with last week they are applying blindly on Craigslist to 40 different places a day and hearing nothing. But they both have given me — the internship would not start, because since they're creating the position they have to have it approved by all these people, and then I have to be appointed a supervisor, and they have to make a plan. So it probably wouldn't start until the end of July, first week in August. So in this whole time, I can still be working as a nanny so it's not like —</p>

<p>[11:09.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you can be having income in the interim. Why make a decision?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can still be applying, and I can just not do neither. So we'll see. But then, I love my job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If there wasn't the complication of the switching of the relationship from working for her as a nanny to working for her as an assistant, what would you think about that job offer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 11:38.3)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if she was an unknown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just knowing what she did — like she's very respected in that whole industry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a really good relationship to have.</p>

<p>[11:52.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I tell people she does a lot of work in interior design and that I'm working for her, and they're like "Oh my God, I've read about her in our textbooks." It is quite an incredible job to have. But it takes a special kind of person. She has her quirks, so you have to — being in her home, you know, I think I could get to know her on a completely different level than knowing her in the office.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing, it says something that she feels comfortable enough with you, knowing that you know her probably in a different light than a lot of other people. That she feels comfortable bringing you into that work environment. She also probably knows you in a different way than she would know another assistant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's one of the reasons she said she wants me because as an assistant, you do everything from picking up her dry cleaning, which I do anyway. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You already know (inaudible).</p>

<p>[13:02.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) I already know how she takes her coffee. And she was saying "Well, maybe you could just be the family manager." I'm like "Oh, God."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, that's totally different. Because from being her assistant, there's the idea that you would then progress in the field. Being a family manager doesn't give you — it's a lot of the same skills, I'm sure. But it doesn't give you a point to build from on your resume in the same way. And you don't want to be — you know, a family manager is keeping you more in your nanny field than moving you into where you want to be professionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also there's a lot of gray. So we do have to sit down and — because if I am going to — I mean, she calls me her assistant now. I'm not the nanny. I'm her assistant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. When did that start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Always. But I don't do any — I mean, I guess when she introduces me at Piper's school, I'm the nanny.</p>

<p>[14:13.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you obviously take care of the children, but you do things additional to that. You're not a babysitter. You really are a full-time nanny somehow [and you do school at the same time].</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when we're out and she's introducing me to her friends, I'm the assistant. I don't know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In some ways, I think it shows that she respects you for all of the different roles that you really do provide to make it possible for their family to run.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to be gone for a week. They'll be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They'll miss you, I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I made an entire six-page schedule for Piper for the week. (chuckles) I guess she needs —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just information you keep in your head.</p>

<p>[15:03.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is good to have anyway if they're hiring another babysitter. Just like favorite foods, helpful tips, you know, when all else fails.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that's invaluable information.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I e-mailed it to them last night, and they were like "Oh, this is incredible." So that was good. My first day back was the Monday after graduation. I was over there and she was sick and she threw up all over me. Like all over me, down my shoulder. If that had happened before, I was like "This is a stepping stone." Now I have my college degree, and I was just thrown up on. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have a doctorate and I still get thrown up on. It doesn't protect you. (laughter) [It is biologically-related, throw up, to me]. I don't know if that makes it better.</p>

<p>[16:14.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Then it was beautiful yesterday, and we went to the playground for hours and we were running. I'm like, I'm not at a desk, this is great, you know. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are definitely pros and cons.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely don't want to be a nanny forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a wonderful thing you're doing, and if that's what you wanted to do for your career, then you'd be awesome at it. You are awesome at it, and it would be a great fit for you. But it's not what you decided to do for your career. There are probably lots of people who just graduated with degrees in early childhood education, for whom this would be a great job going forward. It was wonderful for you, and you clearly did a really good job. They love you in lots of ways, both the kids and the parents. But it's not what you decided you wanted to study.</p>

<p>[17:19.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I just don't know how I will ever leave them though. (chuckles) So that's the difficult part. But it's not like I'm on a super time crunch. I have really the next month or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did she give you in terms of a decision-making timeline?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She didn't. As long as if I am leaving, I have to give her ample time to find someone and then to help with the training process. And she knows the internship would start in mid-August, probably the next few weeks. I still have to go in next week and talk to them. The biggest thing is going to be probably the salary, in the end.</p>

<p>[18:21.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The salary at the end of the internship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the end of the internship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they hire somebody for the position that you had applied for? Or are they holding that open to fill when you're done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's still — the job description is still up on the website. That was like two weeks ago at this point. I don't know actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm wondering what the plan is for you when you complete the internship. If they're creating a position for you now, it's not completely unrealistic to think they would then create a position for you post-internship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I still have to make a decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's good to have options, but it's hard to decide.</p>

<p>[19:29.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) can't be done with school. I can't not ever go back to school. It just seems so strange, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you never have to make that decision forever. You're not closing doors.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking maybe I'll start with one class or something. I just can't ever imagine not — not that I won't learn anything from now on, but I'm just not done with being a student. I don't know. Maybe not this fall, but maybe in the spring, I'll take one class. Maybe two. Who knows. But right now, I'm ready for vacation. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[20:24.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, schools will not be going anywhere. There will be lots of opportunities for you to take classes and do continuing education. Just give yourself a little bit of time to enjoy where you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to be more present. I'm not very good at that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when you were talking about being at the park, it sounds like that was a moment you were very present in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. But I always feel like I'm thinking about the next thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do a lot of planning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. I know. Sometimes it's annoying to others, I'm sure. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who do you think is annoyed by it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably Kyle. Well, definitely Kyle. Just because I have to know everything. Like I wake up in the morning and I have to know minute by minute what is happening in the day. I don't know why. Then I write it all down. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[21:30.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your day? His day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just my day, mostly. But we'll be eating breakfast and I will say "What are we going to have for dinner because we have to go to the store." He's like "It's 9:00, 7:00 in the morning. I don't know what I want for dinner." But then on the weekends, he is definitely a relaxer and that's just not me whatsoever. So he gets very annoyed. I don't know. If I had like a Saturday and a Sunday off, I just feel guilty if I'm not doing something. I have to be out of the house by 8:30, no matter what. Even if I walk around the block. I just cannot sit in the house and be lazy. I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just —</p>

<p>[22:31.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when I do — if it's raining, then I won't. But especially if it's nice out. If it's noon and I haven't done anything, then I feel bad that I didn't do anything. Then it's 2, I still haven't done anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's going to happen on vacation when you get out of bed and put on your bathing suit and lay on the beach?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have many activities planned. (laughter) We're going snorkeling. We're going horseback riding. We're going for an entire full-day nature hike. We're going zip-lining. I have massages booked for mom and I, and I just called and made Kyle and my stepfather's tee time. I'm a control freak, I'm realizing as this is going on. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) In the beginning of the session, I think you said something about "I just can't wait to swim up to the bar and get my frozen margarita." It doesn't sound like there's actually time to drink the margarita, [which is I think a frozen drink.]</p>

<p>[23:39.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There will be. There will be time. I'm sure I'll schedule that too. But I mean, the horseback riding is only an hour. We only have one full day of that hike, but that was one thing we wanted to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those all sound like wonderful, fun things. [Not at all in that particular location]. Those are all things you wouldn't have a chance to do in your normal everyday life, so they are wonderful things to do. Sounds like you're excited about them. But it's interesting that this idea of being on vacation and relaxing, it's hard for you to know how to actually relax.</p>

<p>[24:24.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean, I think horseback riding is relaxing. I bought books. I'm sure I'll do plenty of lying on the beach. But we're only there for a week, and there are so many things I want to do. I'm excited to go snorkeling and horseback riding, get a massage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm so excited. I'm going to have to leave at like 3:30 in the morning. The flight is at 5.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, that's early.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but we have a three-hour layover. I can't wait. I think this trip means a lot to my mom too, because we almost cancelled it when my stepfather had his brain aneurysm.</p>

<p>[25:24.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's good that you can all go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they booked it the day before he had his aneurysm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then everything happened. My mom had no idea about medical bills, and she felt so guilty having this whole trip on the credit card. It was one of the only logical sentences he said the whole time he was there, but it was like "Do not cancel that trip. I will be fine." (chuckles) So she didn't, and thank God. And he's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he'll be able to go and enjoy all of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a celebration of a lot of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And Kyle graduates in August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When do you guys move from your apartment?</p>

<p>[26:23.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Our lease is up in August. I don't think we're going to buy any furniture or anything because we have no idea where we're going. And that's another thing. I feel like if I'm staying, if I take this job and Kyle gets a job somewhere else or wherever, and I want to go too. I would like to move too. I don't want to be there for a month, you know. But he'll probably know — he has a couple of offers, so we wouldn't move, which would be fine. I'm just going to think about my vacation. Not think about anything else.</p>

<p>[27:31.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can make decisions on a lot of this stuff when you get back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it will all be here when I come back. (pause) Did I tell you that my little sister called me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you haven't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she called — I guess this was last Friday — to say congratulations and wish me luck (inaudible at 27:58.3). Then she said that all of her friends are starting to look at colleges, and she hasn't been able to look anywhere. My stepmother doesn't drive, and with everything going on, she asked me if I would take her to different schools on the weekends. Which is fine, but thinking that we'd go to the city and check out a few schools there.</p>

<p>[28:27.4]</p>

<p>No. So she wants to go to look at them. I don't know how we're going to swing this, but she wants to look at schools far away too. So these are all weekends that I'm now losing. (chuckles) Which is fine. We'll have fun doing it. But I just didn't think that I would be doing this whole process over again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your gut reaction when she asked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I was losing weekends. But she's actually right. This is the end of her junior year. She needs to start applying, and she hasn't been on the campus. So it's my sisterly obligation. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[29:29.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's also your sisterly right as a person with her own life to help her set some boundaries around it. That's a lot of schools and they are different places. What is making her choose those schools, how much has she looked, how much reading has she done ahead of time? Because you don't want to go out there on a whim because it sounds cool. Helping her whittle down what feels most important and doing some compromise. Does she have friends that are looking at some of the same schools? Maybe she could go to some with their families.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She does have — she said one of her friends was looking at them too. So that was actually — she said the summer tours start next week once all the schools have let out. So she was going to go with them. The one out West is her number one choice and it has been for a year.</p>

<p>[30:29.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really don't want to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just don't know how I will — I can't afford to pay for the two of us to go there. But I went to Texas for my freshman year, so I get that she wants to go away. And given this current situation, I am surprised she wants to stay that close. (chuckles) (pause) I don't even know where to begin with — I was looking at flights and for the two of us it would be $600, like $300 roundtrip for each ticket. And if we went on off-peak, like Thursday to Sunday or Thursday to Monday, it's just a lot. And the one up North we can do — we have a cousin who lives up there, so we can do that and drive, that's fine. [31:49.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she drive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has her permit. She does not have a license, and I have yet to see her drive. (chuckles) Flying to Maryland is a puddle-jumper, but it's — I mean, you could take a train. I don't know. It's just not what I was planning for the summer. I'm going to have to spread them out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know, like if she applies, what's the likelihood of her getting in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She will absolutely get in. She's a 4.0 honor, she's a fantastic student. There's nothing — she's involved in everything. She took the SATs in March, and she scored very well. She didn't take them again because she couldn't do any better. I think she should be reaching higher, but these are the schools that she wants. It's like, I live on campus. You can just come over and I'll give you my own tour. (chuckles) But I absolutely do not blame her for wanting to —</p>

<p>[33:13.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wants to have the experience that her friends are having. I can understand why that feels important. And she doesn't necessarily have to get everything she wants.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not fair because she doesn't have the same family set-up that maybe some of her friends have where it's easier to do what feels so typical. You don't have to fill every void.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I can just imagine if someone told me when I was 18 that I couldn't go to Texas for whatever reason. You know, when you're 18 and you're graduating —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really where you want to go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's like your only focus, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she can apply to some of these schools without going for visits, and then visit when she gets in. If it's still a contender, she can visit then. She can visit some of them. You can find ways for her to go with other families that might be visiting the same school. It doesn't have to be exactly —</p>

<p>[34:21.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we don't have to go to all these places in three months. That's a good point too. I just feel so bad because all of her friends are going to look at this school —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's easier for them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I just feel badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels unfair that it's more complicated for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'll definitely be able to take her to a couple. Maybe she should've — but Arizona is her first choice, and she will get in (inaudible at 35:00.1) (pause) When I went to college four year ago, our lives were completely different. We visited three times before I made my decision. Not just to go down, because my parents loved the area. And I was only there for a year. (chuckles) (pause) But she's been through a lot too.</p>

<p>[35:36.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, she has.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is just like, applying to college is like the most important thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is what's supposed to be present in her life, and it is a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's also, I just found out, she's going to South America for the entire month of August to teach English to kids. It's not Mexico City. One of those areas that is less safe but not — and she's going to be teaching English.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a really exciting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She got a full scholarship to go for a month. So, she's great.</p>

<p>[36:31.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will look great on college applications.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. She's done it every — last summer, she was in Washington fighting against the meth outbreak and doing teenage support groups. She's like the most incredible kid. And the year before that, she was in Costa Rico teaching English, and they built 16 playgrounds throughout —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's always been able to go on these humanities scholarships. So she'll get in where — she should be applying Ivy League, but she just doesn't want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the right fit for her. Just because you can get in doesn't mean it's necessarily the best fit for you. If she goes to a place she loves and does great, she'll create plenty of opportunities for herself. It sounds like she's good at seeking out opportunities.</p>

<p>[37:40.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it would be good for her to get away for a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you talked about really wanting to get far away. South America is pretty far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (chuckles) (pause) She has to have four different sets of shots to even enter the country and come back to the US.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot of travel involved for stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it will be a great experience, that's for sure. Maybe I'll go visit her in South America. (chuckles) (pause) I have my manicure and pedicure next.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Life is so different in two weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Last time I saw you, you were finishing final papers and projects and interviewing.</p>

<p>[38:32.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, oh my God. I won't go back now. That was so stressful. One great thing though about not having homework is I come home and I just do what I want. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it that you want? What do you find yourself actually wanting to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I got a Kindle for one of my graduation presents, so I've been reading. The people I work for, the father, just published a book. It was released on the 7th of the month. They wrote me an incredible note and inside they signed it, so I've been reading that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you like to read for fun?</p>

<p>[39:20.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything. I love to read, anything from girly books to crime. His — It's <i>The Other Side of Normal</i>. It's about nature versus nurture, and it's pretty interesting. And the next book I bought was <i>50 Things That Every Young Woman Should Know</i>, like etiquette. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're doing okay without the book. It seems like you've impressed everybody that you've met.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) I like those sort of, you know, knowing which fork to use.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's the outside in.</p>

<p>[40:24.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh yeah. When all else fails. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't had the need for that in a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I ever have. I mean, if I get two forks at a meal it's somewhere fancy. (laughter) I went to the gym this morning, but I haven't gone in a week. That always makes me feel good to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you've been really busy. There are times when some things just need to get dropped off the list. And while it's really healthy to be able to work out, sometimes it's healthier to know that it's just not happening and to kind of cut yourself some slack. You'll have time to add it back in now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They have yoga in the mornings on the beach, water aerobics. (chuckles) I can't wait.</p>

<p>[41:26.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just a few hours really, if you're leaving at 3:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's actually not that far away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I'm already packed, and it's a beautiful day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enjoy your day and just make sure when you're on vacation to check in with what you feel like doing in the moment. That's a really good chance to practice being present. And if you had something that you thought that you were going to try to do, and that's not actually what you want to do, it's okay to let it go. You only have one week this time, but you will have other vacations in your future. You're going to be a working woman now. So let yourself take some time to check in and say "What am I actually in the mood for?" And if it's what you have planned, great. If it's not —</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it's just another drink —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay too. Let's see if we can put our books together and figure out a time to meet when you come back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I have no idea. Not a clue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to call me when you get back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So on Monday —I'm working on a Monday so I'm unable to start our schedule for the week. I don't know. It's just so last-minute. So I'll e-mail you on Monday and tell you sort of what my schedule is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. When you have an idea. I didn't know [about work].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a clue.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So enjoy your week. When you have a clue, e-mail me or call me and we'll figure out some things that work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enjoy yourself, and congratulations. I'm really happy for you on all accounts. On job offers and graduation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice to see some good things come your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so too. (chuckles) Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fly safe. Use sunscreen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I brought 70. I burn. Have a good week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. I will talk to you soon.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, yes, the wind has been awful.  I heard them say it was eighty miles an hour down I think it was [DEIDENTIFIED] or somewhere.  So, it's going to do some damage.  They showed a cabin that had picked up off its foundation and moved like forty feet up in the mountains.  So, anyway, so how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been really sick.  I was, I went to the emergency room Wednesday, and I was there from like ten o'clock in the morning until about almost nine thirty that night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then they decided not to keep me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did they do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they just gave me some medicine for my stomach, and something to help me relax.  I was just like, I just had to just, my stomach hurt so bad.  I had to just keep moving, you know, and I was so tired 'cause I hadn't slept, but I, I just couldn't sit still, and, uh, so I don't know what they gave me.  They gave me, 'cause I had an IV, and they gave me about three or four things through the IV, and then they started to just give me some fluids because I hadn't been eating at all.  I ate a toasted cheese sandwich Monday, and then after that I, I couldn't even look at anything to eat.  So, uh, I don't know, but I'm, I'm still don't feel good today, but I, I just had to get out and you know, see if you could just, I have so much stuff in here, but it's all stuff that I've been taking and I didn't know if you could look at it, and see if there's anything that, I don't think that it's anything that I'm taking or doing, but, um, you know, I'm taking like these drops and things from, uh, I, you probably don't know [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She has this [DEIDENTIFIED] place and I've gone to her for a long time, and [NAME OTHER] took me there, and so she was kind of trying to help me 'cause she had I guess, sees quite a few people that have some stomach problems, but I just, it just knocks me out.  I mean I just get sick all over.  And then I've had a headache with it, and I, in the beginning, I had a high fever, but I think that was, that was more than just my stomach.  The doctor thought it was an upper respiratory infection maybe, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know how high your fever went, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One hundred two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But now, I'm usually, a couple of days ago in the morning, it was 94.5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'm sorry, that was when?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A couple of days ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ninety four point five.  Huh, so it really dropped.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what it was today, or did you check?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't take it today, but I checked it yesterday, and it's almost always 97.4 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's pretty usual for me, but then by late afternoon, it's like 98.8.  So, you know, I can't, I don't really know it that's a bit of a fever for me or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, you know, I mean it's always low in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, [PATIENT NAME] can you remind me, are you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, it's kind of normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you seeing a GI specialist now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was, and I went to a second one, but she didn't do anything either, but I'm going to have to go back to somebody, but I don't know if anything's they can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't know that even know why you're having the pain, do they?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they did an upper endoscopy, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I've had three or four, and it's always the same.  It's my stomach looks red, inflamed and that's about all they would say except the last one she said she saw a little bit of diverticulitis or diverticulosis.  I'm not sure which it is, but, uh, and she said that's unusual to see it in the, in the upper endoscopy.  You usually only see it in the lower.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's as much as I've ever found out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are you taking anything specifically for your stomach now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They gave me a new prescription, um, and I take all kinds of stuff like to digest, help digest food, and then [NAME OTHER] gave me some and, uh, this isn't this.  And some of it's supposed to help repair and one's for digestion, and uh, the other one is, it's called stress resistance.  They're just drops.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can I see one of those, [PATIENT NAME] just to see, see what's in them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My goodness, I have to get my magnifying glass to read it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know.  I can't read any of it.  I'm getting so I'll probably not gong to be able to see it with my glasses on, but you know, I didn't think I was taking very much prescription medication, but I guess I am taking a little more than I thought.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, this is quite a, quite a collection, everything from coffee to oak to alcohol to impatiens.  A lot of flowers, clematis.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I've never even read that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Star of Bethlehem, rock rose, clematis, [INAUDIBLE]  I don't know if they're getting pineal glands from animals, or where it comes from.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know either 'cause like I say, I didn't even read it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, I'm assuming this is a homeo, yeah, it's a homeopathic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's all she does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But now, the, um, this new one that I started, this is generic, almost everything I get they give me generic form.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But this is that doxepin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, they said well, what's that supposed to do, and I wasn't quite sure, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, three things that it can help with.  It's an antidepressant.  It has antianxiety properties, and it can help with sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I said it's supposed to help with sleep, but, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But they use it for other things too.  The GI doctors sometimes use it for people who have irritable bowel or something like that, but we were using it more to help with depression, anxiety, and sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you think that would help my stomach?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, I don't know.  I mean it's not typically something that affects the stomach one way or the other usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's more for the lower intestines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, it shouldn't, I wouldn't expect it to hurt your stomach.  It doesn't normally.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, and then this, you know, that, uh, patch that I wear for pain.  I wouldn't think that that would have an effect if you're taking, if you don't swallow it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just a [INAUDIBLE] patch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Patch.  Oh, okay.  I'm not aware of that upsetting the stomach, but I don't know for sure [PATIENT NAME] since I don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Well, you know, I don't take very many prescriptions, but I guess I wasn't thinking that I took this much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you know what you might even do is check with your pharmacist just to make sure that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any interactions between them all because they have all in their computer, and they can just cross check them against each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  This is just for nausea, and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but she said maybe you should just try a half of one because it might make you, uh, kind of lose your balance or something like that.  I am just terrible that way anyhow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we don't want that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, yeah, I didn't want that, and, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did you know that, do you recognize anything on there that would help with digestion or anything?  That's what it's supposed to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's mostly different enzymes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That will break things down like break down lactose, which is milk, and might break down fats, but whether this can cause any stomach upset or not, I just don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't think that it would, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's mostly enzymes, but again, but I just, have you been on it for a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've taken it off and on for quite a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you know what some people have to do is just start systematically eliminating one thing at a time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To see if it helps, and sometimes they can find that it works.  I have one patient who was taking medicines and was doing fine, and she switched to a generic medicine, and it just starting tearing, tearing up her stomach, caused terrible problems.  She went back to the brand name and the problems went away, and it turned out the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I worry about that because they, everything that I get almost, they switch to generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, and what I learned [PATIENT NAME] that I didn't know, in her particular case, was there was an inactive ingredient, what they thought was an inactive ingredient in the generic that was not in the brand name, and she has a condition called celiac disease, and it was causing her celiac disease to flare up.  When she went back to the brand name, it went away.  So sometimes we think the generics are going to work just the same as the brand names, but sometimes they don't.  So, it may be that one of the things you can try is, you know, again, systematically eliminating one medicine if you can and one of the supplements just to see if it might be affecting your stomach, but you'd want to be careful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See this is even generic for Neurontin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They just, uh, now she said, you know, the Donnatal might make me kind of sleepy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then she said do you get sleepy when you take the Neurontin, and I said, no, not usually.  So, she said well then don't worry about it.  Take them at the same, around the same time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Otherwise, you know, on the antacid it says wait two hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, how have your spirits been through all this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I slept the night before last.  Last night I didn't sleep very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I had a time, hard time getting to sleep, but then when I took, I took the Lunesta, just one and then it just really knocked me out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when I woke up in the morning, my arm was hanging off the bed, and this felt it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your energy level during the day?  Are you tired or do you have enough energy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been in bed most of the time because I just have been so sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, when I was sick, I really didn't eat any solid food from Monday until last night.  I tried to eat a piece of toast one day.  Maybe that was Monday night, but it didn't, I couldn't eat very much of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you been feeling anxiety much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, when I was really sick Wednesday, I was really anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it's gotten, since your stomach's gotten better, the anxiety's come down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some.  I have a little bit, but you know, when I was really sick, I didn't take all my medication.  Then afterwards, you know, I didn't even think about it.  I was so sick, I wasn't thinking about not taking something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I wondered then if, if because I didn't take all of the Neurontin, that maybe that restless leg came back a little bit.  Could that be or not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, it could.  If you don't get the medicine, it might come back.  Okay, but are you getting any enjoyment out of things during the day, or are you just kind of getting through the days on survival mode?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of.  That's about it, and, um, then I'm get in that apartment all the time.  I never get out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's hard when you're not feeling well, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, hum, did they suggest that you have a follow up appointment with your primary doctor after you left the ER, or what did they suggest you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I'm not going to see him till Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Plus it's always the weekend.  I usually get, it seems like I get sick more on the weekend and then I have to wait until Monday to call the doctor.  He called me, and we talked, but, um, I didn't, I haven't gone in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, huh, I'm just thinking what do we do here.  I kind of hate to make any major changes when you're not feeling well.  Do you think since you cut back on the doxepin from three to two, has that helped any or have you been unable to tell 'cause you haven't felt well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's hard to tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's hard for me to tell.  The only thing is I just thought if it helped with sleeping.  Although some of these, the Neurontin should help with sleep too, shouldn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little.  It's not really a sedating sleep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's more for the restless legs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, okay.  Um, then the Donnatal I think it says it may cause drowsiness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So many times it's bad, but then it says dizziness too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's how bad my eyes are.  I think it says drowsiness, but do you know anything at all about Donnatal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this is generic too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the one, I took this.  Oh my gosh, fifty years ago maybe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, it helped me then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, I have to look it up.  I think it's an antispasmodic though to help, I think.  I have to look it up though to make sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I know they gave it to me for my stomach then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You take one before each meal, and then one before bed, but he didn't give me enough pills to last till I go back to my own doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that one you got at the emergency room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Could you give me a prescription for that, just enough for three or four days?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can't because it's not a psychiatrist medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you can't?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What you could do though is call your primary doctor just to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just I hope that it's not too late today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, you can just call him and explain that the emergency room doctor gave you this and would they refill it for you at the pharmacy so you can at least have it to last until you get into to see him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, well [PATIENT NAME] my goodness, you got a lot going on right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm been sick so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You know what I would suggest we do is not change your doxepin or, you're still taking Lunesta too for sleep?  You're not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I haven't taken it.  It's just once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Did it, did it cause problems or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it was just I was so knocked out, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The next day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, in the morning, and then I thought oh, now I'm kind of afraid to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, next time if you want to try it again, you can cut them in half and take a half of one if you wanted.  They're 2 mg.  You could split them and take a 1 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if this is only 2, it shouldn't be that bad, should it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's very strong.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're strong, yeah, 'cause I had before two and three, didn't I?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, uh, I didn't take the three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, this is only two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so if two—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It says don't drive and don't mix with alcohol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So, if it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's about all it says on this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, if two is too much though, you can split them, and see if one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't even think about that.  I just thought they were so little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you have a pill splitter at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so [PATIENT NAME] let's do this.  Let's not make any changes yet until you're feeling better physically 'cause I don't want to do anything that's going to upset the upper part.  You're going to see your doctor Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, you know, if he thinks the doxepin could be contributing, which I don't think it is, and wants to stop it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me know, but I don't think it's the doxepin.  That would be very unusual.  I just don't know what is causing all the stomach problems you're having.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does that sound like an okay plan for now with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the only thing that I thought about was that I just wondered if, if going back to three at night would help me sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It might.  You can either try three—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what about something for, yeah, the, uh, anxiety and depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the doxepin will help too if we can get to higher doses, as long as it doesn't make you too tired during the day.  The reason we cut back was you were feeling tired, uh, but you know, that may not have been the medicine.  It may have been that you were getting sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  This is what I've been sick so much, probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So, if you feel like you can go back up again, just try three next, and if you're okay after we—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I could get something for the anxiety and the depression, that, I think that would help me a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I agree, and [PATIENT NAME] again, that's what the doxepin is for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, if we can increase the dose, I'm hoping it'll give you more help for depression and anxiety.  So, let's try that.  If your stomach feels able to tolerate it, why don't you try going up to three when you're ready, and then if you're not feeling better after a week, try going up to four, and let's stay at that dose for a little while and see if that helps, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope, I'm hoping it will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stay at three for one week?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, at least a week, and then if your stomach's fine and not bothering you, then you can go up to four.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think the doxepin has anything to do with my stomach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think it does either.  It'd be very unusual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought about, you know, I didn't know about if any like a mixture combination of any of the prescriptions, but I don't know if there is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's hard to know for sure because everybody reacts differently.  I mean again, you could check with the pharmacist to see if they show any interactions, but otherwise another option would be to talk to your doctor about maybe systematically eliminating one medicine at a time just to see if there's something happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's upsetting your stomach, but for now, let's, let's work with the doxepin and see if we can get your depression and anxiety under better control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can use the Lunesta at a lower dose if you want to to help you sleep, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Was there anything else [PATIENT NAME] that you wanted to talk about today before we stop?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just, if I could just feel better, I'd be really happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand.  It's no fun feeling sick.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I never get out of that apartment and [INAUDIBLE] in the dining room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Well, [PATIENT NAME] listen—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I thought my stomach was better and then last night I tried to eat a little bit of chicken and rice, and then I got this stomachache back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This morning and so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME] let's check back in three or four weeks just to make sure you're better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you want to do three weeks or four do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, what about three?  When would that be?  [NAME OTHER] said any Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, Wednesday okay.  I've got the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think she works every day almost except Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've got Wednesday [DATE] at either nine, nine thirty, or twelve thirty.  Would any of those times work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, let me see the [DATE] at what nine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nine or nine thirty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nine won't work.  That's, she takes [NAME OTHER] to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, we could also do twelve thirty or even two o'clock.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably twelve thirty I think because, uh, at two o'clock, she has to pick [NAME OTHER] up at three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I don't know if she would, it might be better for her to not have to take me back and pick up [NAME OTHER] too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's try the twelve thirty and if she has—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if that doesn't work for her, just have her call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we'll figure something out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [DATE] at twelve thirty.  Now, was she going to come back and get you when she was done with her meeting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to just wait in the waiting room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought maybe that was her with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can check and see.  It might be or it could be my next patient.  I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll look and see.  If it's not, you're certainly welcome to wait in the waiting room till she gets here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I'll have to wait, but I'm almost sure that she'd be back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm not positive 'cause she had to go to the high school and get [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I don't know how long that would take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet I guess.  So.  All right, [PATIENT NAME] take care.  Call me if you need me, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.  I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, bye bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.</p>

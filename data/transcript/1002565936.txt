<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And thank you very much for helping to improve communication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you're very welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how've you been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well between the election and the Phillies, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never a dull moment in this town huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was very exciting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, myself I've been okay, um as far as the anxiety is pretty much still the same, um but I have 2 things that um are really um upsetting me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now these are my closest friends, this one I know I told you passed away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's so sad, I remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, now this one I just found out has cervical cancer and it has metastasized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she went through the radiation, she went through the chemo, I think she has one chemo left, and as far as I know, okay, she, here, that's [NAME OTHER] wedding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay she named her daughter [NAME OTHER] okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] or [NAME OTHER] as we call her, um lives 2 doors from my ex sister in law who is the one who's sick, her best friend is her cousin, they don't get along.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They went out to lunch and I was wondering why I wasn't invited but she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Didn't want it to get back to her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not to hurt my feelings—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But she didn't even tell [NAME OTHER] until she found out in May, until August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this is, we're talking best friends here now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So um I looked it up, it's to me it's Stage IV, once it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's wrapped around the bladder—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, God bless her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it says that it has shrunk, but she's supposed to find out the prognosis is whether it's working or whether it's not.  Now then my sister's neighbor who I've known for 20 years, when we go over to Jersey, was working the night the Phillies—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Won and a lady with a child in the car, she works for [DEIDENTIFIED] my sister's neighbor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was in the [DEIDENTIFIED] van, not the big truck, [NAME OTHER] she was in the truck, this lady was in the 45 mile hour zone, plowed into her, ejected her, she's got such severe brain injury right now, but she's the only one the doctor said that he's hopeful about two, two cases that have brain injuries like hers, after he did the um surgery he told her to move her finger and she did, and when my sister went up to see her the other day, she opened, kept her eyes open the whole time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As if like she can hear her, and I think they're supposed to, they did take the respirator off, so she's now breathing on her own and they're supposed to move her to another ward which is a good sign.  I had a friend who went through an accident like that before and it did take a while for her to recover but she did, but they had to see the extent of the brain injury—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After all the, and she lives next door, has a daughter my nieces age, you know the one I, that's the bad seed of the family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she has a grandson [AGE] and she has a, ah boy, a son who just got engaged and, out of the blue she, she was only in, she was in New Jersey at um, and I'm telling you 44 miles an hour and this lady with the child—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Comes smashing, I mean to have thrown her, they found her unconscious, not breathing and then you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did the other driver stop at least?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh she had to stop—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She had to, she was hurt but not nearly, they, I think they're fine now.  But they had to fly her to [DEIDENTIFIED] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Terrifying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The fact that she's even living today let alone—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a miracle, she was ejected from the car.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh she was ejected big time, now I know they don't wear their seatbelts cause they're in and out, so was the bad thing, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes that's a huge risk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is yes.  So between her telling me this but this is where me and my sister don't see eye to eye cause she—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So much going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She tells me, like you're going to hear about a lot of people around our age that are going to start dying.  I said [NAME OTHER] don't say that to me because it's insensitive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Horrible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't say that to you about [NAME OTHER], now I know [NAME OTHER] but this friend is closer to me but I wouldn't say that to you, do you understand—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Every person is precious anyway but [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you, that's exactly, I said she's a mother, she's grandma—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's a daughter, just like [NAME OTHER] so don't tell me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's a treasured friend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At [AGE] that you're going to hear, that's not the average age to die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah and you don't just shrug it off and say ah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that's right, that's right, no I can't, I know that these are close friends of mine and have been my whole life—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Such a sweet picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah well that's [DEIDENTIFIED] when we were [AGE] and [AGE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we're [AGE] and [AGE] now turning [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're still so close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we are all of us, yes Um-hum, except she passed away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh wow, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At [AGE] from the um DVT—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, deep vein thrombosis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Poor thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her mother passed away a week before that, her nephew after that, um, oh it's so sad—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if [INAUDIBLE] just whatever, but anyway—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [PATIENT NAME] I'm so sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh so a friend of mine came over today which is the one I was telling you knows her cousin, I haven't seen her in a couple of years, she stopped in, she saw my dad, she hugged him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Your father looks wonderful."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You take such good care of him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh well I don't, we both do.  I can't say—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You help keep his spirits up and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, he gets mad if I cook too much for him and I make homemade dinners every day for [NAME OTHER] cause I work, you know he works so hard and uh like I'll give him a sandwich on a Saturday, he keeps himself very active, he does puzzles, he goes out for his walks, so say, he says Sunday's I leave.  Well Monday I had made a big pot of beef stew and I made this like beef [INAUDIBLE] mashed potatoes with brown meat and rice in it over you know thickened gravy.  So I gave him that and then I gave him the beef stew and then he wouldn't talk to me after that, and I'm like, it's not that he wouldn't talk to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are trying to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's dinner, he doesn't eat all day long, he doesn't eat, and he eats pretty much dinner, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my mother [INAUDIBLE] healthy every single day so my sister came over the day of the election and you know she's like [PATIENT NAME] [PATIENT NAME] and then she said did you Barrack Obama, I'm like yes you know I did and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We didn't think my father was going to and we said who did you vote, she said you voted for McCain didn't you, and she, he said no, I didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said I voted for Obama and Biden.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That speaks volumes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well he doesn't like Palin and I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, now don't get into politics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and Biden is a 30 year Senator, see I can talk to this one and her husband very um intelligently about these things because the other sister says who's Biden?  I said are you kidding me, you're from [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you're asking me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's from [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who our 30 year senator who's next to your state is, but yet, oh she was cute during her speech.  I said what does cute have to do with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She has no experience, he only picked her to get the women vote like look at the situation we've been in, in 8 years, do you have any common sense, like we do need a change so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's one X chrome, 2 X chromosomes is not enough to get every woman to think she's great [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No exactly, Hillary Clinton, I voted or her because she had experience and she had her husband behind her [INAUDIBLE].  And we did good then, and everybody, I don't care if you're republican or not, this man has come so far cause I didn't know who I was going to vote for to begin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But what</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes he is.  And he's in great health except he smokes but he's trying to quit that, he chews the gum all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He reminds me of Kennedy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He reminds me of Clinton.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very much so, the way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little bit of both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's, and Kennedy, they way he speaks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eloquent</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Went to Harvard, he's scholarly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's not all black, if people want to say that you know what I mean.  My father was raised—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're probably all mongrels when you get down to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My father was raised in a very prejudice family, you know what, but I get, tell you what, guess what when it comes down to the economy, your children and your grandchildren and who you have to feel for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who you going to vote for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm [INAUDIBLE] impressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The middle class people, even my sister makes over $200,000, it didn't stop her from voting because she's got 3 children and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You don't now, you don't want to end up in a third world country or no funding from the government—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or a privatizing this or no social security, so he's got a long road ahead and like [NAME OTHER] said, keep him in your prayers and wish him good will—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he seems like he's ready for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's smart, he can delegate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No one person can do all this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes he is, and he's my sign, a Leo, and I do believe that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Leo's a good sign.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and that's what Bill Clinton was, and I do believe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're go getters, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, and I do believe that so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's neat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's my story for today, I'm not very depressed lately.  I'm more, I can't say I'm not depressed, I'm more so worried about my friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And just coping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm just trying to count my blessings at the same time, you know what I mean, that I still have my dad you know and my sons are okay, or because you don't know what's going to happen in a moment, you don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] two girls, these are two friends out of nowhere in the same week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like, what, what?  You know I'm like, no, no, no, no, wait a minute, come on, and it's like, and then she's trying to tell me.  I said [NAME OTHER] we're not 60 and 65, where you can hear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's too young in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that is too, cause my mother died at [AGE], thank you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING] that's too young yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My father's [AGE] and it's, but [AGE] is, you're in the prime of your life come on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know I'm waiting to hear the prognosis and I'm just praying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope it's good news.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is being so positive they are not thinking any other way, the hospital is telling her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That makes a big difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, to think that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she does go to [DEIDENTIFIED], which is my favorite hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes it's a good one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But uh, it's a great hospital.  So that's it [PHYSICIAN NAME] I'm just here for my medication and to tell you I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm so sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not um, you know, I'm more worried about other people right now than myself so, I'll put it to you that way.  You know I could get down and I, I really ever since my um nephew committed suicide last year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well that changed my head from trying it when I was thinking that way cause I lost [PHYSICIAN NAME] and I thought oh my God I had all of them symptoms for so many months on, on end for a couple years.  And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I just touch wood that I don't even go really that far any more to think that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So happy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So life is just a little too precious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah you have your moments and you do get down so bad, mine is when the mania, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mm—hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] my father, all right, all right, all right.  My sister, [NAME OTHER] come, I said don't you know who I take after yet, my mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh we found a good balance now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a nice balance of the medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not having problems with the weight issues with some of the other mood stabilizers—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No and my sister's daughter moved out, so that's a big uh thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that, that interference, every day and that pressure—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That negativity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes that's helping, yes it's, because I've learned to, you know she, and she got a new job because they had let her go because of her personal business, but some guy hired her cause she has great work ethic.  So she can't make very many phone calls from work, that helps me a whole, whole lot and I've learned that by not talking to her as much about her daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See we almost had an argument over Thanksgiving and my father said you still have a turkey downstairs because [NAME OTHER] brings one home free every year and that to me meant he doesn't want to travel to Jersey, you know he wants to stay home—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and I will, I'll invite my son and he just got engaged.  I'll invite my brother who lives a mile away, and the other one's go to their in—laws and my sister's going to her in—laws for the first time, so you know that was it.  She said I don't care who you cook for [PATIENT NAME] really I don't care, I'm easy going.  I know she cared but you know, it's just the way it is.  Sometimes you have to set limits—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm trying to do that so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What you want to do is spend precious time with your loved ones and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Make that as positive a time as you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's right, that's right.  I don't want to hear the negative about her daughter, I do listen to her to a certain extent—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mm—hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I say look, I have to do something like or I'm in the middle of something or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what or something, and then it's, or she says to me "oh my boss is", okay good, bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the other job she would sit there for hours on end and that's all I would hear—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yikes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would feel obligated and she would drive me crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean just because it dominates her life doesn't mean it has to dominate yours too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly, you know and I understand the other sister just doesn't even get into the middle of it and she, she, you know she's not very close to her anymore and that's the exact reason why, but you know, there's more important things in life, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I came in here telling you about, that people our age need to worry about and send this stupid stuff that my niece is coming up with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, so that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I hope I helped [INAUDIBLE] thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you, yes.  We'll work on uh improving communication across the board.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I heard [INAUDIBLE] cuts for the city today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but I don't think we're affected here cause it, [INAUDIBLE] I'm thinking oh I hope it doesn't take away, it's more for city workers for like no snow plower mover, no bulk, um, 2 fire stations he's eliminating or 7—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thos are tough decisions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My brother is a captain of a fireman, no overtime for cops but he's, yeah he's got an 800 uh, 800,000 to a million dollar mark to make up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So what he's cutting, I happen to have to agree that it's not as an, 200 city workers are getting uh laid off, that's not 2,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So in the overall perspective of it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do think what he's cutting, like he says isn't as major to us as it could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you know everybody has to sacrifice, we're in an economic crisis, we're dire all over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He and Obama are have a lot in common [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly, and he said, at one point he said he would ask Obama, I didn't hear what he said, four something, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, maybe some kind of aid or something, I don't know, but I did hear that part of it but I was getting ready to come here so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But um, boy he's got his hands full, Obama.  But you know what they had a psychologist that night who said he looks like he's up for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, he does, if you go grey it's because it age, it doesn't necessarily mean that he can't handle the stress because he said he looks just by the way he came out and made the, he knows what he's up against and he's ready for it.  He knows it's not going to be easy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He knows he's going to have to take on a whole lot, he, the man's not stupid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And to have that kind of self possession the day after his grandmother died.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you know what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was blown away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I said that to my dad, isn't that such a coincidence, [NAME OTHER] died, we win the World Series, now Obama's grandmother died—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they did count her vote too for her grandson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Awe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause he did go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He went and visited her, remember he took two days off because you know why, he didn't do it with his own mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He didn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was, I think he was too busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know that he didn't, maybe it came on sudden.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Talk about a life lesson.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and he said I'm not going to repeat that mistake twice, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I would have thought she might have made it to the election but I think she just couldn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no apparently—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's only so much the human body can do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, she had to be [INAUDIBLE] and I'm sure she was very ill or she would have, you know what I mean, so, yeah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean for her to pass away like that, just like you know, I mean.  I'm sure she was probably up there in her 70s or 80s too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bless her heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep, yep but, what she did say to him is she was satisfied at how they all turned out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she knew he was running for president.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think she, if she was even lucid in the last couple weeks, she had to know he was leading in all the polls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and just to know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Amazing.  And it didn't matter to her, you know he was a success anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I don't think so, that's right.  Raising him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What really matters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right, that's right.  Because I feel that way about my son—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	President or not, he is married—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's smart, he's got common sense and he's still, and he loves me, never disrespects me and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so.  So I have to look at the good things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Instead of going on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's what your friends would want you to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be there for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be praying for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be rooting for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh well I have been praying for even my sisters neighbor ungodly every single day, for her to just, and she is um uh improving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's not like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he, the doctor told her husband there's only been 2 other cases he was ever optimistic with this kind of injury—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh thank goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like I did have a friend when I was younger and she had the same kind of accident and she, it was 3 months before she came out of the coma.  She had to relearn to walk.  [INAUDIBLE] she's fine now, but it</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Took maybe a year and I don't know the extent of [NAME OTHER] brain injury, they said the front, the ability to do math, the personality, that part was um and but it's a day to day thing.  But she can hear, she's responding like at least to some kind of stimuli so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the brain has amazing regenerating powers—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We never even realize.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right and I think she's a little you know, it's only 2 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So give it 3 months and then I think, but she may improve whole, wholly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, like that's what I'm hoping for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hope so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm hoping my friend gets the best prognosis, I don't want them to say like it didn't work or, cause the only thing that has me worried.  I went to college and took medical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I switched over because at the time I was thinking bed pans [INAUDIBLE], I never thought of like lab technician or anything.  And I switched over to business.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doctor [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I, I mean I do know, if you're in Stage IV and it's metastasized, it's not good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not good, but not insurmountable either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, what I hope, now it shrunk a lot, one, one friend told me it only shrank a little  but the one who's very close to her, and named her daughter after her, [NAME OTHER] told me you know, she said um [NAME OTHER] it did shrink a lot.  So and she's another one, my friend [NAME OTHER] is so positive in thinking you know like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's such a positive thinker which is why I enjoy talking to her so, she never gets a word in edge wise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She loves me to death anyway and I do her too.  But I'm just hoping that within the next month I hear something good out of her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh I hope so too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know that maybe they can operate and take it, I don't like that it's wrapped around an organ is what I think she said, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They can shrink it down enough though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I, and this is, she said it shrunk so I hope you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I got to get to the gynecologist because I waited 4 years and then I went last, last night, so I have to go now cause he said to me last time [NAME OTHER] don't wait that long ever again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, especially after hearing this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you need more Zantacs as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I still have the other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my sister quit and she put on 20 pounds, she was 102, 104 pounds at 5' 6", she now weighs 120 some, everybody—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At 5' 6", I'm jealous [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my friend [NAME OTHER] who I'm talking about is like 102 pounds and she's 5'.  My sisters 5'6", she looked skeletal.  But she quit smoking, her daughter moved out and she now weighs 124, she said [PATIENT NAME] I haven't weighed that since I was pregnant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's very reasonable for her height.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, well she's always, my, my father's a very thin man, we all come from a very thin family, except me and my mother have the broader you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're in good shape though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well yeah, I, I do my bike and  my brother—in—law bought me a beautiful, really, really nice one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really pays off.</p>

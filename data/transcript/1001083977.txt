<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is the first time I've ever been late.  I got on the, uh, the turnpike and, um, they were doing construction and it came to two lanes so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, where'd you park?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, that was the easy part once you got here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Most people find that the hard part.  With my [DEIDENTIFIED] folks, it's the traffic.  What do you take, the turnpike up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  [INAUDIBLE].  There was some [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I saw you [DATE].  Your husband was sick.  Uh, you nursed him back to health.  Your energy was low, you were sleeping eight hours.  Your appetite was fine.  Your weight was okay.  [INAUDIBLE] was fine.  No suicidal thinking, helpless or hopeless.  A little bit hopeless.  Not helpless.  Not sad, getting pleasure.  Your blood pressure was 148/90, pulse was 67.  We were question marking whether or not you were relapsing at that point.  Um, you were oversleeping and overeating and we thought maybe if we cranked up the Wellbutrin a touch, we could rope it in.  So you did that, correct?  Do you think it helped?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do think it - it helped everything except my fatigue.  I mean, my mood was a lot better -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you moved it, it was at 450 of Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And I also felt a lot calmer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's unusual because, um, Wellbutrin has a reputation of kinda activating and energizing, not energizing, activating and agitating.  However, when depression is giving people anxiety problems, just lifting the mood, calms things down.    Even though it's Wellbutrin.  Does that make sense to you somewhat?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because I've got the same problems, but I just felt -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It wasn't as -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Calmer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Overwhelming.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your mood over the last two months is decent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your anxiety is under good control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you irritable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, most of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What gets you angry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your husband's health problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, are you angry at anyone besides your husband?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Only him.  We've localized the tumor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been working on my key problems and, um, I told my intern who works for me, she likes to check my blood every so often and she's kind of at a loss as to what to do about it, but she suggested that I get a sleep study done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I said a sleep study?  Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's talk a little bit.  That not a terrible idea.  Because daytime fatigue, I mean, if it's not depression, daytime fatigue is often about lack of restful sleep or restorative sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's exactly what she said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, she said, yknow, thin people can get sleep apnea, too, not just overweight people.  I never heard of that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have sleep apnea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anyway, but, it was funny, I was discussing it with my husband and I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He has apnea?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He must, but he's never done anything about it.  But, eh, he knows that I take two Tylenol PM before - I had a flare up of my back pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is okay now.  And he said to me, um, well, when do you take it and I said right before I go to bed.  He said maybe that's why you're falling asleep over breakfast because it's still in you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly, he's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, I said I never thought about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two of them is a big dose of Benadryl.  I mean, what's in Tylenol PM is Benadryl.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And for me, it knocks me out.  It makes me groggy the next day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I, I am constantly nodding off over breakfast.  Sometimes after lunch I have to lie down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why are you on Tylenol PM?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I had a flare up of my back and I was just going down -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why not regular Tylenol?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pardon?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why not regular Tylenol?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I was taking it at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Usually, Tylenol PM is to help people sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And I do sleep very well.  Um, but now, I'm gonna wean myself off it and see what happens.  I only took one last night and, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you can take the Tylenol without the PM part.  You know, just regular Tylenol.  The PM part is Benadryl, it's an antihistamine that knocks people out.  Just take regular Tylenol if you're having pain.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That has no PM.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just think that, that -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's right.  I mean, it might very well could be, uh -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because he said to me, he's had a problem with his elbow and he has had really - I don't take it before I go to bed.  I take it a couple of hours before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  How's your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And your energy.  Once, once you do shake yourself awake, let's say by noon -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, your energy's fine.  It's just morning fatigue you're having.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most of the time, yeah.  Although, I, I find that I can get a little groggy in the afternoon.  If I can lie down for twenty minutes -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you nap a little bit?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've never done that, but I find that it really refreshes -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you drink coffee?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Only decaf.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the thyroid, someone's checked your thyroid recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, my primary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right and it's very hard to follow, um, thyroid function tests because of the two different thyroids you're on.  It distorts the test.  You can't follow it.  But, you can follow the TSH.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's just one of those numbers and if that's very, very low, that's what we want.  We want to be, you want to be on enough thyroid to suppress the TSH.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  Well, she wrote for that for my next -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just TSH.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Prescription.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because the other, yknow, the other is uninterpretable.  Because you're on T3, you're on Cytomel plus Synthroid.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, the numbers don't -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, one of the things that was concerning me, or was concerning her, is because, um, my, my, uh, cholesterol was 180, that was about six months ago, and then, then, she likes me to have a blood test every three months.  And it was 209 and she was very upset, she said.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Had you, was it fasting?  Was it fasting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I always take it fasting.  Um, so she said, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Gosh, she's really keeping an eye on you.  Whoa.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Stop eating cheese.  I said cheese is one of my favorite things.  I said I'll stop eating cheese.  I didn't stop [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Before you do anything, repeat the test.  If it's of any concern, repeat it first.  Because that's within the, yknow -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I just had another blood test, um, and my cholesterol was 223.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, you're gonna have to worry about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But my HDLs are 91.  Which are good.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So now, she wants -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you exercise?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I tried, but I've had a big problem.  It's this thing that I haven't done as much as I should do, but I'm starting back now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Listen, those numbers are not out of control numbers, but she's right to keep an eye on them and if you can't do it with diet, then medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know, but I never had that problem before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your self esteem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you getting along okay with your husband?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, yes, for the most part.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How is his health?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Worse, or about the same?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it just hasn't been a good year, since January.  He is so thin now, that he could just hit his arm against something -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And bruise, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And also, he had gone back to the plastic surgeon.  For almost a year and a half, his ankle has not healed.  The plastic surgeon wants to do yet [INAUDIBLE] heal.  He said it's the only things, there's no guarantees, but, so, um, I don't know.  We're so limited.  I mean, we can go to the movies and go out dinner.  That's about it.  If he has to walk more than a few yards, he's in pain, which, um, which distresses me because I was led to believe from the vascular surgeon that he was gonna be 110 after he had this done and when I question - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They always lie.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm telling you.  When I questioned him, he says to me, well, yknow, when he came in the hospital, we didn't think we were gonna be able to save his right foot.  I said well, all right, but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, yknow, they lie to get you to do the surgery.  It was probably a good thing -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That you did the surgery and they had to talk you into it.  So, you know, they, they over promise.  It's a bad thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's, it's bad, yknow.  I mean, it's better than strokes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's better than a few other things, but it's not good.  I don't even want to -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know it is, I mean we got through it, it's, it's, yknow, I mean, he can hardly walk, I have to hold his hand all the time now because he can't balance himself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Is he still working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does he go to work or he works from home?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He goes to his office for a couple days a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can't he work also from home anyway?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He can, but all his files are in his office and, um, if he stays home, he feels that he wastes time waiting for a call from somebody.  But if he's in the office, he can always do something else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Frankly, as long as he can go -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get him out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I want him to go.  Because, if he stops working, he's gonna die.  You know him, he doesn't have any interests, he doesn't have any hobbies.  He just likes what he does.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and he's, he's good on the phone?  He's still engages normally.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He must, I imagine, have to chat a lot and charm people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Well, it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?  Business is getting tougher and tougher.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's terrible, yeah, so it's a lot of long term care.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Something called [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know what it is, but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's paying someone to die, or betting on -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's the, uh, he gets an injection it's always that somebody's gonna be out to kill me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Um, so he sells those policies?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that requires a lot of explaining.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It does and it doesn't.  Um, sometimes people think it's a great idea because you're gonna get a fistful of cash.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It gets them on it right now.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The people who give those policies, they just buy a thousand of them, they buy a huge amount of them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they average it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know how they do it, but, um, what [NAME OTHER] tried to do is get people, who - they have to be over seventy and they have to be in not very good health.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, he's having trouble getting a policy for somebody now because the guy has a really long life span [INAUDIBLE] from the insurance, but, um, the one he just did, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You would think they'd want to insure someone who -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's the [DEIDENTIFIED] people who don't want them because they're gonna live too long, but the insurance people want someone whose healthy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  But it doesn't work that way with [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's the investors who buy these policies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  And the investors want someone to have a short life span.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.  Probably.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Horrible. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't get involved in that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's like, uh -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I know that we're supposed to get a very big check this week or the following week -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Commissions are big on the [DEIDENTIFIED] for him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, very big.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why is that?  Why is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The commission comes from the investment people, not from the insurance people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Depends what they're, they're offering for the policy, like, they can order - offer something like a hundred thousand dollars and I think it's spread around a lot of investors.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, depending on that, um, that's, that determines the share that the client gets and the share that [NAME OTHER] gets.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, we're supposed to get a check for seventy thousand dollars this week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For one of these things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For one case.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.  And are those negotiated with person who buys the [DEIDENTIFIED], or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, [NAME OTHER] has people that he, he -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or it's [INAUDIBLE] that -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He gives somebody the situation and they, what they call, they put it out for bid, um, the policy, and they look at the individual and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, wow, it's that specific.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For one, one [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's interesting.  I'm surprised he doesn't have you on the phone trying to sell these things to people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, boy.  I'm good at selling, if -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sure you are.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I work in retail.  Because then people come to me.  But for me to pick up a phone and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cold call.  No, you're not a cold call, but yknow, your friends, yknow, if the commissions are that good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I, I'm, I think I'm starting a new job next week.  I say a job.  But my jobs are all very flexible and part time, but I thought the concept was so interesting.  I'm gonna be [DEIDENTIFIED].  Pretty ideal when I thought about it.  Not exactly in my area, but the guy that's hiring me is gonna pay all my travel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Will it be a one on one or a group? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it will probably be [DEIDENTIFIED] about ten people at a [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, I'm waiting to receive some information on it.  But, I'm trying to learn a lot of -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right, mortgage.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I thought this was really challenging.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Closing costs, uh, yknow, down payment.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, um, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very nice.  It could be great. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it wouldn't be - but they're paying you by the hour, yknow they're -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're paying me, um, they're paying me, um, two hundred seventy five dollars for every eight hours, and plus with the travel expenses.  It worked out to something like forty four dollars an hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it'll be fun, hopefully.  Um - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I think it will be, yeah.  Not as much fun as teaching the three, four and five year olds, but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you ever get closure on that whole issue with them, you know, the guy who advertised for your job and all that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You never figured out what happened?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  Well, he, he, - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right from the beginning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  He, first of all, he was paying me twenty dollars an hour, which is a normal tutoring rate.  Sometimes it's twenty five.  I've gotten twenty five.  Um, and I remembered him telling me that I would be getting that, but the money part bothered him and so he -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And he found someone to do it for fifteen an hour.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know if he did or not because, um, um, one of the kids in the kindergarten there that I taught, I happened to see her in a play, this little kid.  I was talking to the mother yesterday and I said how did the new Spanish teacher work out and she said, um, very vague, and then once I had called there and talked to um, actually the person who was the office manager and I said oh, well, how's your new Spanish teacher working out.  She said oh, I don't know anything about that.  Well, that's a lot of baloney.  She knows everything that goes on there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Mum's the word.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just felt, you know -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They didn't want to talk to you about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think your husband's probably right.  Um, all right.  So, we're gonna continue the Wellbutrin -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At 450.  That's a winner.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We're gonna continue the Paxil at 37.5.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> T3 and T4 you'll maintain the thyroid doses -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The way they are.  And the fatigue, we're gonna hope gets better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I, I think your husband's probably right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's the Benadryl part of the Tylenol PM that's making you so groggy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Take just regular Tylenol with no PM.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I don't think you'll need something to sleep, but if you do need something to sleep, I can give you something else that's shorter acting, yknow, it won't carry over into the morning.  I'd prefer you not use a sleep medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I only use a sleep medicine when we go up to the [DEIDENTIFIED] every year.  And I've always used Restoril because I never had, I never woke up in the morning -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Restoril's good because it's short acting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  But it's no longer available.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've prescribed it, yeah.  Why is it no longer available?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I told that it had been discontinued.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  I've got people on Restoril, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You want some?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  I always keep it just for when I go away.  Otherwise, I don't take it.  I always have -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um.  I'm not sure what it's called, Temazepam, but I'll write it as Restoril.  Who told you it's not available?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think my pharmacy.  And I got the generic of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't used it yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you don't need a prescription?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not for that.  I'm just hoping that the generic is gonna be okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the generic's the same as the regular.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, but Temazepam is Restoril, it's the same thing.  When you need more of it, just let me know, and I'll give it to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now the Wellbutrin, you had been on the XL.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then we raised it to 450.  Are you taking the XL or the SR?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it's the XL.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you take three of the XL?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take one 300 mg and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And one of the 150.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 150.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why do you do it that way?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because you told me to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But then you need two prescriptions, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want to just to go to three of the 150?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'd like to use up what I have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Use up what you have but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I have refills on it, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the dose is 450, however you do it.  Either three of the 150s or 300 plus 150.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a bit of a hassle two, two different prescriptions, the 300 and 150 because sometimes the insurance will see that you're getting two Wellbutrins and they'll not allow, not let you have the second one.  So usually, I just write for three of the 150s.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As one prescription.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But use up what you have.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can just call me and we can call the pharmacy.  So, let me not give you one now until you, you need it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, you'll give me one, one of the three -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Three a day of the 150s, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, um, you're on the control release Paxil and you seem to like that, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You like that better than regular Paxil?  Have you ever taken the regular?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And this beats it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe it's the fact that I take it at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some people, yknow, there was a time when you couldn't get the controlled release and so everyone went back to regular Paxil.  A lot of people who just, yknow - you were probably on -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was on regular Paxil.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  But there was a time when Paxil CR had some, uh, problem with distribution or whatever and you couldn't get it, so everyone had to go back to regular and the people that really liked the CR, they went back to the CR.  The people who it didn't matter, stayed on the generic regular Paxil.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, what's the difference between them?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a controlled release formulation of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You mean -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The [INAUDIBLE] is about equivalent to 30 of regular Paxil, which you can get generically.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But this, you can't get generically, but it's, it's kind of a slow, steady release.  It, for some people, it's much better.  And it sounds like you may be one of them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I like it.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  And we can call those in whenever you need it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You look great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, psychiatrically, you're a peach.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  No, I really feel - I feel good most of the time.  I'm just very happy that I can get back to tennis.  I can't exercise, I play tennis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  I'll see you in a couple months?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  Two, three, what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two months is fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, take care.  Call me if there's any problem. </p>

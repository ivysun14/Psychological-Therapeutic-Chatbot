<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like at the end of the week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah Friday. Having to do... Like I've had some (inaudible at 00:00:09) on Friday. Which means that getting ready for the change between that is going to ... Me getting how many people are ready to be trained on how to do what they need to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And then it just must be a madhouse like Friday and for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't usually work Fridays but I work all launches, so... Yeah. I don't mind that so much. Though it's exhausting and physically very taxing, it is usually very happy and the customers are usually in a good mood so it makes it very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That helps.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A happy crowd is so much better than an angry crowd. But it just, you know, it's a lot to have to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Technically not that exciting but nothing really like the Microsoft when you're just working like crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it a lot more hours for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will be a lot more hours. Yeah. Even this week. Like this Tuesday I went to work at 8 and left at 10 at night. So yeah. It's a long day. Now most of it was not actually dealing with front-facing customers. It was until about 1 p.m. and then I had to go and write a bunch of documents and then I had to go to this ridiculous meeting. But it's just still a really long day and physically very hard on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's as many hours as you usually work in a week, right/</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. Pretty much. I could have gone home, the thing is I had stuff I needed to get done. I'm still behind on things I need to get done. But on top of it, it's just going all the way back out to Hanover and then coming back out just seemed like a tremendous waste of time, so... [00:02:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are we on next Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next Tuesday and next Thursday are, as far I know, we're on. So I think I might need it. Tuesday it depends. I'm pretty darn certain I'm not going to be there late that day, though. I am in the process of trying to... Trying to empower certain people to make decisions so I don't have to make them for them. And it is, unfortunately, too hard for them to understand this concept. Apparently this is something that is really common to only children, realizing that you can make up the rules as you go along and it's fine. Like there's some basic things you can do and then after that if there's no real detail you can just do what you want. And part of it's like that. I went to a Waldorf school so a lot of my curriculum for a long time was what I wanted to do. And so this concept of, "Okay so we're going to make a class. What do you want?" "What do you want it to be?" "Okay we need to have, in order be able to promote it properly we need to have by the 15<sup>th</sup> of the month and not before. I'd really like if you didn't invite any customers. If you want to do a dry run that's great, and I'll be happy to mentor you with any questions, but I'm not making these choices for you. You need to make them for yourselves."</p>

<p>And most people are unable to really do that. And so, it's like, "Well I have resources that you can contact, but I would really prefer for me to teach you how to get these resources." Like at my old store we ran a brain-storming session which is that electrics thing with the computer event. I contacted a company and they overnighted us a tremendous amount of equipment, and helped us promote the event in Raleigh. It was partially — and then because I had an associate from Brown's computer science research department, I had people from Brown's research Institute there to say that, although this is for kids, that before they make anything they do it with blocks first because it's cheaper. Kids love that. I mean I don't want them to repeat this. I want them to understand that you can make these, you know, say "Do you think this is out of line?" or "This is that." I want them to be able to think on their own. And breaking these barriers of, "Oh well why don't I e-mail somebody at a corporate blocks company to see if they'll send up a bunch of games of something like that?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think for themselves? [00:04:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Think creatively. And so it's been kind of a struggle to really get them to think outside of their box and do it. But I think I'm slowly... I got one person sort of thinking about it, and that's something. But it's very hard for me because I spent so much of my life around... Now mind you, I did sort of make a career out of that in the event industry, of trying to think outside the box. And I understand that the people because of their age and the time of their lives, that they weren't in that very flexible point. But these people are younger than I am. That's different. This is the point where you take risks. It's very foreign to me not to have somebody who's going to take risks, do something interesting. But it's a process. So... [00:06:00]</p>

<p>But it has just been...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does that leave on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I measure that part of the reason you are trying to push some of the people who work with you to take more initiative and think more creatively is so you don't have to deal with as much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Partially. Partially I want to catch the imagination of management to see that I've created a culture of people who can do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my hope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That's more the... It sounds like it's as important or more important than offloading stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I'm running a, 'How to borrow library books on your device,' thing. Primarily the reason why I'm doing it is just so that people can see that it can, see what it looks like. I want them to see what something can look like. It's not even all that innovative because I didn't want to take away the spotlight from other people, and it's also supposed to be like National Library Month, so I figured that was okay. But I wanted to really give them the chance to really try it themselves. Part of it is taking... It's actually really more about catching the imagination, seeing that I can make things happen. I do things unorthodox but at the same time I get really good results usually. But part of it is just getting certain people comfortable with it. Some people are more comfortable than others at breaking limits and trying to make classes. [00:07:42]</p>

<p>They don't see it as, 'The world, Microsoft isn't making a cent off of this, why in the world are we doing this?" And getting them to get the idea that, you know, I've met the people who've developed this whole program. I was part of the original people who developed this program. That Microsoft is supposed to be the equivalent of a science center where you get to buy the exhibits. These things do not actually have to... Very little of what we do has to have any financial utility. It is getting people in there and getting people comfortable, is what's really important. It's a community resource. And so that is actually also very difficult. Getting people to see it as not monetizing it. Because the money will come eventually, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Microsoft's doing pretty well in that department as it is. [00:08:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that's been an interesting struggle. Part of it's also when I'm not feeling well it is very difficult for me. Like last week I was in so much agony. It's really, really hard to be as buoyant in terms of personality as I really am. And I tend to sometimes take the easy route or something. Instead of encouraging someone else to do something on their own, or trying to pick everybody else's mood up, I will just go and do something and just get it done. But that I dislike about myself, but at the same time I know that it's sort of a defense mechanism. If I'm not feeling well and I get put under the gun I can get a little bit short tempered. And so by just taking care of it, that keeps me from snapping at somebody. [00:09:29]</p>

<p>I wish there was a way that I could control that, but I don't really know how. I spend so much of my time keeping my negative emotions in check at my job anyways, that I think that's going to be a lot to deal with, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (inaudible at 00:09:51) that you keep in check this often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well you know, I'm not really that bad but it's just a lot of it. Are we doing this occasionally. Primarily just dealing with customers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Like? [00:10:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every single time something goes or happens that is unexpected on a computer, a significant number of customers that that — they've decided that they've gotten a virus. And there are things you can and cannot say or do. And sometimes I just want to be like, "I don't know how in the world you got into your car and drove all the way over here if you honestly think this is... Like how in the world are you surviving in the world if you honestly believe that aliens are stealing your e-mail?" (laughter) That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is not like the few things that punctuate your year, this is... I mean I only work like 12 hours a week on the floor, I see maybe 10 people a week and at least two of them have some sort of completely off-the-wall belief system. And I have to hold this in check and say, "Okay, you can either be right or we can get something done. Which would you prefer?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you have to hold this back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Annoyance, my anger, my — I have to be patient. I have to do this stuff all the time. Yeah. Even when I'm in pain. Like usually I get people who say things to me like, you know, that are really uncharitable. I'm not really sure why it is that a lot of people feel as if it's their business to comment on things that is none of their business. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're very good at everything like dealing with customers or like people coming into the store when they're being assholes. [00:11:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's an awful lot of them though that they've gotten to the age where whatever part of their brain keeps them from saying whatever they want to say, that regulator is just gone. For example, "I can't believe you've gotten that fat and you haven't had babies yet."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's awful. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you deal with that? Really awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to intellectualize and realize that this person's in their 80s and they don't really have that part of their brain anymore that keeps them from saying things that they think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that keeps you from...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saying anything terrible to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does it actually hurt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. (pause) I mean in my own head I rationalize the fact that I could, I am really good if I've decided to do something, to actually make it happen. And I will always be smart, even if my own brain starts having problems, which it does, I will always be brilliant. They could never become smart, but they could lose weight. One of them is a matter of control, one of them is a matter of a natural talent. There is no surgery that makes somebody get smarter. There is no way that they can make themselves... So I sort of have to somehow think in my head, "Well, you know..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're going through some major mental gymnastics to, I guess, distance yourself from how much it hurts when somebody says something so terrible. Because, for whatever reason. [00:13:45 ]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. (pause) For the most part it's not directed at me that does happen, that's probably every other week probably I get something that's directly mean to me. Like that I'm eating myself into my grave, or something equivalent like that. Usually at some point I explain to them that I have an incurable disease and that I... Which is none of their fucking business. And that I've been on steroids forever and I'm actually not naturally this heavy. But it depends on the person, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But most of time it's just, it's honest to god it's just crazy. It's the nuts people. The people who think that aliens are deleting their e-mail, kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So more like... That's not, that's just wacky.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least every other day someone's decided they have a virus. What actually happens is somebody in their household's looking at porn. So I have worked out with a couple of people the appropriate way to say to them. We ask of them if they've had a teenager in the house. And then we explain to them, it's not their son, but one of their sons' friends has done this and he's so embarrassed that he won't even tell the son. Which actually is fine because he's actually a good kid, he's embarrassed. So we blame it on some amorphous friend, than the son.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Yeah. That's pretty clever. [00:15:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's the only...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can't start telling them just like that. Anybody that's paranoid, you're just a couple of sentences away from them deciding that you've done something to them. Seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I may have run into that once or twice. (laughter) [00:15:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's always like the people who think someone's spying on them or whatever, you have to be very careful. You have to make sure you don't go out of the way to be too helpful. Because one thing is they'll cling onto you like crazy, but the second thing is that they decide that you're doing this to them too. And that's about every other day where you have something like that. That seems to be the most innocuous way to feel better, is they realize that some friend of their sons' who would never admit it because he's too embarrassed to admit it, especially to his friend. That makes it so much easier than saying, "I'm really sorry but you son was curious." [00:16:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is none of my business to have to explain either, but it's ... The world of technology is a lot more complicated than most people realize. Especially when it comes to teaching people things. There are an awful lot of people who are lonely, who come in just because... I mean they have nothing they want to do. They just don't have anybody else in their lives. And so they come in and they stare at you. Some of them are being forced by family members to learn the computer, though they have no interest in it. That's the worst to me. But, of all the people who are mean in this net, I really feel that in some way they actually really want to be there and they want to get something out of it. Sort of, they're just misguided. The people who really don't want to be there and their forced to be there is the worst because there is nothing you can do to make them happy. And it's not your fault. And so you spend the next hour with them trying to bide the time by doing something. Finding out that they like Needlepoint. And then we looked under Google image search for an hour of different pictures of Needlepoint or something. It's just... It's rough. [00:17:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean like they'd be like there to give you company?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're dropped off by their children or grandchildren for the next hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, I see. It's like babysitting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Adult babysitting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They really think that the grandma's going to like the Facebook. She has no interest in it whatsoever. It's not like she's day trading. There's nothing that, after a certain age, that you really need a computer for. What do you do? And unfortunately now that — I mean it would happen a decent amount when it first started but because of that they were getting more and more people. I mean, it's a victim of our own success. And so it's hard. And the worst part is, the people that are meanest to me are the people who want me back, just me. That's the thing that kills me. Is if I honestly think that someone's going to actually write a letter saying what a terrible person I am and they're like, "I only want to work with you." And I'm like, "Sorry we can't do that, lots of regulations about that kind of thing." But it just cracks me up because I don't know if they're just realizing they can push me around, or if they actually really like me they're just not any good at expressing that they like working with somebody like that. So it's rough, it's really rough.</p>

<p>But luckily I will be out of that. When we have our launch I don't have to do any of that for a while, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do the training. [00:19:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I train the people there and then usually what happens is that I end up showing people some basics about what they need to know and then getting them to arrange for... getting them to get transferred. That kind of stuff. So that is good. Teaching them words that they don't know right now. That kind of stuff. But it's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you do work pretty hard to compartmentalize, sweep under the rug, keep at bay, how emotionally painful this can all be. Partly because it hurts, and partly because you really don't like being or feeling negative, I think. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, and quite frankly I've been lonely before. I've had a point where I've had physical limitations that have bothered me. And when people made me feel good about it was nice. And so I'm just sort of paying it back, paying it forward for the future. I don't know. Just because I don't like them doesn't mean that they don't necessarily deserve to be treated with respect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know there's a lot of cultural differences that are, from region to region, what is considered to be irrespectful (sp) or not respectful. And, you know, that's... There are an awful people I teach who take notes because they think that that's the way that you show that you respect their teacher. If they can't read their notes, they're not paying particular attention to whatever you're saying, but that was what they were taught to do. You have all of our rituals.</p>

<p>So it's rough. I would like to, if I could simply pick and choose who I taught all the time that would be great, but my market is primarily skews older, where I am right now. [00:21:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well I guess this possibility of a job would change all that, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd probably only have to do it 12 hours a month instead of 12 hours a week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Big difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really important to keep in there to see what's changing and the trends. And I think I've expressed before that for every time that I want to literally go home and start drinking after working, I have one person who has totally made my day because of the fact that I've changed their lives. Like the underwear model running an underwear company who... That's the kind of stuff that like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it sounds like that was pretty fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was nice because it was such — it was nice to have been the person who didn't give up on her. There are lots of people who gave up on her. And she's bright, she's uneducated. She apparently also wrote a really nice letter to the store too. I haven't seen it yet, but I just got an e-mail about it. But that was nice. The thing is, and I think is the number one thing why, the reason why alcoholism is so rampant amongst Microsoft trainers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. Like, quite literally, there's always. I was shocked when I went to one store and found out there was not a Microsoft bar where the people went to drink afterwards. There was only one of them. I was trying... When I was leaving and like, "Hey, where is the bar that you guys go to?" It was like, "We don't have one." That's the only store.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It (inaudible at 00:22:58) Microsoft store. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's because it was where everybody commutes out, from the city. But there's always a place where everybody has to go and drink after work. I don't do it that much, but I see it a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get it. Yeah. Pretty much. I just don't believe in spending my money pickling my brain, but sometimes you have to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah I know, it sounds like it's very clear to you how much this could stress everybody out who has to deal with. I mean, it doesn't sound like...The type of stuff you have to put up with is unusual, but you're retail.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the thing is, and this is a positive spin I always tell people this, which is true, the reason why people have unnatural expectations is because it's Microsoft. Microsoft always breaks people's expectations. So you should be flattered that people expect you to be able to do something that you can't, and I think it is kind of true, you know. The fact that you get an wireless device and I say, "Do you have a phone?" And I come back and I take all the — you know, whatever archaic phone it was, took all the phone numbers out of that and put them in the device. They love that. These are things they don't expect that can happen, except at Microsoft. But the problem is, is that because of that there are these outrageous expectations. At the same time, there are very brands that have the kind of loyalty that it does. I mean I love Jaguar as a brand. They come out with the new convertible, I'm not pitching a tent in the front yard waiting to see it. Every time with Microsoft it happens. There are people who camp out for that, and so it is, it's a fascinating world. It's actually a lot like... There's a lot of super brands in Asia that are like that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? [00:25:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know many of them, but I've heard about it. Some of my colleagues... Because the main flagship Microsoft store is... (inaudible at 00:25:13) is like the cool, trendy area, and it borders on with that. So they see a lot of this, like the new Hello Kitty televisions coming out, so people will dress up like Hello Kitty and wait outside. So... And a lot of the people who are Microsoft employees are pretty... Because it's about half, native-born half. People from other countries are there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I think it was the store. And so it was a pretty big eye-opener to hear about stuff like that. But it is kind of interesting. I just need a break from this all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:26:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the very least, I just get excited when I have somebody to talk to that has the same interests as me, you know. Whether it be an employee or a customer that comes in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you had much of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There has been a couple of new employees that are young engineers who, after I proved to them that I knew what I was talking about, they seemed pretty darned impressed and they like to talk to me now. Which is nice. But it's pretty...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are they interested in doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well a lot of them they don't necessarily. They're 18, 19 years old. They (inaudible at 00:26:35) for these positions, as to whether they're expecting from someone. And unfortunately sometimes you have to prove yourself to them. But after that point they're interesting to talk to, but for the most part not so much. I really just need to spend some time cultivating relationships with people that are on the same intellectual level as me. Maybe not the same things, because I do like being around people who are different, I like to hear different slices of life. People who have the same general goals and interest and knowledge, that kind of stuff. Which luckily, I live in a town where that does happen. [00:27:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just need to spend some time doing that. And now that the temperature's getting warmer, I'll definitely have a lot more energy to be able to do that too. Hopefully I won't spend as much time sleeping. We'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Do you tend to feel better physically when it's warmer out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. As long as the weather... It's really a pressure-based thing as well as cold. As long as the weather's pretty clear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And the (inaudible at 00:27:55) pressure's lower, you usually sleep better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually. I used to think that was an old wives tale, but it actually isn't. But it tends to be a bit better. It depends though, but I'm just... I'm just looking forward to getting out and about, you know. Doing things. I hate winter, it's so bleak for me. So that and my husband doesn't want to admit it, but he gets very seasonal affective. It's like, I wish that I could have started gathering data in the past, but he gets very depressed during the winter time. Hopefully that will get better. [00:28:39]</p>

<p>He's been a pain in my neck lately, so I haven't really minded being at work. I'm not really sure what's been going on with him. He's been sick a lot. He hasn't really been at work that much. And for me it's been kind of a pain in the ass because, I had to tell him yesterday. I said, "You know what, every moment that I have not been working you have been home sitting right next to me. And I need some downtime — not with you because you're starting at me, you're trying to interpret things. I need you to go to work. Please, go to work."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The sort of thing like, "Get out of my face?" [00:29:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I might have said something to make him think that I thought he wasn't really sick. Before he had some sort of throat congestion sick, but I don't think it's necessarily sick. I think that because he is depressed, his threshold for feeling pain, I think that is lowered, and so it seems a lot worse than it is. Which is not the same thing as faking it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. [00:29:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's faking it. I think in some cases I think he's faking it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think if he can stay home and sit in a chair and play video games, he can go to work and sit in a chair and do work. Non-work stuff. Yeah, but... He went to work this morning, I'm pretty sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much stress has all that added for you, his being home so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. I think he thinks he's being sweet about it, though. I think honest to God in his mind, he thinks that by being near me he's being loving and attentive, as opposed to being away leaving me by myself. But sometimes I just need...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I just... It's very hard because it's like there is very little, and I hate having to say this, but there's very little about his life that I can control in any way, shape or form. Not that I wanted to, but like right now I'm convinced that he needs to figure out what's... It's not just like depression, or at least it's depression that's being fueled by something else. But I can't be that wife who calls up the doctor going, "Well what the hell is it, because I can't stand him. So go figure out what the hells' wrong with him." Makes me sound like the crazy wife. I can't like call up his therapist saying, "I don't know what he's telling you, but he hasn't been to work in two weeks." That kind of thing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:31:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's frustrating. And the thing is, is that I can only... I only go by what he tells me, and I'm pretty sure I get a lot of a filter of what he wants me to hear. Is that makes sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Specifically what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like what's he's talked to the doctor about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, I said, "I'm pretty sure he went to work. He left the house. If we were in our hometown I actually wouldn't be as sure because he would at least know where to go to kill time, but I'm not entirely... That kind of uncertainty is kind of odd. I have never had that worry about that kind of stuff. I have no idea where he is right now, he could be anywhere. And I know for a fact that he is actually, he's been able to not do as... not got to go to work as much because everyone thinks he's somewhere else. So if he could do it to other people, why could he not do it to me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. [00:32:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want to have to worry about that crap anymore, you know? I'm just grateful he's out of the house right now. I don't know where he is, I don't know what he's doing, but at least he's out of the house. Because, you know. (deep sigh)</p>

<p>He is taking everything so personally and so sensitively that it's making it so that I cannot be myself. And I am not willing to talk about things, even though it's going to bother him, you know. He already gets so defensive about the few things that he has that makes him happy, that if I mention anything negative about them he automatically gets very upset. [00:33:08]</p>

<p>Like, I do not want to take... He goes and (inaudible at 00:33:10) people. I would not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He found this (inaudible at 00:33:16).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wouldn't be wanting to take it away from him if... Why would I look to find this group and find out what time it is and make all these arrangements for you if I didn't want you to go? However, if it is negatively affecting your mood, that is something that you need to think about. Like, if you can't go, if you get upset and kind of a little bit spiteful because you can't go, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Say the last...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he can't go, if for some reason he doesn't get the opportunity to go, then if he gets negative feelings then you have to rethink that. If you're starting to get very angry and bitter when you can't go to do something like that, then you've got to rethink what's going on. You know? [00:34:03]</p>

<p>That's not me trying to take something away from him, it's just me saying, "I have given you an game device. I've encouraged you to buy games. I'm concerned that you've bought too many games, perhaps, but I'm not trying to take away the ones you have. And I think that you may be playing them too much." Or, "I think you may be doing this too much." I can't talk to him about that kind of stuff. I can't even like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He reads into me far too much. Even if I start staring at the screen kind of funny, he thinks I'm pissed off about something right now. And so I don't know if it's because of the nature of the therapy, or if he's depressed, or whatever. But it's one of the things that I could count on him for years not being like. Like, if I'm upset with you, I'm going to tell you I'm upset with you. I'm not going to hold it inside. But right now, I haven't really wanted to talk about what's going on because that's going to be... It's not gonna benefit anybody. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. [00:35:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I just... It's exhausting. And so... And then I had sort of poked him to go call his dad regularly. His family doesn't call him really all that much, so I've been trying to get him to sort of get into their lives, and not really working but at least it's something, you know. So I'm like, "Why don't you call your dad and tell him that you're depressed?" Because apparently I guess he's kind of, his dad is just feeling better, I don't know. And that was really a struggle to get him to talk to somebody. I don't really want him to call his dad, I wanted him to call and talk to somebody else. I wanted him to pick somebody randomly from the phone book and talk to them. Because I don't want him moping around the house, you know. In general, I would really prefer him to work and actually get something done, but I think the fact that he's convinced he's a failure and that he's not able to... I think that he's letting the deck get stacked against him. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: His only failure is what's keeping him from being able to succeed. His own thoughts of failure. Right now, although he hasn't voiced, I'm certain it's because one of his friends from grad school is also near and he is right now interviewing, he is doing an interview lecture for a faculty position. I'm certain that's part of the thing, is that someone who graduated just a month before he did is doing better. I'm certain that that's part of what's getting him. I'm never going to bring it up because that's... If it isn't, then I've already started him being upset about something else. But you're never going to get any further if you don't suck it up and just do it. There are lots of things in life that are super-uncomfortable that you really don't want to deal with. But the more you do it, the better it gets. You know? And I hate that he's like this. [00:37:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's not the person I knew, and that makes it kind of sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine. (pause) Yeah. I imagine it's like you're kind of venting because you've got so much you have to deal with; with him, with work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least for the most part he's actually a very, very good person to listen to; the people at work kind of thing, which is nice. But you know I just need, you know. There are a lot of things, a lot of hobbies that I do that drive him up the wall. There's a lot of things that... Quite frankly, we've a small apartment so when I'm cleaning the house he feels guilty if he's not helping. And quite frankly sometimes he's underfoot. And so it's easier to do it when he's not home, you know. [00:38:28]</p>

<p>Really the biggest thing now is all these things I'm talking about really stem back to the fact that I'm just really angry. I'm really, really angry that... That somebody did that to this family, you know. And the fact that he can't remember anything is not his own... I mean it's his own fault, but it's not like something he went out of his way to immediately forget something within 30 seconds of being talked about. He has this selective... Not even selective memory, certain things he just wipes it out. And pretty much it just pisses me off that nobody gives a damn about him, in his family. You know. (pause) One because I'd like to have somebody to share the burden, but quite frankly, I mean... (sighs). If they had just made him feel like a normal human being I think that he would be okay with that. I think he'd have a lot less...</p>

<p>The fact that he forgets things so quickly, I really think it's because of the fact that he had to, to survive and deal with all this stuff. So it makes me angry. Almost all of his reactions he has towards me are things that he had to survive. He had to constantly be vigilant as to what people's moods were, and the women of the house they didn't have to be around. Like just conveniently not be around when bad things happened, you know. [00:40:05]</p>

<p>That's not necessary for me. If I'm mad at you I'm worried to tell you and not going to take things out on you. But it just makes me angry that he has to be like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Of course you feel protective of him and bad for all the things that happened to him, and how he was treated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel bad that no one really gives a damn that much. Everything's on their terms. And it just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:40:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me sad especially because of the fact that I know that I have limited family. I mean, I have a very large extended family but I have limited family. And my parent's help has not been that great. And so... And not being able to have kids and all that stuff basically makes it so that, you know. I feel like having such a shitty family, it makes things become very lonely, very quickly, you know. And not that I'm saying I have to have things my way all the time, but why does it always have to be on somebody else's terms? Everything we do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be nice if, for once, people could think about the two of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It would be nice. I don't think it will ever happen. But... The worst part is I sincerely believe that if we could be able to procreate that things could change quite a bit, I think. I don't know if it's necessarily very positive, but I know the relationship would change somehow, you know. It's just kind of annoying. [00:42:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I'll see you Tuesday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

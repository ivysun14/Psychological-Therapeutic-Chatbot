<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>[Beginning from last three minutes of previous audio tape.]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 0518-014, Session No. 19. May 20th - thank you - of 1971.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes, does this sound right? That part, I mean part of what makes you feel grudging (ph) and one of your feelings about the therapy is like - I don't know. It's something about - well if you're going to come with all these limits and conditions and if you're going to just give me that it's sort of, just this much and no more, well the hell with it. I mean it's like... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Say that again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Well yeah, I think I understand what you mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like - I don't know. Like a limited time or a limited relationship. Like it's kind of - I don't know. It's like almost a little bit insulting or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's also just really different like, because I never - I can never limit anything. I never say 'no' to anybody. I never like can decide that I'm going to do something next year or that I'm going to be somewhere this summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've no idea where I'm going to be...I don't even know what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just like am so vague about things like that, that I don't think I'm really so hurt by the structure, it's just that the - I don't know. Sometimes that it's just like so blatant it bothers me. But sometimes it's just the opposite. Sometimes I'm relieved by, like when you said you were angry, it made me feel better... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...instead of worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. (sighing) Okay, where are the jelly bars?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) You want some?</p>

<p>PATIENT: On one o'clock Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One o'clock Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only person I know who calls me Stacy. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. [1:06:17.8]</p>

<p>*** [Picking up at beginning of new audio here.] ***</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible]...and those were the years I had them, I guess my freshman (ph) - I can't remember what year I had them, maybe it was just last year. But I've gotten to be really good friends with him. I mean like I made out this whole itinerary for me to go to Europe and I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...had lunch with him just now. And we, I just - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And especially because I always feel completely comfortable with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I never feel like I'm trying to impress him... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or that - I mean it's just like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...just this last time, there was somebody out there, a really strange dude, Mr. Black. Do you know who he is? He's another... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The name's familiar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so we all had lunch and were talking about Greece though. It was just like, it was one of those hysterical conversations where like it just gets funnier and funnier. It just put me in a really good mood. Anyway... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anyway?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm in a good mood. Nice things have been happening. I've been feeling, in some ways stronger and some - just that I don't feel like I lose myself, I mean that feeling that I always have of losing myself when I talk to certain people, I don't have. And I talked to one of the people, one of Carmen people just a minute ago - that's why I was late. As I was leaving, having lunch with them, I walked in - I met him and instead of - and like...I felt completely comfortable and what, even when I...after I see, after I'm completely comfortable with some people and I see Carmen's people or Carmen, I get all tongue tied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just said, "Hi, how are you?" And we had a nice little smalltalk conversation but he didn't go like that and I didn't feel like I said anything inane, we just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you felt like you were okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then he did too, that was what was real nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I come here feeling very whole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And I had a super time last night, too. I met this lawyer and his wife and their kids. I had dinner with them and played with them on a waterbed for hours. And they were just really neat people and I again felt real whole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they really liked me a whole bunch and invited me over tonight and...want to be my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's real nice to have people wanting to do that to me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I get the feeling like I'm always on the pursuing end, the rejected end...so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I feel good about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just so nice to feel whole?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really - well, how can I hold onto it, just this thing that I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it seems very much that it's related to people. Like I feel whole. I mean, like I can't tell which comes first, whether I feel whole or somebody starts, just opens themselves up to me as a whole person and I have the opportunity, it would be this whole thing, so I start being it, and they start responding, so it gets into a good cycle instead of being locked into a bad cycle. But I don't know how to make it self actualize. Like I don't know how to... [0:03:05.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...make sure that I do it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and to have it under your own control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And to be - yeah. Because it will be good when I can just take it for granted...that I'm me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and that I can have me with me all the time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...instead of feeling really good when I'm there, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. [inaudible at 0:03:31.0] And some people apparently do take it for granted...I don't know. I mean I - lets say like last night they just...I guess what it is I felt very separate when I first met them. I went over with an old high school friend of mine who just was in New York, who I haven't seen for a really long time, and I never really knew him, except I really loved his girlfriend, that's how I'm acquainted with him, and I went over with - I spent the day playing with them and then went to their house around dinner, after dinner or something and we talked to them. And I felt very separate at first, like this - I guess I really did have this feeling of I didn't care a whole lot if they liked - I mean I wasn't - I mean they were like very separate from any people I would have run into.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're like older, they have two kids, etc.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have to have... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wasn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...them like you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I wasn't - and lots of times when I have to have people like me I'm kind of ingratiating or careful... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or feigning...always grateful or something, and...I didn't feel that way at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that made them see me as this like, I mean like maybe that's what did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like thought about it last night, trying to figure out how come it was so wonderful. And they like...they were just like - he's a lawyer and wants to...they're very, they're all real hip...we smoked dope together and they take acid and they're unlike, not at all stagnant people. He doesn't really want to be in law anymore. He really opened up to me personally, too, you know? And we had a long talk about existence and stuff. But all the time I felt - and that's what happens when I start feeling good...I radiate it and it just feeds on itself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I - just the same way when I feel miserable and uptight... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that radiates it, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it feeds on itself and I radiate it...but how - I don't know how to make it and like be the controller, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) I don't think I do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, why not? (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wish I knew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does that happen to you too, what I'm talking about or do you just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes, I think it does, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm so - and it even has this, I mean it's even - it's so blatant. I mean it's always - it's just to not - I feel much more comfortable talking, just talking, you know? [0:06:06.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my mind works quicker and I think of these neat things and my - and everything on me starts working...really smoothly and I can just feel this, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, God, I wish I could - but then I get into a thing that it's, a lot of it's just this ego thing...and that maybe it's the wrong fight. That maybe...because a lot of it I think...is I get an ego trip from it...and that somehow I want to be able - and I'm not sure that happened that much last night, when I really felt like I really liked them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know some of it was the guy was attracted to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew that that was some of what was, some of the dynamic that was working out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I didn't feel like it was anything illicit and anything too dreadful about it but that we were both attractive people and that was okay, didn't make me feel like he was being a dirty old man or I was being coy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I really just feel like we really could talk to each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I was just thinking about feeling whole and not feeling whole. And like some of the way I experience it is like, because even when I'm walking around sometimes I'll feel like I don't have to move aside for people. I don't have to worry about how they need to get by. I have a right to get, to walk where I'm walking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, to where I want, right. That's really it you know? And my immediate response is always to make sure how they get by, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, right. Right, yeah. That's my usual, too. It's like I would meet someone and I would sort of hastily step aside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To make sure that they don't think that I'm being aggressive or something or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well it's not - I'm not so worried about being aggressive but it's something about - I don't know. I don't know why it is I do that. But that's exactly it...that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I know. I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like we can play that. Like you can switch with me today. Like you can switch yourself down into being pursuing and insecure, then you can try and switch yourself back up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, say that again? [0:09:05.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can try, like I think you're feeling pretty whole now. You can try and shift yourself down into where you're placating me and then you can try and shift back up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, oh. That's not true because that's the dynamic that happens with you too, is I get real... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like that, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. And I know if I just don't...and I feel close, I mean that's when - oh, wait a second. There was some flash but it has to congeal. [silence from 0:09:43.8 to 0:09:54.3] It's probably like sometimes, like when I come in I worry about how to get it going with you or how to start...or that it just didn't occur to me, I just, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't feel any farther away from you, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I didn't take you into account.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's right, yeah, right. But there is some sense in which you didn't take me into account.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the sense is a good one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's not... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess that's where I always get worried. I always get worried that, that not taking into account is a bad... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's like a non, is a bad thing and so self pursuing but it isn't necessarily.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it doesn't do - it's not doing anything bad to you and you're not feeling bad by it. I didn't mean it - I mean it's just like it's maybe the line between ingratiating and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...concern...or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean there's no sense in which you can properly take yourself into it kind of. Why don't you try now and take me into it. Well start taking me into it, a... [inaudible at 0:11:05.2] ...in that bad way and see if you can get yourself into that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. [silence from 0:11:11.4 to 0:11:23.1] I have to like sink then into it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:11:26.1 to 0:12:16.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how it works (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: As I kind of go down each step I can see it. And I can see how like it negates who I do it to, too. You know, how it's like this insult when I start seeing you as this somebody I need to have to have care for me and be, like and be my friend, right, you know? You just, you can't be Rene. You have to be my friend otherwise therapy isn't successful or then it's just blah, blah, blah, you know? I think well I have to keep - I have to greet (ph) you, Rene. [silence from 0:13:03.8 to 0:13:29.8] Get more space, too. It seems like that's part of it. And you start goofing (ph) the center of where you are, so you have to go wondering around for it more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:13:49.7 to 0:14:03.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I almost don't want to go down there. You know, there's something in me that's released and I keep on getting ideas about, and instead of going really down... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe you ought to come back up for a moment and sort of walk you way back up the steps for a minute because, and sort of feel the reversal too, before you go completely. [silence from 0:14:27.1 to 0:14:48.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's like people can feel when there isn't self concern and they're scared of it, you know? Because I know...when the shit hits the fan, unless you take care of yourself nobody really is going to. So if they like find this person whose energy is getting all gone out there and they get, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. [silence from 0:15:13.7 to 0:15:22.9] Like you're seeing, you're getting some kind of clearer sense of how you seem to other people in the dark (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I'm really feeling, I'm just getting, I mean I'm only saying one-tenth of the flashes I'm getting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know it's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: God. [silence from 0:15:42.7 to 0:15:57.2] And I wonder what - oh, wow! [silence from 0:16:05.4 to 0:16:24.6] I guess it really is a self confidence...that can almost melt down. Well it's not - confidence is selling it short. [silence from 0:16:40.5 to 0:16:53.8] God. [silence from 0:16:54.1 to 0:17:03.9] It also just like - all these - that just all these words keep on occurring to me as important words. [silence from 0:17:23.9 to 0:17:30.6] Like need and separation and... [silence from 0:17:33.6 to 0:17:54.0] And that whenever I'm feeling really, when I'm feeling good, like when I was talking to those, Mr. Black and Mr. Shales today, I even remember having the feeling of being very - I mean it was a physical feeling, getting like very in my body.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just very in my body.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:18:16.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like I was - and I really had - and it's a defined sensation I have and I really felt it, you know? And last night I felt that way too, when I was with the Longs. I felt that same sensation of feeling very self-enclosed. And I don't feel that way. I distinctly don't feel that way when I'm with Carmen, for instance, just not at all, you know? And I even do things like trip a lot more, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's important too, for me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I think what you're trying to make me do is real had for me but I want to try to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because then I can see that we're continuing from feeling there, to feeling down there... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and start being able to identify and seeing it as me being able to do it, to get to go up, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, to be able to move along the continuum and to - well like you used an analogy about, like going down steps to it. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I think it helps to see, to be able to know the geography and know the steps.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I really want to be able, but it's hard for me to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Where are you now? Like where are you, sort of mostly whole?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Did you...like you started to go down some and then felt that - 'I don't want to feel like that.' Did you then go back up or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I feel - I still have that sense, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Of being in your body and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not as strongly. Not like with - I mean when I was talking to those guys, it just like slapped me in the face... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...of how much I felt like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I feel like I want to try to see how they're connected, because it gets, it really gets - oh, that's a really good thing that you did that, too. Because what happens is I get polarized and there's this kind of incredible abyss between one and the other... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I have no idea. And I feel like I'm either here or there, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really, really just do [the whole thing.] (ph) And well, too, like later you should remind me I have beads around here somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, God, they disappeared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) I think they're basically down your neck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where inside? Oh no, here they are. (chuckling) [0:21:18.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But...like so that it's important to see yourself as not all the way up, but you're somewhere off of in feeling a strikingly whole... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and that's important to know that, like it's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it's important to see that it's a continuum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I never saw it that way before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I never had any - so I always felt like it was one cycle here or one cycle there... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and that there wasn't a lot I could do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was really funny. I was supposed to read Sartre for today and I didn't, but it was because I was playing all yesterday. But I got into class and people were talking and they were talking about Sartre's feeling about responsibility in whatever happens and whatever decisions, even if they're unconscious...are always your responsibility and you are the master of your fate. And I was sitting there, (both chuckling) you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and it's - and I really realized how much I blame or put the responsibility for how I end up on the situation around me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which just fucking isn't fair. First of all, it like makes it impossible for me. It makes me into a - makes...corners myself, because I can't get out of it if it's other people doing it to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So the possibility for change is like nil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And somewhere I have to find out - I mean I think if I start being able to feel being able to step up, I could do it, you know? I mean if I could feel the connection from one feeling to another and how... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it progresses and how I can start feeling more myself and what I can do to make... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...to pull my center back into me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...then I can see that it's not so much something that's done to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Where are you now? I mean... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably intellectualizing a lot. Where am I now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In between. I mean...I've had... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How centered do you feel there (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty centered. Some of it might be an aftertaste. I can't tell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I know that I'm fighting being - I'm fighting being that way to you. Because it just occurred to me, I mean I didn't realize how much I've been like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was one of my - oh, wow's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just realizing, God, what a dependent and clingy, needful, demanding, creature I've been on you. Like I've wanted you to be...just all these things, you know? [silence from 0:24:29.8 to 0:24:41.7] And just always the way I leave when I say goodbye, there's a certain - I don't know. There's - I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But if maybe you would help me say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like when you first talked I was thinking, dependent? I don't know why she sees - I mean I don't see her that way. But the way, I guess there's something about the way when you go - I guess it's, it doesn't strike me real unpleasantly, but I guess there's an element of a way you're ingratiating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I felt that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you try and sort of move yourself into a state where you are going like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: God. Well the thing is you have to help with it, too. I think. Well maybe not, because I think I managed to do that to you without you even doing anything. Let me see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I know one way I could help is to think badly of you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Accept I don't really want you to think that. (both chuckling) [silence from 0:26:01.1 to 0:27:09.4] I'm going down. (big sigh) [silence from 0:27:10.1 to 0:28:19.4] Yeah, I can start getting down there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Can you feel yourself twisting down here? And I know it's hard (ph). [silence from 0:28:32.7 to 0:28:50.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like trying to fully... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to hold onto something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or like it, yeah, just keep on patting (ph) it, making sure it's all there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it...the more you pat (ph) the less you realize it's there, it's already gone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which must mean that you feel less substantial and less sure that you're all there? I don't know, like ill defined.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. [silence from 0:29:31.6 to 0:29:41.5] Yeah. I can like see that nothing like is to be worried about. [silence from 0:29:47.0 to 0:30:00.8] Just like Diane and Jackson are going to meet later this afternoon. And I remember, I was talking to Jackson when Diane came up. She didn't say anything to me, she just talked to Jackson, so and said something about them seeing each other. And I remember at that point realizing that I didn't feel that touched by it...that before I would have felt dreadful, first of all because Diane didn't say anything and treated...treated me like I wasn't there, and was making plans with the person I was talking with and with my friend to meet, and that always makes me jealous and left out and angry. And I remember thinking, 'well' and I just...I was feeling good enough so that, 'when I was with Jen I was with her and if she was going to be with Diane that's okay and it wasn't any sweat off my back'. But I also recognize it because that reminded of - you jumped to that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...when I started to try to get down. And my mind jumped to like, well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She'd just ignored you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she just ignored me. What makes it worse is that she like is going to take away my friend and she might be better friends with Jen than I am, even.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're on the outside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that...I mean I kind of want it so that if she's not going to be my friend, she's not going to have any other friends...she's not close to anybody. So I can, so my mind can quickly switch back into that kind of grabby... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...needy feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A scared feeling. [0:31:50.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well you kind of feel like...scared that you're bad in some way that makes other people not care about you particularly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also scared, I mean like all of the sudden just now that it ran through my head that, that center that I was feeling real strongly could like just be this ego-inflated hollow. You know that it was really just only - it was like really false, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have no real center?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like... [inaudible at 0:32:41.8] I mean it's - and when I act that way it's just like [ego full] (ph) inside, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that it's like showing off. Because I do, do kind of show off things, not show off but I get real quick witted and funny, which you probably don't even believe since I don't ever, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can get that way, like last night...or this afternoon, but, and it comes very naturally but it's very glib in this funny... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...untrustworthy way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And that the way you see it now is - is not you centered, feeling good from being in touch with yourself and in your body, just as a role you can snap yourself into that looks good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And that it's real...yeah. And that if it is that artificial and people do respond so positively, then it's even more confusing, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and...and I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's - I have a feeling that this is part of - what you're seeing is part of being down, is like doubting that people really respond to you well? [silence from 0:34:29.1 to 0:34:43.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. As soon as I go down and get really suspicious of absolutely everything, I'm really self scrutinizing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like I feel like I'm doing that... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...to everything I felt ten minutes ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I know the feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's kind of - it's I feel like haughty and sick at the same time and I feel like miserable, too. That the haughtiness is like the haughtiness of relating to or of defensive stores...they're really haughty to the customers, although they're working there, you know? It's that same kind of fucked up, like I feel like - I feel like I know that I was...or something. I mean I feel... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel haughty to the people who buy you and yet you're still trying to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I also feel haughty to the person whose fooling everybody, because she's fooling everybody. And at least I'm not fooling, even though I'm miserable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Guilty (ph)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but at least I'm not fooling, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Right now that it's very real to you, the ways you're crummy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I vacillate like...the first part of our sentence, I'll feel really bad and then as I'm saying it I'll start feeling a little bit better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, as you said, that I've felt things that were really crummy, I at that moment have just been going, 'no'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you want to try to go up now. [silence from 0:36:42.6 to 0:36:49.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I just went down again. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, something about trying to go up that's part of the down thing I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's really an element of, well of trying, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, there is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that somehow implies failure when I'm down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? Also, because I try to play not down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and then as it skids in between being down and trying not to play down, makes the language I speak...just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...repellant...to everybody. [silence from 0:37:42.6 to 0:38:02.0] (big sigh) I mean I still all this time feel - in a good way, even with you. I mean... [silence from 0:38:16.8 to 0:38:38.4] how can I walk back up the steps without being phony?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Yes, but... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I do phony things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it's like that song, you know, (kind of singing) - whistle a happy tune.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...and it's...the thing about it is that it's worked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I've been feeling really lousy before and I'll meet somebody who...I won't ordinarily run across, and I'll decide, 'okay, I'm going to be...'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: '...and I'm going to come across in this way.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I do it and it works and then I see - then after a while I'm like dragging along behind my image for a while, and then I catch up and I really do feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. Right. But is there any other way to do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But is - yeah. That's what I want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I had a picture in my mind of all - but not - that when you're down what you need to do is not sort of, try to find your center again, but to sort of spread yourself out into all of the place where all of your energy is going, and sort of let yourself go into how scattered you are and to sort of gather your center together that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. I know that sounds good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds really good but I don't know if - like how to do it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know like physically...how to - how would I act? Would I go in a room somewhere and just like allow myself to buzz out and then slowly quiet back? Or would I like run around from one table to another and just see, shop frantically for 15 minutes, until I like fell in a heap on the floor?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's something to do in your head. Like you could - the way I imagine it is like you're just sitting still, sensing how you're scattered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. Well it gets ready (ph) - I think it's ready (ph). I'm even... [silence from 0:40:58.1 to 0:41:04.3] (whispering) [Yeah, I get it, yeah.] (ph) [silence from 0:41:05.4 to 0:41:13.3] Yeah. That's what it is. That's - oh, I just had another flash. But lots of times I'm prone to get hysterical. I get really hysterically - like I'll start laughing with somebody and I'll really get embarrassingly hysterical. Like I won't stop laughing until I'm literally blue and I have tears running down my face. And everybody's like gotten utterly freaked out and just like sitting there clutching their heads. (counselor chuckling) That happens a lot and when it happens I really can't control it. And I really, I mean it's not...it's not funny. [0:41:51.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just really frightening and I freak people out...people have like told me that they just...and that's happened. It also like happens at...it happened at a class once, in Hyde class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Where Cathy and I just got each other hysterical and broke up the whole class, and people came over and screamed at us after the class. They just couldn't believe that we could've done that to ourselves. Like because it was really - it was triggered on this one person who we both thought was remarkably phony. And he was saying something, and he has a very grandiose way of talking and he is kind of a colorful character, but we just got hysterical. It had nothing to do with him after a while but he was supposedly upset. But what happens, I close my eyes...and I - somehow if I - what I finally do to stop myself is I realize what I'm doing. Somehow all this time I've become - I close my eyes and I get oblivious to everybody else and I get oblivious to myself when I'm hysterical. And I just have all this incredible, contorted energy that just comes out like that, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then what - finally I can stop it after...usually after a - how it's already worked, wrecked its havoc, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what finally happens is I become aware of myself...I become aware of what I'm - and it might be - I feel sometimes like when I get real frantic and grabby from people, I stop being really aware of them and I stop being aware of me...and I'm just like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just all your energy going into grabbing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I like...and I think that if I would like - all of the sudden become - I mean if I could like gather myself or like just realize how frantic I've been and like feel that for a minute, then I'd have to get collected. I don't know what made me go off into that passionate stuff or that it somehow explained it in my head but didn't sound quite as... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...something and I was saying it out loud, but I think I know what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. We should be stopping.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Time flies. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling much less smoother (ph) than... [silence from 0:44:24.4 to 0:44:32.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Monday at one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that will be our 20th session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Far out! (chuckling) Yeah, far out. That's really been a nice 19th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (both chuckling) That's nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. God. I feel like I've gotten something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) Well, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One o'clock. If I can remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, let me give you an appointment slip.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay, yeah. [inaudible whispering at 0:45:23.2]... </p>

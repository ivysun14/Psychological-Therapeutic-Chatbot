<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Before I forget, I'm sorry, but I have to be out tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I can reschedule I'll let you know. I probably can't give them ... the week is all screwed up because (inaudible 00:00:18).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, as I you get toward the end of the week I have things ... I have applications for work so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first, the first ... I haven't had any lunch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they split one, so. Well, the one good news is ... I think I've complained only about 30 thousand times, the fact that I don't like the new head of Retail. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was fired yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right, there were two people who left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They both left. That was ... one of them is leaving, like he's going to be still an advisory role and this and that. That's because he's got personal life things that he can't really be as responsible for all this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible 00:01:04) more or less was not let in the building yesterday. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was that you? Did you call?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is your area code, 101?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, so that 's why I got confused. </p>

<p>[00:01:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But now so that's good news we hope. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And until further notice it's going directly to the CEO.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So until they get somebody else better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's good. Apparently, yeah he cut too many ... the problem was that his bonus was really related to how much the, you know the expense verses, you know income and he'd just tried to squeeze every single pint he could out of it. Well ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, that I would imagine is kind of reassuring because that's sort of similar to your frustration with him that he seemed so cross conscious that he was ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Foolish.</p>

<p>[00:02:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And causing real problems with morale.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He also had problems with previous companies too with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the previous companies he worked for actually went and underwent a name change so that they could reduce their, like the problems that they had. Because this was a different country, it's not as obvious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. It was a piece of really good news, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. Today has just been all over the place at work. I screwed up so badly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just ... I'm glad that I was out at one because (pause) basically it's the Monday ... that's on Monday but the (inaudible 00:02:56) quarterback syndrome once you screw something up badly enough ... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... then there's just no recovery. (pause) Like once you watch somebody drop a laptop and you try to catch it and because you try to catch they start in turn blame you for actually dropping it, which is old. But you know little ladies will do that all the time.</p>

<p>[00:03:15]</p>

<p>(pause) Amongst other things it just ... I just glad that today is over, so. It's been blech, you know. (pause) We didn't have any major repercussions from the storm, which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So. (pause) But (pause) just been sort of (pause) exhausted, trying to mostly catch up on things. I've been so easily distracted lately. I have no focus whatsoever and I finally get actually really embarrassing (pause) because like I ... I'm not ... things that I'm spending all of my time focusing on and I'm not looking at anything else and I'm just not retaining the information, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's ... just right now I think it's just stress, but you know it's a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) that's you know? (pause) That's pretty much the big things, you know? Um ... (pause) Yeah. (pause) Pretty much. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why has your focus been so shy is it from pain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's partially pain, it's partially stress. (pause) Awful lot of anxiety. (pause) No good reason. Just (pause) just anxious. Um (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know any bad reasons?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm don't know any bad reasons but like no, like there's no specific reason ... I mean I spend a lot of time getting myself anxious about the fact that I couldn't figure out why I'm so damn anxious, you know? I just ... so, so unproductive. As far as I can tell, (pause) I some unconscious level something didn't seem right but I don't know what it is. (pause) And so I'm sort of ... if you emotional (inaudible 00:05:46), okay, do you have my keys, okay. Something feels like it's missing. Do I have, you know this? Do I have that? Do I have bus passes? Like not even ... it's not quite like checking per se but it's definitely like something feels wrong, you know? And so ... (pause)</p>

<p>[00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know since when?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably Friday, Thursday. (pause) something like that. (pause) Nothing like in particular, just (pause) as far as I can tell at least. (pause) But it's definitely keeping me from focusing. Like I can be watching something in plain English or easy, you know and not retain a darn thing or reading a sentence and not retain, you know (pause) not be able to get anything out of it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. That's not good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's not that it happens very often. Usually when it has happened in the past at some point I'm able to reboot and get back to normal but (pause) there's only been a few times where I've really had insight other than when I'm like subconsciously realizing my husband is acting out. But this is not the same thing. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is not that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it usually ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel like I'm being gassed, I just feel like I'm not perceiving the world the way it should be if that makes sense. (pause) So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it ... how unusual is it for you to make mistakes like the ones you made this morning at work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very. (pause) It's very unusual ... to have them ... especially to have them happen all in the same morning (pause) you know? (pause) Pretty darn unusual. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what were they? There was the?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the dropped laptop. There was just a couple of customers that were just (pause) how to explain this. (pause) They were unhappy with the answers that they got about certain things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>[00:08:11]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that kind of stuff. I'm usually, usually much better at taking the temperature of what they're looking for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I asked a coworker if we're having a meeting and she said she didn't think so because of the store wasn't trying to get caught up. And so I never bothered to look back into it and then my boss is like, "So you missed the meeting." Like yeah this person told me that. (pause) You know amongst other things like that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the meeting about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, every morning we're trying to meet at 11 a.m. to just sort of get a temperature on the day, have everybody talk about what they're priorities are. It's brand new. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've only been to one. (pause) I'm just (inaudible 00:08:56) stuff like that. I'm just (pause) I'm normally wouldn't have trusted just asking this person, just I wouldn't have just trusted just her. I would've watched to see what ... you know to see if there's anything happening or something, you know? I wouldn't have let myself get in that situation. (pause) So (pause) I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The metaphor of dropping the ball keeps coming to my mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause). It doesn't feel like it has to do with sort of your subtly picking up on Mike's acting out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. I could be wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could be wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels different when that happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, this feels foggy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That just feels like the world is ... that seems like oh, my God like I'm like ... this is what ... this is what I'm noticing and this is what I'm being told the world is like and it's not necessarily the same thing, you know? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else comes to mind about it? I mean just whatever pops into your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About ... when he's acting out or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm sorry, about the, do you feel does it bring anything to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it just makes me nervous. I mean when I mention the, the screwed quarterback syndrome it's just one of those things where after you do a couple of things (pause) you feel un-nerved. And so it's very hard to just calmly go into the situation and stop the process of making mistakes. </p>

<p>[00:10:43]</p>

<p>And the worst part I'm saying mistakes like I am mistaking trusting my own coworker to tell me the truth. That's really kind of a horrible thing that feel that's a mistake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is where I become a control freak is because of this kind of crap. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the most conspicuous thing or the most obviously problematic thing is to me is your difficulty focusing and reading. I mean which doesn't really affect anybody but you. It doesn't sound tragic, it just sounds ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's been trouble focusing on people I'm working with as well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) trying to find out ... a couple of times, you know instead of spending the time troubleshooting because they're describing to me what's wrong, I was like, "Is it backup?" Yes. I'm just going to swap it out. Like for fixing a link in the tablet or something like that instead of trying to figure out the situation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a problem solver by nature so when I'm feeling like overwhelmed like that, like I'm just not processing what this could be ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes me feel very odd. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a very uncomfortable feeling because I don't have it very often. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... And I can't help but feeling like I want to go to work tomorrow so I can have a redo. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Because I ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) I don't know, I just feel just very awkward. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't like feeling this foggy, you know? (pause) I mean, sometimes I'm a little bit too aware of my situation around me but this is feeling extremely oblivious too, you know? (pause) I haven't been hit by a car or anything yet, but this is the kind of thing that I definitely think to myself, "Oh, my God, I'd better look before crossing the street." Kind of ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This feels like it fits that kind of profile on this kind of thing, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. I mean, my sort of initial thought is either there's something you don't want to see ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is why I wondered about the acting out. Although I understand it actually feels kind of different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This feels different.</p>

<p>[00:13:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is more along the lines of just ... I don't know if it's exhaustion or (pause) just feeling depressed. I mean, all I want to do is go home and go to sleep. Of course I normally do that anyways but. I spent all day yesterday sleeping, you know? I just (pause) I said it before I feel like I'm sleeping my life away but it's really true. (pause) I feel like that a lot. (pause) There's definitely a lot of things right now that I don't want to see but for the most part I've been sort of just holding my nose and you know (pause) somehow muddling through it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't do well with like difficult situations, that kind of stuff. But it's (pause) I don't know what it is. I wish I did. (pause) I really do. (pause) It's (pause) I don't know. I guess (inaudible 00:14:50) completely understood. I feel like (pause) I really feel it's really off. (pause) And usually when I'm like this like (pause) I'm actually exceptionally clear right now, like I'm actually using nouns and verbs and things and not dropping things out of (inaudible 00:15:18) and all, but. (pause) And I'm normally not like this this long. Part of it was just information overload, part of the weekend at least because trying to like go to Ikea, like before a hurricane is a lot of ... I wouldn't call it stimulation but that would be ... that's fine but then you know I would think that there would be this refractory period and then I'd be fine, you know?</p>

<p>[00:15:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still feeling like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I haven't been around that many people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) I mean, yeah there's a bunch kids that are out of school and all but, you know? And I understand that it's too dangerous to go to school. It's not too dangerous to go to the mall. Never understood that one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) You might get homework at school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So. But that's you know? (pause) It's been pretty exhausting for me for that kind of stuff, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am surprised ... I can't believe I'm actually surprised about this. I'm actually surprised that Mike's mother hasn't even called to find out if we're okay from the hurricane. Usually that's the kind time when she ... she's not speaking to us, but you know? (pause) I have to admit I'm really frustrated that Mike hasn't addressed anything with his grandfather yet. He was supposed to but just never got around to it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no way of controlling that. (pause) But (pause) Yeah (pause) and it's like I said I feel exhausted (pause) both physically and emotionally. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:17:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just wish I understood what was going on. It's very (inaudible 00:17:26) to me. (pause) I don't like feeling this way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I guess I just sort of slug through this and figure out what happens from here. I think it's always like that though. (pause) I want to see progress. I don't necessarily know if there is any progress. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's really frustrating. (pause) (pause) But (pause) I suppose that's sort of the was things go. (pause) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Progress with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feeling less depressed, digging out of debt. I don't know, communicating better in my marriage. (pause) You know? (pause) Usual stuff. (pause) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you upset with me that you're not less depressed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (whisper) No, I don't really get upset with other people that much. I mean I do but not like (pause) nothing like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I'm not doing what I need to be doing to fix this. But I really don't ... I don't know. (pause) Just (pause) (heavy sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you seem more at a loss than usual I think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (pause) I just feel right now like I'm just (pause) I don't know it's just hard to explain it. Like I (pause) I don't necessarily know if I'm getting anywhere (pause) in terms of my mood, in terms of my energy, in terms of my anything, you know? </p>

<p>[00:20:25] </p>

<p>When I get like this I start to wonder if I'm just being a spoiled brat and I just need to suck it up and just ... you know get some better discipline. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you're being (pause) is it the part to (inaudible 00:20:44)? Just upset? (pause) I know this brings up ... like (pause) being upset about it doesn't mean you did something wrong. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (slight laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you weren't good enough at something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>(pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, it's just feels kind of hard for me though. (pause) (pause) (pause) I guess the big thing is, is that I feel like certain things I should be able to do on autopilot by now. You know I've did them so long and I have been able to, but sometimes I have to really, really focus and that's (pause) when I don't really focus on it it's really frustrating because then it's something that I can do all the time, gets screwed up.</p>

<p>[00:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I don't know I just don't like to have that not being able to multitask anything at all, you know? I'm talking like I can't darn socks and watch TV at the same time; like kind of multitask. Not even talking about like typing something and listening to something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm talking about something that is a pure mechanical, repetitive motion thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not quite walking and chewing gum, but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... going in that direction. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So ... but it's doesn't exactly make me feel real good about myself. (pause) So ... (pause) (heavy breath) but perhaps I will (pause) find some insight I guess, I don't know. Just (pause) (heavy sigh) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible 00:23:27) how you pretty worn out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Really worn out. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) though there have been some positive things from it. I don't think I'll be doing any biometrics thing here and (pause) this is very important to me because you know I feel like I have to prove everything to myself. (pause) Hold on this is, is quite impressive. (pause) (humming) So and in the past week I have walked 13.4 miles without trying. This is not like a person that doesn't work, that doesn't do anything, you know. And there was the one-day that I forgot to put on the band. So, who knows what that is, yeah. One of the days alone was like six miles. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Wow. </p>

<p>[00:24:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's like, you know, I mean it's not like I was trying to do that, that's just, you know doing stuff around the house and walking out to like appointments and stuff. So it's like I feel (pause) I do better with numbers and graphs, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckle) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I get angry when people like question my perception. And I'm like, you know I even question my own perception, that's fine. But you know being able to have something solid like that (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? I work retail. I really don't sit still very well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And lately there hasn't been enough seats for people so I stand while, you know somebody sits next to it. So there's not like I'm really doing much ... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's probably (pause) you hate sitting around, you hate being passive, you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I darn socks while watching television.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You pretty much have always pushed yourself pretty hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know if you slept all day yesterday that's not that you're lazy, it's because you were entirely wiped out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I also kind of pre-knew that there was a good chance that the buses might not be running on a normal schedule, so I knew that I had to be out by at least five to get to work by nine. Probably ... and I did get up at 4:30 just in case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:26:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean I knew ... I was sort of like conserving energy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though I slept all day yesterday apparently I walked ten thousand steps. I don't really know how that happened. It wasn't vacuuming. (pause) But the (pause) but you know I (pause) you know I had to plan ahead to do that because it's like, "Yeah I know that it could be a giant nightmare." And I don't want to have to have a conversation with my boss about why I can't get to work on time. So ... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know and especially because the company is kind enough to get us like ... the mall did not close, secretly our store decided not to open. They didn't announce that they weren't going to open. But they just told all of the employees don't tell anybody, but we're not opening tomorrow. And so, yeah, so we all got the day off, so they did take very good care of us for that kind of thing. (pause) So ... but I knew I needed the rest. (pause) And I ... I mean I did do a few things, you know it wasn't like (pause) I live in a very small apartment. I just live in a like 600 square foot apartment, tops, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, very small apartment, right? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do spend like ... when I'm not sleeping I spend most of that downtime getting it clean because if you don't keep it clean it gets away from you really fast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, there's been periods of time I've just been to exhausted or haven't been feeling well enough to do it and so ... so a lot times like during the week just getting caught up on that. And I feel like on some level that it's not ... it's always going to get away from me too. It's like ... I have no idea what I'd do with a bigger house because I can barely keep, you know my tiny apartment clean right now, so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause) I just feel like it's just one thing after another and I've never ... it's almost like (inaudible 00:28:20) the one ... the thing ... I feel like I'm not really getting anywhere just doing the same things over and over again. And I understand that with my cleaning house, houses get dirty again, you know? But I really feel like, okay so I'm not ... we sold our car ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But your life feels that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my life feels that way. We sold our car and you know we did this and we did that and I'm still not feeling like we're getting ahead in terms of, you know finances.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:28:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that's really hard. </p>

<p>THERPIST: I would think so. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How ... do you know how that is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know as much as you keep a pretty tight ... a pretty close eye on the debts I ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are inexpensive and expected costs sometimes. (pause) Things that just sort of like a speeding ticket was 150 dollars that Mike got, like a bunch of other things. But also just in general, just seems like sometimes it's like (pause) just as soon as I know we can start paying something down it's like the interest rate for some reason, because they decided we're a credit risk, raises it and then it's like well, you know still paying the same amount of money but ... it just seems like we're not getting anywhere right now. I don't know if it's true or not, you know? I just found a track on a paycheck that got lost. God only knows how that happened. I've never had a mailed paycheck in my life but they decided to mail me a paycheck two weeks ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like really weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was because of the bank being bought out they got confused and I had one paycheck in between. I don't know, but it's like ... I feel like there's always something that I'm running around trying to figure out what's the (pause) you know what is the major holdup as to, you know why this is a problem?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just exhausting, you know? It doesn't necessarily ... as soon as I fix one situation then I have to wait and you know figure out another one, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) and that's (pause) what I have to deal with. (pause) So ... (pause) and it's really been (pause) (heavy sigh) that's really been my week primarily, you know? (pause) (pause) I don't like the fact that (pause) my deep need to monitor and control parts of my life is getting reinforced over and over again that when I don't like monitor things and I don't keep track of them then they really do go crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? (pause) It feels like it's being reinforced just not like it ... I mean I spend a little bit of time thinking of it. It's not like it's a like a compulsive feeling without any justification. It's like, yeah, I asked a coworker about something and they said no and like now, obviously they were wrong and they went to the meeting too and so I obviously need, to know, keep better track of this. </p>

<p>[00:31:50]</p>

<p>Or like, you know if I don't like keep track and figure out what every penny that's going in and out, you know then somehow something goes a rye, you know. Or this or that, you know it's just (pause) I don't really want to be a control freak. I don't. (pause) But it seems like if I don't things go wrong. And I really wish that I could just automate an awful lot of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the past back when we had a reasonable mount of money I just had a bill paying system and just paid it all out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whenever I try to set that up now, I can't because there are different parts of the month where we may not owe money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... (pause) I just don't like to have to vigilant. I don't know. I like to have as much automated as possible. I just don't ... I don't think about that kind of stuff, I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it just sucks not to have enough money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, that's true too. (pause) There are very few people in the world that would feel differently you know about that one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean in your situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be (inaudible 00:32:58). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, no, I'm not (inaudible 00:33:01) out it's just, fuck. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) (pause) I just yeah, it really sucks. And I just (pause) It's just exhausting too, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:33:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would like to be able to focus on other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't what these other things are because I don't have the time to think about what they would be, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would really like to do that. (pause) (pause) (pause) I feel like I can barely even focus or enough to go one week at time in planning stuff much like a month ahead of time, you know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's some element of just being really exhausted and the difficulties focused and being out of kilter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that's a great (inaudible 00:34:18)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Maybe also much more than you kind of want to be or sometimes you want to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Also a little bit fed up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. That's what I'm like. Yup, you tell me you can't your Internet, you get a new device, you know? It's like, I want to make this the easy one right now because I just don't want to have to (pause) If I would just ... and I don't want to think this through but I also don't want to have a situation where, like it conservation of energy when we run around and found that this is what I really need to do in the first place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>[00:34:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't think there will be too many ramifications for that one, so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, same concept that happens, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got the secret suspicion that almost all of my coworkers are like that anyways. They're not especially trying to figure things out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am not certain, so. (pause) I just don't like to swap things out because if it is a software problem, then it just becomes the same problem. (pause) But yeah, I'm just ... I'm just exhausted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know just thinking about that fact that I've got to trek home is exhausting. It's not that far to home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's just the concept of it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When you're really wiped out it's a long way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (heavy sigh) I just ... yeah. (pause) Feel like a broken record just saying the same things over and over again but I don't really have that much more (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't cry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Contribute on that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other than the fact that I wish I wasn't like this. (pause) It feels like it's just one more thing in my life my that makes me feel isolated. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Other people don't have these kinds of things, you know? They think they do sometimes but they don't have the same things. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:36:49]</p>

<p>Really what I want is more that would connect me to the human race and less things that separate from me them, you know? (pause) Kind of think of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's just the negative things; there's positive things too. You know it's like well you know what I just what to have something that (pause) connects me. (pause) (pause) (sigh) This is going to sound a little bit strange but is it okay if we end early? I'm just exhausted. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure whatever you like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And as I'm sitting here I'm filled with dread with the walk home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, go ahead. Whatever it will be helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. And we'll see you next Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you next Tuesday. I'm (inaudible 00:37:52) tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. No problem. If you have something open Thursday let me know but Friday's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friday's good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Pray it's not another one of those 4 a.m. days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so that being said, um, yeah, you're a handy car repair person now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're a handy car repair person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  I'm proud of myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, you know, I've been doing, I've been pursuing things, you know, since my husband died, uh for a long time.  That's one thing that I'm not.  But then, then, okay, though, I was supposed to, my birthday was in January.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So yesterday because my license expired, I thought hey -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, happy birthday last week, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, uh, the [DATE].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so yesterday I go in and I had to take the written test.  And I hadn't taken that since [AGE] and I passed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I only missed, and I only missed 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Congratulations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But those were the new laws so that they switched over for the children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, which new laws for kids?  What are the new kid's laws?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They keep changing them.  Half the police don't even know them.  They were asking, one was um, about a, being, if you had just had your license under 3 months and you're 17 years of age, um, it's a weekend and it's 11:00, do you have to have a parental figure or an 18 year old in the car with you while you're driving?  And I said yes, because that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, that used to be the law and now it's no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it used to be a law for us.  So they just got rid of that?  So now you can be 17 and you don't need a parent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, or yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or an 18 year old?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I guess the idea is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On a weekend.  But it was a weekend.  It wasn't just on a weekday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the thing is, what if someone is working at McDonalds and they get finished at 11:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Exactly.  So they changed -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So how they get home, uh, have their mommy pick them up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I bet that they probably got some flack from parents calling their legislators, saying hey, you know that's dumb.  I think they were trying to stop people from ganging around, like gangs of high schoolers -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't blame them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, driving around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, you know what they have to worry about are the little kids that, you know, that are doing a lot of damage in the neighborhood.  And, um, actually they, you know they, I, I caught kids doing this, and I could identify all 3.  I called the police.  They busted my windshield out of my [INAUDIBLE].  And I thought he did it with his girlfriend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Having a fight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I'm pulling in, and they were throwing chunks of snow like, imagine the middle of a snowman.  Okay, like that.  Two of them were throwing it and trying to hit the windshield as I was pulling in.  I was either, if they were on the road, I would have killed them or crashed the car into someone else's car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It would have caused a big accident, and it would have busted the window all the way in.  And if there were other kids, my kids, my son just [INAUDIBLE] was a girl.  And I called, um, you know, the association, they had a letter and everything.  And they didn't even follow through.  And they just put up another letter.  And I can identify them.  I even told them which building they ran in to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And the police didn't care.  Nobody cares.  Oh, we're looking for these people, blah, blah, blah.  It's like don't bother to put up the sign if you're not willing to do anything about it.  You know?  It's ridiculous.  I'd, you know, I'm just, I'm kind of really, I've, I've been irritable.  I'm disgusted.  I, you know, go and, I went to Walmart with my [AGE] neighbor because she doesn't drive very well.  And she went to the DMV with me, after the DMV taking that stupid test.  [LAUGHING].  We were there like 2 and half hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, um, I see people just stealing, and the employees are watching out for them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My sons can't even get a job there.  These people -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if that happens, if people are stealing, eventually there won't be anything left to steal because the company will go bankrupt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, well, you know, and then, and then, the, they called the employee after this guy has his chinos on, he calls, 2 of the employees were watching out.  His wife's loading her purse.  He calls the employee.  They open up the locked area, you know, for the razor things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, he starts loading his pocket.  I say something to one of the managers, and they start following me and my old friend around.  And I'm like, don't, I don't steal.  I told my kids, don't steal.  And I said if I ever catch you stealing, I'll go make you work at that store for free -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't care what happens.  If they arrest you at they make you do something, you know, besides you'll go back to that store and you'll work for them.  And I will stand there and I will watch you the whole time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which would be humiliating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the management didn't care, or people -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They didn't care, and then they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What store is this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was Walmart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Walmart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should write a letter to corporate headquarters and tell them that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't even think they care.  I, I, my son -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they will care.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No sense in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you get someone don't care, and then they'll fire the managers.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, you know, I push my son, you know, to graduate -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that raises the prices for everyone in some instance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, one person should steal like 50 pairs of baby underwear and stuff like that, baby outfits.  You know, I said, how old is your baby?  Nine months.  Do you think your baby cares if they wear the same 2 or 3 outfits every day of the week?  Or if they have 50?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you buying for, because oh, my baby needs clothes.  I sit there, you don't need 50.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's lazy and doesn't, she's lazy and doesn't want to do laundry is what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's lazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I like your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A baby at 9 months, by the time they're at 10 months, they're out of that size anyway.  You know that and I know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And any, most people know that, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she's just got handfuls of stuff and shove them in her cart, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They could go get free stuff, you know?  And it's terrible.  They are, they could go get used, slightly used stuff and donate their stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always donated my children's clothes, and you know, always to people that need it.  You know, and bikes they outgrew, everything.  I've always donated, unless it was complete trash, but it, it wasn't.  They just went through it so quickly.  I just don't get it.  You know?  I don't get a lot of the things that are happening and it angers me.  You know, the unfairness.  How they treat certain people -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, you know, I clean, I clean a house one day a week, okay?  Because I've tried to find a part time job.  And look at my hands, okay?  I, I work hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do, you know, and this isn't part of the job, this is a 3 story, you know, a 3, a 2 stories.  I do it.  I do the corners, and you know, most maids wouldn't work in the house for that amount of money, and do 12 loads of laundry.  And do the stuff that I do.  But it's honest work.  I'm like, okay, it's helping me till I get a part time job.  I'm doing it for one of my friends, and you know, they were paying me, he was paying another maid, 2 maids, more to do it.  And I've done it better than them, you know?  Even on a, on a rush time.  But I spend like 3 days doing it, you know, during the day, you know, when I don't finish up and do, you know, everything.  And what happened to honest work?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't understand it.  I guess that's because I came from a family of 7.  And my dad, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He relied on you guys to work, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He relied on you guys to work -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To help support the family.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let's talk about this.  You want to get off your Valium, how often you taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, kind, at first because I wasn't able to sleep, um, about 3 times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It has allowed me to sleep the 3 weeks I've been taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And calmed me down and focused me to what I was able to do, which is great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because the Klonopin wasn't doing that.  And, um, I just noticed that I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're down to 3?  Is that what you're taking, 3?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking 3 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Three times a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking 2 pills 3 times a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I started with 1, and it didn't do anything, and I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the 10 mg, you're taking 2 of them 3 times a day.  So that's 60.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  That's more than we thought.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I started with 1, and it just didn't, it didn't work.  That, that's a medicine that it's like after every 4 hours, it wears off and, but I don't take it all the time.  I still have a bunch at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking the Provigil still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I, I'm thinking that, you know, because I'm really not ADHD -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they fill it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, they filled that, the 7.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did they fill the 30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They didn't fill the 30 yet.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  Okay.  They may not.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I'm just really so like low on energy, I take that.  But then, then you know, I don't sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have that problem, and that's the worst thing for me because I become so manic and crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you taking Subutex still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, 8 mg 4 times a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about Ritalin?  Are you taking that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No Ritalin.  So you're just taking Valium and Subutex?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And since, I, I notice, you know, with the Valium -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That my urine smells, but see I had this problem even before then, when I had, when I went to the, um, the urologist.  And I still had the, the strep, and he said it's not coming, he went, he catheterized me.  And now I'm having a total like problem urinating completely.  Um, he said well, your urine is clean.  I don't think it is now.  It's so thick and it smells so bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you got to get that checked out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm drinking a lot of water.  I mean, I've started because I'm going today, otherwise without a little caffeine, and I'm not a coffee drinker, but you know, I've been drinking a lot of water.  But it's still, I mean, it's hard for me to urinate, and my back hurts.  My, and he told me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should go to the ER.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He told me after the [DATE], finishing that prescription now, he told me after finishing that prescription -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Take anymore antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you've got to make sure you don't have a [INAUDIBLE].  If your back hurts maybe the infection is gone up to your kidneys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it ever went, it, I, it never went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So you need to go, where did you go last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, go somewhere else this time.  Um, go like [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where, I don't even know where that is.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, [DEIDENTIFIED] is right over here, down [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, they'll take Medicare or Medicaid like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, you know check yourself in.  Go over there now.  Just tell them here's the problem.  My urine is dark and I've got pain in my back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It smells like it's, it smells worse than poop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, they'll do a urinalysis and stuff like that.  They'll see, you might get admitted for IV antibiotics possibly.  You know, or if not, they might give you some oral.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think they should have done that before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you might need that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because now I'm going, my weight is starting to plunge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because that will affect you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I looked yellow yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and some of the medicines -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like it's yellow and when I took both the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, you need to go get checked out and make sure you [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do I look a little yellow to you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now as far as the Valium that you're taking, yeah, you need to come down off that because you're taking more than you're supposed to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to take it period.  Do I have to wean off of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, otherwise you have a seizure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why can't I just go on Klonopin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, otherwise, well, we could switch you over to Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let's go back to Klonopin?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, let's, uh, we're going to change the Valium to Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now can Valium -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm going to say 2 mg 4 times a day -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Now, and I still have like severe joint pain that's getting worse.  And that's not helping.  I mean it, I don't get this.  I'm not, I'm mot getting why I'm getting up at 1:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, strep can cause joint pain, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they, the RA, it said yes on there, positive -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you could have rheumatic fever.  And that can cause rheumatoid arthritis.  It can affect your kidneys and everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to set everything up and it's become, yesterday it was so uncomfortable to walk that it, and I have so much to do that I don't have time to be messing with this.  And I've tried.  I mean, been going to a doctor once a week, and then him sending me to a urologist.  And the urologist not, I said, well, where's the strep coming from.  I don't know.  Go to a gynecologist.  I go, I did.  And he told me to go to a doctor.  I went to a doctor.  He sent me to you.  Now you're sending me elsewhere and nobody, you know, I just stopped taking all the antibiotics and I've noticed this is been getting worse and worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you probably need antibiotics intravenously.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you need to get checked out.  Make sure you're not going on kidney fail, because if you've had all this strep, I mean, you know, you could have acute, um, kidney failure, acute kidney failure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I noticed like yesterday, I looked really yellow.  Look at this.  I'm starting to look yellow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That started yesterday, and when I put lotion on because I'm really dry.  That's, you know, from doing the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or it could be hepatitis from other things you've done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never shot up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you can still get -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never done needles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hepatitis from some [INAUDIBLE].  You can, it's infectious sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can get it through sex or things like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or even bad food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only person I've ever been with has been, you know, um, well, I was married to 20 years to the same, same, you know.  We had 20 years.  I was with the man, married to the man and had my 2 children.  I got remarried again, and you know, he did give me HPV.  He told me he didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?  Until after he had a break out, you know, 3 weeks after we were married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, [PATIENT NAME], I would like, um, to consider something else like Lamictal, Depakote, some of those other things.  But first they've got to make sure that you're okay.  I can't put you on lithium because your kidneys could be all messed up.  So you need to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] now.  Okay?  It's down [DEIDENTIFIED].  You have a car or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  You just go down [DEIDENTIFIED].  You know where [DEIDENTIFIED] is.  Okay, 2 miles down, big hospital there.</p>

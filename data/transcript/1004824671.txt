<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you vote?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not yet. You?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I hope it's not too crowded. I'm going to go after. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Most of the lines have died down. If there were lines. I assume there were. It's nearby. (inaudible at 00:00:23) So I don't know. But (inaudible at 00:00:30) have school today? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I don't know if it does. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible] does not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because they're using the school as a polling place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Professional—that might be the reason. I know the high school is one of the big locations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Unbelievable lines. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Professional development day. They seem to have a lot of those in the area. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (inaudible) everywhere. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) So I remembered why I get so pissed off at Jess. And it's like Halloween and I'm just trying to take Lucille's picture. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And Lucille's obviously—doesn't want me to. Just eh, eh, eh. You know? But Jess has to like intervene and say, "Oh she doesn't—stop. She doesn't want you doing that." You know? When it's like—so doesn't that send a message to the kid that (pause at 00:01:44] to [00:01:50)—I don't know. When she reprimands me doesn't that make me less—doesn't that add to the kid's separation anxiety? [00:02:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could. Oh. Separation anxiety with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: From me. You know it's like she shows up at soccer and the kid wants nothing to do with me. And so there are these periods of times where she's just like doesn't want to be bothered while other times she does. And I think she gives into letting her be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It certainly could. I mean if essentially Lucille feels like you're tougher on her and Jess is always siding with her that could contribute. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to take the kid's picture. And there are other things too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She makes this eh noise. This squealing noise when she's upset. (makes noise) I can't do it. My throat's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last couple of days I haven't been all muscousy and puking. It's just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Head cold? [00:03:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) It got pretty bad for a little while there. I was even contemplating taking some kind of nasal stuff at night to stop everything from dripping down. I think I finally—first there was the cough. And then there was the nose. (inaudible at 00:03:29) (pause until [00:03:36) I'm too worked up. Maybe I shouldn't move my feet and give you signals. (chuckles) </p>

<p>It feels difficult to get work done today with the election. And I think I'm just going to go to the office for a little bit and get some things done there. And come home and watch the election results. Or at least the non-stop coverage. Who voted where. Mitt already voted so it's safe for you to go vote. What a pain in the ass it must be for people trying to get to work and you've got the secret service and the media. I'm sure he goes to the front of the line. That'd be funny if they made him wait. [00:04:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) (pause at 00:04:31] until [00:04:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it looks like Obama is supposed to win. So. Unless there is some -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't—they reprimanded me and stopped letting me read his articles because I read too many. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can only get like ten articles a month or something like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had to sign up for the New York Times. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can quit tomorrow. It's like ninety-nine cents a week. I don't know if I have to do it for a certain period of time. But even all the other ones that do it as well have Obama. [00:05:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the (inaudible at 00:05:28) which is where people trade at stocks. They basically bet on who is going to win is up to sixty-seven percent for Obama. So and that's the lowest of the percentage to win. I think (inaudible at 00:05:48) up over eighty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah he's up over ninety this morning. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Was he really? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Real clear politics is over seventy. (inaudible at 00:05:56) You know when Romney's planning on campaigning today that he's in trouble. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Why bother?" I mean how many people are you really going to affect? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Most states people have already voted with early voting. In Florida they stand in line to early vote. It's like what's the point? (pause at 00:06:21] to [00:06:31) So I have all these titles I've got to do that have just been stacking up. They just keep coming in and coming in. And I don't seem to be doing any of them. (sighs) Good news because it's more money that I'm owed. [00:06:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: We get like two checks a month. Two, three. Now I get more than that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like checks for two titles or two checks for a bunch of titles?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I probably get paid like four or five a month. But I do more than that. So he owes me over twelve or two thousand dollars. So. I need to get around to sending him an e-mail with all the—I send him the ones that are over ninety days. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a good number of them. So. Because some of them just close and they don't get around to sending the check out. (inaudible at 00:07:32) close. (pause at 00:07:34] to [00:07:41) I've got a good number of re-fis. (inaudible at 00:07:47) (pause until [00:08:08) I went to that concert with my friend Paige on Saturday. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She says I should do Match.com. That I should go on anonymously and look at other men's profiles. And take ideas from them. I don't know. Something creeps me out about the whole thing. And you've got to communicate with these people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The women?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah. (inaudible at 00:08:37)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I might be contacted by men. I'm not sure. But I don't know. (pause at 00:08:45] to [00:08:53) I don't know what I would put. To tell you I have been bored to the point of actually cleaning up a little bit. Slightly. I made my bed once. Maybe twice. I saw something on TV that mentioned how you make you bed -. [00:09:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And do other stuff. And maybe that was the day that I kind of (inaudible at 00:09:24). I've still got a long way to go. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But at least there is like crap up off the floor. And just business cards. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just crap sitting on the floor. Stuff that falls off the desk. The next step is cleaning the dresser off where I just come in and drop everything. Soccer is over. There is a picture I posted on Facebook of just all the kids going crazy during the photo. Which reminds me of just how crazy they all are. [00:10:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Right. I know what coaching is like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It wouldn't seem normal for them to just all be sitting there smiling. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's kind of nice. I know Ian is going to miss it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He had fun (inaudible at 00:10:32).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He misbehaves at the practice which drives me nuts. But the games he behaves. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He probably had fun with you being the coach.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (inaudible at 00:10:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that that made him behave (inaudible at 00:10:51). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'd get pissed. I'd be kind of getting angry with him because it's like I've got to baby-sit ten other kids. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And at least I had my assistant coach and she would deal with the ones that are crying and need their nose wiped. But he—I don't know. I think part of it was just it's Friday. And he's just all wound up. And a ton of energy. [00:11:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes he shows up and he's tired from school. And he always claims his stomach hurts. But I think he just doesn't want to play. But most times he's out there and just kicking balls and running the wrong way and not running at all. And I don't think he would do any of these behaviors if I wasn't coaching. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:11:45] to [00:11:51)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I might lose my assistant coach in the spring. She said—she's Jewish. And she's like—Friday night when have our practices is one night they get together for dinner and light the candles. And do all that crap. And it's like, "Yep. We're going to have Friday practice in the spring." What works for me and that's really all that matters. [00:12:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. And no one seems to really have a problem with that. All the parents are like—they're just so grateful I'm out there watching their kids while they're not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I don't know if we're going to have a post season party or not. (inaudible at 00:12:42) I'm supposed to. We should do something in the winter. Get the kids together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it will be the same group of kids in the spring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For the most part, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this team—since there are no girls it's all boys—they mixed in another team with ours. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anybody who returns will be on the team in the spring. The magical team. [00:13:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Magical team. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's our cheer. Ian actually came up the cheer because there is this cheer that we do—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: This whole team thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so Ian had turned that into, "When I say this you say that." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:13:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So had to come up with something. "When I say ... you say ..." You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he came up I think with magical team. "When I say magical you say team." They love that cheer. So. He's got some creative—you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Gene somewhere. I don't know where he gets it from. Not me. (pause at 00:14:11] until [00:14:20) The whole Match.com thing has me thinking about how difficult the whole dating and—Paige was surprised. She was like, "Are you dating?" And I'm like, "No." She said, "Just go on Match.com." But that's terrifying to me. I guess for some people it's a no brainer. And they have no problems with it. (pause at 00:14:51] until [00:14:59) I don't know what it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is it terrifying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Talk to women. [00:15:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there is some danger there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it's a prerequisite. (pause at 00:15:15] until [00:15:22) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I know at some point I'm going to have to break down and do it. Doing nothing isn't helping. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:15:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like most of the people I hang out with around the city are much younger than I am. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So they really don't have friends who they could set me up with. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Where in the E&G group you've got all these old ladies trying to set up their divorced friends that are all like (inaudible). [00:16:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Like pretty much a long distance relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably all fat too. (inaudible at 00:16:22) not fat. (inaudible) little fat and then just too fat. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's—maybe that's my fear right there. (pause at 00:16:39] until [00:16:44) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well going out with someone who I find unattractive. I mean I assume you exchange pictures?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so. Yeah. I think there are pictures right there on the site aren't there? On people's profiles?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess. I did look some women's profiles the other night. I don't know. (pause at 00:17:10] until [00:17:23) I really don't have any dating clothes either. What do you wear on a date? This is like—dressed up. Casual. [00:17:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the matter with that? (pause at 00:17:34] until [00:17:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you're afraid of being rejected. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That too. (pause at 00:17:56] until [00:18:01) Long standing fear. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe -</p>

<p>CLIENT: But can you be rejected on—well I think once you have the date you can be rejected. (pause at 00:18:12] until [00:18:18) But I guess they would never contact you if they weren't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think there must be some mutual interest, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause at 00:18:25] until [00:18:46) I put on there—like I would put on there—(inaudible at 00:18:49) practice. Help me get some 45-year-old divorced guy that's mean and tough and had ten knee surgeries. [00:18:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) (pause at 00:19:00] until [00:19:11)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They all look like robo-cop when they play. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:19:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Braces. And they're still faster than me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: With braces on. Jump higher than me. (pause at 00:19:25] until [00:19:35) Yeah so I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of the last couple crushes you've had -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that a professional term?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you describe them? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I'm thinking of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just makes me feel twelve. (chuckles) [00:19:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? (pause at 00:19:58] until [00:20:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last few times you were in puppy love—(chuckles). I mean that's the same thing. It makes me feel twelve. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Does this whole thing make you feel twelve? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No not really. But the word [crush] (inaudible at 00:20:20)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The word crutch does. (pause at 00:20:22] until [00:20:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) showed interest. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. People in whom you have romantic interest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (inaudible at 00:20:33) (pause at 00:20:35] until [00:21:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were painful. (pause at 00:21:01] until [00:21:07) (inaudible) and Claire. (pause at 00:21:08] until [00:21:15) What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was trying to show anger towards them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Okay. (inaudible at 00:21:21) Now I get it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was saying—you know. [00:21:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That I got. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. (groaning)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it makes you pretty nervous huh? Terrified? Did you say terrified?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of the process. Terrifying. The whole Match.com thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect it's the dating thing as much as this Match.com. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:21:48) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:21:49] until [00:21:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You have to talk to these women. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you do in those awkward moments when no one is talking? (inaudible at 00:22:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it doesn't make you feel that you're twelve. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:13) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) fair? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Control freak. Because when you say control freak -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Control—yeah. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought you would enjoy that one. [00:22:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:22:32) That's like the one—more of like a kid one. Knock, knock. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Come in. I'm twelve. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you heard the (inaudible at 00:22:59) one? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:23:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's Ian' favorite. I remember when he first learned it and he kept trying to tell it. (laughter) It never came out right. But now he can do it for multiple animals. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:23:18) pig. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) (pause at 00:23:19] until [00:23:32) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I hope there is not a big line. I have to go into the city today to do a title for something that's already closed. [00:23:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of never finished it. And this client wants to see it. So I probably should finish it. And find out if there is anything that I need to fix. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (long pause at 00:23:50] until [00:24:46) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) new car. Even though I'm saving gas I'm driving it more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like a day like today I probably wouldn't normally go to the office but I'm going to go anyway. I'm waiting on a check. So I want to deposit that. (inaudible) [00:25:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah the extent that you're driving it more to get work done. Yeah. (inaudible at 00:25:06) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But like yesterday I went in for maybe two hours. (inaudible at 00:25:19) But I was productive in those two hours. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:25:24) (pause at 00:25:32] until [00:25:43) Facebook is insane right now. (inaudible at 00:25:46) political (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The election? Like ads and stuff or people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just what people are saying. You know? First there was people's opinions and now—people who are trying to persuade people which is (inaudible at 00:26:01) to me. But impassioned pleas. And there are the people who tell you to go vote. I'm just like, "Come on. Show pictures of your kids." [00:26:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what Facebook is for. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A joke. (inaudible at 00:26:18) video. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause at 00:26:18] until [00:26:24) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Facebook is not supposed to be too—well a friend of mine posted that his mom just died. So but that's kind of what Facebook is for. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:26:33] until [00:26:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) But I think there will just be a series of "I'm leaving the country" posts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it will be over with. (pause at 00:26:53] until [00:27:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How worried are you about the election? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I have mixed emotions. Normally I'm very worried. [00:27:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know there will be some benefits to my business if Romney was elected. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think the social issues are more important to me. Supreme Court Justices. Things like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'd still rather have Obama win. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:27:40) I'm voting for Jill Stein. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For Senator?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For President. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:27:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She ran for Governor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's with the Green Party. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I figured I had to vote for an anti-war, civil liberty candidate and there were two options. And the other one is too conservative (inaudible). [00:28:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's kind of a crazy green lady. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's Jewish too. So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I assume. Stein. (pause at 00:28:16] until [00:28:21) It's the name of the drummer for one of my favorite bands. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:28:25) She's got that going for her. But I figured it's the state. Obama is going to win. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I voted for (inaudible at 00:28:42) because she's—well some polls have her far ahead. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? I heard (inaudible at 00:28:47). </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then the last poll that came out yesterday had her trailing by a point. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but that's just one poll compared to a bunch (inaudible). [00:28:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. (inaudible at 00:29:00)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can just tell by the desperation in Scott Brown's ad versus hers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause at 00:29:08] until [00:29:20) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that one is more important than the President. We need another Democrat in the Senate. (pause at 00:29:27] until [00:29:42) I think she won't be afraid to block stuff that she doesn't believe in. Where I think some Democratic Senators don't really have spines. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's tough. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't want to be married to her. You don't hear much from her husband. I saw there was an interview with her and he was just sitting there. Old guy. [00:30:09] (pause until [00:30:22) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you afraid of that with—it occurred to me that with dating-I was thinking of Elizabeth Warren as compared to the tough, mid forties chick that you were afraid of ending up with. And I guess I wonder—that makes me wonder if part of your worry is that you're going to wind up with somebody who is sort of tough and bossy. Which I think you would describe Jess as. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you worry about your own kind of nervousness around certain people. About what to say. Making you vulnerable to some tough, bossy woman who is going to—(inaudible) [00:31:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Theoretically I have some control over that but you never know that they're tough and bossy until it's too late. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't see them tough and bossy until they start being tough and bossy with you. (pause at 00:31:32] until [00:31:39)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me [that this is a big worry] you bring to dating. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. I can put that on my profile. Tough and bossy chicks need not apply. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Need not apply. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You think that's going to scare other women too? Especially if I use the word chicks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's up to you what you put on your profile. (chuckles) [00:32:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you use the word chicks and someone is offended by it then you're not going to get any women who are offended by the word chicks is one way of looking at it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I should sell to what I want not to what I'm afraid of. Right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's the very point we're talking about. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I should just have women I'm afraid of. Tough and bossy. Tough and injured. Well they can be tough. I don't mind tough women. I just don't want them being tough with me. (pause at 00:32:45] until [00:32:53) (inaudible) (pause at 00:32:55] until [00:33:07) Should I put on there that I'm a slob? [00:33:09] (pause until [00:33:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You poll for bossiness a bit huh? Do you think I should do my page this way? Or that way? Is it okay if I put this on there? (inaudible at 00:33:27)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get that from my mom. She's a poller. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She always had to ask my advice for everything. And then go do the exact opposite. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But she asked all her friends what she should do. (pause at 00:33:38] until [00:33:45) Anything with her computer she calls me up. I tell her to call my friend. She's like, "I already tried." (pause at 00:33:56] until [00:34:07) (sighs) (pause continues until [00:34:26) I'm going to go snowboarding this winter. [00:34:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And all my snowboarding stuff, equipment, is at the house. So Jess's going to know that I'm going to go snowboarding. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which might make her—I don't know. Not so much jealous but knowing that I'm spending money on going snowboarding. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Instead of the kids. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've already volunteered to pay the rest of our legal bill for our tax attorney, which is like $1500 bucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm already spending the settlement from (inaudible at 00:35:13). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've also got a big water bill. Which they just liened. But I don't want to spend money on the water bill if we're not going to keep the house. You know? [00:35:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just throwing $2000 bucks out the door. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know what's going on with that. The bank calls me. And they always kind of call me at an inopportune time when I can't take the call. And they never leave a message. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. But yeah so. They just have to kind of get over—if I'm going to do it anyway. I probably should go get them early before I'm going to go because I know—I want to take Ian to have lessons. Ski lessons. I can't really go snowboarding with him. (inaudible at 00:36:12) Teach him and watch him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I'd prefer to pull him out of school one day when the mountain is empty. [00:36:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:36:22) But if I take him I'm not going to get any (inaudible at 00:36:31). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't be able to leave him at a lesson and go? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess during the lesson I could go snowboarding. But is it worth paying for a lift ticket for an hour or forty-five minutes? Probably not. (pause at 00:36:52] until [00:37:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Lessons are short like that? (inaudible at 00:37:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it depends. But I think your basic group lesson is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially (inaudible at 00:37:11) beginners (inaudible). I'm not sure how it all works. He wants to do cross country skiing which I would have to take a lesson too. It's something we could do together. But I want to go snowboarding. I may just go by myself. [00:37:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: During the day go out to (inaudible at 00:37:38) and get some good snow. (pause at 00:37:43] until [00:37:50) Now that I have a little bit of extra money. Instead of blowing it on (inaudible at 00:37:54) I can blow it on snowboarding. (sighs) A little bit of exercise in winter. Make up—a day on the mountain is probably (inaudible at 00:38:14). Probably a little more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:19) </p>

<p>CLIENT: At least I'm back on the track of doing my exercise. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel better now that I've (inaudible). [00:38:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. That's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Still not riding my bike. Sunday I went out to the pub and I drove. I don't know if it's because I had a new car or I was just lazy. I'm not sure. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cold weather too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:39:05) (pause at 00:39:05] until [00:39:13) You warm up. (inaudible at 00:39:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause at 00:39:16] until [00:39:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I hope there is not a big line. If there is a big line I might not even go today but I really should. Actually I'm going to go tomorrow. I can theoretically get what I'm doing today done tomorrow. Do some title work. Get caught up on some of these titles. [00:39:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: By staying at home. It's bad for my back but I could set up my desk. There is no TV. I put the eco button on my car to get better gas mileage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. What does that do? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It kind of takes away a little bit of the pep. (inaudible at 00:40:22) speed up real quickly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (inaudible at 00:40:26) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So there are two things. There are green lights around your odometer and mileage. How fast you're going and all that. When those green lights are on that means you're driving to save gas. [00:40:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that there is one part of training you—and this is on all the time. You can turn it off. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But even when you don't have the button on the green lights come on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And they turn white when you're not driving—like gunning it up a hill. The white would come on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But there is actual—when the button is on it's all these screens so it doesn't let you gun it up the hill. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's interesting. When I first bought the car I drove it like that. And then I think for the city driving where you really don't need to gun it I leave the button on to see how much of a difference it makes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:41:30) how much gas you're saving now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe somewhere in the manual it gives you per gallon based on the button. So. (pause at 00:41:39] until [00:41:55) Yeah I guess it's a little nerve wracking. I've got to wait up for the election results. I think there is just the uncertainty. (pause at 00:42:03] until [00:42:15) Good day to take a nap. Wake up at ten o'clock and stay up all night and watch the returns. They're saying there is a good chance we might not even not know until a day or two. [00:42:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because of how close it might be and there might be recalls. If it's real close there are automatic recalls. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like Florida. (inaudible at 00:42:38) That's all we need right now is a recall in Florida. (sighs) (pause at 00:42:46] until [00:43:01) Are you going to vote during the day or are you going to wait till—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably the evening. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Whew. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah the lines will be bad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You're not going to bail? See if I waited till (inaudible at 00:43:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really want to go just to vote for the senate. It's the only one that makes a real difference. [00:43:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:43:34) my life. (pause at 00:43:35] until [00:43:44)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we should finish up for now. I think (inaudible at 00:43:46) on Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: As long as I remember. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:43:58) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah you too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. [00:44:00] [end of audio]</p>

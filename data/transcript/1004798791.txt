<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Among very many things I don't understand, I don't understand why I would've been so afraid to tell anybody that I was upset or that I was unhappy. Rhetorical question, sort of. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As a kid, do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like looking back, I'm like what was up with that? Like that was the most important thing. (pause) Which I got there by saying I don't understand why nobody noticed that I was so unhappy. </p>

<p>[01:08.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is just as dramatic to me, actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And now, because I don't know whether it was actually that nobody noticed or whether people noticed and I kind of said "No, no, no, it's okay, I'm fine" and they believed me. But why would they believe me also? Like what's up with that? (pause) </p>

<p>So Amanda and I, you know, we talk about Stone occasionally because occasionally Stone finds out where we are and sends us requests for donations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uhh, what—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Stone is my school, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) That's the—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a private school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Private school, K through 8.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>[01:58.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) our town in Texas, which is a pretty fucked-up town anyway. Basically everyone there has an income of over $500K or under $25K.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, it's like the sort of town where (chuckles) they put in a whole row of subsidized housing, I think mainly because it got too annoying that the people who were cleaning the houses couldn't afford to live close enough to actually get there. (laughter) That's cruel. That's about 10 percent too cruel. Yeah, I don't like it. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And why were you in private school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because my dad—- my parents had both been educated in private schools and because they thought I would get a better education.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>[03:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So—- I'm sorry, I'm just struck by the [cognition between] they need a private school in a town that sounds like it was quite wealthy enough to probably have pretty good schools in it, but not making sure you were doing your homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For eight years or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's very characteristic of my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That doesn't surprise me at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) The logic takes a while. It's just like "Oh, that's just my dad." You know, making just immense sacrifices in order for us to be able to go there. I asked him once when I was in college "Some of my friends' parents had college funds. Why didn't you do that?" </p>

<p>[04:01.5]</p>

<p>And he said "Well, I spent the money on your private school." Like, you know—- and I found out just a couple of years ago when I ended up with an old bill that St. Margaret's (sp?), like the school had funded 90 percent of my—- like I had big scholarships, but it was still like he was paying very much up to the edge of what would feed us. (chuckles) But it was like he just didn't trust the public school system at all. Yeah. From the outside, Stone looks like a pretty remarkable school. </p>

<p>[04:53.9]</p>

<p>Like it's got lots of innovative programs and really nice facilities and lots of teaching awards and da da da da da. And it does have all those things. It's just like they're just so clueless in other ways. (pause) Yeah. Like they failed my sister. Amanda's science teacher gave her a failing grade because she had to leave class once a week to go to therapy the year that our parents got divorced, which meant that she had to miss lab every week. And the teacher failed her. It never occurred to anybody, like the teacher didn't talk to my dad or talk to Amanda or work anything out. She just failed her.</p>

<p>[06:00.0]</p>

<p>I don't understand that. I mean, part of it was like I guess we were kind of—- you know, I don't think that would be the case now because this was, you know, 20 years later and we're more used to parents splitting up. But it's not like this was the beginning of that wave, 20 years ago. I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>Amanda and I, we kind of compared notes at one point and realized that both of us had kind of a chip on our shoulder because we felt like anytime anyone at Stone talked to one of us, they talked about how awesome the other person was.</p>

<p>[07:01.8]</p>

<p>So everyone told me how good Amanda was at sports, and I was terrible at sports. Everyone told Amanda what a gifted writer I was. Amanda is an incredibly gifted writer, but they didn't notice or something. (pause) </p>

<p>Yeah. And you know, the year after I graduated from college, I got hired at St. Margaret's (sp?). I didn't have teaching experience or a Master's, so they sent me to teacher camp. The Texas Association of Independent Schools runs like a week-long training program, like a crash course in education for people exactly like me. I call it teacher camp because we had way too much fun.</p>

<p>[08:00.6]</p>

<p>It was actually a really good course, but there was also like drunken karaoke with the instructors. It was in San Antonio, Texas so it was like the kind of bar where they had Bud and Bud Light, and it comes in a mason jar. Literally comes in a mason jar. It was just really fun. (chuckles) </p>

<p>But so the guy who teaches that, the English concentration, his name was Jeffery and he teaches at Stone. He didn't ever teach me. He taught Amanda at one point, and he came in to guest lecture a couple of times. I was in a radio play with him when I was a little girl, so like I knew him, I knew him around. He had been teaching at the private high school in the area when I was there and then went back to Stone.</p>

<p>[09:03.0]</p>

<p>He just loves that place. He loves it. He's really smart and a good teacher and really committed to the idea of independent schools as something that's good for society as opposed to bad for society. You know, to want independent schools to do well and what they need to be doing better. And he like worships the headmaster—- I think he's retired now—- who was there the entire time I was there, and who I think like his personality really kind of stamped the school, and talked about what a mentor he was for him and everything.</p>

<p>[10:00.9]</p>

<p>And he kept telling me "Oh, you should come back and visit. We are so proud of you. Everyone here remembers you so fondly." Like, you know,—- who was it? Crap, I can't remember his name. It was my English teacher in sixth and eighth grade. Like "Oh, he brags about you" blah blah blah. Like what is this? There's just this discrepancy here. I didn't really have it in me to say, at that point, that I'm not going to go back and visit because those were the worst years of my entire life and because I feel like I begged for help and was refused over and over and over again. Like I didn't have it in me to say that.</p>

<p>[11:04.8]</p>

<p>So I just kind of said "Hmmmmm, maybe" and, you know, shuttered it away every time. But—- (pause) I don't know. (pause) I remember very clearly at the beginning of seventh grade, they split the class into two halves. Like, you know, seven-ones and seven-twos, and I think there was probably some splitting in terms of like development or difficulty of courses or whatever, but they never really said. In seventh grade—- so there were like the people who were like actively bullying me and the people who were kind of neutral, and a couple of people with whom I would occasionally hang out because they were the people who were also getting bullied.</p>

<p>[12:10.7]</p>

<p>In seventh grade, people who—- I was basically in a class with nobody that was not hostile to me or that I felt was not going to be hostile to me. So I asked my dad, you know, "Can we go and ask if I can switch?" And we went to them and I remember like bursting into tears in the office, like really having to be like "I'm not going to cry over this. I'm not going to cry" and then just not being able to stop crying because I was so afraid of what was going to happen in the next year. (voice trembling) And "Please let me be with people that are nice to me" and they didn't do it. They just said "No, we can't do that." (pause)</p>

<p>[13:04.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's awful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And probably fucked up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I don't know why. (pause) I don't know. That was a big year. A lot of stuff happened that year. I started taking Latin. The teacher was kind of an advocate for me. Later on, Papa told me that she told him he should just send me somewhere else, that he should take me out of that school. But she was the Latin teacher and she was just like "You just work at your own pace. We'll catch up eventually."</p>

<p>[14:03.6]</p>

<p>So I would just work ahead in the Latin book. It was really fun because I was just so bored in the class. That was the year I quit school. Did I tell you about quitting school? That I came home and was like "I'm not going back." I think what had happened was we had sports at the end of the day, and we were changing back into our clothes, and a couple of people had hid some of my clothes and were laughing at me because I couldn't find my clothes. (pause) And I just eventually—- I don't remember whether I found them or not. I think it was like socks, so it was something I could do without. But I went and my dad picked me up and I got in the car and I said "I'm not going back there. I don't want to go back. I'm not going to school tomorrow."</p>

<p>[15:06.5]</p>

<p>And then he said "Okay." And so I took like two weeks off, and I don't know what negotiating happened behind the scenes, but I did visit the public school in the area. There was this girl, Emily. She was the person who got bullied more than I did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At Stone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At Stone. (pause) She feels like my doppelganger in some ways. (pause) I also bullied her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember you mentioned feeling really bad about having bullied her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I spent a long time feeling really bad about that. Probably would still feel really bad about that if I thought about it very hard. (pause)</p>

<p>[16:08.3]</p>

<p>I wrote to her on Facebook, it's been a year or so ago, and I apologized. And she was like "Dude, it's totally okay." (laughter) That was really fucked up. It was like "Yes." (laughter) Because it kind of seems like there is so much other shit going on in her life that that fucked up situation wasn't even really on the radar. Like she's just had some bad stuff happen to her. (pause) </p>

<p>But she had left after sixth grade, so she was like the person who was like my buddy when I was visiting the public school that she was in now, and she was really happy, or was so much happier. I kind of thought maybe I could have this. (pause) </p>

<p>[17:11.9]</p>

<p>But, you know, the stuff they were doing in class was boring. It was more boring than what I was doing, and I really wanted to be in the play. They do a big eighth grade play every year that's a good, real production. I just really wanted to be in it. Everyone got cast. (pause) But I got a kind of crap role when it came down to it, which I was upset about. (pause)</p>

<p>[18:01.4]</p>

<p>It seemed like the whole class kind of said, like when I just didn't show up, they were like "Oh yeah, I guess we weren't being nice to her. We're sorry." So I came back. They showed they were sorry for about two days, and then it kind of sucked again. But they weren't as mean. People weren't as mean. </p>

<p>When I was in sixth grade, I—- did I tell you about the lice? This is the worst. When I was in sixth grade, I came back from summer camp with lice, and neither of my parents knew that was what it was. Apparently neither of my parents ever had lice or had to deal with it because they didn't notice until like—- it went on for like—- I had lice for months.</p>

<p>[19:08.6]</p>

<p>For actually, I think, literally months. My dad thought I had fleas because they were big, so he got flea shampoo and was like "Here, wash your hair with this." It was horrible and I didn't know what was happening. (chuckles) Blessedly, finally, this lady-—she had two sons who were around Amanda's and my age and was a friend of the family and I think kind of, you know, adopted Amanda and I in some ways—- was like "your child has lice. What the fuck is wrong with you?" (laughter) And so she got the shampoo and combed my hair and got everything out and took care of it.</p>

<p>[20:05.8]</p>

<p>And I took a day off school when this was happening, but it was on a day of the week that a girl who was one of the people who was the meanest to me—- I think she was also somebody that some pretty bad shit happened to. Yeah. I did taekwondo with her dad, and he was a bad guy. </p>

<p>She would come over to our house on Wednesdays because her parents were working at that time, and they would pick her up in the evening. I was kind of constantly trying to be friends versus trying to avoid her because she would then be horrible to me. Like back and forth with her. So one of the things that I did was I shared with her, to try to be friends with her, and so I told her about this.</p>

<p>[21:03.8]</p>

<p>Oh no. No, no, no. This was not one of the things I told her about. My dad—- Papa talked to me about it in front of her. That's what happened. And afterward I was like "What? Why did you do that? You should not have done that." He was like "Oh. Whoops." He just didn't understand. </p>

<p>And so I came back—- the day that I got back, they had taken my desk—- there were like three stations of like six desks in a huddle, but obviously there was like some degree to which it was like the student's prerogative, because they had taken my desk and put it in the farthest away corner of the room, facing the wall. And I just came in and sat down there, and like—- (pause)</p>

<p>[22:02.7]</p>

<p>Yeah. Like everybody talked about it. (pause) That was really bad. (pause) I was so ashamed, but so angry because I knew that it wasn't my fault. (voice trembling) That none of it was my fault, but it wasn't enough that I knew. (pause) (crying) It's still not enough that I know. I've been doing the same reasoning process that I did when I was 11 or 12, and it's still not good enough. It still feels like I deserved all of that or like I brought all of that down on myself. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know entirely about that, but one thing that occurs to me is that it was all your father's fault.</p>

<p>[23:04.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) (sniffling) Yeah. (pause) Yeah. I hated him for a really long time. (pause) I mean, at that time I hated him. Really up until I had been away at school for a while. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even the way you put it, when he told you in front of her—- what was her name?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fiona (sp?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fiona (sp?), sorry. Like "Why did you do that? You shouldn't have done that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure that's what I actually said, but—- (pause)</p>

<p>[24:08.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It must have been] very critical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess clearly what I'm sort of wondering about is how much you tended to let him off the hook.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I mean, I let him off the hook more now than I did then. It's harder for me to be critical of him now than it was then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I could never express criticism of him then because he would get so angry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I was critical of him in kind of saying "This is going to work out badly for me, and you should have known that," that he would yell.</p>

<p>[25:20.2]</p>

<p>He would blow up. (pause) Yeah. I know that I was absolutely convinced that that was what happened 80 percent of the time when I expressed criticism of him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he would blow up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and yell and tell me it was my fault. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did it look like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It's hard for me to remember, actually. (pause)</p>

<p>[26:22.8]</p>

<p>It's been a long time since he blew up like that. (pause) He would be angry about things that it didn't occur to me that he could be angry about before he started talking about them. Then I would think how did I not know that this was coming? You know, he would swear sometimes. He would yell. (pause) You know, he would say things like "You don't do this to people. You don't do x." (pause)</p>

<p>[27:18.9]</p>

<p>I don't know why I can't remember well. (pause) You know, I remember like a couple of times vividly. Like I remember him coming in my room once when I was getting ready for school, and it was like a disaster area as always. But he hadn't been in my room for several days, and he'd told me to clean it up several days before. So I think he assumed that something would have been done, which flew in the face of anything that had ever happened ever. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like any parent anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Well, I don't know that part. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I do. (laughter) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So I was just like getting ready for school—- (crying) The phrase like "You're living in shit" comes to mind, but I don't that that's exactly what he said.</p>

<p>[28:28.2]</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure he swore. I know that he picked up my dirty clothes and threw them at me. (pause) I know that it lasted for like at least five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. I didn't say anything. I would just kind of stand there and wait for it to be over and cry, but I would try not to cry. Then he said "You're not going to school today. You're going to stay home and you're going to clean up this mess." (pause) So then he left, and I started cleaning things up and it just kind of rehearsed in my mind, like all of the reasons how he was acting was not fair.</p>

<p>[29:24.4]</p>

<p>Just saying "This is so unfair. This is so unfair." And "I hate you. This is so unfair." And then two hours later, it was clear that he felt bad about it, and so he was like "Oh, I'm going to lunch with somebody from the church. Here, you come along." And I went to lunch but he couldn't just apologize. He couldn't say "That wasn't right." He would try to like sheepishly make up for it, but I was like "That's bogus."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That wasn't really taking responsibility for what he did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And owning up to it too. So about how old were you? I mean, not exactly, but is that like six, nine, 13?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nine or 10. I remember him yelling from at least like fourth grade on. Maybe third grade. But it felt like it had always been there. (pause)</p>

<p>[31:02.5]</p>

<p>I was so scared. (crying) (pause) And I never knew when it was going to happen. I could never be good enough for him to do things differently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, it sounds like he was terribly inconsistent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you had this fantasy that if you were good enough or perceptive enough or smart enough or vigilant enough, you could have protected yourself. </p>

<p>[32:03.8]</p>

<p>You could have done what you needed to do and kept it from happening. Which, you know, is completely impossible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crying) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, is it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and for reasons having nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I know. Sort of. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My room was above the kitchen. I couldn't always hear conversations, but I could hear when people were talking. I would just listen to gauge where he was. (pause) Like he would be yelling at Amanda downstairs, and I would just sit upstairs, like shaking.</p>

<p>[33:13.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he also hit you guys or your mom or push you or anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He never did. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, that's not required to terrify the hell out of a kid. I just—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's—- I mean, it's the same thing that had happened with Bryan (ph). If he had hit me, I would've—- like I had been told that it's not okay for adults to hit you in anger or in an inappropriate way. So I would have told somebody. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, but somehow this was more okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah, nobody told me that there was a way that you could yell at somebody that would be not like just a parent yelling at a child in an appropriate way. I don't know why anyone thinks it's appropriate to yell at children, but they do. It is what it is.</p>

<p>[34:19.1]</p>

<p>I think—- I imagine that he was probably very very afraid of his own anger. The story that he told us about why he didn't spank us was that when Amanda was like two, he like slapped her on the hand when she did something, when he was angry. And either she said something or she just looked at him and he was like "That is really not okay. No, I cannot do that." So I imagine he—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's bullshit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is bullshit. Exactly. That he said "Okay, this is where I'm drawing the line" and that helped him be okay with the fact that he was completely out of control.</p>

<p>[35:18.6]</p>

<p>That he felt like he had some control because he wasn't hitting us, but he did not have any control. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope, and you didn't have much either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) (pause) No, but it's a lot easier to understand when you're an adult why a six-year-old doesn't have her shit together than it does when you're six. You know, I could never understand why I couldn't just do my homework. I never understood. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, everyone else did their homework. (crying) It was just me. (pause) </p>

<p>[36:19.2]</p>

<p>I still remember when I was introduced to the concept of flashcards. You know, I was in fourth grade and I had been failing geometry—- or, not geometry, geography—- quizzes for like months. Finally, our nanny, sat down with me and she made flashcards and she drilled me on them, and then I knew them. (pause) It was like oh, revelation. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were pretty badly neglected in some ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I was always glad that nobody noticed when I would go wandering off into the woods by myself for hours. But in retrospect, maybe that's not okay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[37:21.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not okay. It's not okay that you didn't do homework for years and mostly got no help or support for that. It's not okay that you had lice for weeks or months, or however long it was, and then somebody else—- it was so obvious that somebody else had to tell your dad what the fuck was going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like both my mom and my dad missed that. Like both of them talked to me about it, like "Oh, what's that?" It was like "I don't know." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get the impression they were so kind of absorbed in their own whirlwind or whatever that they—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my mom was dating a very wealthy man whose son was in Amanda's class. Yeah.</p>

<p>[38:26.9]</p>

<p>My dad—- Angela (ph) was around by then. She also, I think, didn't know what it was. (pause) I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, who doesn't know what lice is. Especially like—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I didn't, but—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When your parents didn't and you were a kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know why—- like I tried really hard to avoid people's notice, but I don't know why I succeeded so well. (pause)</p>

<p>[39:28.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems pretty clear that at least at home, there were ways your parents weren't looking that hard or didn't want to see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't get the impression, from what you've described so far, that they consciously meant you ill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But they, you know, really didn't see and were probably turning a blind eye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And they knew it would just break my heart when people at the church would talk about what a good priest my father was, how caring he was and how well he took care of people who were sick and people who were in need. How well he, you know, how much of a supporter he was for them.</p>

<p>[40:37.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you did kind of know something about what was missing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crying) It's kind of amazing that I'm still in the church, or that I went back to the church. (chuckles) It took me a long time. (chuckles) I mean, I hold a grudge there. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would hope so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I think the best I can imagine it is that it would have been just so devastating for either of them to recognize the extent to which they were failing me. (pause)</p>

<p>[41:49.7]</p>

<p>Which, I say that and whether it's true or not, doesn't have any emotional weight, if that makes sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think that was it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Because it was just such an ongoing thing. (pause) I mean, I know it was less about her because she left when you were younger, but yeah, I don't know why he—- you know, something like you were being bullied at school and his not wanting to see that, or see what effect it had, and sort of turning a blind eye to that because it made him feel so bad.</p>

<p>[42:58.0]</p>

<p>Like that I could kind of imagine. But, I don't know. Day after day, week after week, your kid doesn't do her homework?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he wouldn't know that we didn't do our homework until grades would come in, and then he would get all up in arms and then he'd forget about it until the next time grades came in. So I just got yelled at every time he got any of my grades, and that was it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like he just forgot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very negligent. I mean, like I've worked with kids that age and their parents and stuff, and it's like—- (pause) I mean, this isn't the worst I've seen by any means, but that's negligent, you know? Like to just forget about it for months at a time. I mean—- </p>

<p>[44:16.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he would try, but it was kind of like somebody making a resolution and it lasts for a week or so. Like "We're going to have structure." He'd be like "We're going to have structure in Tanya's life. We're all about structure this semester." And then he would just forget about it. And I was supposed to be the one who kept the structure going, and I always felt so bad that I couldn't do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, you were a mess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. (laughter) God, the pictures of me up until I was like 10 or 12. I never brushed my hair. (laughter) So it was just like a crazy person, like crazy- kid-lost-in-the- woods-for-like- three-days hair. (laughter)</p>

<p>[45:11.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Your hair looked like that. Your room looked like that. Your emotional life looked like that. Your relationship with your father looked like that, I think, at least a lot of it, significant parts of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Amanda and I were at odds with each other always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She would bully me, and I would whine. You know, she was in so far over her head and I couldn't help her. She would get angry at me for that. And then I would think she was just being horrible to me for no reason. (pause)</p>

<p>[46:10.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You too.</p>

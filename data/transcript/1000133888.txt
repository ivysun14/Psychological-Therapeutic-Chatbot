<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nearly freaked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We do keep switching around days aren't we? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was for 3:30. I mean I couldn't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes it was. I meant to tell you I'm still trying to find people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you still interested in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's one of the things that I'm most interested in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. That's what I thought. Well I'll tell you what I have found two people that you might possibly talk with. Neither of them has exactly your kind of problem. They have similar kind of problems. Now one of them, I haven't contacted either of them yet, but one of them is a lady who works with the employment services. She's a black lady and she has something wrong with her hip and she walks on crutches or something. Some difficulty like that. [0:01:21.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now the other one is a man who is white who is a professor and was in some kind of car accident. He had difficulty in walking and some kind of difficulty with talking I'm told. I don't know exactly what that is. And I think some kind of scars from the accident. So I mean they're the kind of people who have not exactly the difficulties that you have but some would have some of the similar feelings and problems. Now would you be interested in talking to either of those people? [0:02:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well possibly the woman because the man is first of all it's a recent thing with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know how recent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know how recent. It might have been a while back. My guess is that it was a while back. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it seems like a white man would have less problems of that sort than anybody because well I think that perhaps not only does he have the advantage of being a man and women are more, I think, sympathetic. Maybe women's lib wouldn't like that but I think they are as a group and less physical. And probably white women more so. Perhaps I shouldn't even say that. I don't know if that's necessarily true either. That's just my feeling about people and their position. I don't know if you agree with it. [0:03:38.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know either. I guess my mind was sort of more on trying to think of what I should do. You're interested in talking to the woman? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Of course I could talk to the man too. It depends on where he is and when I can see him; where these people are. [0:04:02.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now he works here at the University.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you could maybe even talk to him some time when you came over here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What makes your contact think this woman would talk to me? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well just that he knows her. We don't know if she would talk to you. Just he knows her. We tried to think of people who would be someone that would be perhaps helpful to talk to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What does your friend think?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm just wondering other people listen to me but they never tell me what they think. No one's ever come out and said to me, "I think you can attract people." or "I think you can't." Or someone would think, oh a person with that problem maybe they shouldn't worry about that or that person really has a big problem. [0:05:10.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like nobody will come out and tell you how they really think about it. They won't be really straight with you about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm completely in the dark about this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (phone ringing) Excuse me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello. Ok. Goodbye. (hang up phone) Just let me give you the other information that I have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before I forget it. Then I just went around and I just said to people, "Do you people with this kind of handicap?" I said, "I know someone who had this and I'm just interested in if there's someone else that she could get in contact with that you know about?" [0:06:00.5]</p>

<p>Now I work with a group at the employment services and there's one lady in there said that she knew a lady that lived near here. And she didn't know exactly what kind of handicap she had but it sounded to me like what she was describing was very similar to what you have. She said that that lady, she was a black lady, is married to a black man and had lived next door to her. The man was from somewhere like, she wasn't sure where he from, like the islands she called it. She wasn't sure what that meant. You know Haiti or somewhere like that. They have lived here in New York for a while next to her and then they moved away. She said that this woman is married to this man. Then there's another. That's the only one. Then there was another woman who knew of another girl who twenty and had the same problem that you've had. She was new here. She was a black girl too. So that's just more information. [0:07:26.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh thank you. Well I certainly went to school with handicapped people. They had more than deformities. They had physical disabilities. I think some of them got married. I don't know what it is with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well just let me finish this with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh ok. Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you want me to go ahead and say try to call this man sometime and see if he would be willing to talk to you? See how he would feel about it? [0:08:04.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. I'll talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll talk. Ok. Then we'll see how that goes and see what else goes on. Now the thing is if I call him up and I say, "I'll call you." Do you want me to say that you're a client of mine or would you rather I said that you are a friend of mine or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Now if I do it that way, he might say... This is the way that I'm thinking of doing it; let me see how this sounds to you. I will call him up and tell him about you and then I will give you his phone number and you can call him. How does that sound? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that hit you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yet but maybe he shouldn't know why I want to see him. Are you telling that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's see what we should say. What would you like me to say about that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't see anything wrong with his knowing that I'm a client of yours. [0:09:04.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's alright. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because otherwise it seems rather bizarre to see him. Ok. Fine. For what it's worth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For what it's worth. Ok. Now if I do that, shall I leave it for him to call you or you to call him? That's what I'm trying to figure out next.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll call him. How old is he? Do you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't know. My guess is he's in his thirties. That's my guess. [0:10:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's in a wheel chair? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. He's not in a wheel chair. I don't exactly know what's wrong with him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's single?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. He's married. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. No. I don't think so. I just can't see a connection. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did the fact that he's married change that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't have any problem with the opposite sex if he's married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we don't know that. He might have had some or he might have felt some problem. Maybe he solved them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then maybe he was married before he had the accident which would make it different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think not. It's possible. I think not. [0:11:02.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. I'll call him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll call him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. There's always the other woman there too. Alright now if I call him and say that you're going to call him and that you're a client of mine, then I feel like I'd like to be able to give him your name so that I could say this is who this is so when she calls you up you'll know who she is. Is that ok with you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. So what I'll do then is I will call him up and tell him that you're a client of mine and a little bit of why you're interested in talking to him. And I think that maybe I'll say too that maybe she's not sure because she feels like in a way that you're different from her. You know a few things like that. Then I'll tell him your name and tell him that you'll be calling him. And I will either call you and tell you that or else I can give it to you next week. [0:12:03.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Now I don't feel different. He'll understand in which way I feel different. I don't feel different in the sense that people are different because of race. I just feel that his position would be different in relationship to that kind of problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. Yeah. I can understand how you feel about that. I guess feel like if I were you it might be helpful to talk to a couple of people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. Thank you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll keep seeing what else I can dig up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know a black man once told my mother, maybe I told you this, that "Oh she'll never get married." [0:13:09.9] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Told you what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'd never get married or I would have trouble. People have told me, relatives and whatnot, have said, "This is the way men are." And yet we find cases where people are married. So I don't know what's wrong now. I don't know why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know why you're not married to anyone? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I don't have a choice? Not married but you know what I mean. Attract people. You said something last week that if I hadn't have had this then I would've attracted people and I would be a different person psychologically. But you said something about it's probably a very complicated matter for me to get someone that I'd like to go out with me. Were you saying that it was complicated because they would be ambivalent towards me? They wouldn't be able to make up their minds? For example, they would say I like her but what will people say? [0:14:35.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that isn't really what I was saying but I think that certainly some people would feel that way yes. What I meant by that was you have an extra barrier to get through with people. Like some people who will be maybe tense or uncomfortable or turned off by the way you look. Some people won't but that it's an extra barrier. That's what I meant. [0:15:13.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it would seem that I only meet people who are turned off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like everybody you meet is turned off by it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well so far as I know I haven't known anyone that wasn't. Of course a person could not be turned off and could not be attracted to me as a person. It doesn't mean because a person isn't attractive they're not repulsed either. But I don't know. There's just that so many people with this problem have gotten through it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. I'm just puzzled. I'm just in the dark.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As to what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That is must be a problem that's peculiar to me. A problem that I would share with others with the same problem but it also has another dimension with me. Because there must be other barriers between me and people of the opposite sex in so far as anything beyond friendship is concerned. [0:16:30.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you see people that are successful and get male attraction with your problem then that makes you feel sad and like there must be something extra wrong with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So when I fail with somebody, I don't know if it was because they were turned off physically or because there was something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So its like again what you were saying, you are very much in the dark as to how much of what goes on between you and other people if someway how much is it? [0:17:14.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then there are women who aren't handicapped who have problems. To me they're (inaudible at 0:17:25.2) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is what you're trying to do is to figure out whether or not you have problems besides that? I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Then there are cases where some men are ambivalent. They seem attracted just so much and no more and then I don't know. Now what's the case with a person like that? Are they attracted or repulsed. That's something I don't understand. Like in the last instance where a man is very friendly or seems attracted yet he's not. That's hard to define unless you've lived through something like that. They're attracted but there's something wrong. I wonder well is that person attracted or is he turned off and if he's turned off why was he attracted in the first place? Why did I go out with him a few times and that's all? [0:18:40.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why was did he seem attracted for a while?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or didn't take me out I wonder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened? Like it's very hard to understand what's going on in his mind. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How he thinks about you and what it means that he took you out and then stopped taking you out. [0:19:02.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is only a few cases. Or even was friendly or hinted to take me out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or hinted to take me out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean what does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now that's something I don't understand. I don't know if it's something that I do or something that they think over well I can't do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what's running through my mind is it's too bad that in some way you can't find out. Like you cant' talk that over with them so that you'd know at least. [0:20:03.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well one person I wrote a letter to a couple of years ago explaining and there was no answer. I've even known of women with even other problems that they've had with men and they try to ask and they never get an answer. From the consensus of women that I know, men are very unfriendly about that. They're not honest with women. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you really feel whenever you start even talking about it a little hopeless about getting information because you feel like they aren't going to tell you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No the two or three times that I've tried; I've never been able to find out. They'll just say something that sounds good. Oh there's nothing wrong with you. Not those words but something of the sort. Noncommittal. [0:21:07.6] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that happens? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I suppose they don't want to hurt my feelings or they don't know. But that doesn't help me. They don't understand that I want to know no matter what. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I understand the difficulty you're talking about which is about getting truth from people about being handicapped because I've experienced that a lot. In effect what it's almost like, the way I feel about it personally, I have to put make some people feel comfortably enough to tell me the truth because they start out feeling uncomfortable with me or with you. [0:22:01.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well then that doesn't explain the initial friendliness if their uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no maybe people can be friendly at sort of one level. And yet say they might be comfortable with being friendly with you for a little while but they might be uncomfortable with say getting too involved with you. Some people can be friendly superficially or for a short period of time but they're afraid if they start feeling like too involved with you or something. [0:23:07.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the basis of that fear would be physical?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean physical?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of the physical handicap. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be and it might not be. It might be a lot of things. For example it might be that they are the kind of people in general who are afraid to get close to other people. Like they kind of make little attempts. They reach out for a little while and then they get scared just because they're scared of closeness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it might be the physical handicap or it might be many different things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Or them not being at ease with me. [0:24:09.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. They might be not at ease with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well now we're back to personality. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Back to you mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well maybe they sense that I'm unstable. That wouldn't make sense. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait. That sounds like something you're afraid of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if they weren't turned off physically then perhaps they would be uncomfortable with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the yeah...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because maybe I'm not a person who's comfortable to be with in that sense. Maybe it's my fear that they won't be interested. [0:25:01.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe there's some way in which you act that makes them uncomfortable. What would that be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know in nonverbal ways perhaps I don't know why people aren't comfortable. Maybe I show in my mannerisms or habits that I'm not sure of myself or that I'm tense. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that when you are with people you feel tense? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No. Only in certain situations; relationship with a man. It could be something that I'm unconscious of. I know the feeling might be there so maybe I communicate that. But see I don't know. I just don't know. [0:26:05.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying that when you are with a man you do feel tense in some situations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if it's a situation where I thought he might be interested I might be worried about losing him. I might have anxiety.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then while you're with them sometimes you're afraid even then that they're going to get turned off by you; that you'll lose them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be if I'm interested. Most men you're not interested in. It's just like talking to anybody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you are interested in them, that's how you feel. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you don't feel that way but you kind of suspect that you might feel that way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's hard to know what I'm feeling all the time or thinking at a given moment from moment to moment. [0:27:05.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to keep in touch with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you're saying that you put people at ease.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I try to. Yeah. Sometimes yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you try? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do I try? Well one thing I do, I sometimes ask them if they feel uncomfortable with me. If I'm working with somebody sometimes I'll say something like sometimes people do because I'm blind and they aren't used to being around people who are blind. So what I do by that is I'm agreeing to talk to bring it into the open. Like I'm sure that there are many people who deal with you and are very afraid to mention anything about your physical deformity. And so if you mention it first then that's a way of saying to them it's ok to talk about this. [0:28:19.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another thing I do is I try to show them if it's true that I won't be hurt or upset by them talking about it. Sometimes I even try to figure out how they would feel about talking about it with me and I'd say things like, "Are you afraid you'll hurt my feelings if you tell me how you really feel?" Then say they'd say, "Yes, I'm afraid I might hurt your feelings." If it's true that they wouldn't, I would say to them, "Well I would rather that you tell me the truth about this, it won't hurt my feelings and it would really make me feel better to know the truth and for us to be honest about it." [0:29:24.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see. You know I was reading somewhere where encounters group where people tell each other the truth have been very damaging to some people psychologically. Even though I would like to know the truth, they keep pointing out that you're getting the opinion of one person or some people and some people have really been damaged by it. I suppose you have to get some answers somewhere. [0:30:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that you might be hurt or damaged if you heard the truth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't know think so. No, but I would keep in mind that I was hearing it from one person. Then, of course, if I think that person is representative of a lot of people like if a certain man told me this then I would feel that a lot of other men would feel the same way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying what would be important to you is to remember that this is only one person. [0:30:33.4]</p>

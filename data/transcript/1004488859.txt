<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before we get started, I wanted to find out. We're supposed to meet next Tuesday, and I wanted to see if I could reschedule that for a different day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I've had a case of loads here, the zipper load.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you just take it to a drycleaner or any place that does alterations, they can put that zipper right for less than five bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, that's very helpful. I will do that. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We can skip entirely too if you don't have any openings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me find an opening. Okay, I've got - I'm almost certain I will have Wednesday at 10:45, that will be good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you invite me so that I get automatic (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I think I can do that. Let's see, so Wednesday at 10:45.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (coughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It still has you as an invitee, so I guess -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm assuming that if I just click done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Done, then it will just - it will e-mail me to tell me that it's changing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The benefit with somebody who teaches how to do this for a living is, I can answer questions, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (clears throat)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The last time you were talking about the idea of asking my parents for help, but how I felt very uncomfortable with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did, going out of here, sort of think about what I did feel comfortable asking for help about from them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the thing is, is one - there's a difference between things that I can't take care of because - technically, money is money, but if I ask for it for a certain purpose, it seems different to me. [00:02:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like instead of, I can't pay my electric bill, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, saying you know, because I do - I'm in a lot of chronic pain. I used to go see this particular massage therapist who, when you get to this level, it's often referred to as body work, not so much massage, because it isn't spa. It's not like you tip them, like you don't tip your dentist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. A lot of them have like - they have - you know, they have an orthopedic surgeon they work with, that's like on -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. I have heard about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's mostly for -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a kind of PT.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They do a lot of what's called Kinesio taping, where they tape your muscles in a certain way so that afterwards, you're starting to retrain it for a couple of days, to sit in a certain way. It stops bunching up at the origin and causing pain. It's really kind of cool stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's basically more or less PT or it's - but it also hurts like hell. Nobody is going to have a good time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Anyways, I talked to my mom and I have just been so broke lately that I haven't gone for about six months. I haven't got a lot of benefits. I talked to both mom and my dad and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do have somebody here who does that kind of stuff who's good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. [00:03:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so um, I talked to them about it and I said do you know what? This is something that is extra, that I'm to cut out of my life, that I can't afford; however, I really feel like the benefits of it make it such that I can work harder, and so it's sort of like an investments towards being able to do more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that they would need that but for me - do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand that entirely. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mother, talk to the manager, at the same time. Like mom this isn't the kind of place that has a manager.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is not the kind of place that has a manager exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mom you don't get it, this is about being productive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh she does, she does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was trying to be kind of sweet about the whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure she was, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I asked them for some help for that, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that's something that - I really feel like that's something safe and okay to ask for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though they're not paying that place. You know, it's not like they're paying them directly, they're just giving me money so I could use it for anything, but the point is that I feel like it's going to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so it's sort of a running joke because I had - back when I used to go to a different place, in New Jersey, -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:04:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I - my old um, ah, my old doctor, who I just adored working with for years, he's also the doctor, or used to be, he's retired now, for the Patriots, for many years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's also a sports therapist. He used to explain that when he first introduced me to going to these places he's like, it's kind of like going to see a dominatrix except for they're much more expensive, and they don't actually hit you with anything. You have to understand, that's the kind of like sense of humor she has about this kind of thing but it's true, in terms of expensive. She's like yeah, except for they're a lot more expensive. They charge like you know, like what a lawyer charges per hour, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not quite but very close to it, but you get a tremendous amount of benefits. They do X-rays before they do everything, they do - not everything but before you go through a certain treatment plan there's a lot of things that go on. They have your consult. You know, before they decide to treat a certain thing, they have a consulting with an orthopedic surgeon, to make sure this is okay. Certain things they do blood work with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's they're training? Are they trained as physical therapists or - (crosstalk)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They train as physical therapists. They also have orthopedic training as well. Most of them have sports medicine -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:05:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - training, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The place here is Boston Bodyworker. They work with people - they mostly - their clientele are people who run marathons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they do, do a lot of rehabilitation too. But it's extremely expensive you know, about a hundred and fifty bucks an hour. So yeah. So it's something I don't feel normally comfortable enough spending for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often will you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. Last year I was able to go a couple of times a month, because it used to be, as long as I had a prescription from my doctor, it used to be an allowable medical expense for my flexible spending.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They wouldn't pay for it, but I at least could take it out of my flexible spending money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't do that any more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gosh, that's really too bad, considering it seems so related to your medical issues.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know? And your functioning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently there's been - there's a good - there's been a lot of backlash against some of this stuff, especially when I'm not going to a day spa to get it done, I'm going to a place that specifically, that's all they do. [00:06:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's other things involved, but it's something that may very well get changed again. There were a lot of changes as to what you could spend flexible spending money on, and so, so hopefully that will get fixed and maybe next year we'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know of someone else who gets that kind of treatment, I think at a different place, but I've heard a bit about it actually and it sounds like it's the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very medical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's very medical. In this case it's a lot of like elite skaters and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, that's how I got into this thing, is I used to figure skate, so yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And I also know that that place seems particularly good at getting money out of Blue Cross. Do you want me to ask about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you don't feel - if you feel comfortable yes, that would be great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it could be covered partially by my insurance, that would be even better. [00:07:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I'm wondering about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, because they're not paying for things like X-rays and fluoroscopes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll probably have time to ask about it, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of expensive but at the same time, I'm actually seeing over time, the change. I know that there isn't a placebo effect. I see what they're working on. You can see trapped nerves, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I will ah, I will find out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because it's something that you know, long-term when I do it, it was definitely - I had a lot of benefit from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's interesting because of how much um, how much technology that looks like it's a super science that's actually real. Like when I first saw Kinesio taping, I thought to myself oh, that's just like the people who believe in magnets, which is absolutely ridiculous. And then like I realized oh, what they're actually doing is the equivalent of when they tape up someone's ribs together, when they're playing sports. They're putting it in a certain way, to teach you how to - so the next few days, you get yourself readapted to the way you're holding it. It's not like it's - the tape itself isn't doing anything to you, it's not healing you. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not mystical.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's just, it's kind of like, almost like a back brace or something, like they're teaching you how to get -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the right way to hold yourself, so that you can stop feeling pain and you can start getting used to the way you're supposed to be standing or using your arm or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's kind of interesting. But it is really hard to really find practitioners, because it seems they'll go like two different directions, and a lot of them have like these really strange place, and so it's really hard finding just a really good fit. If you believe in like the whole like okay, so why don't you take like snake venom along with this. And trust me, there's tons of them. And then there are the people who actually have some sort of basis in medical fact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I'm sure snake venom has some sort of medical effect on something, but just not this one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's been pretty much you know, I went out there and I felt like I ought to try and do something like that, and they seem to be perfectly okay with that. So at least for one time and we'll see how it goes from there. [00:09:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though I've had really good like success so you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I just - it makes me mean, it's exhausting, it's just you know, it's a lot to have to handle at once. That's really for me, like it's very hard because I'm trying very hard to be tough about this. I'm kind obsessed with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - being strong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm aware of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to say it out loud though. I guess it's been something that's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally fine, yeah. But it's, it - right, not so subtle, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, the big reason why is because I'm afraid, and I actually did, when I first got diagnosed, sort of go through this like really brief period of time where I was very upset about it. I'm afraid of wallowing it, if you know what I mean. I, I just don't want to be that - although all I ever really talk about here is like you know, problems with my husband's addiction and chronic pain pretty much, and I'm not really that person. These are just two things that bother me a lot. I just don't want to be that - [00:10:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The struggle is - there's evidence of a struggle. As you talk about these things, on the one hand, you know clearly you're wanting to... but they're not there to talk about how you're feeling, to get some of it out of your system and to think about it and you know, it gets worse because I even ask you questions, encouraging you to talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really isn't so bad. No, no, that's not the bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, I'm -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know, I'm just teasing you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And at the same time, like there's you clearly don't want to be that person or resemble that person, or be identified as somebody who possibly could be perceived as resembling that person. I'm not sure what all the reasons are for that or that's a - I guess I have some thoughts, which I've said, to do with -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've met people in my life. I've had to manage people who, they were their disease.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, some people work it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's just so unbearably upsetting to have to deal with people like that, that I just don't ever want to be one of those people. [00:11:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes them so upsetting to deal with? I'm not saying -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I've managed them, which meant things like you know, I would get all kinds of like completely unreasonable requests about things, like you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like I'm broken and I can't come into work today kind of stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More along the lines of it was really obvious that there were certain trends that you know? Like I can't come into work today, but it's also the same day that like there's a movie coming out that I want to watch or like, just things like that you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, bullshit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean really working this excuse or just other things that just completely you know? It was just - it just annoyed the hell out of me you know? I have one person that I was managing who regularly got seizures, who would just sit down in the hall, let it pass and then go back to work, which I then thought that was really overdoing it, to be honest. He should have gone home but he didn't. But then I would have somebody who, like their lives would feel - they would be feeling really bad and they're like yeah, my cortisol levels are getting high, you know if I get worse - if I don't take the afternoon off, I'm going to get worse and I'm going to have to call off a whole lot more. I'm like oh crap, you know what? Just because you're having a stressful day, you need to go home early so that you don't have to call off later? No. You know? [00:12:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Also you know, having to deal with a lot of workman's - not really workman's comp claims but really more like disability related claims.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That were just a giant pain in the ass, about things that were not - I don't know whether or not they're really valid, but they just didn't seem valid to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had to change the paint in the store because it was supposedly causing somebody else's breathing problems. They're only there 15 hours a week you know, and I just really had a hard time believing that you know, that we were causing that much trouble with the paint, that has been on the walls for years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But to be honest, I mean it's just one of those things. I don't want to be one of those people. Also, I think on some level, I sort of get - the people around me sort of encourage it, not like in a bad way, but sort of glorify the fact that I'm tough. You know? I've had friends and family members being like yeah, you don't have a case of RA, RA's got a bad case of you and I feel bad for it, and things like that, that kind of stuff. I mean it's really sweet and therefore it - but they don't realize that that actually sort of raises... [00:14:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? It's not like you know, people telling you to buck up and you know, little camper keep going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they actually do it in a way that is so supportive that it is almost like - it definitely lends to my you know, in terms of reward, you know happiness kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It definitely steps up to that right thing of saying it that way. I don't think they have a clue in the world that that's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. They're entirely trying to be nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're trying to be nice, they're trying to be very supportive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But at the same time, it sort of encourages that, that you know, I've got to be tough kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. And to be honest, I like being told that kind of stuff, I really like it. I don't like being sick. I don't even like going to the doctors ever, but I do. So, it's just a matter of sort of finding a balance I guess, between feeling like I'm not a victim constantly, because it's very easy to get super passive for me on this, because there's certain types of pain that I'm just extremely vulnerable to, and some things I can sort of ignore and keep going.</p>

<p>But I hate the commercials. Luckily, I haven't seen any recently because I don't have a television, but they make all these commercials for rheumatoid arthritis drugs that are actually quite mean, in which they show somebody who is young, and then they're like having more and more trouble like doing stuff. And I find them to be very cruel, because they are - they don't - they're sort of innocuous to the rest of the world, except for the people who have RA, and they see this like woman with baby, can hold baby, by the time baby is toddler, can't you know, can't really push the stroller kind of thing. And they're telling you well, if you just have Enbrel or if you just have you know, whatever they have out there, that this will slow down. It's like well, yes and no, you know? It's not as - and I think that's the only real advertisement I feel especially vulnerable to, but that one I really do. I hate those commercials because you know, they prey on the fact that you're - you don't want to become crippled, therefore you need to use this stuff. And you do, you do, but at the same time it's like, I don't need to be told by my television. [00:16:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it's really manipulative?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's really manipulative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And really to be honest, there isn't really - I mean yes, it's all brand name, there's no - there probably will never be a generic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because of the high risks involved in manufacture and for distribution. But it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it also a factor that that ad or a lot of those ads have kids in them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. They show a lot of things like - that's particularly one of them. I'm trying to remember which one that was. No, it's not even so much that as much as they sort of show time periods with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, it's not even - I mean that a little bit, but not really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's more about the fact that you're seeing somebody, over a very short period of time, degrading very fast. So, which is to me very hard, because I don't ever want to be like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been, you know I have been like that before you know, where it's just been a struggle and I just, I - it's - the funny thing is, is that you know, I mean yes the medication does help, but it's not exactly what they say it is you know? Like you're never taking your kid to the toddler park, because the toddler park is full of germs and you are immunocompromised. They would show this too, and you're immunocompromised, so you to actually stay away from - [00:18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk). Usually you can't go because you're immunocompromised.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which that drug isn't going to address.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they do tell, very, very small - no doctor will let you know this without letting you know that the biggest risk for it is dying of pneumonia. Basically it's the same types of risks you have with AIDS, because although it shuts off a different part of your immune system, it's the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's um, you know, you have to worry about a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, and I - I mean right now, the reason why I'm coughing when I come in, is because I've had a perpetual case of pneumonia for 18 months. I'm at like this like weird impasse where (coughs) I'm okay right now, but basically there's a type of - it's often referred to community acquired or like walking pneumonia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where it like - yeah. Like I'm not coughing anything up, but if I let myself, it still - the fluid is still in my lungs and if I ever like get myself too run down, I'd get really sick again. But it's sort of like, it's sort of like having this ceasefire in my body you know? But um, it's annoying, it's annoying as all hell because it's like I know that at any given time, I'm - there's a whole lot of types of infection I'm a lot more susceptible to. Unless I go into remission, which it does happen. I'm trying to say it won't, but I don't think it's - [00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does happen. People do go into remission, they don't understand why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some people, their immune systems just turn off, like if they stop - their body just stopped attacking themselves. They don't know why but they do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now there is an association with pregnancy, but unfortunately with me, it's probably not going to happen that way, because my immune system is too aggressive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would never get past the first trimester to be able to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But um, it does happen associated with that, which I think is just because your body has to like be able to handle cells that are foreign anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they do know that it definitely does happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. What percentage of people have some - go into remission like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't really have a good - well the thing is, they have a percentage, it's about a third of them, but they often go back in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not like you know, there's a remission that you have to fight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not really understood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't really understand what causes it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I've talked to a couple different people. Some people think it's hormonal based, some people think it's based upon like all kinds of stuff. Some people just say you know what, honestly, it's just a roll of the dice. Sometimes, what turns - they don't really know what starts the immune process. I'm starting to think that your own tissue is you know, a foreign invader, so. The funny thing is, is that I have a couple of people in my life who have put it in my head that the reason why I have RA is because I'm so negative against myself, which is actually - I mean there's a correlation but not a causation to that. [00:20:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm self-deprecating and therefore, I've caused my immune system to attack my joints?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm quite confident, that seems - yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it cracks me up because it's like well yes, those two things are true, but one does not cause the other one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I just started liking myself, I just don't think my immune system would stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. So... But you know, it's kind of a - like I said, it's you know, I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that I think that liking yourself better, being less self-deprecating isn't a good thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even if it's going to cure your RA.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not putting my eggs in that basket. It may make it so that I can cope with it better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think it's like that's going to - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alas, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I understand that there's a lot of mind body connection for a lot of things, but I just - something feels a little fishy about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But you know, if I ever do go into remission, I will just take it as you know. I mean I'm not counting on it but if it did, I'd be happy with it you know, I may get a surprise. Kind of doubt it but it could happen I guess. [00:21:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They really don't understand what causes these things. They're really, from what I understand, so many - a lot of rheumatologists don't even like to use the word RA, because once you start having - like so many of these diseases are exactly the same thing. Lupus and RA are the same thing, except for one goes after soft tissue versus one goes through joint areas. MS is where it gets the myelin sheaths in the spinal cord, same to these. That's why a lot of times they're the same medications too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like psoriasis apparently is the same thing. There's a bunch of - once you start having - like I have - I use the word RA but I have a lot of other like small autoimmune related things. When I start showing crossovers, they start to really like - don't really like to call that - they just say that you have immuno you know autoimmune problems, because it's not really any one thing it's everything. It starts becoming complicated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but um, it's an interesting world. So yeah, I get tested for like all kinds of stuff all the time. Back when I decided to actually let them do things to me, I'd let them test me all the time. No more like - I'm just not willing to be a guinea pig for so many things. You know? I ah, the problem is I've always been near teaching hospitals and I'm usually pretty good about being around residents. [00:23:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. There's a lot of poking and prodding that goes on around -</p>

<p>CLIENT: More like - look, you'll never see anybody who has this, like this much in your life. One of the problems I have is that - and why I can't take yoga. Lots of places are like oh, go do yoga. Yeah, my joints go the other direction. That's why I've got to - I have like two artificial joints.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of the fact that they go the wrong way. Everything goes the wrong way. So yoga is actually bad, because they try to teach you to be more flexible, but I tear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So they don't let you go to those kind of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't do tai chi or anything that like - the things that really stress a certain amount of flexibility don't work, because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because they're hurtful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't feel it. The joint doesn't have any limits to it, so what happens is I only feel it after the ligament is gone or I've torn something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so almost always, every doctor is like hey, I need to show you guys all the people - you know, this person's hand goes all the way or this... And it's like after a while it gets to be kind of annoying, because like you don't want to be the freak show. [00:24:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And it started really - even though I didn't get diagnosed with it, it started so early that it's - I mean, I did write an article about it specifically, to get it off my chest, about being one of the earliest you know, people with certain types of tendonitis diagnosed and how weird that was. I don't know if I've ever talked about this or not. I, back in 1984 or '83, something like that, had like the first case that they had - at least at Children's Hospital, which is pretty reputable - had ever seen, of basically... At the time they called it something tendonitis, but basically it was from playing videogames, because they didn't really - they didn't have videogames that much back then. I had just gotten Pac-Man. And so yeah, and they brought everybody in to have everyone see - they thought they'd never see this again of course, and they see it all the time now. The kid who actually had a repetitive stress disorder, you know at the age of like seven or eight, you know? [00:25:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, you were that little?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So... I mean it wasn't that bad. I mean yes, I did play a decent amount, but it wasn't like to the level that like - actually it would be considered to be in normal ranges of playing videogames now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But back then it was considered to be pretty odd. But I just got it, it was just like - it was like I got it for Christmas and it was like already before New Year's that I was already there. So it wasn't like I was playing that much, but yeah so I was - and it sort of started from there, like this whole thing of oh, everyone, take a look at this, you'll never see this again. And I'm like oh great, now I've got to do this again. But at the same time, going to teaching hospitals, it seems like they're more willing to actually and find something, you know what's wrong with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As opposed to a lot of practices where they're not as up on the newest things, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And perhaps not as curious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, but I um, I'm just kind of sick of it you know? Sick and tired of being sick and tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could imagine. [00:26:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I could imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's pretty limiting in terms of like you know activities, that kind of stuff. Quite frankly, I mean if I could just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and you just feel really ashamed about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want to tell people about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean it isn't like specific symptoms, tiredness themselves. There's like being concerned about you know, people thinking you're working it or using it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not so much worried about what other people think about that. I'm concerned that I am, like I have to keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got your own judgments.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: More along the lines of am I letting myself take the easy route.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some with other people, it depends on who it is, but most of the time it's just my own... yeah. [00:27:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't imagine you'd ever take an easy route.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm going to need an example, because I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gosh. (5-second pause) I'm trying to think of something that - I know that I've done something recently that was the easy route, and I can't think of what it is. I know I have. I just can't think of anything off the top of my head. (8-second pause)</p>

<p>Okay, a very simple one. I have to go to an appointment. The appointment is you know, at X time. I ask to leave earlier than that because I figure I'm going to be downtown anyways and I want to run an errand also at this place. So I ask to leave earlier than I really need to so that I can go to this place as well, that has nothing to do with the condition. [00:28:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the easiest one I can think of right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess ah, (7-second pause) do you feel bad about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. It depends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm confused, because you started being like so concerned about not taking the easy route, and so in many, many ways, don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm talking about just every once in a while that this happens like you know? I don't usually, but that is a good example of something. I can't think of the last time I did it but you know, leaving more - with extra time so that I could run an errand as well. [00:29:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, I usually don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like I took the whole day off or anything like that, but it is definitely something that... you know, I have you know? I'm trying to think of anything I can think of right now off the top of my head, but definitely I have you know? When something is painful or less you know, just more complicated, I have gone the easy route, which I shouldn't have you know, in terms of that. I ask for a ride home when I really should walk or you know, something like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually there are a few examples like this, but they're just vastly outnumbered by examples where you haven't. [00:30:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But still.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's... (8-second pause) I don't like to do that kind of stuff you know, but sometimes I do. (12-second pause). But yeah, so I don't know. Just sometimes it's really, really hard though, it's really hard to - you don't want to necessarily make relationships with people because it's like, I feel like a friendship with me comes with an awful lot of writer statements on that contract of friendship. Like I will be your friend and I will come over with you, but you must understand that you know, if I'm not feel especially well, I may cancel on your. Or you know, I may not be able to do the things you want to do or you know. I feel like - I don't like the fact that - I don't want to always go into relationships with people, because I don't want to necessarily have to show all these writers so quickly on you know? Like these things, these - and then there's this one you know if, you know I will be willing to do this, but only if that, you know? And I hate that. [00:32:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to be able to - it's not like I don't want to go skiing with people or I don't want to do this. Um you know, now skiing is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like completely the opposite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd love to be able to go skiing with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you'd love to be able to go out you know, at any reasonable time, and not have to worry about whether you're incapacitated by pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually, if I'm doing something and you know, if I'm doing something social in the evening, I usually need to make plans to get rest, so that I can - now it doesn't technically have to be sleep, but I can definitely take the weight off of my joints or do something. I usually do something to you know, prolong my ability to stay awake and keep moving later in the day, and that takes a lot of planning and it's annoying too. You know? Also sometimes, I need to plan for the day afterwards too you know? I need to be careful and I don't like that you know? Especially like for example you know. [00:33:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course not, it sucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I can partly (inaudible) is that when you say you don't like it and you don't want to do them, it's as though someone could disagree, be like well, -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually somebody could disagree, because I didn't go on the snow tubing trip for work, and one of the guys who just had knee surgery went. Like literally three weeks ago, had an ACL replacement, you know had a tissue replacement in his knee, went tubing too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how does his being an idiot relate to you know, you having to be defensive? I mean - I don't know enough about what -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I probably could have gone tubing, but I was concerned about having to first go home, get a nap. Because tubing isn't nearly as significantly -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not like skiing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like skiing or anything like that. But I would have to go home, get a nap, then haul my ass all the way up to like Vermont afterwards, in the middle of the day, to go, and then get back up to work, to be at work at 7:00 a.m. It just seemed like it was more than I could really physically take, as well as the fact that I didn't really know how - I wasn't certain how um, this particular facility, how easy it was going to be to move around and get to places. [00:34:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what seems to me gets lost, is the fact that - I don't know about this particularly with tubing, but there are - I do know there are a ton of things that you would love to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you can't do. In other words, like the issue becomes this sort of you know, sort of squabble in your head, about can you do it or can't you do it, and if you can't do it, do you have to feel bad about it or is somebody else going to think you could have done it when you couldn't do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well some of it I'm really sad about too. Like I've put off so much in my life -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the part -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - academically, thinking I'd have time later to do it, like going dancing and things like that, to nightclubs. I can't really do that so much. I mean I can kind of but not really, not the way I would really hope to go. And so that kind of stuff I put off and then it was too late. And most people when they that, they say that when they're like 70, not like you know, in their thirties.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's sort of, that's the kind of stuff I really regret.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel really old about not being able to do. You know? [00:35:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know? I want to be able to go do this kind of stuff but I can't. There's a few things I don't want to do but mostly it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - that I do, but I just can't do it you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I feel like sometimes it's really hard for me to go into a friendship, knowing that this is going to be complicated you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and I guess I follow your kind of - kind of a few different issues, among them that like you don't want to have to explain to the person or be concerned about you're being perceived, when you make it clear that there's some things you won't be able to do. And also, like it's just sad to know that there are things you would want to do with somebody you were friends with, that you won't be able to. And like that you're going to feel the pain of missing out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Also knowing, like having to explain to someone early on that I could cancel on you at the last minute if I don't feel well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That sucks. It's like I'm flaky, I am like - but the thing is, it doesn't necessarily easy to see it that way you know? [00:36:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I understand, and I don't mean to just say you're being defensive about it, because I, I -</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you're going to somebody's house for dinner, they're cooking, and if you all of a sudden just don't feel very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you don't want to let anybody down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I tend not to want to do that as much you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I guess means there's even more that you're missing out on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, totally, so. And I just don't want to be that kind of person, the person that you constantly have to like make accommodations for you know? But... I'd like to believe that I have a lot of things to offer, just they're different things you know? I think that's sort of the reason why I make the - I sort of promote the urban legend of Debra doesn't like to go out into the wilderness kind of things. Yes it's true, I'm not especially fond of you know, suburban and more - even less - you know much more country life. [00:38:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's sort of - it's sort of become almost like - at least around people I knew from undergrad, sort of like a legend of Debra hyperventilates when she doesn't see concrete. You know and like you know, that kind of stuff, like Debra needs to be like around people and concrete and buildings. It's not really like that so much as going out into the wilderness usually involves something that I can't do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but I, I sort of - I sort of perpetrated this, perpetuated this believe of you know, oh I can't you know. I just don't like being outside of cities, just so that it makes it less complicated too. But it is a little bit true, that I'm not a big like go out into the wilderness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even really sure what the point of camping is, other than drinking beer, so. I'm really not. So um, that seems to be what people do, they say oh, let's get some beer and I'm like okay, we could do this in my backyard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. I think people hike too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But I'm not really sure what the point of alcohol I'm drinking and camping is, but apparently it's a primary staple of amid 20 things. Yeah. I'm not really sure about that. But yeah, I'm not really big into that kind of stuff. I can go hiking in the city. There's lots of beautiful parks that don't involve like going far away, so. I am going to do something that normally, I've been putting off for such a long time, which is that a friend of ours down in Virginia has a boat and he recently bought a vacation home. And I've been sort of avoiding going on the boat, because I've been concerned about mostly not being able to do things that I need to do, to be on the boat, but I think that when we go down in April, I'm going to just suck it up and just be a good camper and see if I have a good time. Boating involves using a lot of things, like ropes and knots and things, and I don't have the dexterity for it, on top of that I can't swim. I can, but just not very well. But the most big thing is the dexterity thing of being able to sail. I've been putting it off for almost ten years, going on this boat, and he made a big deal about the fact that if we're going down to the cherry blossom festival, that he wants us to come out to his new cottage he just bought, specifically because he knew that the getting out to the middle of nowhere, to where - Chesapeake seems like a small area but really, it really is kind of - getting from Virginia itself, up into like you know, where most keep their boats is kind of a hike. He was like well, now I have a cottage, so basically we can just dock the boat and go inside and go to sleep, and it has like air conditioning and everything. He made such an alluring offer for us for when we came down that I'm like okay, he obviously knows that there's trouble. I'm just going to suck up the fact that I might not be very good at tying knots so, and just give it a try. I know he didn't buy the cottage for me, but he did make it a point of saying that he does have one now, so. I just need to get down and be around some of my friends. I think taking the trip down to Virginia will really help I think. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ah, yeah. I just miss a lot of - I miss a lot of my friends. It will be good. Almost all of them are in the Virginia area, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not all of them, but I'd say probably 60 percent, 55 percent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friends from school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: From school yeah, are all in the Virginia area. I'm not really sure why or how.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some of them have moved around but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they doing defense related stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and no. I think the biggest reason why is because so many people who went to Carnegie Mellon are from that area anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That that's just, that was home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But yeah, the city is very familiar to me. I know my way around so, though I've never really gone down for the cherry blossom festival in particular, because at first that was a tourist trap, an excuse to go down, so we'll see. But I think it will be good to do that. The bad news is that some of my friends actually haven't changed since 1997, like John. John has a beer pong table in his house, yes. He's single, there's no one to yell at him about it, so you know, more power to him. He also has a plane and two houses, so chances are you know, he's not a slacker. [00:42:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he will be on the millionaire matchmaker pretty soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which is kind of funny. I never thought he would go on that. He was going for - he was using that service anyways, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know, it's good. It's weird to see certain people settling in but it's good, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. What's it like seeing your old friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually it's pretty good. Occasionally, I feel really worried, because I feel like I need to explain what I've been up to lately, though lately I haven't been so bad, mostly because of like they know I've moved and therefore, you know sometimes when you move for your spouse, you, you know. Because a lot of people have this experience, you end up changing careers a little bit, that kind of thing, so it's not nearly as bad. But it's really nice most of the time, to hear about how people's lives have changed. There's a couple of people that I just am crazy jealous of their lives and how well they've turned out, and not the guy that has a boat and a plane, but the - [00:43:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a beer pong table.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a beer pong table, very nice beer pong table, it's gorgeous. Yeah. It's made of rare wood. It's like you think -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It's very weird. But yeah, like several of our friends have settled down and had kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course I'm jealous about that. And then it goes to that whole thing of a lot of people who, if you don't have kids, they assume that you don't like kids and therefore, they don't want to bring their kids around. Like no, I want you to hand baby Ashley to me, I want to hold her. You know it's like I don't want to have to like put on display the fact that we can't, because a lot of people happen to have a choice. And so I feel like I have to make myself vulnerable on that one you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. But it is, it is um, it is nice to get together with everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now, but I'll see you Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. No worries. Stuff happens. So, it's all right. Come on. It's issues. I guess that's an advantage of an un-stressed schedule.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know where to start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What pops into your head? [00:00:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Various stuff. My friend, Vivienne, who was my big brother in the sorority I belonged to as an undergrad co-ed, Everyone was referred to as a brother regardless of gender, Is in town, and she's coerced (ph) my doing these wedding invitations for her in the print shop. So we went out to dinner Tuesday night. And then yesterday, she swung by the shop around 10:30 to look at what I had printed so far. And I was hoping to have them done before she goes back tomorrow, but that's looking some less likely as time goes on. But yeah, it was good seeing her now. She's awesome, and neither of us are really phone people, so we don't talk unless she's in town. So that was good. [00:01:32]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were some undergrads around all evening yesterday while I was working on the press, and they were just so adorably clueless and destructive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This one kid walked in while I was running the machine and was like, "Can I help? Can I help? I just got trained Monday. I want to help, please." I was like, "I am not qualified to supervise you running this dangerous piece of equipment." "That's okay. I can press the brake when you need me to press the brake. Do you need me to press the brake now? How about now? Can I press the brake now?"</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I finally told him that if he really wanted to help, he could set some type for the next page I was gonna do. I handed him the page, and I had like three lines of text, and he spent ... oh, I mean he's learning, so I shouldn't, you know, make fun of how much time he took, but it was ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was also a mess. [00:02:30]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He did it wrong. I had to redo it. I had to undo what he did ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... before I could make forward progress. It was - they're so adorable. So earnest too. But yeah, there's a little crowd of undergrads around, and I realize that - like viewing them from like ten years' distance, I realize that a lot of the - the ways they act is just really trying to figure out who they are and how they want to present themselves. And that kind of made me feel a little bit less ashamed for some of the things I did when I was that age ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... still figuring things out. I also - I probably mentioned this last week or maybe the week before, but, you know, it used to be almost physically painful for me to visit my (inaudible at 00:03:28) campus shortly after I graduated. And, you know, for the longest time, I felt like I didn't deserve to be on campus because I wasn't a real alum, and I, you know, didn't deserve to be out of my [inaudible] whatever. But like I don't know if it's just the magic number, or if it's just time has passed or I've changed, or therapy has been effective, but something has happened ... [00:03:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever it is, we'll take it.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it doesn't bother me to be around campus anymore, so that's - that's interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if it's just what you're doing, but it sounds like it's actually been nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the - the familiarity is pleasant as much as anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It turns out the grad school is going to let me walk in commencement exercises ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good. [00:04:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... even if - while I'm still pushing my advisors. I - even if the transfer paperwork doesn't clear in time, you know, they might hold the diploma until Fall, but they'll let me participate in commencement exercises. So now I'm debating whether I should invite my parents or not. Like on the one hand, it would make them really happy, and I feel obligated to, but on the other hand, having them here would be stressful for me. And if I invite them and they decide not to come, that will be hurtful and they're just going to be assholes about, "Well, why didn't you get a PhD," or "Why didn't you get your Master's from a different university," or whatever. I don't know. [00:05:16]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you'd invite them 'cause it would be nice for them and you wouldn't invite them because that would be nice for you. [00:06:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much. I mean I'm completely honest. There's a part of me that hopes they'll just come and be proud of me and happy for me and like be decent parents for once in their lives, but the likelihood of that is - is small.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why you keep holding onto that even if the likelihood is wrong? [00:07:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know why.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something's making me think of that thing. There's some saying like it's better to be a sinner in a world ruled by God than a pretty good person in a world with no God in it, or something like that. [00:08:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know how it goes, but vaguely that way. And that ... not only with wanting to hold onto the hope that they could be like good parents if they came, and it would be really nice. But maybe you also hold onto - I know this may sound crazy, like the idea that they were good parents, and they were right in a lot of the critical things that they said because maybe it's more comforting in certain respects to feel like you fucked up in all the ways they said, but they're, you know, sort of honest and decent parents in that sense. [00:09:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe I've just been so - so indoctrinated that I can't let go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean that there's just a lot of inertia or that you kind of have nothing else you can believe or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think I was more getting at, you know, they - they pounded into my head from childhood that they were right and their values were right and everyone else is completely stupid for valuing anything different. But maybe that message is just the hooks are in too deep. [00:11:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing) Maybe you're saying, "Doc, you're not gonna get between me and them."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think that's what I meant consciously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, something like that. Consciously, I imagine you said that more worried than anything else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's - I almost feel like I'm engaged in constant double think with myself, where on one hand, there are these - this set of things that I value, that I say I value, that most of the time I act like I value them, but whenever it comes to my parents, all the sudden, those things are kind of worthless. And it's like what the fuck is wrong with me, why don't I care about these things. I could be valuating this other bag of things that my parents value. Clearly, that's the right thing to do and I suck for caring about these things over here. And it's really, you know, it's really frustrating. [00:12:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So these are things like you and yourself positively or doing things you enjoy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, or where even, you know, valuing friendships and community versus you can't trust anyone who's not a blood relative. And that's like - well, A, it's bullshit, because my dad's blood family is fractured and dysfunctional as hell (inaudible at 00:12:59).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This - this idolizing, you know, perfect family relationships is wishful thinking. I don't know. (Cough) I actually had a long conversation along these lines with a friend on Tuesday. She's Asian, and her mother is insane. It would take too long to describe it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:13:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But her mother is emotionally manipulative and passive aggressive and probably has undiagnosed personality disorders, and it's just - it's really terrible and has pushed away all of her kids. And my friend got this horrible letter from her mother saying, you know, "I don't understand you. I don't think you're even Asian anymore because real Asian people value their family, and you value those weirdoes on the Internet more than your family," and "What's wrong with you?" It just went on and on and on, and we had this long conversation about mostly Asian immigrant parents, like I'm sure other people experience this, but I've seen it a lot with my second generation Asian-American friends that - and their grandparents are like, "Well, back in the home country, we valued family. Family was the most important thing ever. And you kids raised in the U.S., I don't know what's wrong with you. You don't value your family." But then you look at these family relationships. It's like you've got one family like - just my extended family, my dad doesn't speak to his brother or either of his sisters. His one sister, her husband hasn't held a job in 20 years. For, you know, about 16 of those years, my dad sent her money to keep a roof over her and her kids' heads until he cut her off because she refused to come like uproot her life and move to Missouri and move in with him and be his housekeeper. So now, her kids are supporting her, but like her other siblings have never taken care of her. They're the ones who forced her to marry this useless son of a bitch in the first place. My dad's other sister, none of her kids are speaking to their father because he's an alcoholic and he beats them and he beats his wife, and no one - like none of her brothers or sisters have stepped in and said, "Look, you can't beat our sister." Yet, his brother isn't talking to any of his kids because he married them all off to rich people who they hate and they're resentful of it. Like where the hell is this like the only people you can count on are your blood family, and, you know, blood is thicker than water, and blah, blah, blah. Like, what the fuck? [00:15:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like my youngest sister isn't even talking to my dad anymore. My middle sister and I exchange pleasantries with him, but have given up on talking about anything that matters. Like ...you know, and then I think about my - my - I guess the best phrase for it is found family here. The people I've been - known and been friends with for ten or twelve years and how they've completely been there for me. There have been people who offered me free housing when I was out of work, people who helped me pay off medical bills when I had a minor medical emergency when I had no insurance. Now the people that were there for me and helped me grieve after my miscarriage, (inaudible at 00:16:30) sure as hell. They were like, "Well, just have more sex and try again." Like who says that? [00:16:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know you had a miscarriage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was two and a half years ago. And it sucked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you actually trying to get pregnant or ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, we had been trying for a year at that point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you go through the whole fertility treatment thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Mostly because I was too chicken. Like I was worried that, you know, there'd be something really wrong as opposed to oh, your timing's just off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've been avoiding doing that, although I really should because I don't know. Not getting pregnant now is slightly more worse than the not getting pregnant at 27.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So have you guys continued to try?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But no success.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm sorry to hear that news. I didn't mean to drill you. That - that was important. [00:17:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've kind of backburnered that part of my life in favor of surviving grad school, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, like if something truly catastrophic happened in my life, I would far more rely on my close friends than my parents or my sisters. There's just no - no question. So I don't know why there's this part of me that still thinks, you know, you're a failure because you don't have a PhD, and you're not earning six figures, and you haven't won all these accolades, and, you know, I was supposed to be the surgeon general or something by the time I'm 40 or I don't even know. My parents had all kinds of crazy expectations. My mom actually got into a screaming match with my sister at Christmas over my sister no longer explicitly saying that her - her lifetime goal is to be a Fortune 500 CEO. Like ... if that's your standard for success, you're either a Fortune 500 CEO or, you know, the Dean of Surgery at a major teaching hospital. There's like maybe 1,500 people like that in the whole country of like 250 million I think. That's - that's - those are some ridiculous odds that you're forcing your kids to mat - to win at and ...[00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there are a lot a lot of people I would imagine who really wouldn't be happy doing those things ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... even if they had a shot at them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's (inaudible at 00:19:56) just occurred to me that, you know, if you think of the brain as a computer, which obviously is an incorrect model in like neuroscience debunk that, but, you know, just think of analogizing a metaphor. If the brain's a computer, like I almost think of my parents' values and influences as a virus, and, you know, I'm on this constant mission to find all the files they've infected and get rid of them, and it's just tenaciously holding on and hiding and dodging my attempts to root it out. [00:20:30]</p>

<p>(Cough)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is - is that I've ... in a sense, like seen you more often in the throes of the illness conveyed by the virus than otherwise. Like otherwise being like now, where although it seemed when you were in school like you were operating more so from the point of you that what I said was true as much as if I asked you, you would have said of course not. [00:22:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that you were - the way you felt and the way you sort of treated yourself and saw things like the kind of realpolitik of it involved your sense of their point of view.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whereas now you sound much freer of that, which I was reading mostly to the transition out of school and doing things you're happier with. [00:23:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I hope you're heading in that direction I think you have been working on, but - but I don't think the ... I think the shift from - from some of the times I saw you, you know, especially in crunch time writing the thesis, but at other times too and now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean I still have fairly frequent moments of thinking, you know, I'm a complete failure for not - for doing a project instead of a thesis, and for doing the Master's instead of the PhD. And what's wrong with me, but ... I don't know, after the first weekend after my advisor kind of went surprise, you're done, where I just wallowed the entire time in self-hatred. I got sick of it.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I wish I was confident this feeling could stick, but, you know, my God, this is just so pointless that I don't want to do this anymore, so I'm going to stop. Like if I could make that stick, then I (inaudible at 00:24:24) anymore. [00:24:26]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if it's going to stick or how to make it stick or how I got there, and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we're working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my impression and experience is that, you know, other than the sort of ongoing processes therapy or something like it, there are sort of strategic solutions or technical approaches or something like that - I mean there are for some things, but I haven't seen the one yet for something like this. [00:25:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Something else that's been on my mind is a friend of mine is - her husband of ten years is divorcing her because he got to the point where he just couldn't cope with her chronic depression anymore. And she like is - what did I say - like she has been like clinically depressed off and on for the entire time I've known her. And from what I gather, from the entire time of their marriage, and that's terrifying to me because while I would consider Dave and I have a fairly healthy marriage, and we certainly don't have any major problems. When we do have small problems or disagreements or, you know, like emotional terribleness going on, about three quarters of the time, it's because he can't cope with my depression, and like it's - I don't know. Seeing (inaudible at 00:26:31) and Dan break up (inaudible at 00:26:32), you know, they had seemed like such a great couple from the outside is really, really frightening. And there's another couple at our church from our choir, friends of Dave's, who got divorced after 40 years of marriage because the wife had been depressed and untreated for almost the entirety of their marriage. And she finally started getting treatment in her 60's and like started having a happy, active life, and they realized that their entire marriage had centered around him being her caretaker. And now that that was over, there was nothing ... [00:27:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... keeping them together. It's like wow, that's ... like that's terrifying to me, you know. What if - you know, what if I can't see it from where I'm standing but, you know, in - in five or ten years, Dave and I are gonna realize my mental health has been screwing up our relationship to the point where we can't stay together, and it's ...</p>

<p>(Cough)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I - I - I guess you're kind of screwed either way there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Well, I mean it's not like I've waited 40 years to get treatment, so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. [00:28:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... it's not quite the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That was your point. I guess I was thinking like here we're describing a worry related to being depressed and a worry related to getting better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean if I'm screwed either way, I'd rather get better and be screwed than stay depressed and be screwed. But no, it's really - it's really frightening to me, and I brought this up with Dave a couple of weeks ago, and he was just - he seemed offended. It was like, you know, we made vows to stay together, and I love you, and do you not trust that I love you, and like do you think I'm gonna leave you, and how could you possibly think such a thing? Haven't I been faithful? I'm like yeah - yeah - yeah, that wasn't the point. It's not you. It's me.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, this was clearly not something I can discuss with him because it pushes his buttons for whatever reason that I don't understand and ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it doesn't make a difference to like get that kind of loving response from him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, at one point, he said something like, "I can't believe you just compared me to Dan. Like what the hell is wrong with you?" Not in those words. Paraphrased.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. Right. But if it all your - your point wasn't to compare him to Dan at all ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:30:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... it was just to be worried that your depression was gonna be too much, not because he was a bad guy or didn't try, but - 'cause he just got overwhelmed beyond that point or something.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>(Cough)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's not that surprising that you'd have a worry about, you know, your relationship not working out or people not really being there for each other. I mean that's far more what you've seen ... [00:31:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Growing up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... growing up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then, if that's the case, then I guess I don't feel wonder like how long is Dave going to have to deal with my fears and mistrust because of my father's sins. Like that's ...</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you feel guilty? [00:32:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I feel angry. Like - I have all of these dysfunctional reactions around conflict, so that if Dave is (sigh) I wouldn't even say angry, like if he's just irked even about anything, like I will immediately go into this horrible fight or flight mode where I, you know, and, you know, madly cycling between groveling for forgiveness and yelling at him about he's really in the wrong, and it's not my fault and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... that's totally a reaction that my mother does whenever my father is angry. And when I'm not in the middle of it, it's clear to both me and Dave that's what's going on. And it - it sucks for me and it sucks for him, and - because he feels like he can't express anything that's not positive for fear that he'll - the situation will provoke me into this horrible dysfunctional coping mechanism that's like - it's frustrating and it's tiring and it's not fucking fair to either of us. [00:33:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope. Not in the slightest.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you call it a coping mechanism to do that, you sort of replicate this coping mechanism of your mother's. What do you think you're coping with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think - like in the situation I grew up with at home, there was - you know, God's rule is law. So if he was angry, you did something wrong, which means you are a bad, horrible person. So there was this - on one hand, you wanted to cringe and grovel and cry so that you would look nonthreatening and apologetic and repentful so that - so he wouldn't beat you. I think my dad only ever actually hit me like less than a handful of times, but I was still terrified all the time that he would beat me. But at the same time, like I don't think I understood it at the time, but in hindsight, there's only so much believing you're a horrible person that a human can take before you have to (clears throat) convince yourself that, "No, he's completely wrong. There can't be anything of value in his criticism because if there was, you would be a horrible person." Who wants to be a horrible person? So ... like go for the sportsters tactic. You'll have to convince him that he is completely wrong and you are completely right at like ... [00:35:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which of course never worked with my dad 'cause he's more stubborn than anyone else in the family, but ... like ... when I fought with my parents, if I could work myself up into being really, really angry at them in the moment, and then that could stave off the I'm a worthless human being and should just kill myself now reaction. And of course with Dave, who didn't grow up with this, it confuses the hell out of him when I react that way 'cause one second, I'm crying and pleading and begging for forgiveness, and then next, I'm screaming and yelling at him and telling him that, you know, he's completely wrong and stupid, and like - like complete one-eighty in attitude on the span of like twenty or thirty seconds. It's ... yeah, it's ... [00:36:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it must be pretty disturbing for both of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been working on stopping that, catching myself before it escalates in the point where, you know, one of us is sleeping on the couch, but - and this doesn't happen often. It's not like we're screaming and yelling ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... every night, but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. No, and ...how often does it happen? [00:37:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's every couple of months maybe. But like even when we're in arguments that don't escalate, it's really - really hard for me to accept a compromise. Like it has to be either entirely his way or entirely my way. And this drives Dave crazy because we'll be having a discussion about something like, you know, pros and cons of like installing a dishwasher, and like we actually spent a whole Saturday afternoon discussing this, and I wouldn't let it go until I had - until either he had defended every single one of his arguments against getting a dishwasher or had accepted every single one of mine. And he was like, "Okay, some of your arguments are stupid, but (inaudible at 00:38:34), you've convinced me we should get a dishwasher."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:38:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "No, no, no. You have to accept all of them or none of them," and in hindsight, I recognize that that was kind of messed up, but like at the time, it was very, very important to me that he had to be 100 percent onboard or zero percent onboard, but none of this like 85 percent that was going on. (Sigh) As you can imagine, this was remarkably frustrating for him.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you worry about ever becoming those sorts of ways in here? [00:39:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Figured I'd ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I figure if I start going off the rails and being completely crazy, it's kind of your job to tell me that's what I'm doing and put a stop to it - sort of ...</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? That - that - that's actually interesting to me. Like even if you were to do that that it would be my job to sort of point it out and call you on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then to stop you somehow? Like ... to say like, "Okay. Time out. Time out. Okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop," or something like that? [00:40:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh?</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you're the professionals' college (inaudible at 00:40:46).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. But I - I mean ... (clears throat)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Like the point of these sessions was to make me less crazy overall. Like ...</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... or at least that's how I see it. Maybe this is incorrect. If so, we should discuss that.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean if you want to put it that way, okay. I can - I can sort of see that as the point here. In a way, I'm just ... [00:41:17]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one reason I'm surprised by that is I would not imagine that my approach generally comes across as sort of telling you to stop doing things or ... advising you to do X, Y or Z differently, but tend ... [00:42:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ... to involve like exploring things, asking questions, you know, trying to get a sense of what things are like for you, saying stuff about that. I guess that in the very least, it seems like it sort of puts me in a - in a - a bit of a different role or a role - this role in a different way. Just like okay. All right. But that one - that one, stop. [00:42:30]</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on. That doesn't do anybody any good. Like, something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I mean - I have been kind of assuming that if I was behaving remarkably dysfunctionally, you would say so quite bluntly and ... you know, maybe that was an incorrect assumption?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I thought ... I would want you to know what I thought about how you were behaving, yeah. I mean I ... you know, if you came in one day and started on a tirade about me for something it didn't seem like I did as far as I could tell. That's it. Which I guess is sort of the kind of thing we're talking about. [00:43:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I would partly say that's how it seemed to me, and partly want to know where you were coming from.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wouldn't dismiss it, as like, "Oh, this is just craziness. You just got to stop." Like I - I'd say, you know, again it - well, it seems to me like you're blowing up this way when I don't see how this adds up, you know, to you getting so angry and blowing up or - or being on this kind of tirade. Yeah, I guess there are times where, like I'll start being more definitive about it and step in with something like, "No, no, no. Like that's not what happened," or "That's not what I did," or "This is just off the wall," or something like that, but pretty rarely. [00:44:42]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we'll talk more. I will also need to charge you for the missed session, or we can deal with that next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. How much is it? I'll just bring a check next time ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:09).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No problem. It will be $90.00 'cause that's what I would've gotten from insurance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Sure. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Talk to you. [00:45:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

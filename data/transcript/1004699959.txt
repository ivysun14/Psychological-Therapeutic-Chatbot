<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. I—I went away for the weekend, as you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Indeed I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Indeed I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I spent time with my brother on Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was totally normal, fine. And as soon the kids came over Saturday morning, he just turns into this just—yelling at them instantly, you know, I'm trying to play with them and he's getting all over them. And he also intervenes in my relationship with them, so it's like, you know, he's telling me them, "Oh, don't"—you know, the—the example I can come up with is a couple of years ago, I was trying to tell them knock-knock jokes, and he would be like, "Don't answer him, don't answer him, don't answer him."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Very odd (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I—I didn't hear exactly what he said, but, you know, I was messing around with my niece, and I was like—as I was leaving the room, he was telling her something. I know he was talking about me. And she's actually afraid of me now. She says like, "I don't know what you're going to do with me." You know, and it's like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tickle you, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was kind of –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, boy, I don't know. Eight?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eight? Oh, my gosh. Ok. Not three.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, three-year-olds, that's—they're afraid of you, and like, whatever. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're afraid of you, and that's not good. But eight or nine-year-olds, that's a different story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. My mom came into town Friday night, and she was—you know, I was talking to her Sunday night. I left—basically spent 24 hours at the lake. I went to the draft (ph) about midday on Saturday and came back about mid—you know, late—late evening on Sunday—Sunday. And you know, my mom was—had even noticed like how—how, you know, he's mean to her and he talks down to her, just like my dad does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:2:21].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, great. So that was a fun weekend. I did have fun at the draft, though. The draft took like six hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that—I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually we finish around 11:00. We finished about 2:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I had fun, you know. It was good, but an exhausting trip, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got a call Saturday morning from (inaudible) clients who are friends of Jess's who were having trouble with getting their tenant to leave. And there's been some physical al—altercation between Jess's friend and the tenant. And then she went to hospital and the police—the police came.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the woman says she's not leaving. So now I've got to evict this woman and everything. I didn't call them back. I'm like, it's my vacation, I'm not –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Wow. [00:03:24].7</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm going to deal with that today. But I didn't call them yet. But um—I never got a call from the psychiatrist to—about a new appointment. You know, she was going to put all (ph) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, what happened? </p>

<p>CLIENT: She was sick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, I was—I was traveling all day Thursday, and—I got these new clients—well, actually they're old clients, I helped them buy their house, but they're having trouble getting their money back from their landlord, um, for rent and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like security deposit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Security deposit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:04:16].7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I remember they told me about it, and I can't remember exactly what the facts were, you know—but you get attorney's fees.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like, I gotta start taking this stuff, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't turn it away. You know, I'm going to figure it out if I can file it in small claims or district court, or, you know, what I'm going to do. Probably just small claims would be easiest, and most sensible, because it's not—it's like $1,700 for the rent and $1,700 for the security deposit. And you don't include the trouble damages (ph) or the attorney's fees, so you get a hearing much quicker. If you don't return the security deposit within 30 days or you have a reason why you haven't returned it in writing, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's trouble damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you don't keep it in a separate account.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I don't know that he did or did not, you know? You're supposed to, you know, give the tenant, you know, notice that—(sighs)—I gotta deal with that today. And uh—I don't really have that much to do, I guess. I guess my closing went fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. I worried about that, like as far as the wire. Are they going to do it on Friday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I got a check—I over-nighted the check Thursday and I got my wire in. And then the check was delivered, so hopefully that will clear and there will be no issues, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But um—they always say on there that, you know, you—you have to use the, you know, you can only use certified funds. Some say you can use an attorney's trust account, but some don't say that. And my bank is one of those ones that's always said certified funds. And I never sent them certified funds. And I just did one in May, the attorney check and they cashed it, so we'll see if—there's nowhere in the note that says that you have pay off the loan in certified funds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? So I don't know if they're state bonded or not (ph). But—I had one bank call me saying that they'd let it go this time, but next time I better get certified funds. So, you know, (inaudible) banking loans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:07:23].9</p>

<p>CLIENT: That could be the only thing that would trip me up is they're like, "Oh, we've got to send it back because they're not certified funds."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They've never done it before, so I don't know why they would do it now. I have practice tonight. Soccer is starting up (inaudible) like soccer. It's probably going to be cancelled—the rain, coaches' clinic. Then we've got soccer practice on Friday, a game on Saturday, and then—everything's changed this year. You know, we have goalies and we have –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:08:07].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: —six players instead of three. And the goals are bigger and there's throw-ins, and it's not really penalty kicks, but you know, just a lot of new—new things that I'm not really sure of their refs, you know, which –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there not refs last year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm just out there in the middle of the field yelling at the kids, "Run, run, get up, get up, kick the ball." So I don't even know if I'm allowed on the field. So they were (ph) the first game the other day, so it's not like I can even watch another game, you know? But uh—I'm just very anxious. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you worried about this? Are you going to miss this stuff up? [00:09:22].4</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm just—just generally anxiety and just kind of a lot of things. And I got to do a lot of things—I'm just—I don't know. Just tired and don't want to do anything. Personal (inaudible) I've got to do today, call this—you know, take a shower, shave (sighs). And then one vacancy (inaudible) about to have money. You know, the constable—one constable wanted $300 for her fee and $1000 for the moving. I don't really have that kind of money. I can't make my life easy and just, you know, work it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe they've worked it out, but hell, I don't know. The woman's supposed to leave today. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was today the end of that 10-day period?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we gave her 10 days to—she could put—she could stay through today—or had to leave today. But she could put her stuff in the basement and leave some of the big things in the living room. But she had to be out of there today because the husband is out of his place and has a moving van scheduled and all that. So I don't know what happened with this altercation. Just—you know, the mom, which is kind of—it is what it is, and the daughter is just all fired up, and, you know, I don't know what happened. (pause) I was kind of angry when I left here last time, I don't know if you noticed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, tell me. [00:12:26].7</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm not really sure why. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel like I was giving you a hard time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. I just felt that—it's not just you. People don't understand that, you know—you just can't—you know, I'm struggling doing what I'm doing now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, I had one more thing I'm going to struggle with doing, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just not that easy to just, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not that easy to do things the way they are now, let alone taking on something new?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I'm—I'm still dealing with the stuff I'm doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know all of the rules, and, you know, I'm—I'm looking at doing a trial. I've never done a trial before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to assess for damages. I've never done that before. It's like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —supplementary process where you figure out how to get the money. I've never done that before. You know, there's all these things I've never done before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All coming up and at me, you know? [00:13:46].4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to deal with that. Nobody's happy. Divorce is going to do the same thing. Nobody's going to be happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, what am I paying you for? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've got—I don't want this coach's thing to be cancelled because, you know, it's—it's good. But it's—I've got—there's something every night this week. You know, I've got a meeting with people for an estate plan on Thursday and um—(pause) you know, it's like I don't have an office where I can get this thing executed, let alone people who witnesses this, and just (pause) you know, just (pause) it's just stressful. I was going to meet a client tomorrow, which I will probably cancel. A meeting on Thursday, I've got soccer Friday. Just (pause) I just got back from a supposed vacation and I already want a break. You know? (pause) My game tonight's a while away, which I don't feeling like driving out there in rush hour traffic, so I'm going to ride my bike, which I probably should do any ways. (pause) My brother has a girlfriend. I'm somewhat jealous of that. [00:17:49].5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thinking about (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause) I am imagining you were mad on—I guess it was—was it last Wednesday? Because I was giving you more about—I was giving you more things to think and worry about. And as you say, you're already feeling overwhelmed with what you have to think and worry about. And (pause) yeah, I think really it didn't feel at all like I was saying, you know, "Hey, let's try to understand this. I'm not really quite following how A leads to B." And, you know, like I was (inaudible) whatever. It felt much more, I think, like I was sort of making you feel overwhelmed with the need to figure this out or act in a different way. And probably also as though you should be able to do divorce or something like it, or something along those lines. In other words that I was talking about divorce, not per se, but even in here, that it felt much less like we were talking in a way that could be sort of helpful or lead us to understand more what was going on with you, and much more so like this was just something else that was difficult and anxious and overwhelming to deal with. [00:21:39].8</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember exactly, but –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —what I do remember is that I just felt like I'm struggling enough as it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was—that message was getting to be made.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. I wasn't getting that from the way we were talking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just the topic that got (inaudible)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I—I—I mean, maybe. But I—I—maybe you're also right. But I—I think—I think you are right that I didn't get how anxious and overwhelmed—it's not that I didn't get how anxious and overwhelmed you're feeling by the things you have to do. I—I mean that's something we talk a lot about and I—I know generally to be true. I think somehow I wasn't linking that up with the way we were talking about doing the divorce stuff. I think you're right, there was a connection that I was not making there. (pause) I guess I will say the thing—or a thing that's (pause) not clear is how some of these things become overwhelming. Let me—let me explain what I mean. I know that it has something to do with external factors, like if you've got to do—you know, evict somebody, which is something you haven't done, or do a trial, which is something you haven't done, or, you know, coach soccer when the sort of rules and set up is different because the kids are older. I certainly understand that in general, you know, having to deal with new things like that and being the one who is responsible for making sure things go well can be stressful. I—I—you know, that's—makes sense to me. But you know, I would imagine we would agree that there's also more that gets added to that, like that there are reasons that, you know, really unfortunately, you're finding some of these things more anxious and overwhelming, and it's just to do with like the sort of external factors, like the newness. Now maybe you don't see it that way. Maybe you can say like, "What does anybody who's got to deal with as much new stuff as I do, along with the financial stress and the loneliness and all that, is going to feel this way?" And ok. I mean, that's reasonable. Like maybe that is it. I mean, that is how you feel about it. I guess it's kind of seemed to me like maybe other things are going on. So I guess, now that I get around to it, I'm asking you a question. [00:26:08].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's the question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The question is (pause) let's say with the soccer, which seems to me in some sense may be more benign than the worst job (ph), what—what do you think you're worried about there? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Part of it's just, you know, "What am I going to do with these kids for an hour?" And –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, are you afraid of looking like a jackass in front of the parents? Are you afraid of being anxious around—yelling at the kids and getting really angry and then feeling bad about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I know they're going to stress me out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To date, I've done a good job of not losing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's like goalie—you know, she wants to play goalie every time, but you can't—you've got to give everybody a chance. And I don't know they just—they throw you into this so unprepared that it just—I just feel completely unprepared for, you know, what to do and—you know, it's—I don't even know if I can be on the field or not. Am I on the sideline, am I on the field, you know, I—I don't know. You know, it's like they—they tell you you can't talk to these kids, explain something for more than a minute, then all these new things you need to explain to them, so it's like, you know, like offense and defense, you know? What is an offensive player supposed to do? What's a defensive player—how do you explain that in a minute to a little kid, you know? (pause) And there's just—you know, I don't have an assistant coach, because he's coaching his daughter's team this year, and you know, there's two weekends this year, one where I'm going to a bluegrass festival and one where I've got a tournament.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:29:14].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like, I don't know. I've got to get someone to cover. You know, you cancel practices, but you know, for the games, I need someone to step up and technically they're supposed to, you know, have a CORI done –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, a background check. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's all due process, pain in the ass stuff, you know, and (pause) I don't know. Just it feels like nothing's easy, you know? Nothing is. (pause) You know, I spent the whole day with the kids yesterday and when I got back from—you know, I had an early flight so I got—picked the kids up around 11:00, got home and met them at the park, and you know, Jess's telling me how, you know, when I'm not there, Lucille's like, "Dada dada dada." But when I'm there, she wants nothing to do with me, you know? And after like literally a couple of hours, she finally was like, you know, letting me come play games with her, you know, like peek-a-boo and stuff like that. I thought I'd (inaudible) and you know, but still it's like, you know just frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:31:06].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jess wants me to pick a day—I gotta—pick up Ian on Tuesday's and take him to swimming every day—every week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know if there's a day she wants me to pick Lucille up from daycare and it's like, you know –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —just all these things are being added and thrown at me and I don't know, just—I don't know, just so much going on. Just (pause) I'm getting tired of going to being high (ph) every Thursday, you know? My last month as president, you know, it's just (pause) I don't know if I'm getting to the point where I'm not enjoying anything anymore. (pause) I just ate way too much this weekend, I just can't stop eating. (pause) It's just—just like trying to schedule a fucking appointment with the psychiatrist, it's like, you know, just—I don't know why, but it just stresses me out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:34:28].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) A lot of it is I just don't feel motivated or like I have the energy to just deal with all this stuff. [00:37:03].0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (pause) Well, you're so overwhelmed and there's so much to be dealing with. I mean, I'd imagine that, you know, if you're finances were in good shape, you were in a relationship that was making you happy, you know, things were good with your kids, then, you know, soccer practice might be a little stressful, but not like it is, kind of along with everything else. I mean, a lot of things are kind of like that, if that makes sense? You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my audit next—next week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh—I got the—I'll have to prepare for that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:38:26].6</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just not ready to do, you know? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) on your mind? [00:41:21].4</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Just—racing through all the different things I've got to do, all the things I'm forgetting that I've got to do, I've got to sent out the payment for the health insurance and just my mind is just bouncing from one thing to another, so (pause) (sighs) I just wish things would resolve themselves, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:43:06].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: So much to be thinking about. (pause) I wish I had more closings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could turn all this stuff down (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's too late. I've already got too much to do. I've already taken all this stuff on and I just –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now.</p>

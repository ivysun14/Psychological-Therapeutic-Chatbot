<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session Ten. I woke up at two-thirty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The thing I was doing though - just to finish this up - was as I said staying up until I was tired which would be sometimes as many as twenty hours. And then if I slept seven and a half it means I was on a cycle of twenty-seven and a half hours. So I'd eventually catch up with myself and I'd get like six good nights sleep a week. But this would bring problems because people would call me at two in the afternoon and I'd be just going to bed you know? (chuckles) Or just be going - Or just fast asleep and [kind of got things goofed up.] (ph) Well anyhow - 0:00:35.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, we can go until five after and that will give us a little more than (inaudible at 0:00:39.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, fine. I've noticed one thing that's made - well now that the exam is getting close, I think different ways about it, you know, and about how it's kind of structured my life. And I know the strong similarity between this and the final month before my swim that I was feeling the exact same things. Not - you know it's sort of a trivial thing - while I was - that it was a big moment in my life and I didn't know whether it was going to go one way or the other. But it's really true. Like I'm living now with the idea of failure and to see how that would suit me. And it didn't last time and then I'd get sort of like maybe I'd feel that way for a week. Thinking that I'm not going to make it for a week. And then for another week I'd feel really good about it. 0:01:33.3</p>

<p>And it's amazing how I'm really so driven by creating this crisis. I'll have some well-defined goal and then I'll have a crisis to get to achieve that goal. And I'll either make it or I won't. Fortunately, I've chosen easy ones so far. This is the first one where I'm really wondering.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's questionable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it just shows there's probably some method to my life. However, now that I said that I'd like to completely discount that and tell you a little bit about nuclear physics because it's been a great analogy for me during the past week. The state of nuclear physics is - well of course - is generally the first week they give you all the facts about what they know about the nucleus. And then after the ten-week course, the next nine weeks each week is spent on a different model none of which is very good. 0:02:20.9</p>

<p>But each one can explain a certain phenomenon. So you say well, ["Isn't this composed of shells?"] (ph) and they say, "Only if you want to explain this." "Is it composed of a liquid drop?" "Only if you want to explain this." And I'm sort of feeling that way about this right now. I mean, what we're doing here. It boils down sometimes to saying well - when I first came here I was just throwing out facts. And just sort of being honest for the first time it seems like with myself. And mostly just saying things that I never tell anyone else but I really knew myself. And so I got all the facts out and then you sort of construct models. And the models work only for the things you construct them for. 0:03:03.9</p>

<p>There's the one - the latest big thing now is the ego thing; that that's what drives me. And I - you know you can come up with things that that satisfies. But then there are things that don't fit into that model so therefore you construct a different model. And well it seems to me - well to go back to the analogy - the state of nuclear physics is sort of right now saying - as a matter of fact it's really a dead thing except for nuclear power. They're just waiting around for more knowledge. They're just saying, "Well right now we can't investigate any farther because we don't have the equipment to get more data. And until we do have more data our models will just work." So it's really a phenomenal logical field now. All the models that have been drawn up are already made and as I said they can fit to whatever you want them have them fit or not fit. 0:04:02.9</p>

<p>So what's the point? I mean, you know if I can come up with a given model in a given situation, does that mean that I'm behaving that way because of the same - I mean, because I fit that model? Or am I saying this is my behavior. Here's a model that describes that behavior so let's just take it. Then when I don't fit that behavior it's, "Well, we'll have to look at another model that happens to work." Which makes it seem kind of futile. I mean, at any given juncture, are my motivations reduced to, "Well this is what caused them?" or is it just unanalyzable right now? And there's no way I can tell. I don't - this isn't new. I mean I - it's just something that - the idea I know isn't anything new to me anyhow. But I just never really thought about that being the case but it certainly seems to be. 0:05:10.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that's partly because you don't have the opportunity now to go get any data?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think anyone does. You see - well let me tell you the way I feel about the whole science thing and your work. Well - and again these are all lay thoughts. I mean, I haven't read much in your field and these are just my thoughts as a physicist. But anyhow, I find social sciences often times quite contrived in that a structure will be developed - a pseudo-scientific approach to something, which merely fits the data. Now certainly physics is that way too. I mean we don't know the basics. I mean there is no unified field theory that tells us why everything interacts in a given way. And we'll get down to the point where we don't know why electrostatic charges work, why there's [colonic repulsion.] (ph) But at least we're now that far and we realize those limits. 0:06:11.2</p>

<p>And I think an awful lot of social scientists and I'm going to - well that's a really broad term - but there's some like sociologists that just use glitter and generalities I feel all the time. And haven't really gotten anything out - it's not a predictable thing. Well now on the upper end of the other side - the scientific side - I place medical doctors who don't really understand the workings of the chemistry and the - well my structure is this: mathematicians come first, then I would say physicists are a little bit removed from reality because they don't really say, "Well why does this interact?" They can sort of explain it. Then the chemists are just working with the physicists tell them and sort of making their own structure. It gets much more complex of course. And a physicist can't understand chemistry because it's more complex. 0:07:03.3</p>

<p>Then you get to the biological sciences. And you finally phase out of the scientific era when you get to the medical researchers because now you're working with such a complex organism that it cannot be reduced to basic principles. So then you take this amazing leap and now you're at the psychologists. And now you're into the social sciences because now it's man's mind interacting and the chemistry of the mind hasn't been figured out. If the chemistry of the mind ever gets figured out and we understand how the brainwaves work then maybe we could make that leap across science to social science. But I think that it's really impossible right now for a psychologist or psychiatrist to really take it back to first principles because we don't know the chemistry of the brain. We don't know what makes it click and what makes everything work. So therefore, I look at your work with - well, I'd never do it. I mean, I just couldn't take the lack of certainty of it. 0:08:13.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ambiguity of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So that's how I feel about it. And now that I think about - see I've sort of displaced what we're doing from that because it's - you know I can fit everything into a nice, neat structure, except myself. And I'd rather - you know, I thought I was just going to come here and everything would be all straightened around. I didn't really fit it into this idea of it - you know, we can't really figure it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds - is that what you're doing now? Saying, "what if I can't really figure out myself?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, - yeah, that's a problem. You see maybe that's not what anyone comes here for. I mean, "I behaved at two pm this afternoon this way because of these reasons." And just list them right down the line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, is that what you came here for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think that initially I was going to - I felt that something, yeah, to that effect could be done. And everything would really be settled out. And yet still, I mean, this little harangue I just went into about where the scientists fit in my mind has long been there. I've often felt that way. I mean I've long felt that way. But I didn't sort of fit myself into it. And now I'm beginning to do that because I realize what we've done. We've created these models that have [to be created because of the complexity of the situation.] (ph) And well that was kind of a discouraging thought that crossed my mind. However, if you don't look at it that way - if you just say, "All right we'll live with this uncertainty and we'll live with the fact that it cannot be reduced to first principles" - then well realizing that you can work with a little bit more confidence that you're doing something that's going to work. 0:10:10.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that where you are right now? Like in this - in a way of realizing that uncertainty?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it's just growing between - see I sort of like put two separate little corners in my mind. One that was - you know, you work with me and the other was [this type work in general] (ph) and now they've drawn together. And it kind of makes me feel good that my previous analysis, which was based on no personal experience, seems to be true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you were right [in what...] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you ever feel like really futile at times? Like you say, "Oh, this is really ridiculous. I'll never figure this guy out or never straighten him around."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I may feel futile sometimes about people but it's not in that sense because I don't - the way I happen to look at it, I don't have to figure him out to straighten him around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh! Well that's nice. Now how can you explain that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's a little complicated. It's hard for me to figure out how to just exactly explain it. But see I feel like you're right in the sense that you can't figure everything out. First of all, it's too complicated. It would take years to figure somebody out -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -as far as I can see. But I feel that if I can not help them figure out the reasons why they act the way they do but help them get in touch with say their feelings in all the situations - in many of the situations that they're in. Then that is the - [that's where I mean.] (ph) And I think that frees people up because they're in touch with what's really going on inside of them and [they can act or choose what they do more freely.] (ph) 0:12:01.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, so it's more of a feeling thing than an action - I mean, rather than resolving actions, knowing how one feels about actions or  - ?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you mean rather than an action?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well rather than saying, "You behaved this way at this moment because of these reasons."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's not that really. I mean, sometimes you know but I think - sometimes for yourself it helps to know why you behave. Sometimes it helps me. But where I'm aiming is like they can - where I'm aiming is more like helping them see how they feel about things and think - like what things mean to them. How things hit them. And then they can choose their actions from that. 0:12:43.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a different emphasis I think is what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the point - yeah, I see. The thing is - do most people come here then with an idea of - as I apparently did - which is trying to figure out why they behave in a given way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some people do. Some people come here with all kinds of you know different ideas. Some people come that way yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can imagine you having people just with so many different approaches to this thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow. I can also - does it ever happen that someone comes up with a - you know, major insight number 327 that someone else came up with the session before or something? And you just - (chuckles) I get the idea that I'm sitting here saying, "Oh, look at this," and you're saying, "Oh, that's pretty cool. You know, Joe Blow [spotted that about two weeks ago] (ph) so you're behind him there. But you thought about this one ahead of him." 0:13:42.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you mean like you're competing in a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No - well, yeah, of course, that's in my nature but not necessarily competing as much as - I'm looking at it as a great big almost divine inspiration when I can come up with something about my life. And you're sort of sitting here saying, "Well yeah a lot of - you know, that's a standard stage. Everyone figures that out about themselves. Next will come this." And sure enough, I'll come in next Wednesday and boom! This will come out. And as though - well, I don't know. I get the idea that I'm doing something very amateurishly; that you can sit back there and just sort of nod and agree with and sort of almost realize what's going to come next. 0:14:25.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's really not true that I can realize what's going to come next.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you often hang labels on what I do or what I say? I mean, because -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just some - I don't mean some medical term but some new philosophy that I've suddenly embodied because [well I've sort of evolved] (ph) -  you know my thinking has evolved during the course of this  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I've gone from one idea to the next. I mean, if you were to sit down with someone who shared your vernacular, would you say - if you had to describe how I've progressed in a paragraph - could you say, "Well, he went from, you know, from this to this to this to this," or maybe thought that for a while then this for a while? Are there words to hang on? 0:15:15.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the kind of words that I - I mean, there are for some people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Put it that way. For you, the way I would think of it is more in terms of - let's see. How would I describe you in a paragraph if I were to  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't want a description.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just want to know if my behavior is such that it ought - well if anyone's behavior is such that your science is well enough developed so that at any given point it's pretty much to see where it fits in. Do you have enough models defined such that I haven't gone you know into any great new thing with what I've told you? 0:15:55.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, before I answer that let me ask you how you would feel if I said, "No, you haven't gone into any new thing."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think - well, first of all, I'm almost certain that's pretty true because  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But how does it make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, first of all, I don't think it'll change my opinion because I think you're getting ready to tell me that anyhow. But I think it'll just make me feel that - well, the way I feel about the whole thing is the fact that I could come here, I could spend about ten weeks explaining everything to you and you could spend the next ten weeks straightening me out and getting me all set to go out in the world. Boom! There I go and maybe I'd be goofed up the next day. On the other hand, you could do as you've done, and let me sort of plow my own way through it. And it's much more important for me to come up with a conclusion and me to base my life on what I feel than for you to say, "Well you're model number thirty-two and you fit into this. Therefore, you should feel that way and that will make you feel better." And, lo and behold, I do feel better because I feel that way. You know, the idea that a psychiatrist sits with his notepad for a while and then sort of mulls over his notes. Then the guy comes back and the psychiatrist does the talking. 0:17:12.8</p>

<p>I think that to get away from that and to get back to what you're doing, which is infinitely superior, you have to avoid saying, "Well, let's - you know, you're feeling that way because of this," or "I've got that one figured out that you're this model." I mean, you have to avoid doing that but I still think you do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but I want to know now - you think I do to myself you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I - yeah, I think -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well wait - Now I still want to know; how would you feel if I said, "Yes, you have come up with new models?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow! New? Oh! Well, first of all, (laughing) I'd lose a little of the confidence I have in you if I can, with my shallow thinking about life, come up with something that's new and unusual. No, I don't know about that. I just don't think that - I just don't think that I -  0:18:01.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to take it back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What were you going to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said, you don't have to take it back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no. I just don't think I'm deep thinking enough to have come up with something new. And if I have come up with anything - you know, some major insight that no one gets to really or maybe very rarely, I'd be very surprised. And it would probably do what I'm been trying to avoid doing; giving my ego a boost. Now I think you better not answer. (chuckles) Well...I don't know. It's sort of strange looking at what we're doing instead of, you know  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want an answer or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well see I don't - I don't think of it exactly in those terms. Like I don't think of it as, does this person come up with new models or did this person not come up with new models that are like of such significance for everyone. You know, like nuclear physics models. What I do think is that everybody comes up with their own way of putting things together. I think everybody does that. Like everybody struggles with things in a little bit different way, which keeps - that's one of the reasons it's so interesting to do; like you don't exactly hear the same things over. You know, you hear people again and again who say - who have trouble with their schoolwork right? - or have trouble with failing in school or you know like you were talking about or with whatever else. But each of them have a little bit different way of - a little bit different problem and a little bit different answers to it. So I guess in a sense the answer is both yes and no. 0:19:53.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you certainly must get some repetition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, do you ever get the feeling that, "Well here he comes again today. I wonder if he's going to say this." And, lo and behold, he says that. You know, he reached that stage. Does that ever really happen? I mean, I said it with a tone of voice that maybe I shouldn't have. But do you ever get sort of - you have a feeling that I might come up with something and, lo and behold, I do? 0:20:18.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't, to date, had the feeling, "Now this morning, Wes is going to come in with such and such." And, lo and behold, you did. No. There are times when I have clients and I say to myself, "it's very likely next time - it sounds like they're leading up to something." I don't know exactly what but I feel like I'm not exactly getting to what meaning that has for you. I don't know if it makes you feel unimportant or  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you see I'm really torn. I don't know whether I'm a scientist or not, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether - everyone I've ever talked to has said that I shouldn't be a scientist. Anyone that really knows me said I shouldn't be a scientist. I should work with people. Well, that's fine except I really don't think there's - I just am not satisfied with it scientifically. I have done it well in the past. And so that I really am torn between - you know - looking at a thing -  being able to look at the type of work you do in a scientific light and find some predictability to it. And just sort of by-the-seat-of-your pants type thing where - well that's a bad way to word it - but where a person is maybe born to be a psychologist and he can be taught to be a physicist - that difference. Not saying that education is - 0:21:40.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're wondering if there's that difference or you're wondering how you'd doing  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm just talking (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you talking about here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (chuckles) Why don't we get off of the idea of what psychology is and get back to me? But actually I well  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well - okay  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: What were you going to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well see I'm not sure whether you're talking about - whether psychology is - whether you'd like working with people - which might be one level of it - or whether you're talking something about how you feel coming in here all the time and saying things to me and feeling like they're repetitious and how that - I'm not sure -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I think I said a long time ago that I was worried that I was wasting your time. 0:22:23.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That your time was more valuable than my meager problems. That passed when I realized that a person - when I told you that a person's problems are his problems. And - but now I don't feel the guilt about it but I sort of do feel the - I do get the feeling that the exciting, new insights for me are maybe not necessarily exciting new insights for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not - I don't - nah, I don't think it will - I don't think it would make much difference as far as  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like that does make some kind of difference to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I don't think it does to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that I guess  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: See I don't  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something about it not making a difference to me that makes you uneasy or you don't like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I like that. That's - I mean, if I came in here and had the feeling that - I mean, if you had a checklist out. You know, a mimeographed checklist and I came up with something, you whipped it out, checked the left-hand column because I finally hit that thing and I was going to leave when I finally hit all thirty-seven items, then I'd feel bad. Now you seem to be at the opposite extreme. You seem to be - even though I feel that that's the case, if it were the case that something like that were happening, I think that's probably the only way you could lie to me. You know, to make me feel good by not letting me know about that list. I don't think you do that. I'm sure you - 0:24:09.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you still suspect I have a list in the lower left  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping laugh) Yeah, I guess I do. Well I don't know. Maybe you do and you don't want to admit it. Maybe you like to look at each person and realize that a person is himself and that you have to treat each one individually. But maybe there are two basic patterns and that you realize them and can see them emerge. 0:24:35.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, first of all, what kind of list do you think I have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have any idea. You see that's the thing. My ignorance of the field is great enough such that I can have all these strange fantasies about what's going on in your mind. Now if I knew more about it, did some reading, then I'm sure that this whole thing we've gone into is just a waste of time. I'm just pretty sure that's the case. But it isn't the case and  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well I do have in a sense an idea that the direction I want to help you go is to help you get in touch with your feelings. And that's my list in a sense. There may be other things like I would like it - let's see if I can think of it. Oh, I'd like you to - which is really the same thing said in a different way - be able to get a feel for whatever has happened. Like it's not necessarily for example - like I'd like you to - well this doesn't apply to you but it's all I could think of. So I won't bother saying it. But there's also - if you're interested in the kind of way I think about it - have you read any Carl Roger's books? 0:25:57.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a book called, "On Becoming a Person," which you might find interesting to read.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll remember that. (chuckles) Not that I'll have time between now and June 1st. I have about seventeen books on my shelf now that I've said, "Oh! I've got to read that!" Then I study and I put them back up on the list - on the shelf. And I'm really going to have a good time this summer sitting on the beach reading [all of them.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if I have a list, I do have some kind of a - you know, it isn't really a list. It's kind of an orientation; a way of working. But it's not a list of, "Well now he's got to get through these seventeen issues."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I see. I don't know why I went into this so much but - [well, I guess it's just because it's the one that was on my mind, which is all I ever go into.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And it sounds like it was important to you.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, anyhow, does that - does all this lend new insight as to what has transpired so far? 0:27:03.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I couldn't hear what you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Has that changed any - I mean, does what we've said today change anything about what we've said in the past? That's where I'd like to take it now. And I think it does to the extent that I was pretty much analyzing it - well, just analyzing the heck out of it. I realize now that that cannot be done. So that - well, like when I was going through all of my many true loves in my quarter of a century of life and all the - both of them maybe or whatever it is ever since kindergarten. Well, remember that stage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I tried to come up with some - an overall conclusion that this is what drives me. And it's silly to do that. It really is. You're never going to come up with anything. You can say how you feel at certain times and - but to try and place everything that's happened into - and to make it fit and therefore predict what you are because you can do that, it's pretty hard. But then again, there are significant trends that shouldn't be ignored. And well, I don't know. Your statement - I'd like to examine a little about not so much helping a person understand why he behaves in a given way in a given situation but helping him understand his feelings. Now that's important. That's - you should have said that about four times ago and then I'd really (inaudible at 0:29:01.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would have been helpful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if it would be helpful. Yeah, I guess it would have been helpful. That's pretty important. You see, [there's a difference though between feelings and motivations.] (ph) I mean, how I feel about something...yeah, I guess - I don't think you're ever going to really come down to motivation.[I think you just better live with them.] (ph) Live with your actions. Maybe at a given point, if you're self-examined enough, you can - any given action you could say, "Well, let's think for a second," you know. And realize what might be motivating you there, greed, avarice, whatever it is in my case. And then you could say, "Well, that's the wrong thing. Let's not let the self-centered idea be the thing that's motivating you. Let's do something nicer. [I'll find better.] (ph) Or you can just sort of let yourself go and then find out why you - and then feel about it; feel about how you behave. And I think that if you felt badly enough about how you behaved often enough and you really examined your feelings, that naturally you would change your actions. 0:30:29.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you would change them out of how you feel about them rather than  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well that's - [hang on though] (ph) - that's what this is all about though. I was coming here because I was feeling pretty bad about my actions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I want to say, I don't want to give you the impression that I didn't think what you've been doing is  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -on the right track.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because I didn't feel that way. That it was on the wrong track.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Not that it's necessarily on the wrong track but there seems to be a whole new direction I haven't had it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hmm. Right. Yeah. That's - yeah, but maybe there's more. [More ways to it.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, do you ever have people leave more mixed up than they came?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you worried that that might happen to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It could. Now I don't want to say - nah, worried isn't the right word. Let's go back to the analogy again. I mean a schoolchild that takes elementary science courses has an idea as to what a nucleus is. And you might be very comfortable with that okay? Now if his - but he's bothered because some phenomenon cannot be described by his idea then he'll probe it a little deeper. And I mean if he's only got twenty sessions to probe, he might just come out of that with just - oh! - The most god-awful feeling because he will just be so confused because he'll never understand the workings of it. Indeed, the best nuclear scientists in the world don't understand the workings of it so why should he? So wasn't it maybe a little better with him just, you know, back there not even worrying about - you know, so the first little worry, you say, "Oh, you know." Maybe he should have had some teacher that brushed it off, [said, "Don't worry. Let's talk about something else.] (ph) 0:32:27.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying, yeah, maybe that kid should have just never followed that up and been satisfied with the simple explanation. And you're saying that I guess about yourself too. Like, "Maybe it'd be better really to just stay where I am than to get into all this complexity and confusion."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if stay where I am is right - where I am. No, that's not right. The - well, I said earlier to that I would never have come had I not been living pseudo-alone in the last six months. I would have been so caught up in myself that I wouldn't have time to look at myself. So maybe that's the ignorant state that I'm talking about which I got beyond. Because once you're out beyond that state, there's no sense going back. You can't comfortably go back to an "ignorance is bliss" state after having passed it. But it also seems futile to try and get to the - you know, what's the opposite of "ignorance is bliss"; "knowledge is golden" or whatever the case may be? That end is not achievable. 0:33:42.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not - you're saying - I guess you're saying it's never really that simple  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -when you get beyond that ignorant state.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Boy, so many people are in that state, too, when you think about it. So many people just don't even think about why they're behaving in a certain way. And I'm not talking about just - you know, [your average Joe Blow off the street] (ph) that would never even think about therapy but you know - people that are bright people that are around. You know, intelligent, well-accomplished people - 0:34:19.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that it makes you feel good to realize that that at least you think about those things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that it makes me feel good. Yeah, I guess maybe it does. It makes me feel better. When I look at them realizing that maybe they should too. When I think of - when I can look at other people and see such a strong motivating force in them and they're being completely ignorant of it. Or when their feelings are just an open book to me and they don't realize them. Then I think, "Wow! Why don't they stop for a minute and do something like this?" Then too, other people have been saying the same thing about me. [Actually, my friends have come in here and you've talked to them for a while and then come back to you and maybe you'll have me all straightened around in no time.] (ph) No sweat. 0:35:11.1</p>

<p>I don't know - well, I don't know that that's too much the case because I talked to June and I talked to my roommate Steve, who lived with me for two years and seen me act and interact. And they didn't come up with anything that I thought was particularly inspirational. Oh by the way, [I've seen June a couple of times lately] (ph) and it's really - we've had a couple of really good talks - mostly about me, which is nice of her. Although I think she realizes that I'm - I mean she probably shouldn't waste the time helping me figure myself out. But she has. And - 0:35:57.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really appreciate it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I - but it's really progressed to a stage where now I have no desire to - remember I was worried about falling in love with her. And that's clearly not going to happen. The opposite extreme has happened. It's become a very, very heady thing. We sit and talk for a while and there's no - there's nothing beyond that. But I think she's pretty mixed up too now that I look back at it. I mean, but anyhow it's nice to have someone that you can do that with. That you could - I mean besides having a therapist. You know I - I wonder how many people really do have a person - you see, one of my standards as to how many close friends I have - I mean really close friends - is if I died tomorrow, how many people would assume they'd be pallbearers? It's easy for me because most of my close friends are guys or chief mourners, if it's a woman - if it's girl. [Or I'd call her a pallbearer too. It doesn't matter.] (ph) 0:37:08.4</p>

<p>And I'd come up with maybe three right now so I'd have to have a lot of wheels on the casket. But people that feel they're so close to you that your passing would be an important part of their life. And right now - yeah well, I just don't think that anyone really - of those people they're so divergent and so different that no one really knows me very well. I would say June probably knows most where my head is at of anyone. And the other people whom I consider close friends by this strange standard were developed as friends over the past when I wasn't looking at my motivations and my feelings. 0:38:04.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's kind of distance between you and them  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: -because you've gone somewhere else in the meantime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like to develop at least six new friends just so I've had a [good set of pallbearers I guess.] (ph)(chuckles) That's a morbid way of looking at things but I think it's a really good standard. I've told that to people and they almost slapped me. They said, ["What? That's really disgusting. Don't think about that."] (ph) But I think it's really cool. It'd be great to have about one hundred people who would assume that because then you're really a tight friend you know? Hey, I wonder how many people that - I was just thinking of the compos - the reverse. How many people if they died tomorrow would - I'd - would I be one because I was so close - 0:38:49.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you assume  - ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If they were realizing they were dying tomorrow would they choose me today? Probably the same three - that's about it. Well, anyhow the thing I was getting at was, I don't think many people are really well examined at all and have any person that they confide in honestly. I think that married couples are honest only because of the proximity of years and years and years of just seeing each other's lives. I don't think they ever came out and said, "Well, I behave this way because of this." And well like I look and my own parents and well they had facades up till a couple of years ago. And lately now they've finally sort of torn them down and - well, my father's been retired and so that they are together all the time. And well like it used to be - he had a terrible temper. And he'd go into like two weeks of temper tantrums. I don't mean there would be yelling and stuff like that. He would just go into a shell and not interact. And wow! What a strong fa�ade. I mean, even with my mother there would be very few words spoken for weeks on end just because he'd be in this temper thing. And wow! People that live together all their lives - well not all their lives. They got married late - but a long time, still have these tremendous walls between them. 0:40:19.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's amazing how that can happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And - I mean I wouldn't even conceive of marrying a woman that I would - that that would ever cross my mind ever happening. I don't think right now I could conceive marriage period but that's beside the point. But if two people in the old school manner - as my parents are - got married and lived together all this time and still have these tremendous walls and couldn't honestly sit down and a have talk about it, imagine what most of the relationships of people in the world are like? Pretty shallow I think. 0:40:58.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you saying about - I'm not clear what you're saying about yourself in all of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm saying that I'm starting to realize that I don't have that many deep relationships - many honest ones. The people that I really feel comfortable around are ones that, you know, it's a former me. And they might feel comfortable with the other me. And there are the people that I'm around like my parents that just because I've been around them since age four or five, we just know each other. We're predictable, not necessarily knowing why a person's going to act a certain way, but we know how he's going to act. And we find comfort in that. So it makes me feel bad that my life hasn't developed deep relationships but it makes me feel good to realize I'm only twenty-five and I've got - 0:41:48.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you still have time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or at least I've got a few minutes if I don't run out and get killed in the street. [But just because I've started is a good sign.] (ph) So I feel comfortable about starting. But well it's strange now though that I have - see of all the people I know - I haven't met any new people lately so that I can't develop any of these honest relationships because it's hard to tear down walls. Actually, I've come to non-interaction. I just haven't seen the people lately. Of course, that could be because of the [current situation with this exam.] (ph) 0:42:37.9</p>

<p>But I'm more interested right now with meeting new people and trying to see if I can interact honestly and not build the walls than I am with tearing down the walls with people that are in my past. Then too, I - people in my past I don't like as much as I used to before. I  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping) (inaudible at 0:42:56.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:42:57.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We keep interrupting ourselves here. That's a good thought. The thought that - well, I look at people now - the prime example, everyone fits into this that I've mentioned but the prime example is of course Nancy. [I look at it now in a completely different light - a very distasteful light. And like I haven't seen her in three weeks.] (ph) I used to be over there every day for dessert or something like that. And it was really a comfortable relationship. And now it's quite uncomfortable. I just never see her. Is that going to be - well, is that because in the past I never was selective about friends? I never thought about [a person's will] (ph) and never thought much about how a person acted. And, therefore, I ended up with some bad friends.</p>

<p>Or it is just a fact that anyone you're going to get as a friend is going to have faults and I'm just realizing that now? 0:43:55.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure which?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I think I just sort of have the idea of how people like [Laura should find each other - just sort of glow on each other's ego and let them blow the old one away and that's fine.] (ph) But I don't want to be a part of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're wondering now is, "Can I find friends who I will like?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There are some people that I know fairly well that I think I should probably - some really nice people but I just haven't been close enough to but - I could be closer to them. Maybe I'll probe those relationships. Well, we'll see. Has today been very helter-skelter more than other days?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel it has?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This - today was one of the few days that I came in with very few thoughts. My mind's been busy with physics [all week.] (ph) And as a matter of fact, just last night I said, ["Well let's see. How much did you straighten around this week?"] (ph) And I thought, "My gosh!" you know? I haven't straightened around much at all. And the only thing I can come up with is sort of this vague little thing about psychology as a science. And we started from there and I seem to have been ranting and raving on. Hey, by the way, have I contradicted myself often or at all? 0:45:37.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I don't know. What if you did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - it doesn't - you know, it would just show an unexamined self, which I admit readily and freely. I mean  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which would be embarrassing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think that's probably your role more than anything. If I were to come up with, you know, an answer or a question - come up with something - and it completely contradicts something that happened five sessions ago that I just seem to have forgotten in all this mish-mosh in my head, I would think you should come up and say, "Hey, how did that fit into this?" Because wow! It might change everything around. But have I? Have you noticed any glaring  - ? 0:46:20.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well - any what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Glaring inconsistencies?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Well, no, I haven't. But say if I did, it might - I haven't looked for that either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I haven't looked for that because you might come up with something today, which is different from say five weeks ago because you feel differently today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that sounds like [kind of some - kind of concern for making it] (ph) all stick together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Reducing it to a science when it isn't probably. I don't know. Yeah, well, I don't know. That started like back in the old thought when I first came in - like complete confidence that you have your list and that it all fit in. And you'd say, "Oops! Number sixteen doesn't jive with number eighteen," or "you got them out of order," or something like that. And I realize that now it probably isn't the case. It certainly isn't the case. 0:47:21.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that disappointing in some way or [disheartening?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhhhhhh, I wouldn't say - uh, yeah, it's a small disappointment in some way. But it's a disappointment with a former standard. Now I realize that standard was all wrong. You know if I look at how I was going to come in here - what I thought was going to happen and what does happen - well they're two completely different standards. So. Well anyhow, the point is I seemed to have - well I guess that's all we ever do is just follow one thread, you know, through all sorts of things. But there have been times when, wow, I've come up with seventeen major insights during the week. I list them and write notes on occasion because there was just too much in my head to remember. And I didn't want to miss anything.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, there are times like this time when it's probably - well things that come out just because I'm talking you know? 0:48:37.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you're a little unhappy that there aren't seventeen new insights a day or [you're a little down about that?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nah, I don't know that I'm unhappy about it. I mean there are just times when I'm going to be in a state of great flux and there are times when I'm just going to be sort of settling down with the last revelation. I think I'm probably in the settling stage now. I hope in the final settling stage. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what would really feel comfortable [would be if you finally get to that stage.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm feeling much more comfortable about my whole life period. Of course, I don't know if I can be honest but that's the thing that seems to bother me. And I think that there probably will be a chance at my being a little honest [directionally.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing that bothers you is "Will I be able to be honest?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think, yeah, I probably will be. And I will wind up with a life that'll be much more - a life that I can be more comfortable with looking at. I was comfortable with my former life, but I never looked at it. And I think that I could end up with a life, as I said, that is not only comfortable to me but comfortable and known - well known to me. 0:49:58.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It can bare scrutiny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it works, there's no doubt about that. That's cool too that it works. I mean, well if it does. And I think it will despite the fact that it isn't a science and you're - well it isn't a science in my stricter sense of the word - that despite that, it still will work. That has a lot to do with the person. I don't - do you really think that you can do better because  - you can - well do you think that it's as much book learning as it is just having insight into people? 0:51:05.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's a combination of a lot of things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose but still like you and this friend of mine in Chicago, Kevin, - who is the only other psychologist that I really know well - when I think of him - well he was at the school I was at and he only had four years of college education at Wyoming State Teacher's College or some (inaudible at 0:51:28.6) and so he certainly wasn't a well-educated person. He certainly wasn't a renaissance man - you know, know that much about - except what he - you know he's well-read just on his own right. But he really had tremendous insight and commanded the respect of great numbers of people. Now he's gone to Chicago and he spent four years and he'll be a doctor - he'll have his doctorate in psychology. I don't think he's - you know, he still helped me just as much - 0:52:00.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think he's improved just by getting a doctorate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nah, I don't see how he could. I think he was one of the greatest guys. He is one of the greatest guys and I - maybe he's got a better checklist (inaudible at 0:52:17.7) But -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles) Maybe he's got a better checklist than I do, did you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, better than he had before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  - than he had before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When he went in. Just because of his education. But I think that far shadowing that is the fact that here's a guy with an open heart that can listen and it was just in his nature. And that just - well I don't know. Besides that, the few things that - well when I've been there - the few things that he's wanted - that we've talked about that are academic, [really aren't things that are going to help.] (ph) I mean he's not well - he has - he's been working at hospitals with some really emotionally disturbed people. And in that case, there are a lot of times when he should know something about the medicine that's involved. The psychiatry I guess as opposed to psychology. Maybe my terms are wrong there, but I mean - you know what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know what you mean. 0:53:15.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe then, but I would say he's not going to be that type of person. He's probably going to end up in a college life similar to what you're doing I suppose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. I'm going to have to stop...it being five after.] (ph)</p>

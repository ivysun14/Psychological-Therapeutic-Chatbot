<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I had a bad day yesterday. It's shaping up to be another bad day today. So—I need to find a way out of this apartment mess. Yeah. Do these people understand that they don't want to send all of their personal information to somebody who is not legally affiliated with the apartment anyway? You know, to maybe though the landlord doesn't want to sift through 20 applications which is why I am doing the leg work and it's a lot of fucking leg work. And to think that I have to spend all day which shouldn't see that who pissed me more off by the second and—.</p>

<p>I cleaned the fridge yesterday. There was stuff in that fridge that expired in 2007. Yeah. And yet then none of them offered to clean it. Thought oh, you know, I've been living here for a year longer than Tanya. Maybe I should be the one who cleans this fucking fridge. So, I did that. [00:01:25]</p>

<p>I'm just really, really angry that there is nothing I can do about it. And the guy yesterday, he said how long are the application materials like I want to send them if I'm not going to be living there. Now e-mailed me this morning to be like I'm all set with the apartment, but thanks. Which I don't know whether that means that he's talked to the landlord so that he think he doesn't need to deal with me anymore which is false because he still owes me money. Or whether that means that he found someplace else and just dicked around with me yesterday. I don't know, but I need to, I need to figure out how much money I would lose if I get out of it. To just say, to just walk away. [00:02:25]</p>

<p>I'm so angry and I can't even cry about it because it, I just stop. It just stops and—. I don't know what to do, but it's getting to point where I would really rather jump off that third floor building than show it to another fucking person which I think means maybe I should do something else. (crying) [00:03:17]</p>

<p>I just, I don't understand how it's this bad. I feel so bad. I don't, I don't know how that's even possible. (crying) I have to just keep working and— [00:03:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I imagine some of it is to do with being beyond sick and tired of having to clean up everybody else's shit. I mean, literally, obviously the things in the refrigerator, but—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you're in this sort of cluster box situation with I guess trying to get somebody in there about which at least so far I've seen you can really do nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And—. [00:04:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm being held responsible for things over which I have no control and for which I am not receiving any benefit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. At a time when you're pretty close to the edge to begin with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes go over it. And that doesn't have any effect on anybody, I don't think as far as getting help with the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know. I told Eric (sp?) that I was having a bad day. It's not like—but actually what I told him was that I haven't tried to kill myself today and I'm counting that as win. And A. I hate doing that because I feel like it throws everybody around me in to this fear and instability because they don't know what I'm going to do and I don't think that's fair. [00:05:49]</p>

<p>But B. what Eric (sp?) did was kind of like "oh, maybe we should buy Tanya some ice cream because she cleaned out the fridge for us" and nothing after that, nothing. [00:06:30]</p>

<p>And he went to work (crying). I don't know what to do. It just doesn't stop. It keeps coming. [00:07:38]</p>

<p>(crying from [00:07:38] to [00:08:55) I don't want this. Yeah. [00:09:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree that it would be good if you could find a way out of this business with renting the apartment. It does sound like that would help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But I still have to go to work tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep, but—but the apartment stuff makes it different. You, you're right, of course you have to go to work tomorrow. [00:10:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it would be nice to be able to spend my days off actually having days off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:10:40).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like every time I try to get out there's just another closed door. So, never thinking what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it cost to make this darn thing go away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I understand that some areas are—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've already sunk two months' rent in. Basically the last month and first month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, and they're granted the month of November which I paid for because I'm not now living there. I don't know whether—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can James's parents pick up the tab on this? [00:12:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: James's parents aren't. My parents probably could, but, yeah, probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you talking (ph) about then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe that's the thing to do. I mean it's not the only thing to do. Ask Simon looking through. Okay, well, what's the thing to do after that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—it feels like even, even if I say okay, I'm just not dealing with this anymore, there would probably be ways in which I still have to deal with it. You know, just what I do. Talk to the fucking landlord. And, you know, I'm, I'm just already gotten to the point where just the rest of my day looks like I can't, looks unfavorable even though I have nothing to do and tomorrow and the day after that and I don't—I don't know how to fake it. (crying) [00:13:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—some of that seems to do with yesterday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know if yesterday hadn't happened, you'd still probably be feeling pretty shitty and getting through the week would still be kind of overwhelming, but it is worse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of what happened. [00:14:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it will likely be less worse to the extent you can get it out in a reasonable way. What's James doing today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Working. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can he take the day off and square away this apartment crap? [00:15:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. A. The landlord got pissed at us for James trying to do anything to do with the apartment because he's not the name on the lease. And the—he thinks—(crying). [00:16:44]</p>

<p>James is doing everything for me and he tried to do this too and he got, I got yelled at and he, the landlord yells at him. James said okay I need to ask you to do this thing because I can't do it and now you're saying I have to (inaudible at 00:17:01). (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tanya, I'm not yet saying you should turn it over to him. I honestly didn't know some of the history with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only did things in the first place because it's something James can't do. Or things he can't do. Or others have tried to do, but—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. You know it's more simple than I thought. [00:18:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is. It's more of an impossible problem now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even talking to you feels like it's too hard. (crying) [00:19:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I think I'm probably making this harder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I have a life sentence of expectations that sound pretty reasonable, but it's like—. Yeah. [00:20:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I thought instead of helping you with the ones that you had a kind of like another sentiment on you that you—yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it's easy to turn it over to James.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay. You didn't know. [00:21:57]</p>

<p>Well, on the plus side, you know, I can cry, so clearly anything can happen. I don't love, right (ph)? (crying) [00:22:57]</p>

<p>Well, I can't figure out how to indicate to people that I'm not able to handle this or able to do things or I'm not functioning that well in a way that they understand right up until to the point where I just can't do anything at all. [00:23:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well—I think it's probably not entirely your problem. Rather that you're somewhat helpless in light of the way people don't want to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. They really don't want to know. Yeah. I can understand that, but what will make things worse works. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, there's this thing going up where it's like I want to tell you that I'm going to kill myself. So that, you'll have to, you know, call somebody from the hospital or something so that way I won't have to deal with bullshit anymore. But, I don't want to tell you that because I fear I might actually want to kill myself, but I want to keep that option open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:26:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also because I don't, I don't like that in myself. That's making bluffs because I just don't want to do anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like it's some of each. I think. It's like partly a way of having yourself in the hospital and continuing the situation and partly you're feeling more like you would.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not like I haven't been here before, but I didn't then, so. You know, there is things I probably wouldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may have been at moments like, not been here, but I've been thinking was that in a while. [00:27:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In a while. [00:28:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like you think you might—kill yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that's not really different. Yeah. As long it happens, I draw lines in the sand like this. There's a big fuss and then I have to start over again and things are even harder, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean like you go to the hospital and you get—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Like take time off for—. I don't know. [00:29:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is part of what you're saying is that at the end of the day nothing really helps?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think part of what you're saying is at the end of the day nothing really helps with this. You might be safe a week, for a week in a hospital or, you know, relieved to just have no work structure or whatever it is for a little while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:30:30)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're right. And if I don't think anybody can really fully protect you from that—or maybe you very much. [00:31:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I still need it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean in terms of it sort of all being back on you? [00:32:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. You know, on the other side is well I have lots of beer in the fridge and ice cream and books and all of that and those things have a special purpose. Yeah. It's astonishing how well I can respect myself through all of this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've had a lot of practice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty good. It's also really defense. (crying) [00:34:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think I'm clearer from what you said. I really want to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually, it's been a couple of times. God, tell me it's for the same thing. And I'll be the first to say—I don't have anybody (ph). I can remember it. I think about it or talk to her or anything. I just—and that hurts and I feel bad. And it's Franco's birthday yesterday. You know, I don't even know who won the Presidential, the Presidential election. I don't even know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to know? [00:35:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah, who won?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obama won. Obama won.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay. Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I get your point that you're just sick of the fucking world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you hate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I hate them both. Which was partly for local reasons. Yeah, we talked about it, but great. All I remember, right? [00:36:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what? I guess now it seems a lot more like the same old hell hole.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is about what I think about the Presidential election too, but it sounds (ph) like for me. (silence from [00:36:53] to [00:39:35)</p>

<p>Maybe I think I'll never get around to that. I think I could make use of my time. (silence from [00:39:50] to [00:42:20) I told all these people that I'd get back to them today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think we made progress (ph)? [00:42:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't decide what this is going to be over to her and our conversations with various people where I tell them that I need to take down our passion is just keeping me going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a tough call. (silence from [00:43:35] to [00:45:12) I imagine you don't want to change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have no idea how you're going to manage doing either one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never really, I usually don't know how (inaudible at 00:45:38) and I always end up getting through it, so I just go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. Maybe you kind of get through it, and you probably don't. I don't mean you don't get it fixed on a lot of time because I think you do, but—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the cost is usually pretty high.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:46:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's funny. I usually get very angry at people who are trying to say, you know, there's either or. They say that there are always more options. There's always more options. And yet, I mean in my life I feel like there really aren't. I can't come up with more options. Like, none of them are good. Yeah. They're all impossibly bad. And including killing myself. Also an impossibly bad option.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Now I can see how—</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I—stick with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we might as well stop for now.</p>

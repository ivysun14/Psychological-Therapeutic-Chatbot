<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, the thing that's really on my mind right now is, uhm, my wearing this dress. I'm, uhm, I don't know, maybe this was even part of the feeling I had over the other thing I wore this week, that I had some trouble deciding whether to wear, or not. Uhm, although that was uhm, just a different kind of dress than I would usually wear here, whereas this is, you know, more in line with things I've worn before, so that I wouldn't feel uncomfortable about wearing it for that reason. But uhm, I don't know, it just (clears throat) seems, I've never worn this dress before. Uhm, and I don—, I don't know whether I'm uh, you know, I was kind of hesitant to wear it, not just because you'd see it, but partly that, and here I'd been talking about what I've been buying. And then also, MSCZ doesn't know about it. So I don't even know what his reaction's going to be, and, uhm, I won't be happy if he, if he doesn't like it, which he might very well not like it. </p>
 
And then I think, I also have this feeling that it's not that I don't like it, but I think 2 things sort of were part of my getting it. Some of the things that I got when I bought these things, I had really been happy about and had worn quite a bit. And the thing I wore the other night was something, so I didn't have the same feeling, because I'd worn it a number of different times, a, and I've liked it. </p> 
 
But I think this dress was, I'd fixed in my mind that I wanted this particular type of dress, you know, this kind of cut. And it was mainly because of what I'd seen other people wearing. And I hadn't found anything I liked before I came across this. And then this one, it turned out the saleslady made a mistake and told me it was on sale, and it wasn't. So then she had to sell it to me on sale. I didn't make a big thing about it, I was just not going to buy it. But then she said that, since she'd told me it was on sale, she'd sell it to me on sale, you know, that sort of swung me over.</p> 
 
And I do—, I don't know whether I would have bought it or not, if it hadn't been. And I think maybe part of my feeling today is, I, I don't know whether I really like it or not. And uhm, you know, because of feeling that something else was driving me when I, when I got it. And I don't know, just a feeling that I'm making some kind of a statement about myself when I wear it, and I don't know whether it's a statement I want to make (laughs). I just feel sort of self-conscious, anyway. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, what is the statement? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I don't know, (laughs) I mean, that's part of the trouble, I don't know what statement it is. Except, I bought this dress because I liked it. (Pause) I don't feel terribly strongly about it, it was just something that was on my mind, and I think particularly because you were going to see me in it. And in a way, I think I would have preferred not to have worn it, uh, here. So I don't know what I think. I would prefer to wear it in front of MSCZ, than you. And I don't know what that means. </p>
 
Uhm, but then I thought, well this is the dress that I had thought I'd wear tonight. So why shouldn't I, I mean it's ridiculous not to wear it just because I don't want you to see it. And I don't know, I guess maybe my feeling is, that unless I'm sure I like it, after all the talking I did about buying and what moods I was in when I was buying, uhm, it's that part of it that makes me feel self-conscious. You know, that this might be one of the purchases I made when I was still trying to find a penis in some way. Or uhm, (pause) so maybe my statement is, here's my penis, (laughs) and I'm not sure I want it anymore. (Clears throat) </p>
 
But I had the, you know, I didn't do anything about it — because I, a number of reasons I don't think I would have, or what — but today I went to LDG's to get some towels that were on sale. And FSOZ was with me, so — and I had done some other shopping before we got there — so I, (sigh) you know, for number of reasons I wanted just to go get the towels and then leave. But uh, and I didn't have this feeling any other place that I'd been today, and then yesterday I went to DSG's to get something, and I didn't have that feeling, either. But in LDG's there are so many people who are dressed up to the latest style, uhm, you know, there's practically no young female that you'll see there who doesn't look really good. And I always feel as if I'm in, out of the country whenever I'm in LDG's. Uhm, and today, I didn't feel that terrible, but on the other hand, you know, I didn't feel glamorous. And I was noticing around, and there were all these glamorous women. </p>
 
 Uhm, and I had a, you know, I mean, I, I started having that feeling again, well I've got to get this and I've got to get that so I can look the same way, although I know it really wouldn't be me. I don't know how much attention I have to pay to what they're doing to appear that way. But I don't think I'd want to. </p> 
 
And uhm, but you know, I still had that kind of a feeling of missing something, and you know, the kind of thing that will start me in thinking, now, what is it I need? Which uhm, (stomach rumbles) I don't know, I mean I'd wanted a dress sort of, you know, to fill the function that this dress will fill, but whether this is the dress, or not. And you know, I get that kind of a feeling when I see these women. (Pause) </p>
 
I don't know, I was also sort of wondering about something else. Uhm, because when I got home last night, MSCZ had something for me, and you know, it became clear that last night was our wedding anniversary. And I had decided that it must be Friday. And I don't know whether I wanted it t—, you know, I'd been thinking I didn't want it to be Friday, because I didn't like the time, because I guess I didn't want it to be before Friday, either. </p> 
 
Uhm, but I, I don't know, then I began to wonder, well, have I ever really mixed them up, those 2 dates, before? I think I've had to think about it before, because uhm, well I don't know exactly why. Maybe it was, MLWZ's wedding was the 9th, I'm not sure. MLWZ's wedding was right around that, you know, that date. And uh, then I was in FN HWR's wedding, which was the first wedding that, you know, I had any emotional feelings about. And hers was, I think, August 4th, so that wouldn't really enter into it. </p>
 
But uhm, (sigh) well, I was just wondering if I've ever really thought it was anything but the 7th before. And if I hadn't, then why — and also then, when I said, oh MSCZ, are you sure, because I'm not, I kept thinking it was tonight. He said, "Well, we can check." And there was something that uhm, well there were 2 places we could have checked. The album that has our wedding pictures, because I'm quite sure it has the date in there. And then, somebody had taken one of our invitations and painted on it and framed it. And it wasn't something that we'd particularly liked, but that was one of the things I'd, that had been in PTN, and it came back with all the other stuff. And it's been sort of (sigh) sitting around in the kitchen with the other wedding gifts that I hadn't found a place for. Uhm, and it never occurred to me to check there, you know, which was practically under my nose. And MSCZ just said immediately, "Well, we can check," and went to look at it. </p>
 
So it really seems as if I didn't want to know, well of course I know I didn't want to think about it, but up until yesterday I was avoiding thinking about it. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: But what was the magic, then, of wanting to think that, uhm, the day we separate would be your wedding day to MSCZ? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess it's kind of like, I mean, (sigh) on one hand I'd be free (laughs) for MSCZ, because I haven't been letting myself really feel free for him as long as I've been seeing you. And I, I, you know, have been thinking of this as it must be, you know, the emotional leave-taking of leaving home, leav—, a girl leaving her father, and uhm, I didn't ever go through that before. So it just seemed like it would be appropriate if, uhm, you know, it would be like MSCZ and I getting married. </p>
 
I don't know, i—, sort of like, I feel as if now I would be ready to get married, an, and I still don't think I like the memory of our wedding and, you know, all the feelings that I had then. Uhm, (sigh) I don't know, sometimes I've thought I almost would like to do it over again, just because it w—, be kind of a new start and erasing something that was just all wrong. (Sniff) </p>
 
And probably, too, it was just a matter of, I'm losing you, then, it was sort of an attitude of replacing you with MSCZ. Except, I don't think that was the strongest part of the feeling, because I was hesitant to even think it could be then. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Then I'd be sort of giving away the bride? </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Silence) I d—, (sigh) I was just thinking 2 things. One is that uhm, (sniff) I don't know which that, to get at first, but uhm, this morning the phone rang, and I wasn't expecting anybody to call, you know, so I couldn't think who would be calling. And what I immediately imagined was that somebody was calling to tell me something had happened to you. And, and I don't know whether what was most important in that, was then I wouldn't come today or tomorrow. Because uhm, well I don't know, I think I've lived the last day so many times, it can't be as bad as I've imagined it. But, you know, I still sort of dread it. And that would be one way to get out of it. </p>
 
<p>But I think it was also, you know, still the old fantasy of your dying. And I don't know whether it would be kind of an anger, getting rid of you, type of thing. Or maybe it was both this and uhm, but it seemed like mostly it was, then I'd be able to think, well the separation's final, there's nothing that can be done about it. Uhm, and it was sort of out of my hand, out of my control, it's not for me to agree that I'm ready, or not. Uhm, and it would be j, just easier to accept, than having to take some part in the decision, or the fact that I can separate from you.</p>
 
<p>I think, the other thing I was just thinking about, and maybe this is why I had that fantasy this morning, is last night when the BFMs left, uhm, ju—, I, I guess we were listening to a record that was on. We were sit—, w, we were just sort of sitting in the living room anyway. Because they'd left kind of early, and I thought they wouldn't, so we weren't in a hurry to rush around cleaning up. And I was talking a little bit more to him about some of the feelings I've had about finishing, which he's aware of. And he's really been very nice, you know, to me. Because I suppose he could just sort of say, "Oh, it's nothing," or, "I haven't found it this way" or that way, or something like that. </p>
 
<p>But last night, anyway, when I was, I can't remember what things I was saying now. But they've been things I've said here, recently, more or less. Uhm, and then, oh, MSCZ had said something at some point too, I guess what it was, was I asked him if he ever missed XBF, or maybe that was it. And he had, he recently has been very upset about something his father did, which is true to form to what his father has done for years. And MSCZ was saying he thinks he resolved that problem of his relationship with his father falsely, while he was still in analysis. And later he qualified that to say, probably at that time, he had to resolve it that way. But now he realizes it really wasn't uhm, a completely true way to do it. </p>
 
<p>And, you know, my first reaction was, "Oh, this is terrible. How many things have I resolved falsely here? And then, "What will I do? Although obviously he's handling it, if he realizes that it, and so forth. But, you know, it still made me feel kind of panicked. And then I think I asked him if he missed, uhm, Dr. XBF, or some such question. You know, because of my fear of missing you and being u, unable to bear it. Uhm, because MSCZ said, "Well if you really do, you can always make an appointment." Which I know is true, but —</p>
 
<p>And then he, we were just talking some more, and, and, I don't think he really has missed XBF in the sense that I was meaning. He has sometimes missed having analysis, because some things are harder than before. But uh, I don't know, just s, suddenly he said, "Oh, I'm feeling awfully sad." I mean, it was as if talking about it made him miss him in the way I was afraid of missing you. And uh, he began feeling the sadness that I'm so afraid, well, that I have been feeling in anticipation, especially of feeling it, after I've left you, or you've left me here, or whatever. </p> 
 
<p>And I think that sort of, well, it didn't really scare me, but I me—, you know, in a way I suppose I thought, well here he is clearly functioning OK. And if he's feeling that, then maybe I can feel it and still function all right. </p>
 
<p>But (pause) well, I don't know, I just think again of my grandmother and what I was saying the other day about uhm, finding, missing somebody who's died differently than, you know, finding the experience different than I had thought it would be, or should be. And, you know, in this way, never seeing you again w—, you know, would be a similar kind of missing. And uhm — (2-minute silence, sniff, silence) </p>
 
<p>Well, I was thinking about wha—, you know, further about what some, one of the things MSCZ said about his realization that he didn't resolve his feelings about his father, either as fully or truly, or something. And, you know, how he was still going to analysis. And one thing he said was something to the effect of uh, I guess I just couldn't accept then, that I will never have a father that I could like or look up to, or something like that. I don't remember his words exactly. But uhm, anyway, you know, never have something that he wanted. And I suppose I'm thinking about it now, because it just uhm, (sigh) for a while he was trying to like his father and trying to see the relationship as somehow possible, in some way to what he had wanted. </p>
 
<p>And uhm, I don't know, I'm, I must be thinking about that, because my having to accept I'll never have something I wanted when I finish here, a—, I don't know whether it's simply that I'll never have a penis, or you know, just that I wanted one because I wanted my father's approval, and I wanted a certain relationship with him. And uh, (sniff) you know, I won't have you forever, you being, taking my father's place. And so I won't have that relationship, or I won't have what I was seeking as a result of wanting that relationship. </p>
 
<p>And uh, (sniff, pause, stomach rumbles) because then when I, when I said forever, and then I think, well who ha—, ever does have forever, even if they've been lucky enough to have it from childhood on. And uhm, I think I've felt I had it while I was here, you know, some kind of relationship with you that uhm, even if I didn't get precisely what I came for, uhm, (2-minute silence, stomach rumbles) — </p>
 
<p>I don't know, I started to say, I'm just, I guess it's been because I'm just so aware of tomorrow. And uhm, one thing that I've thought, (sigh) would, well, actually I've thought it would happen all this week. Because i—, and it used to happen, it seems to me, whenever I'd be about to go on vacation, mm, it could be the last few days before we wouldn't be seeing each other for a while. And uhm, you know, just sort of, what can I say at this point, or what can I think, or something like that. Uhm, (pause) because I do—, it's a combination of what I've already talked about of, you know, feeling that I want you to say some last thing that will be with me for the rest of my life. Uhm, but also, you know, kind of feeling, well there must be some things that are really essential for me to still talk about. And I can't think of them, and when I leave here it's going to be awful, because suddenly then I'll think of them, and you know, be impossible to ever talk about them. </p>
 
<p>But then, that makes me think of something I, I must have talked about it before, uhm, but it's ano—, it's one of the fears I have, and it's something that I've talked about with MSCZ, and I've never understood quite what he is saying when he answers me. Although, he clearly doesn't find it a problem. Uhm, but I've been, I know so, I feel so often that I'm not coherent. You know, that I evade a certain aspect of my feelings or what the central problem is, or something, uhm, you know, when something comes up. </p>
 
<p>And, I don't know, I, I don't know whether it's a certain way th—, then I could think, well, I'm dependent on you and I need you, and how do I see these things if you're not there to show them to me? But uhm, well, you know, it also, I suppose, my reaction, FHYZ would say, "Well, you know the process, so you can continue it on your own," that kind of thing. You know, this feeling, well, what if I can't? </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, uh, you know, it sounds like again your concern is that since you haven't been turned into a man, maybe you won't be able to think. But you have been thinking, right and left. You've been talking with MSCZ about kinds of things that you never used to tell me you ever talked with him about. You consider things yourself, you understand things without my saying anything. So you've been doing exactly what you're afraid you can't. And all without a penis. </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Sigh, Pause) Well, then I think of something that, this was not quite the way I was meaning it when I first said it, but then I think of something else that we were talking about, last night. Uhm, and I mean, it's related, because it involves, you know, being able to analyze, uh, your own feelings, and it must have been when MSCZ was talking about realizing things about his feelings toward his father, that he just cannot avo—, you know, pretend aren't so. </p>
 
<p>And I was thinking, well there have been many times when I've said something here, and it might have been something I was thinking before, but when I said it here, I heard it differently than if I'd, you know, heard m—, i, it in my mind earlier, when I wasn't here. Uhm, and it w—, it seemed like it was part of just saying it here. And I didn't know whether, I didn't know exactly what it was. I mean, MSCZ knew what I was talking about, and agreed. </p> 
 
<p>Uhm, and I, I guess what I was wondering is, well, is it because of my special feelings about you, and your power and everything, that I would find that so, you were listening. Or is it just, you know, an aspect of analysis that, MSCZ thought that's what it was. But in any case, you know, that's part of, well I won't be, you know, if I, (sigh) I don't know, it just seemed like, well so how can that continue? </p>
 
<p>And uhm, well except, then I think of, well I don't know, as MSCZ has said, it's different. And I guess maybe I do understand a little bit about what he means. But you know, I think of some things now that were just, I don't think of specifics right this minute, except that I think of how many times I have found myself recently reacting, and maybe it's because MSCZ reacts to my reaction, or maybe it's just, you know, I can suddenly hear myself. And I think, well this is, you know, why am I being this way. And uhm — (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I guess it just gets back to (sigh) what I said yesterday, I just feel very reluctant, mm — (pause) You know, a, and I just was thinking about something else, too, that uhm, (sigh) you know, is part of my feeling ready to finish, I mean, you know, it's just one of the little things that adds up. And then I feel, right now I'm feeling reluctant even to think about it. Because it does add up in that way. </p> 
 
<p>But uhm, when FNI arrived, she had just been interviewing somebody, uh, (sigh) for living in next year, and I had known she was going to. But she was a little bit late, and she came in apologizing and explained what had happened. But she was also furious. And the reason she was mad was because the girl that's been with them this summer, who uhm, FNI had known previously, I think she'd been a student of hers once, uhm, came in while she was interviewing this person. And the job will be quite a bit different than what this girl FHIZ has been doing, so that uhm, in a way it really wasn't appropriate for FHY—, FHIZ to say anything about anyhow. And then certainly it was not appropriate at a time like that, unless FNI had asked her to, uhm, and FNI hadn't. </p> 
 
<p>And, you know, something I said, "Well, didn't you let FHIZ know you didn't want her coming in?" And FNI said, well,it just hadn't entered her mind that FHIZ would even think it was appropriate, except that then she went on to talk about how FHIZ was always, uhm, coming into situations that really was not appropriate for her to do. And I had noticed whenever we were there that FHIZ was rather intrusive. And I thought, well maybe they just want her to be, and they don't mind. But FNI suggested that they had found that a problem all summer. So then I was thinking, "Well, then she should have anticipated something and, you know, had made some provision." And part of FNI's anger was that this situation kept going on and on throughout this interview. I mean, it was almost FHIZ interviewing the girl. </p>
 
<p>And then I kept thinking, "Well, why didn't FNI do something?" Because, you know, here I've always had this image of FNI having absolute control when she wants to, and she clearly was mad partly because she didn't have control last night. Uhm, and you know, I don't know what I would have done, it was a bit awkward. Because the girl being interviewed might see FNI handle FHIZ in a certain way and then think, "Well this isn't what I want." But still, I kept thinking, "Well I would have handled it better than that." And uhm, I was sort of surprised that I would be thinking that way, since usually I think the opposite. (Sniff, 2-minute silence, Stomach rumbles) </p>
 
<p>Well, then I start thinking about uhm, "It's fine for me to think I could have done better in that situation, but will I be able to handle the person that I'm worried about being intrusive, you know, MME, next year?" And uhm, and that's a case where I think FNI would do better than I, unless I am better at it than I anticipate. (Clears throat) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up. </p>

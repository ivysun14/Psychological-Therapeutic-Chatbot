<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence) Something happened when I came in today, just in my thinking.  And, ah, I, it's probably happened lots of times before but today I was more aware of it.  And it just made it impossible to say anything at all.  Because I think I came in with certain things that I had thought I might like to talk about and they were all things that, when they had occurred to me at other times, maybe during the weekend or today, they just seemed to be very important things.  But when I got in here, they just suddenly didn't seem important at all and it was almost as if, I could just sort of feel that there was something else that was more important.  But I wasn't sure what it was.  And then these things that I have been thinking I wasn't sure what it was.  And then these things that I had been thinking of before just became things to avoid talking about whatever really was on my mind.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Kind of a neat trick.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you weren't aware of this other thing you were —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, there have been 2 things I've been thinking of but I don't know whether it's —</p>

<p>ANALYST: No I mean —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was it that you felt was interfering?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  That's what I mean.  I, there've been 2 things that occurred to me since I came in here, that haven't, that I hadn't thought I'd be talking about.  And, well, the first thing that did, which sort of made everything else pale in comparison and seem unimportant, was a reaction I had to seeing "Romeo and Juliet"  yesterday.  And when MSCZ and I were talking about the movie, uhm, at one point we were talking about the 2 that played Romeo and Juliet and how young they were.  And the thing that seemed sort of utmost importance to me in thinking about the girl who played ro—, ah, Juliet, was well, there was one scene where she was nude.  And the camera handled it so you were never sure but, well, I, I think she was.  And it just, I'd never been able to understand how anybody can do this anyway and so, considering her age, it just seemed, well, I couldn't even enter in as how an actress would feel about it and it just was very disturbing to me.  (Pause) And then it was after that thought that I sort of forced myself to think about what I had been thinking about before I came in, which were sort of chosen subjects.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you have any fantasies about Juliet?  I mean, in addition to what you mentioned?  That scene in particular?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, as far as the actress was concerned?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I mean, I don't.  Anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Or just anything?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does it bring anything else to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, the 2 things that right now are not — it doesn't bring anything except for 2 things that it brought to my mind then.  And one was, no matter what the camera showed, showed us, there were all these people who were on the scene, having to set it up and handle the cameras and so forth, who could see her nude.  And then of course I compared it to how I very often am very hesitant to be nude, even just, well, just, only when MSCZ is there.  (Pause) And I think the other thing that, there was something else too, I think I was thinking of, with the 2 of them being nude, uhm, and their having as part of that scene to be in bed together, how having, I assume, no particular feeling for each other, they could do something like that. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think somehow it was the fact that there was any physical contact that makes the whole thing worse to me.  Because I was thinking, too, at one point, when he was sort of petting her and, uhm, he had his hands on her breast at one point, too, and things like that, how she could keep an expression, I don't know, I can't remember what expression she had but it certainly was not one of horror or disl—, taste or anything.  And how she could keep such feelings from showing.  Because those would certainly be feelings I'd have if a strange man were doing that to me.  Or sometimes I suppose I have them even if MSCZ's doing it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>The other thing that keeps coming to my mind, it's just started to again, is, uhm, thinking back on a conference I had today with a mother who's extremely aggressive about her child.  And I think of all the boys in my room I like her child least or he's the only one that just rarely is likable at all to me (clears throat) so I always have sort of a guilt feeling when I see her anyway, since I just don't like her, like her or like her child.  And, ah, he also has a very aggressive way about him, he's an extremely bossy boy.  And she didn't like the report so was coming in to sort of defend her child and see what she could change.  And he had improved in lots of things and she's just so overwhelming in her aggression that I just have never really tried to fight her that much.  I try to make my point and then sort of pretend things are pretty good otherwise or somehow keep her from, from being so aggressive.  And I, I think, right now I'm feeling well, I don't know exactly what, but just that I was a traitor to myself in a way because, in trying to avoid being the object of her aggression, I might have implied (clears throat) that things were better than they were, which is being dishonest.  And then I will start telling myself, well, it really isn't worth it because she doesn't listen to you anyway and the more you tell her of things that aren't right, then the more she fights it.  And so then I'm sort of torn in this argument in myself.  (Pause) Or I'll start thinking, well, maybe if I really worked hard at it, then I could get things across that, in the end, would help her child.  And if I don't do it, I feel guilty I'm not doing what I could be doing.  But, on the other hand, it just seems whenever I've tried, that somehow it's almost made things worse because she doesn't even understand what I'm saying to her.</p>

<p>And something just came back to me too, which, when I think about it now, horrifies me, although at the time she said it, it's a typical thing for her to have said, and I didn't really react.  But at one point she talked about how she really didn't feel, since he was only, well, he's just turned 6, that at this stage she should read his whole report to him.  And now I'm feeling badly that I didn't react more strongly in getting across to her that, of course, she doesn't because there aren't for the children, they're for adults.  And this has made me feel very upset too, that I missed this opportunity. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it also, I, I don't know, it's I haven't quite figured out what the reaction is but just thinking of her treating her child that way, well, it makes me feel sort of like, he's not hers.  He has, she has no right to claim him if she's going to treat him that way.  And I'm the one who has to defend him and protect him from something like that.  Because it just seems so terrible to me right now, when I'm thinking about it, that a parent could even consider doing that and think there was any decision to be made about whether or not to read them — although I know that many parents have absolutely no judgment and do do this.  (Pause) And I think too the other thing that bothers me is I can justify what I did for good reasons but — and perhaps in the end I would have done the same thing if I'd really thought it out and been strong enough to follow what I thought was right.  But I feel as if the way I reacted in that conference was more from feeling weak than from having any theory or idea that I wanted to follow.  It's, it's sort of, that she was ready to be nasty and I couldn't stand it so I had to kind of keep everything pleasant. (Pause)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of one of the things that did occur to me this weekend, that, uhm, I read this weekend but I've read several other times recently, about children learning how to be competitive because of the type of fighting that goes on in the family.  I think there was an article a while ago in the KWS magazine on it.  And, but this weekend I began to think of the fact, when I'm feeling, or when I'm within competition, I overreact by either becoming extremely aggressive and defensive and everything or else I completely feel I have to withdraw.  And it just struck me that this is what my, sort of the role my 2 parents had, that my mother always withdrew and took it and my father always was very aggressive and very cutting and said awful things.  And I, I never saw anything in between.  I never saw anybody who fought in a fair way with consideration for the other person while they fought.  And I know, when I fight with MSCZ, less so now but s—, it's still true, my inclination is to immediately think of how I can most hurt him.  So that it's not, it gets off the point entirely right away.  Or else I'll sit there and just take it, as I did today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: How was it in your fights with FYC and FNA and your brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, with FYC, well, I sort of went through 2 stages.  When I was, it seems to me, when I was younger I used to always fight back and, and, and then finally one day I made her cry, which was a big triumph to me.  But those, and then all these types of fights were always in a very physical way.  And then after I made her cry we stopped having physical fights and then I became extremely withdrawn or I, I would be very submissive and let her take, give to me anything, say anything nasty that she wanted to say.  And I never fought back.  And if I didn't like it, I'd just withdraw completely into my own room, away from everybody.  And with FNA and MLWZ, I don't recall ever having much fighting, more with MLWZ than with FNAZ.</p>

<p>And if I did, it was always physical and I was always very aware of being afraid I'd go beyond what I should and that I'd really hurt them so I used to try to avoid that and just sort of stay unin—, uninvolved emotionally so I wouldn't fight at all with them.  Because I can j—, right now, when I think about it, I just recall times like when I, I don't know whether I was hitting my brother with a stick or what, but my feeling was right then, "I want to kill you."  And another time I hit FNA in the stomach and my mother happened to see it and was extremely upset at me because she said I could have hurt her terribly.  I didn't know what I was doing and it was just lucky FNA didn't die because of what I did, or that was her implication, even if she didn't say it.  So I just got the feeling I had this power to kill people if I weren't careful.  But I never felt that way with FYC.  It was sort of, well, she was bigger than me and older, so perhaps that's why. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I was sort of withdrawing, too, and doing the same thing when MSCZ and I were first married.  Because I had a horror of fighting and so the best solution to me, then, was to keep things so superficial you'd never hit upon anything that you might fight about.  (Silence) And I've always had — I was just thinking of the other day, he was doing something with the rug and I could have helped him.  But it meant lifting very heavy furniture and just made me think of a reaction I have about lifting things and moving things or putting together things.  Because I'm thinking, too, of we had to construct, put our bed together, which was quite difficult.  And all these things I, I, I don't know, I just have this feeling I have to push myself until I can hardly stand it anymore.  Because if I don't do what I was asked, then he'll say awful things to me.  And I know there were times when my father wanted us to help lift things.  And if we finally just couldn't hold them anymore or made a mistake and dropped it or did something wrong, he used to always start screaming at us about how stupid we were.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And yes—, on, on Saturday, I think it was, when he was doing that with the rug, at first I just, I told him that if he w—, if he planned to do anything with it, he should plan it in a way that he could do it by himself because I just felt I couldn't even stand offering some help and then being asked to do more and more and more.  Because I felt, once I got into it, I wouldn't be able to say, "No, I can't do any more than this much."  And so the best thi—, best thing was just not to get involved at all.  And then it made me feel guilty because I could have helped somewhat, although he ended up not doing what he really wanted to do.  And at one point he did have to ask my help.  And he was very nice about it and it was so easy to help then and it made me feel even more guilty.  Or he was hanging the new painting that we got and it's extremely heavy and I knew, well he has to have me help by holding it so he can see where he wants it and so forth.  And even, again, I was just trying to think was there any way he can do it without having to ask me to help because I just, I just have this reaction toward it.  But then, once it was pretty much over and it hadn't b—, nothing unpleasant had happened, then I could go around and do lots of other things that I didn't think I'd want to do, in terms of putting up other paintings in other places.  And, I don't know, sometimes I'm afraid, well, all it is is that I'm lazy and then other times it doesn't seem that way at all.  And I don't know quite why I think it's because I'm lazy except that I'm so used to hearing people tell me I'm lazy.  And it's always at times when I, inside, just feel so overwhelmed by something, or enervated, that it's as if I've already fought something so much that I don't have any strength left.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Who always said you were lazy?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  My mother did.  MSCZ does, sometimes, when I don't race around doing things with him.  But my mother always wanted us out, like on Saturdays, outdoors.  She didn't care what we were doing, I don't think, as long as we were outdoors.  Ends up, it's anything that involves being with other people.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Still outdoors?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I'm thinking, I was just thinking about how being with other people makes me feel.  Well, probably many different ways but 2 ways came to my mind.  One was, when I first thought of how I just feel enervated so much of the time when I think of ha—, having to do something that involves others, that it's because, so often I'm sort of playing a role, responding in a way I think is expected and no—, I just don't even know what would really be the way I'd respond because I'm so busy trying to fit this expectation that I think is there.  And then s—, then other occasions came to my mind where I, well, I just think of today as one and then a party we went to Friday, where I had a definite reaction but I didn't have the courage to react in that way.  Or I didn't know quite how to do it and still be polite and tactful.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

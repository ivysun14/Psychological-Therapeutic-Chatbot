<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>TH 1: Well, we got a chance to meet a little bit before we started. But I think it would be good if we started by saying our names so that we all know who we are. I'm Jim Bitter, and . . .</p>

<p>M1 1: Glenn.</p>

<p>F1 1: Carol.</p>

<p>M2 1: Michael.</p>

<p>F2 1: Lauren.</p>

<p>F3 1: Andrea.</p>

<p>TH 2: And Andrea. Okay. Good. Andrea, how did you get roped into coming?</p>

<p>F3 2: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 3: You have no idea?</p>

<p>F3 3: No.</p>

<p>TH 4: You just agreed to because your mom and dad wanted to?</p>

<p>F3 4: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 5: Well, let's start with them then. Why don't one of you use three adjectives and describe your children to me. What would be three words that would describe Michael.</p>

<p>M1 2: Persistent.</p>

<p>TH 6: Persistent, okay.</p>

<p>F1 2: Clown.</p>

<p>TH 7: A clown?</p>

<p>M1 3: Impatient.</p>

<p>TH 8: And impatient.</p>

<p>F1 3: He wants it right now.</p>

<p>TH 9: Alright.</p>

<p>F1 4: Lauren, too. She is persistent.</p>

<p>TH 10: Maybe it's a family value.</p>

<p>F1 5: I think so.</p>

<p>TH 11: Yeah. Are you guys persistent too?</p>

<p>M1 4: I would think so. I am very persistent.</p>

<p>F1 6: And inpatient.</p>

<p>TH 12: So besides persistent for Lauren, what?</p>

<p>M1 5: What is she persistent on? Well, she gets a little upset . . .</p>

<p>F1 7: If she can't find something she is looking for?</p>

<p>M1 6: Where is it? You told me it was here.</p>

<p>TH 13: So sometimes when she wants something, she wants it right now, and she wants some help with it too?</p>

<p>F1 8: Right.</p>

<p>TH 14: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>M1 7: Persistent, yes. For attention too, I think.</p>

<p>TH 15: And how about Andrea?</p>

<p>F1 9: Hyper.</p>

<p>TH 16: And when you say that give me the last time so I can get a feel for what she was doing.</p>

<p>F1 10: She is just so jumpy, and she talks a lot. She talks and talks.</p>

<p>TH 17: And like was she doing that a lot today, I mean, after school or something?</p>

<p>F1 11: Yes, she was. Non-stop.</p>

<p>TH 18: And what did you do when she did that?</p>

<p>F1 12: I told her to stop talking so much.</p>

<p>TH 19: And did she?</p>

<p>F1 13: No, she still kept on.</p>

<p>TH 20: She kept going.</p>

<p>F3 5: I usually talk to my friends a lot.</p>

<p>TH 21: Do you?</p>

<p>F3 6: Yeah. My Aunt Lucy talks a lot too.</p>

<p>TH 22: Yeah. So it's a family thing. Everybody, someone in your family talks a lot, and you are just like that person, huh? start with something important then. What does the dog do when you do all of</p>

<p>F3 7: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>TH 23: Okay. What else does she do?</p>

<p>F1 14: Um, that's basically it.</p>

<p>TH 24: Okay.</p>

<p>F1 15: She bugs the dog a lot too.</p>

<p>TH 25: The dog?</p>

<p>F1 16: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 26: What kind of dog have we got?</p>

<p>F1 17: German shepherd. She just persists . . .</p>

<p>TH 27: And it's the only german shepherd in American that can't take care of itself?</p>

<p>F3 8: It's name is Princess.</p>

<p>TH 28: Princess?</p>

<p>M1 8: That dog puts up with a lot.</p>

<p>TH 29: Wow. And how to you bug the dog?</p>

<p>F1 18: Oh you don't want to know.</p>

<p>F3 9: Well, . . .</p>

<p>F1 19: She pulls his ears . . .</p>

<p>F3 10: I pull the tail, the collar.</p>

<p>M2 2: Kisses it on the eyes.</p>

<p>TH 30: Kisses it on the nose?</p>

<p>M2 3: Mouth.</p>

<p>TH 31: That would be good news for whoever dates you later on. Okay, let's that?</p>

<p>F3 11: She probably like yelps or something. She runs away.</p>

<p>TH 32: Do you have any idea why you do that?</p>

<p>F3 12: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 33: Because you just love her a lot.</p>

<p>F3 13: Maybe because she does bad things sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 34: The dog does?..What bad things does the dog do sometimes?</p>

<p>F3 14: Um, she . . .</p>

<p>F2 2: I could name some things.</p>

<p>TH 35: Yeah?</p>

<p>F2 3: When she was a puppy she used to really run around her, and she wanted attention. She went in the bathroom and pulled the toilet paper, and she ripped it up and left it on the floor.</p>

<p>TH 36: That's a favorite thing of dogs boy when they are puppies.</p>

<p>F2 4: And she drips the water on the floor.</p>

<p>F3 15: And sometimes when she is eating she'll spit it out and leave it on the floor, and she won't eat it.</p>

<p>TH 37: Pretty good stuff. I'm more interested in the ones where you get to do some stuff to the dog and then it yelps, and your idea about that is that maybe it's because sometimes the dog does something wrong and other times it's for something else. I have another idea about why that happens. Would you like to: hear it?</p>

<p>F3 16: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 38: Could it be that you sometimes fool with the dog to see how many time you can get your mom to tell you to stop?</p>

<p>F3 17: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 39: And why would that be fun?</p>

<p>F3 18: I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 40: I have another idea. Let me try this one. Could it be that sometimes you do it to demonstrate to your mom that she can't make you stop?</p>

<p>F3 19: Yes. Sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 41: Sometimes. Okay. That's another possibility. Let me try a third one. Does the dog happen to be something that, a pet that your mother is really fond of?</p>

<p>F3 20: No. She doesn't like the dog. She never touches her. She sometimes calls her a stupid dog.</p>

<p>F1 20: Andrea.</p>

<p>TH 42: Okay. So, it doesn't have anything to do with possibly doing something so mom will, so you can get even with mom.</p>

<p>F3 21: No.</p>

<p>TH 43: Okay. That's helpful. So, if there is anything that you, the two of you would like to see going better at home what would it be?</p>

<p>F1 21: For the kids to listen more.</p>

<p>TH 44: And is that something for you with all three of them, or is it something with one or more in particular?</p>

<p>F1 22: Well, mostly Andrea and Michael.</p>

<p>TH 45: Andrea and Michael. The two older ones.</p>

<p>M1 8: Lauren seems to be a little less of a problem.</p>

<p>F1 23: She begs me to go to bed, you know, take her to bed. These two, they</p>

<p>will stay up all night if you let them, and I try to get them to bed early, and it doesn't seem to work. You know when I say they are going to go to bed at this time, it doesn't work. And then he comes into the picture and starts telling me to stop yelling at them, and that doesn't do any bit of good. When he jumps into the picture, you know, when I am trying to get them to bed.</p>

<p>TH 46: Sure. Now how do you feel when that happens?</p>

<p>F1 24: Well, I tell him to stay out.</p>

<p>TH 47: Yeah.</p>

<p>F1 25: I don't think that it's right that he gets, interferes.</p>

<p>TH 48: Right. You'd like him to just kind of let you handle it.</p>

<p>F1 26: Exactly.</p>

<p>TH 49: You're in the middle of it.</p>

<p>F1 27: Right. And then he butts in, and then he starts telling me that I'm yelling at them, and I wish that it should have been already you know implemented in their mind that when I say to go to bed, it's time, you know, or when they come home from school to wash their hands.</p>

<p>TH 50: Sure. So a lot of it is a hard time kind of getting things to take place that you know need to happen. 
   
F1 28: Today.</p>

<p>TH 51: Right. I wanted to leave early, and they were stalling.</p>

<p>F1 29: And who is the best at stalling?</p>

<p>TH 52: This one here.</p>

<p>F1 30: Michael?</p>

<p>TH 53: Yes.</p>

<p>F1 31: Okay.</p>

<p>TH 54: They are into their own little world.</p>

<p>M1 10: Okay. So is this something Michael that you know about, the ability to stall well?</p>

<p>TH 55: I like to just test my dad.</p>

<p>M2 4: You do. And what do you do to do that.</p>

<p>TH 56: I say what if I say no.</p>

<p>M2 5: And what is his answer?</p>

<p>TH 57: You do it.</p>

<p>M2 6: And do you?</p>

<p>TH 58: Right. Like getting here.</p>

<p>M2 7: Yeah, sometimes.</p>

<p>TH 59: How 'bout with mom?</p>

<p>M2 8: Well, I guess with mom you better do it or else she will give you an 
earful.</p>

<p>TH 60: And what do you do when you start to get an earful?</p>

<p>M2 9: I start to walk away.</p>

<p>TH 61: You escape.</p>

<p>M2 10: And go do it.</p>

<p>TH 62: Yeah. Okay. Now I know that in talking earlier that you have, whose</p>

<p>mother is it that's close to you?</p>

<p>F1 32: Mine.</p>

<p>TH 63: It's Michael and Andrea and Lauren's grandmother, and it's your mother.</p>

<p>F1 33: Right.</p>

<p>TH 64: Okay. And how is that relationship go with grandma and with you as a family.</p>

<p>F1 34: Well, okay, except she wants to you know act like she is the mother. Like she just tries to do like that.</p>

<p>TH 65: So you actually, if I'm hearing correctly, you actually have two people who try to take over for you.</p>

<p>F1 35: No, actually three.</p>

<p>TH 66: Three? Grandma and dad are two.</p>

<p>F1 36: No, well actually my sister too gets involved.</p>

<p>TH 67: Your sister too?</p>

<p>F1 37: Yes.</p>

<p>TH 68: Wow.</p>

<p>F1 38: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 69: Do you ever feel like Custer with all of the . . .</p>

<p>F1 39: Well, we are not on speaking terms right now.</p>

<p>TH 70: You and your sister?</p>

<p>F1 40: Exactly.</p>

<p>TH 71: Because of what?</p>

<p>F1 41: Well, she likes to but in too much like she's the mother.</p>

<p>TH 72: Right.</p>

<p>F1 42: And for that reason we got into it big time one day, and since then we</p>

<p>haven't spoken it.</p>

<p>TH 73: That's been it.</p>

<p>F1 43: Yes.</p>

<p>TH 74: Okay. What do you think about all of that?</p>

<p>M1 11: Well, not too good. I don't agree that the in-laws should get involved to a point. I mean grandmother should be grandmother when it's grandmother's turn. Aunt should be involved like if they are at her house, and that's when she can lay her laws down, but when she comes into our home or domain and starts well this and that and this and that, well you know, I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that at all. I think that's, they don't know who to listen to.</p>

<p>F1 44: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>M1 12: They are confused, and then they are going to start bouncing off the walls.</p>

<p>F1 45: So they don't listen to us at all.</p>

<p>TH 75: Yeah. And have the two of you talked with her about it? I'm certain you've tried to talk with your sister. They didn't go very well apparently.</p>

<p>F1 46: Right. You can't tell her nothing actually because she is just going to do what she wants.</p>

<p>TH 76: So, how 'bout grandma?</p>

<p>F1 47: She does what she wants when they are at her house.</p>

<p>TH 77: Okay. But have you talked to her about when she comes to your house?</p>

<p>F1 48: Yes.</p>

<p>TH 78: How did that go?</p>

<p>F1 49: It doesn't do no bit of good.</p>

<p>TH 79: It doesn't.</p>

<p>F1 50: Nope.</p>

<p>TH 80: Okay. So that could be very difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>F1 51: Right.</p>

<p>M1 13: And it's caused a lot of havoc. And we have sort of come to a point where we have just about gave up.</p>

<p>F1 52: Right.</p>

<p>M1 14: It's like there is no sense to this anymore.</p>

<p>F1 53: The thing was that he was working and I was working downtown and</p>

<p>like you know when I had Michael she had him all the time. Like every day. And that's why.</p>

<p>TH 81: It's the devil's trade-off.</p>

<p>F1 54: Right.</p>

<p>TH 82: So she has a certain sense that Michael is almost hers.</p>

<p>F1 55: Exactly.</p>

<p>TH 83: And it's not, it hasn't been lost on Michael. Michael knows that he can use that.</p>

<p>F1 56: Right.</p>

<p>M1 15: It's been told to him verbally that their home is his home.</p>

<p>F1 57: Right.</p>

<p>TH 84: Anytime.</p>

<p>M1 16: Anytime we want to sign the papers over go right ahead.</p>

<p>TH 85: Okay. Well, I get the sense that this is true but we might as well say it out loud. The two of you actually like your children.</p>

<p>M1 17: Yes.</p>

<p>F1 58: We do, but not the way they act. I wish it was . . .</p>

<p>TH 86: So if we could help the behavior improve somewhat, that would be a good thing.</p>

<p>F1 59: Right.</p>

<p>TH 87: And secondly, do they know that you really like them?</p>

<p>M1 18: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>TH 88: Like does Michael know that you actually would prefer to have him?</p>

<p>F1 60: Yes. When he calls home from grandma's, he calls us from his grandma's, and lets us know where he is at, and he is home, and then we always tell him to come home or when are you coming home. So, he knows.</p>

<p>TH 89: And he does some pretty good stuff around that. He keeps you informed.</p>

<p>F1 61: Right.</p>

<p>TH 90: But when he wants to go, he goes.</p>

<p>M1 19: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>TH 91: Alright. Now, how do each of the kids do in school?</p>

<p>F1 62: Well,</p>

<p>M1 20: Fairly well.</p>

<p>F1 63: Good. He made the honor roll.</p>

<p>TH 92: Congratulations.</p>

<p>M2 11: Thank you.</p>

<p>TH 93: Do you like to do school?</p>

<p>M2 12: The only thing I don't like about it is getting up in the morning. I hate that because you know you feel . . .</p>

<p>F1 64: He's tired.</p>

<p>M2 13: You feel so tired, and you just feel so cozy in the bed, and you just don't want to get up.</p>

<p>TH 94: Yep. I know.</p>

<p>F1 65:</p>

<p>Well you see they start at 7:20.</p>

<p>M2 14: It's funny because on the weekends I get up . . .</p>

<p>TH 95: Like that, huh?</p>

<p>M2 15: But then when school comes, I don't get up.</p>

<p>TH 96: Yeah.</p>

<p>M2 16: On time.</p>

<p>TH 97: Yeah. You know that only means one thing.</p>

<p>M2 17: Go to bed early.</p>

<p>TH 98: Nope.</p>

<p>M1 21: Interest.</p>

<p>M2 18: Oh, if you really wanted to go to school bad enough you would do that?</p>

<p>TH 99: Nope.</p>

<p>M2 19: I give up.</p>

<p>TH 100: You do? I was worried that you weren't going to give up. Well, here's what I think it means. I think it means that you have somebody calling you in the morning to get up.</p>

<p>M2 20: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 101: And who is that person?</p>

<p>M2 21: Well if I sleep at their house, him. And my grandma at her house.</p>

<p>TH 102: Well, let's talk about each place separately. How many time do you get dad to call you in the morning? How many is he good for?</p>

<p>M2 22: Ten.</p>

<p>TH 103: Ten times. Yeah. That means on the eleventh he explodes, huh?</p>

<p>M2 23: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 104: Now some days does he explode earlier like maybe on the fifth or sixth time?</p>

<p>M2 24: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 105: And you have to be careful of that stuff. Now let's see, if you are doing this with real art, and I think you are an artful person, I mean, I think you really have it in you, when you get up the next thing you should do is drag your feet. You know, be slow to get dressed and not eat your breakfast and can't find your homework. Any of that stuff work for you?</p>

<p>M2 25: No, I always have my stuff ready.</p>

<p>TH 106: Oh you do? So once you get up, you kind of get going.</p>

<p>M2 26: Right.</p>

<p>TH 107: So it must be Andrea that's good at not finding stuff.</p>

<p>M2 27: Yup.</p>

<p>TH 108: No?</p>

<p>M1 22: She'll be in bed with her clothes on.</p>

<p>TH 109: She'll go to bed with her clothes on? She's ready for the next day.</p>

<p>M1 23: I'm ready.</p>

<p>F1 66: It's just so she won't have to get up so early.</p>

<p>TH 110: Now does anybody else have mom or dad calling them in the morning?</p>

<p>F2 5: Me.</p>

<p>TH 111: You do. Yeah, and how many times can you get mom to do it?</p>

<p>F2 6: Fifteen.</p>

<p>TH 112: A lot, yeah. Okay. Let's try grandma, because I think grandma must be a little bit different. How does the morning go with her?</p>

<p>M2 28: Well, there are many different ways. Well, she says if you don't get up, when she gives up, she says if you don't get up I'm going to call your father to come and pick you up.</p>

<p>TH 113: Oh, now there's a threat, huh? So, do you get up then?</p>

<p>M2 29: Yeah, I get up then.</p>

<p>TH 114: Okay. Now, okay. As far as I can tell as a couple, the two of you only made one mistake.</p>

<p>F1 67: What's that?</p>

<p>TH 115: You had more children than you, and therefore, you have let them outnumber you.</p>

<p>M1 24: Yep.</p>

<p>TH 116: But there is nothing we can do about it. You've got them. So we are going to have to figure out some ways to handle the whole crew all at once. Tell me how a typical day goes at your house. Just start at the very beginning and work all the way through to the end for me.</p>

<p>F1 68: Oh, god.</p>

<p>TH 117: Who gets up first?</p>

<p>F1 69: Usually, well,</p>

<p>F3 22: I do.</p>

<p>F1 70: Well, when the alarm comes on, I'll get up. No, he'll get up first and then I'll get up, and then we will go get the girls up, and then they give us a hard time getting up, and then they will finally get up at the last minute. She'll get out of bed first.</p>

<p>F2 7: When you call me . . .</p>

<p>TH 118: Now is dad still in bed at this point?</p>

<p>F1 71: No, he'll be up.</p>

<p>M1 25: When the clock goes off, I'm up. I'm the one who sets the clock.</p>

<p>TH 119: Like that.</p>

<p>F1 72: Then I'll go get then ready.</p>

<p>TH 120: Then you get them ready. Now what do you have to do to get them ready?</p>

<p>F1 73: Well, I have to just keep calling them and calling them and then Andrea won't get up.</p>

<p>F3 23: Because I'm really tired. . .</p>

<p>F1 74: Because she goes to bed late.</p>

<p>TH 121: Yeah, it's interesting isn't it. You can't get them to bed at night, and they are in a coma in the morning.</p>

<p>F1 75: Right.</p>

<p>F3 24: And I usually tell my mom, stop yelling, stop saying that, and she was like well you gotta get up, and we went to school today at 8:00.</p>

<p>TH 122: What time does school start?</p>

<p>M2 30: 7:20.</p>

<p>M1 26: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 123: Some time in the morning.</p>

<p>F3 25: And our school is St. Agnes.</p>

<p>TH 124: Okay. So once you get them up, do they eat breakfast.</p>

<p>M1 27: Go downstairs, make breakfast, make lunches for them.</p>

<p>M2 31: Sometimes I don't really eat.</p>

<p>M1 28: And start getting ready.</p>

<p>TH 125: Now, just out of curiosity, how do you get out of the dirty work?</p>

<p>M1 29: It's not easy.</p>

<p>TH 126: It's not?</p>

<p>M1 30: I'm always in the dirty work.</p>

<p>TH 127: Really? Because it seems to me like between making lunches and getting these three up dressed and going, you've got the easier job.</p>

<p>M1 31: Well, I take the kitchen over. I run the kitchen and sometimes run them off to school.</p>

<p>TH 128: How do they get to school by the way?</p>

<p>M1 32: We drive them. School isn't far.</p>

<p>TH 129: And they all go to the same place?</p>

<p>F1 76: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 130: St. Agnes, okay. Now, what happens after that? Do the two of you go off to do other things during the day, or what happens?</p>

<p>M1 33: Yeah, usually. Go back home and wait until everything opens up so you can go out and run your errands and shop and do everything that needs to be done. Clean house, whatever.</p>

<p>TH 131: Alright. So things, that's what we call peace and quiet?</p>

<p>M1 34: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 132: And then what happens after school?</p>

<p>F1 77: It's loud. They go run for the TV.</p>

<p>M2 32: I do my homework first.</p>

<p>F2 8: I do my homework too.</p>

<p>TH 133: Sometimes.</p>

<p>F1 78: Sometimes.</p>

<p>M2 33: But I do get to it.</p>

<p>F1 79: But then like when, well I just recently lost my job, but when I was working, I told him because she didn't bring her homework home I would tell him not to put the TV on because she didn't do her homework from the day before.</p>

<p>TH 134: And how did that go?</p>

<p>F1 80: It didn't do so good. He went ahead and let her watch TV.</p>

<p>TH 135: Has he always been a pansy?</p>

<p>M1 35: I tried to work this two ways. Okay I understand watching TV is bad. But how about if you do your homework and watch TV. We will try and do that. Maybe that will be an incentive.</p>

<p>TH 136: How did that go?</p>

<p>M1 36: It kind of went alright because they would do their homework and watch TV both.</p>

<p>F1 81: But it took them how long too? Because they were paying more attention to the TV.</p>

<p>F2 9: But what about first doing your homework and then eating and then doing TV.</p>

<p>TH 137: You have a plan for it, huh?</p>

<p>F3 26: Well, usually I try to plan something in the morning, but it doesn't work. Like on the first day when we went to this other school we got up first thing really, really early in the morning, and my mom and dad were still sleeping, and we ate breakfast by ourselves and stuff, and my mom was surprised.</p>

<p>F1 82: That was the first day of school.</p>

<p>M1 37: 6:00 in the morning.</p>

<p>TH 138: So you got up, you got ready.</p>

<p>F3 27: Yeah, me and my sister. My brother was still sleeping.</p>

<p>F1 83: But then the next day it didn't happen. Like today. . .</p>

<p>F2 10: . . . day of school and we were excited.</p>

<p>TH 139: And then the next day your mom made a mistake. She got up.</p>

<p>M2 34: Today I did the same thing you're talking about, you know, watched TV while I was doing my homework.</p>

<p>TH 140: Yeah, and you really could concentrate and everything?</p>

<p>M2 35: I had to lower the TV and I can do it.</p>

<p>TH 141: Okay. How does dinner time go?</p>

<p>M1 38: As far as getting together.</p>

<p>TH 142: Is that what you do?</p>

<p>M1 39: Yeah, we all eat together.</p>

<p>M1 40: Usually we try to eat together, I mean. . .</p>

<p>TH 143: It doesn't always happen.</p>

<p>M1 41: But we try to get everybody in and eat at the same time.</p>

<p>TH 144: Who fixes dinner?</p>

<p>M1 42: I do.</p>

<p>F1 84: He does. He's the cook.</p>

<p>TH 145: The kitchen is your place.</p>

<p>M1 43: KP.</p>

<p>TH 146: Get there, stay there, don't get out. That's good.</p>

<p>M1 44: That's the room of the house that I'm in all the time.</p>

<p>TH 147: Okay.</p>

<p>F1 85: He cooks more.</p>

<p>TH 148: Does he do the dishes too?</p>

<p>M1 45: Occasionally.</p>

<p>F1 86: Well, take turns.</p>

<p>TH 149: That's what my wife and I do too. That was our only major marriage contract. I now think fifteen years later we should have had a few others. But the major one was whoever did the cooking, the other person did the dishes, and it's worked out fine.</p>

<p>F1 87: Right.</p>

<p>TH 150: Okay. And then, we've only heard a hint of it, but bedtime is a struggle?</p>

<p>F1 88: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 151: And you get started trying to get them there about what time?</p>

<p>F1 89: Eight.</p>

<p>TH 152: Eight. And they actually make it?</p>

<p>F1 90: Nope. It takes two hours . . .</p>

<p>TH 153: To get the stories, tuck me in, I gotta do this, I gotta do that.</p>

<p>M2 36: I don't stall.</p>

<p>TH 154: What do you do?</p>

<p>M2 37: They tell me to go to bed. Sometimes I do it, and there is none of this tuck me in, tuck me in, because if I'm tired I will eventually go to bed.</p>

<p>TH 155: Sure.</p>

<p>M2 38: But it's none of that tuck me in, do this, because that's just a waste of time.</p>

<p>TH 156: It's a waste of time, and you like to be efficient?</p>

<p>M2 39: Yeah.</p>

<p>F2 11: Because he's older.</p>

<p>TH 157: Yeah, he is older.</p>

<p>M2 40: I don't see any . . .</p>

<p>TH 158: How often do you and your dad just get to do something on your own?</p>

<p>M2 41: Very . . .</p>

<p>F1 91: They've been doing stuff . . .</p>

<p>M2 42: On the weekends sometimes. Rarely. Because they have to go with us most of the time.</p>

<p>TH 159: Yeah.</p>

<p>M2 43: And that's a major drag.</p>

<p>TH 160: Yeah. You won't believe this, but I'm actually starting to feel sorry for your.</p>

<p>M2 44: Thank you.</p>

<p>TH 161: You're welcome. I'm probably the only one here who does, but nonetheless, I actually do. You've somehow managed to get yourself surrounded by all these women, and you have no idea what to do with them.</p>

<p>M2 45: Nope.</p>

<p>TH 162: Yeah. Well, that's okay. You might try your dad's method which is go to the kitchen and stay there, but I don't know. Can I ask you something about your mom?</p>

<p>F1 92: Okay, sure.</p>

<p>TH 163: How hard is it to say no to her?</p>

<p>F1 93: Well, it's pretty hard.</p>

<p>TH 164: Pretty hard. (Pause) Yeah. And it almost brings some tears to your eyes just thinking about it.</p>

<p>F1 94: Not really.</p>

<p>TH 165: Not really. I'm mistaken then. Okay, so part of this stuff is as I'm hearing it is that you have a tremendous amount of responsibility in all of this, and if it goes right, it seems to you that you think it's a miracle, and if it doesn't go right you expect that that's the way it was going to be and you feel defeated. Am I getting that correct?</p>

<p>F1 95: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 166: Yeah. And okay. Let's see if we can think through this, okay? What purpose do you think your kids have for not listening to you?</p>

<p>F1 96: Well, I've been trying to figure that out. I really don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>TH 167: You have no idea.</p>

<p>F1 97: No idea.</p>

<p>TH 168: Okay. Well, I have an idea. Would you like to hear it?</p>

<p>F1 98: Sure.</p>

<p>TH 169: I think that they have figured something out. They have figured out that it's very important to you to have everything done exactly right.</p>

<p>F1 99: Okay.</p>

<p>TH 170: And Michael, for one, when he is listening to you, makes one quick determination. Can he do it exactly right and earn your pleasure, or should he get out of the way? And those are the only two decisions he makes. Stay or run.</p>

<p>F1 100: Right.</p>

<p>TH 171: Andrea listens to you because you are actually the single biggest help she has. She wouldn't know what to oppose if you didn't say exactly what the right things was, and then she does exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>F1 101: Right.</p>

<p>M2 46: That's right. That's what I keep telling my grandpa. And Lauren. Lauren has this urge to be your baby the rest of her natural life, and she would do anything to keep you happy with her.</p>

<p>M2 47: Yep.</p>

<p>TH 172: My guess is that out of that she gets a tremendous amount of service, perhaps, do you still bathe her by any chance?</p>

<p>F1 102: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>TH 173: Yeah. Just a guess.</p>

<p>F1 103: I mean Andrea by now, at her age, she would have already done it.</p>

<p>TH 174: Sure. But you see Lauren can do it too, it's just that Lauren has decided why should I?</p>

<p>M1 46: She won't go upstairs by herself.</p>

<p>TH 175: I have my mom.</p>

<p>M2 48: Yeah she never . . .</p>

<p>M1 47: That scenario she won't go upstairs by herself.</p>

<p>TH 176: She won't.</p>

<p>M1 48: She always wants one of us to take her.</p>

<p>TH 177: Yeah.</p>

<p>M1 49: Because it's so scary up there.</p>

<p>TH 178: Now which of the kids is good at getting up in the middle of the night?</p>

<p>M1 50: In the middle of the night? Lauren.</p>

<p>F1 104: Lauren.</p>

<p>TH 179: And she'll come in?</p>

<p>M1 51: And stare at me and shock me.</p>

<p>TH 180: Does she come to your side of the bed?</p>

<p>M1 52: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 181: And she stares at you?</p>

<p>M1 53: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 182: So she is kind of polite about it.</p>

<p>M1 54: Yeah, until for some reason I wake up and I'm like AH!</p>

<p>TH 183: And what do you say to her?</p>

<p>M1 55: I'll tell her go get your pillow and blanket and just park it right here.</p>

<p>TH 184: Oh my goodness gracious. And how long does it take her to get from the park it here to the place where I know she ends up which is in the bed between the two of you.</p>

<p>M1 56: Actually in the morning she will jump in with us, but as long as she is next to us, she seems to feel secure.</p>

<p>TH 185: And how many nightmares per week does she have?</p>

<p>M1 57: None, unless she sees a bad movie or . . .</p>

<p>F1 105: Or hears a story.</p>

<p>TH 186: It's not a lot.</p>

<p>M1 58: Well sister, they share the same bedroom.</p>

<p>TH 187: You do huh?</p>

<p>M2 49: It was a bad dream.</p>

<p>F3 28: One day my friend, Kara, she was telling my sister some ghost stories about her house, and that night she got really scared, and she started to go by my mom and my dad was downstairs with my brother watching TV at night, and she was really scared, and she kept telling my parents, and my parents kept telling her go to bed. There is nothing to be afraid of because she is faking it, and I kind of believed her when I was there. We were kind of getting scared and stuff, but I didn't even believe it when I came home.</p>

<p>F2 12: But one night I grabbed all my stuff and when my father woke up he said, he thought I was a ghost.</p>

<p>TH 188: A ghost?</p>

<p>F2 13: Yeah because I had blankets on top of my head.</p>

<p>F3 29: Well, parents aren't supposed to be afraid of ghosts.</p>

<p>TH 189: They are not?</p>

<p>M1 59: Sure. If I see one I'll tell ya. You'll probably catch me running.</p>

<p>TH 190: Let's see if we can make a difference with the few minutes that we have left.</p>

<p>F1 106: Okay.</p>

<p>TH 191: Now, I want you to first of all know something that you may not know. I am just going to tell you this from twenty years of experience with families. You have a perfectly normal family.</p>

<p>F1 107: Oh my god.</p>

<p>TH 192: It may feel to you at times like all of this is getting out of hand, but any family with three kids who have started with the same value system that your family has are going to have pretty much the same difficulties because children learn to read parents, and then they figure out what to do. Okay? So the only thing left is to figure out how to correct what we are doing so that it goes a little more smoothly. Now, I have a couple of recommendations for dad. And actually they will be the two hardest recommendations that I give. Okay? The first is no matter what your wife is doing at any moment in time, once she's started, I want you to stay out of it.</p>

<p>M1 60: Butt out. Yeah, I agree.</p>

<p>TH 193: The reason for that is that sometimes children actually mistakenly get their parents into fights.</p>

<p>F1 108: Yep, and we do.</p>

<p>TH 194: It has nothing to do with what they want or what you want. It's just that, and it probably comes because you are listening, and you are sitting there and you have some noise threshold that you just can't stand, and at that point you want to do something. The thing to do is when you start to get that urge to do something, go even farther away, not closer.</p>

<p>M1 61: I'll go in the garage.</p>

<p>TH 195: Okay. Now here's the second piece. The second piece is that I would like you to work out something with your wife where you have about the same arrangement as the dinner time. That is, if one of you is taking care of the morning and getting them going, somebody else, the other person takes care of the night and getting them down and vice versa. You can talk that over and kind of work that out. Because I think that there is a part of you that really does have a slightly different way of parenting, and both of them are different, but they are both valid. So you just want to have some time to do it. And that would give you some free time. You could just go do something else at that point in time. Okay. Now, I am going back to my days when I used to walk around the southern hills of Idaho, and out there, there is a danger every now and then or running into rattlesnakes. Now when you do, one of the best things that you can do is kind of freeze and see if there is a way to get out of the way, and if not, don't disturb it too much. The first time I went out and somebody told me about this warning I said well, yeah, but what would be happening. And they said, the man looked at me and said, "As long as it's rattling you don't have to worry about it. It's when it stops rattling that you have to get concerned." And what the problem is here in this particular situation with you and your children is that you have become their rattlesnake. As long as you are talking and rattling, they figure no problem. It's when you actually stop and take some action that they pay attention to you. They've become parent-deaf.</p>

<p>They just kind of let it go in one ear and out the other. As long as you are talking, so we are going to think of some ways, you and I, that you can accomplish the same stuff by acting without talking. That doesn't mean I want you to become mute forever. I just want you to talk when you are feeling good, when you are feeling happy, like you know, I might ask Lauren some day when she gets home from school, "How did school go?" And if she is willing to talk to me about it, great. But that's a different thing than talking to her when things aren't going well. So let's start in the early morning. How does dad get up?</p>

<p>F1 109: With the alarm.</p>

<p>TH 196: Now, does Michael have an alarm?</p>

<p>M1 62: They all have clocks. They just sit there. TH 197: Are they brain damaged, or do they actually know how to set them?</p>

<p>M1 63: They refuse to set them.</p>

<p>TH 198: Okay. So what I want you do to is to just tell the kids that you are going to stop calling them in the morning and so is dad. From now on if they get it it's their business, and if they don't get up it's their business, but it's up to them. You are not going to call them anymore, okay? And if one of you is down doing the breakfast, I want you to tell them, you can decide what it is going to be. You can decide this like a year at a time. What time will breakfast be served? And then if they are there for breakfast, they eat. If they are not there for breakfast, it gets put away and it's done.</p>

<p>F1 110: Right, and that's what I've told him.</p>

<p>TH 199: You see, the problem is that you and I are the only ones here that really know the right way to do things.</p>

<p>F1 111: Cause I told him if they eat, they eat.</p>

<p>TH 200: Otherwise he is in danger of becoming a short order cook.</p>

<p>M1 64: The restaurant's gotta close sometime. My mother's words exactly. The restaurant's closed.</p>

<p>TH 201: Set a time and do it. Now, let's say the worst happens, and one or more of them is in bed five minutes before it is time to go to school. What could you do about that?</p>

<p>M1 65: Warning. Get up.</p>

<p>TH 202: See warnings are rattling.</p>

<p>F1 112: Get them out of bed?</p>

<p>TH 203: Did you see your son earlier? He absolutely delights in the possibility of getting you to call him . . .</p>

<p>M1 66: The tension span.</p>

<p>TH 204: So, what else could we do? Warnings aren't going to do it. These kids don't listen to warnings anymore than . . . It's gone.</p>

<p>M1 67: Let them sleep.</p>

<p>TH 205: You could decide to do that. What would happen then?</p>

<p>M1 68: They would never get up.</p>

<p>TH 206: Then what would happen?</p>

<p>F1 113: They wouldn't go to school.</p>

<p>Th 207 Now is it your experience that your kids just absolutely hate school. They don't have any friends, nobody they want to see, nothing?</p>

<p>M2 50: I have friends.</p>

<p>F1 114: No not really. Just a couple.</p>

<p>TH 208: So you actually think that if you decided to stay out of that they would just be pleased as punch to stay home the rest of their natural life.</p>

<p>F1 115: That's right.</p>

<p>TH 209: So, that's out. It was a good idea, but not going to work in this family. So, what else?</p>

<p>F3 30: I know.</p>

<p>TH 210: What do you think?</p>

<p>F3 31: I think if they are like sleeping and stuff, you should like carry them out of bed and say wake up. Like one day when I was sleeping, my dad, he picked me up and he said, "Wake up. It's time to go to school." And then I got all ready and when I went to school I felt really miserable because I had to get up really early.</p>

<p>TH 211: You know something. I think she's got a good idea.</p>

<p>F1 116: Physically pick her up and put her on her feet?</p>

<p>TH 212: Oh, no. Much better than that. I think carrying her to her feet is just such a low level service. I think what we ought to do is maybe put, maybe one of you could put whatever clothes they are going to need in a bag and throw it in the back seat, and the other of you could just pick them up sleeping and throw them in to the back seat too and then just take them to school. They could either be dressed or undressed when you deposited them, but they would figure it out I guess. What do you think about Andrea's idea?</p>

<p>F3 32: Well, . . .</p>

<p>M2 51: I have one.</p>

<p>TH 213: I tell you if you decided to do that, it would only work if you decided not to talk.</p>

<p>M1 69: Just do it.</p>

<p>TH 214: Just do it.</p>

<p>F1 117: Right. I thought about that too.</p>

<p>TH 215: Now, here's what's going to be hard for you. You are not sure you, I mean you have the same thing that Andrea has. You like to talk. It's true, isn't it? Tell the truth.</p>

<p>F1 118: Sort of.</p>

<p>TH 216: Yeah. And so sometimes you might find that you don't know what to do if you are not really . . .</p>

<p>F1 119: Talking to somebody.</p>

<p>TH 217: Yeah. So what could you and Glenn be doing early in the morning just to leave them to get ready to go.</p>

<p>M1 70: Don't say a word.</p>

<p>TH 218: What else could you do? Do you guys read papers?</p>

<p>M1 71: Leave the house.</p>

<p>TH 219: You could leave the house. You could go for a walk. You could do anything else that you wanted. Let's talk about bed time. What could you do there? Again, talking . . .</p>

<p>F1 120: Well, what I usually do is I go upstairs. I'll go upstairs and eventually she'll come up, because this one here will tell me to put her to bed, to take her up.</p>

<p>TH 220: And where would she be if you don't do that?</p>

<p>F1 121: Watching TV.</p>

<p>TH 221: Okay, so part of the problem is TV.</p>

<p>F1 122: Right.</p>

<p>TH 222: Okay. What time do you want the TV to go off and stay off.</p>

<p>F1 123: Eight.</p>

<p>TH 223: Eight, okay so if you turn if off, what will happen?</p>

<p>F1 124: They will just turn it back on and then give me a hard time.</p>

<p>TH 224: Well, what could you do next?</p>

<p>M1 72: Unplug it.</p>

<p>F1 125: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 225: What do you think of that idea?</p>

<p>F1 126: We've thought about doing that.</p>

<p>TH 226: And what would the do then?</p>

<p>F1 127: I could turn off all the lights too.</p>

<p>TH 227: You could do that, but we are just going to work on the TV for a moment. You see that's one of the problems with parenting is that we try to do too much at a given time. So let's just see what would happen if we talked about it from the point of view of the TV. If you turn the TV off the first time, they turn it back on, next time you pull the plug, and you haven't talked yet, have you?</p>

<p>F1 128: Right.</p>

<p>TH 228: So what's the next thing?</p>

<p>F1 129: Turn the lights off.</p>

<p>TH 229: Won't work.</p>

<p>M2 52: Put the plug back in.</p>

<p>TH 230: Can you afford $1.98?</p>

<p>M1 73: Sure.</p>

<p>F1 130: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 231: Will you take a recommendation from me?</p>

<p>M1 74: Sure.</p>

<p>TH 232: The third time pull the plug, take a pair of scissors and right down next to the socket, cut the cord. It will cost you $1.98 at K Mart to buy a new plug to put it on when they've decided that they can handle this thing, and this way you will be acting without talking. You will just say to the kids, look, at 8:00 it's going off. If we are going to fight about it it's not going to be me that does the fighting. I'm going to just act, and it's going to be done.</p>

<p>F1 131: Right.</p>

<p>TH 233: Now is it okay with you if she cries?</p>

<p>F1 132: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 234: How about Lauren, God's gift to motherhood? Can you stand it if she cries?</p>

<p>F1 133: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 235: Okay, and Michael?</p>

<p>M2 53: I don't cry.</p>

<p>F1 134: He doesn't cry.</p>

<p>TH 236: Are you kidding? What are you talking about here? Arnold Schwartzenegger here.</p>

<p>F1 135: Right, exactly.</p>

<p>TH 237: So, if you can stand that they would feel upset, then you will get the point across won't you?</p>

<p>F1 136: Right.</p>

<p>TH 238: Okay, now. Here's the next one, because I know Lauren's good at this. I can't make it up the stairs. I'm just not going to be able to do it.</p>

<p>F1 137: Pick me up.</p>

<p>M1 75: I've heard that many times.</p>

<p>TH 239: What could you do?</p>

<p>M1 76: Too bad. Go.</p>

<p>F1 138: Usually I just put her around my arms.</p>

<p>TH 240: Of course and help her up. The poor helpless child she is. How about just letting her sleep on the floor downstairs if she doesn't come up?</p>

<p>M2 54: That would be cool.</p>

<p>F1 139: We've done that too. We've left them.</p>

<p>TH 241: Why not? You've got a nice house. These are the ways that we can think through it. It has nothing to do with what you say because saying doesn't work anymore. Any more than when grandma comes over telling her to stop works. So, in fact, when grandma comes over and is handling something with the kids, even if it is different than you would do it, let her handle it and stay out of it, and when you are doing it, if she tries to step in, I want to show you my favorite hand movement. Are you ready? I got this from the Supremes. It goes like this.</p>

<p>F1 140: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>TH 242: Just put your hand up and say, Mom, I got it. Thanks. You can be calm. Just, Mom I got it. And you handle it. Can you do that?</p>

<p>F1 141: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 243: Even with your mom?</p>

<p>F1 142: Yeah, I could.</p>

<p>TH 244: Good for you. I think there is a lot of strength in you, and I think you can do this. Now, I'll tell you something. Not all of the stuff we talked about is easy to implement all at once. Is there anything that we've talked about that you think you could try one thing to implement?</p>

<p>M1 77: Yeah, the switched off like you said.</p>

<p>TH 245: Okay.</p>

<p>M1 78: Switching off, one puts them to bed, one gets them up.</p>

<p>TH 246: Okay. Any one thing you would like to work on?</p>

<p>F1 143: No, just what he said.</p>

<p>TH 247: What he said.</p>

<p>F1 144: Basically yeah. Same thing.</p>

<p>TH 248: Okay. That and one other thing I am going to ask you to try. One week only. Say goodnight at 8:00 and don't say another word to any of the kids no matter what they do. Could you do that for a week?</p>

<p>F1 145: I could try.</p>

<p>TH 249: No don't try. If you try it, it means you don't think you could do it, and so you shouldn't try that one. See if maybe you could think about one of the things in addition to switching off, something about maybe school in the morning. Okay?</p>

<p>F1 146: Yes.</p>

<p>TH 250: Now, how has this been for you?</p>

<p>F1 147: Pretty rough.</p>

<p>TH 251: Pretty rough.</p>

<p>F1 148: Yeah.</p>

<p>TH 252: Being here, or you mean at home?</p>

<p>F1 149: At home.</p>

<p>TH 253: How has it been for you being here at the counseling session?</p>

<p>M1 79: Real good. I think maybe it's opening up some eyes over here on how things really are. I don't think they really ever looked at themselves to see what they are really doing. I have known all the time it's dysfunctional.</p>

<p>TH 254: Not dysfunctional, just normal with kids who have figured out a way to handle their parents.</p>

<p>F1 150: Exactly.</p>

<p>M1 80: And we've bottomed out.</p>

<p>TH 254: Michael, thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>M2 55: You're welcome.</p>

<p>TH 255: You were a big help. Thank you. Lauren, nice to have seen you, and Andrea, my favorite rebel. Thanks for being here. Okay, well, we're done for tonight. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>At the next session, Bitter would ask the family how things had gone since the previous session. Did they try out any of the ideas that were discussed? How did they work? He would want the family to recognize their accomplishments or, if they did not, he would want to look at the patterns that kept them from implementing change. Depending on the family accomplishments, he would then continue to work on helping family members develop insight and the ability to make more changes.</p>

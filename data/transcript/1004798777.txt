<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am really worried. The weekend hasn't even started and I'm already coming in, you know, exhausted and in pain and tomorrow I have to be at work at some obscenely early hour, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must be really scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You must be really scared.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I am doing everything possible right now to make things better for the weekend. Like yesterday I spent most of the time doing virtual errands, that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>[01:07.2]</p>

<p>Trying to make sure everything was, you know, going to run smoothly. But I just—- I realize that the past few days I've been breaking out in tears. It's not entirely sadness, it's more exhaustion and frustration, you know? Like I'm not sad, I'm just tired too, you know? And I just couldn't sit still. I mean, I'm so strongly in multitasking mode that I can't really focus. I watched a movie for the first time on TV in like forever. I know the basic gist of the film but that's only because I kept on saying to myself "Okay, so this is what's happened," so I'm actually like taking mental notes.</p>

<p>[02:01.6]</p>

<p>But occasionally I'd have to get up and move around, partially because—- and this has in general been happening to me as the weather gets colder—- if I sit too long, I can't get up. Like it's painful to get up. But partially because well, this needs to be done and this needs to be done, that kind of thing. So it's been really exhausting. </p>

<p>I did make an executive decision last night to put the dog in care overnight starting today and then picking up tomorrow night. That way it's one less thing for John to have to do. He's deeply unhappy and miserable on a physical and mental level, and I have tried a lot of different things to at least help. It seems that everything I have done has made it much much worse. </p>

<p>[03:03.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's happening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we've got this theory right now. Unfortunately, he can't see his neurologist until just before Christmas because that's as early as they can see him. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it somebody at the hospital?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and they have a practice at—- it's basically these people over on (inaudible at 03:36.4) Street but also has a practice. He said he would go anywhere at this point, but he can't see anybody until like the first or second week of December. </p>

<p>I think I told you they found all kinds of things in terms of this—- one of them is something called a Chiari malformation which is I guess when the bottom of the brain descends into the spinal cord. It's congenital. Most of the time they don't notice it until adulthood. He's been asymptomatic for the most part, except for the fact that he can't figure skate. He can't ride a bike. </p>

<p>[04:10.1]</p>

<p>I mean, these are things that—- honestly, we're sort of wrapped over the fact that his parents never noticed he had ear infections as a child. We figured they just destroyed his inner ear, but it's actually not that. But they never bothered to care for that either. It's actually this and except for that, he's been asymptomatic. Ever since the car accident about 24 hours later, 48 hours later, he started having extreme—- which is really classic—- like extreme vertigo, nausea, feeling like he's reeling, that kind of thing. Mystery pains that kind of move around, that kind of stuff. But mostly that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Apparently it is not—- most of the time the way they found out people have this Chiari malformation is because they have car accidents and they do an MRI. They don't really know if it's the accident that brings it out or the other way around. But he just needs to get a phone call from his neurologist.</p>

<p>[05:12.8]</p>

<p>He tried e-mailing his neurologist last time and he's like "I don't—- this is a work-related e-mail. Just call and leave me a message at my office." Which is fine. I mean, that's good boundaries and all, but then he's not getting—- he can't see him and he's not getting calls back. And there's very few people who specialize in these kinds of things.</p>

<p>So anyway, I have been sort of pushing him to, first of all, to go see his—- because he's in a lot of aches and pains too—- to go first of all to start acupuncture which is super-brave for him because although he gives me shots all the time, he actually has a phobia of needles. And he's had mild—- not big things, but mild amounts of panic after being left there for more than 15 minutes with them in, that kind of thing. But he's been pretty good about it.</p>

<p>[06:09.9]</p>

<p>But it seems like every time he comes out of it, he feels worse but then he gets better. We've been doing this mostly for his headaches, primarily because the medication they've tried to give him for these headaches, the consequences are so freaking bad and they don't necessarily work. You know, because of that. And there are some really really good clinical peer-reviewed evidence saying that there are certain types of pain-related things that can be helped with this and that it's actually really good for. One of them is there's this boundary between migraines and clusters in which you get both, but there really isn't a definitive—- there's not a difference between which one it is anymore. </p>

<p>So I've been pushing him to do that, but he's been feeling kind of crummy afterwards and that's fine. He's been feeling really bad lately and I wanted him to go see this, and it was really really bad afterwards. He's been feelings lots of aches and pains and I said "Why don't you go see my massage therapist?" </p>

<p>[07:06.2]</p>

<p>He's seen her before, and he has had very positive results. Yesterday he came home miserable. He's feeling really bad. So like I realize I feel really distressed seeing him feeling this bad, and so I don't really know what to do. I obviously can't suggest things right now to help him, because it seems like everything I suggest has been making things worse. </p>

<p>So I'm basically just trying to take over the functions that he does so that he doesn't have to be miserable so he can rehab himself. So I've just been trying to just get things that he normally does, either for me or for the household, trying to get them done myself. And between that and everything else, I'm really trying to sort of stay focused, keep going towards this goal of being done, and not make a big deal about how bad I'm feeling. </p>

<p>[08:09.2]</p>

<p>But I'm obviously not able to do that. (sniffling) And I'm just doing the best I can. (pause) I don't know. I'm just driving myself into the ground, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay if it turns out that you have limits too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Something has to give. I mean, yesterday he was talking about how much agony he was in and how he was really not looking forward to walking to work because of that and that kind of thing. So I was like "Hey, just take my bus pass and here, I've looked up when the bus is going to come. It's silly to take both a bus and the train to do it, but if you're in pain this will be better."</p>

<p>[09:10.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So you guys can't decide on your car?]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, we've been using a Zipcar for certain things, but you still have to return it back to where it started. It's supposed to be like for an hour, but he needs to—- you know, like if he needs it for work, he can't return it back to the same place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 9:27.1)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I mean, this morning we got a Zipcar for a little bit, and we've discovered that apparently if you rent it in the middle of the night, it's only actually $4 or $5 an hour which isn't too bad. I live right down the street from one, so it's not like it's a big deal but it does get expensive. And part of what we're doing, we're doing all of this to save money, so I can focus on that. </p>

<p>Oh God. I'm just exhausted. I'm just trying to figure out how to keep going. Even today—- I mean, yesterday I should have spent the day resting. I didn't exactly do—- I mean, I did some physical effort but mostly just emotional stuff. Maybe a (inaudible) or two, really.</p>

<p>[10:14.3]</p>

<p>Today I have a bunch of errands I have to run, and then tomorrow I have to be at work at probably five. [That's what it says]. That's how we discovered if you rent the car in the middle of the night, it's very inexpensive because you take it out at 4:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have the launch this weekend? Is that why you—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: [I've got fives] tomorrow morning. I never work Fridays usually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, that's what I thought. (inaudible at 10:50.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's going to be exciting because we get to see all the people who didn't realize that you're not supposed to turn it off in the middle of the update and all that stuff. </p>

<p>[11:07.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try not to make these kinds of comments because it's really unfair, but sometimes it's the only thing I can say. I really feel that sometimes we should give people a common sense test before allowing them to have a certain device and have them have to renew this common sense test every year. Because you've got a couple of people—- I've already gotten e-mails about it—- because it came out at 1 p.m. yesterday, they got frustrated because so many people are downloading it at once. </p>

<p>While it was doing the reboot of swapping the old for the new, apparently people got frustrated and then did a forced restart and now they've wrecked their phones. It's like honestly, it's going to take at least 30 minutes to do that because there are so many people hitting the server, probably more. Just pick a time when you don't need your phone and go do something else. So I will probably be fielding that too. But there's just so many complicated situations related to this launch that's going to be a lot worse.</p>

<p>[12:11.0]</p>

<p>Our carriers have made some changes in which, for reasons unknown to me, myself and a few people have sort of been put responsible to know them and make sure that everyone is aware of them beforehand. That's very difficult because I don't sell phones. But apparently, for example, they have this point of no return where a person who is not the bill payer can actually now change their contract with them, and there is no way to reverse it. If one person makes a change to a plan that is shared, everybody else has that change and there is no way of going backwards. They cannot go back, and it can be done by the 14-year-old son in the family if he shows up at an event launch with the ability to pick up a phone. Yeah.</p>

<p>[13:13.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are very few things that should be put into the hands of a 14-year-old.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this is the problem, and that's part of the reason why they decided that myself and a couple of people should be the people that get this, because I'm a little bit of a rules lawyer about that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm going to be the person who is like "Okay, your name doesn't match the ID." You know, this and that. Or like all this stuff that you, in theory, are not required to do, and if someone reports us, we will probably get fined by the State for violating things. Technically we're not required to ask for ID and verify that it matches the same ID as the credit card and all that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's either that or dealing with really angry parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Very angry parents. On top of it, the person needs to know passwords and things like that. And they're absolutely right that I, although I don't necessarily know all this stuff, I'm the person who can really lay down the law before we get to this point of getting things screwed up.</p>

<p>[14:14.2]</p>

<p>It's not in my skill set in terms of what I do for a living. But I'm the kind of person who will be okay with pissing off a parent because they sent them with their credit card for their 15-year-old to go get a new phone. I will send them away and I will be like "I understand, but this kid is not buying." I feel like they feel I can do this better than your average 22-year-old whose mom and dad let them use their credit card to go buy something anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, it is true that I'm one of the few people who can do this, but it is a lot of pressure being sort of the gatekeeper of making sure that nobody else gets into trouble. </p>

<p>[15:10.8]</p>

<p>I mean, there will be managers around for that too, but they can't have one everywhere. And so, among various other things, it has just become very complicated. So like, for example, at AT&T, if you want to be able to use video calling via cellular network, you must change to a different plan and all this other stuff. And they trust me to—- when the (inaudible at 15:42.7) person comes in and talks about net neutrality, you know, says "Yes, that's great and all philosophically, but I can't make—-" They trust me to be the person that says "I understand that you feel as if this is not correct, but if you want to be able to do this over this wireless network, this is all I can do. You can make a choice. You can do this, or you cannot do this. But that's the way the world works." </p>

<p>[16:07.8]</p>

<p>And that sort of—- that kind of, I guess, hardline thing, apparently I'm relatively good at. Saying "I understand. I'm not an attorney. I am not in any way able to tell you about FTC regulations, but I can tell you that this is a device and you can watch every step along the way of what I do, but this is the only thing we can do to make this work." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You're tougher dealing with that kind of stuff.]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Hopefully I'll be able to train a few people to get very good, and I can just start doing what I do well which is basically problem-solving for why data doesn't migrate or whatever. (pause)</p>

<p>[17:10.2]</p>

<p>All of those skills are a matter of social engineering. They're not a matter of intellect, you know? They are a matter of learning how to manage people. So I feel I can pick a few people so that by Sunday, I won't have to do it. (pause) We'll see. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem kind of on your last nerve. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I already saw this coming when I had to deal with other things too. So yeah, I really am on my last nerve. Like physically, in terms of pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been in a lot of pain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm in a lot of pain. I elected not to take my medication this week because I knew that—- (voices overlapping)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The chemo stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The chemo stuff, yeah. And basically anything that had negative consequences, because I knew that there could be a gamble of something really horrifying happening like throwing up at work, which has happened more than once. And although people have a lot of sympathy, there will be nobody to take care of me, you know?</p>

<p>[18:25.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, trying to do the very best I can to make sure that I am in the condition, especially tomorrow, to be the face of Microsoft, to be excited for people. Not just being this gatekeeper thing, but also like the person who comes in at 7 a.m. gets treated exactly the same as the person who comes in at 7 p.m. in terms of the excitement and talking to them about the line and thanking them so much for their dedication and all that stuff. I'm obsequious by nature, but it's exhausting to do it all weekend long.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure it is. I mean, you've told me before how exhausting and overwhelming launch weekend is.</p>

<p>[19:26.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually enjoy it too. Once I get into it, I usually enjoy it and I probably will. It's just that there are a lot of other changes going on that's making it very hard to want to do it right now. Right now if I won the lottery, I would probably go to sleep and cry because of the stress with having to deal with all the red tape. (chuckles) Which is really sad, but true. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It kind of sounds like you're focused on what's coming, things you're going to need to do, how you're going to be at work. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. How I need to be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What problem-solving you can do to make things as easy as possible and stuff like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My husband referred to it also because I'm so flat and so exhausted. What did he call it? Conservation of loquaciousness or (inaudible at 20:23.1) something bubbly, because I know I'm going to have to be on the whole time.</p>

<p>[20:27.8]</p>

<p>I don't mind being that way, but I can't—- I need to conserve my energy towards that. (pause) Because even though I'm telling people they can't do this, I'm extremely upbeat about the whole thing and just trying to be everything they want me to be. (pause) But it is exhausting. It's really exhausting. But it will be over—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're working tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not working Saturday, thank goodness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I work tomorrow, off Saturday, all day Sunday, all day Monday, half day Tuesday, which is still a lot for me. And it's not like—- I mean, when I teach I get to sit down a decent bit of it. </p>

<p>[21:17.8]</p>

<p>This is something where the only time I really get a chance to sit down is occasionally when I'm dealing with people who have certain types of physical mobility issues, so that I can be able to accommodate them. It is unfair to bend down to talk to them. If you sit down and you see them at eye level—- or occasionally, and this is always fascinating, when I get a customer who has decided that I need a break. This is always great, being sent on a break by a customer. </p>

<p>Or they've decided like "You're going to sit down, and if anyone comes to give you a hard time, I'm going to tell them that I'm not buying this phone unless you sit down with me." Every once in a while you get these feisty people who already know, and it's really sweet but it's kind of weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>[22:11.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. They really are—- it's nice. It is nice. When I talk about it as being this massive group of people, we actually do have an enormous community of people who not just love Microsoft but go out of their way to help us as employees. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They kind of look out for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They look out for us. For example, a couple of years ago there was this yoga teacher or something like that who did stuff in our break room, who specifically had free services in which they did mini-yoga things to help with the stress of standing. They did it entirely for free in the break room. They offered it for us. We've had people bring us food. I mean, food is sort of love in the Microsoft world, especially if it involves peanut butter and chocolate, apparently. People will bring us food, cards, things like that. Just other things like that. But there really is a group of people who do support us.</p>

<p>[23:16.1]</p>

<p>It just—- it's not that it isn't enough. It's just that the only way it could be supportive is by saying "I adore you guys camping out, but please just go home and order online." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is definitely a social event. My store doesn't have as much camping out because the mall doesn't allow it. Where I was before was an outdoor location. It was kind of like [inaudible] but not nearly as big. Therefore, we would have people out there for days. Like with Sterno and camp chairs and everything like that. And those people were just a blast. They could've very easily gotten online. They know what they're doing. Those people could work our jobs. This is a social event for them to see their other friends who they only see during product launches, which is kind of weird to explain, but they're also the easiest customers. But yeah, they'll bring us food and they do things like that. </p>

<p>[24:23.8]</p>

<p>But still at the same time, I'm talking about these positive things but really it's exhausting. It's really exhausting, you know? It's a lot to have to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, you're trying to gear up and stay positive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to do my best. I'm glad I made the decision last night. I was originally going to, before coming here, head downtown and then I walked from downtown over to drop her off, then walk back and then go get her tonight. I guess it was probably better to have kept it overnight—- one, for her and two, for me—- so I don't have to worry about it. Then I think we're going to be renting a car Friday night for the rest of it. I just found out that Enterprise apparently is having some weekend deals where it's only ten bucks a day for rentals. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, that's great.</p>

<p>[25:20.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not the ones that are close by. It's always ones that are far away like (inaudible at 25:24.6) isn't that far away. I live in midtown and there's one right in the middle of midtown. But we're going to try to start doing that at least to have that for Sunday and all that. But it's just a lot to have to deal with. It's a lot to manage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a lot of planning in terms of stuff, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most people don't have to do the kind of planning that I do. But they still have a lot of planning to do. And although Microsoft does feed us, it's still a lot of things that have to balance out. At least I don't have to worry about packing my lunch or anything like that, thank God. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They give you guys food?</p>

<p>[26:24.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. All day long. The bad thing is, depending on who's in charge of the food, it may or may not be Doritos all day long. It won't be as bad as that, but sometimes it is the nutritional equivalent of that. </p>

<p>I think that at least at the last store meeting, one of the managers there, Gary, who he specifically came from Florida and I almost never work with him, but he made sure that what he did—- he seems to catch the imagination of things. Like he did an around the world thing where he had food ordered from all these different places in these little sections. So there was an area that had a little bit of sushi, a little bit of curry, so that everybody had something. And America was complete and total junk food. It was hilarious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's funny.</p>

<p>[27:15.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, you know, cupcakes and stuff. It was very nice to do that. That was nice. Whereas a couple of people would be like "Okay, I'm going to order from five different pizza places so you have different things." (chuckles) I don't know. So we'll see. But like I said, it's a lot to have to get done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because of the fact that it's so difficult for me, it always makes me feel a little bit like a failure because—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean because somehow dealing with all of the medical problems that you have, the effects of the treatment, a husband who is having a lot of mental and physical health troubles, a stressful job at a particularly stressful time, because you're overwhelmed by all this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't forget the fact that I've recently gotten rid of a car. But yes. Yeah, you know? (pause) I do feel, no matter what, I still feel like a bit of a failure.</p>

<p>[28:26.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, tell me about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I guess—- (pause) I don't know. It's hard to explain. I feel like a failure because of the fact that I need to have so much preparation to get to these points for things. I really made an effort over the years to not be so rigid about things and be so inflexible about what I can and can't do. But it seems to me that whenever I do, the negative consequences of such are beyond what I'm willing to cope with. </p>

<p>[29:24.7]</p>

<p>Quick example: I don't ever let anyone help me pack to move anymore. The reason being, I was told to just chill out and do that. There are things I've never found. I mean, important things like my knives. I have things like that that I've never found again. I have no idea where they are or what storage unit they might be in, that kind of stuff. </p>

<p>Or just the whole thing of "Hey, I know that you feel like you need to make sure that all of the recycling is where it should be right now, but why don't you just let that go?" Well, I've had that thing after being sick or after being [on a long weekend], waking up to a giant pile of stinky recycling and realizing, you know, being sick or being exhausted and realizing oh my God, this is more than I can handle. And so being that person who can't just let things sit, I tried. I really have tried. </p>

<p>[30:20.1]</p>

<p>It's not like a thing where—- I sort of self-analyze this in a way that's probably not necessary or even helpful, but it's not like the feeling that I can't leave something out. It's not like an obsession in terms of I'm going to get anxiety because it's sitting out there. It's because of the fact that I've not done it and the negative consequences have sucked. Like, you know, leaving dishes out for a day or two. I've had the experience of like oh my God, now I can't get it clean or the house smells so bad that I'm not willing to—- you know what I mean? It's not like—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not moral uptightness. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even like an OCD thing. I've had roommates who were like that who couldn't eat until things were cleaned up. I can't eat until things are cleaned up, not because I get anxiety over it, just because afterwards I'm going to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>[31:29.1]</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever mentioned to you that I had a college roommate who had very severe OCD, and because of that I almost always look at—- this was years and years ago, but it was enough to make an insane impression on me, such that every time I do something about which I'm very quirky about my rules on things—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get worried that you—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not worried. I just sort of do a self-check to think what's the reason behind it because of that, because of the fact that I saw it so much. You know, things like the first time I didn't wash my hands a couple of times while I'm in the middle of preparing something and I've gotten listeria, or something like that, because of chicken. That's not the same as I have to wash my hands a lot, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>[32:28.0]</p>

<p>But having lived an entire year with that, it's enough to make—- whenever you have quirky things about not doing something, it's enough to make you pause and think am I being obsessive about this or is it for real reasons? She had lots of crazy things. </p>

<p>So the big thing for me is that I check my doors a lot. The reason being, more than a few times I have forgotten to lock the door, that kind of thing. So I do make sure that it really is locked, not because I'm afraid that it's not locked when I leave the house. It's because of the fact that I've had situations where I've left things plugged in, especially when I had really bad problems with pernicious anemia. I've left things boiling on the stove, and that was very scary </p>

<p>[33:20.6]</p>

<p>And it's enough to condition me to make sure that—- if I'm feeling like right now today, I'll probably, before leaving the house again, check twice to make sure the doors are locked because I know for a fact that I'm sleepwalking through things. So I'll make it halfway down the street and go "Wait a second, I have no distinct memory of locking the door" and I'll go back and check. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, I don't know. I'm not saying I have to be really worried about being OCD, but I have to be kind of vigilant about the fact that when I get to this level of exhaustion, certain things that I normally do by rote, I need to make sure that I actually did them right. And not right as in "That's okay. You burned the hot dogs" or something like that. It's more like "You left the grill on overnight" kind of thing.</p>

<p>[34:24.8]</p>

<p>And that's the part where I feel like I'm a failure. I really feel like a failure. It would be very very simple operations that I seem to have to plan ahead for and—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to me all the planning and logistical thinking and sort of strategically managing your resources, emotional and in terms of energy and money, dealing with all that is itself—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite exhausting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But not as exhausting as having to deal with things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only thing that's worse is if you don't do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's much worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it's exhausting in the best of—- I mean, with better alternatives too.</p>

<p>[35:29.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like as I've started walking places, the first time I noticed that my feet are sometimes bleeding. I'm like okay, that's weird, but whatever. Having now realized that I can't leave the house without an extra pair of socks just in case, that kind of thing. I mean, I've already gone through the experience of having to deal with that. It's exhausting doing all the planning, but at the same time if I don't—- I feel kind of like what new mothers do when they're trying to figure out, like before they go outside, all the things they need to take for the baby. Like the logistical planning of taking the baby up to the mall for the first time or somewhere. I feel a lot like that. The problem is that it gets easier for them. And it does sometimes get easier for me. </p>

<p>[36:24.3]</p>

<p>I have certain things that are pre-set already so that if I'm going to do certain things that are already set, I have them. But not always, you know? Like I already have certain bags that already have a power cord for my laptop. I bought four or five laptop power cords because I know that it's better to have one in my luggage for travel than to have to worry at the last minute packing that power cord. That kind of quibbling stuff, you know. </p>

<p>That part does get easier, but the planning of making sure that I have the things that I need at any given time is not always so. It's tiring. (pause) But at the very least it makes me—- if I know that at the end of the day that I have everything I need to get done, it will help me sleep at night instead of being worried. I'll be able to sleep well. </p>

<p>[37:33.5]</p>

<p>I'm one of those people that seeing all the things I got done gives me a sense of achievement. I don't necessarily show anybody the list of the things I've gotten finished, but at least I know that I got all this stuff done and wow, that's amazing. Whether or not anybody else thinks it's amazing is, well, they don't have the same standards, you know? But I'm just exhausted and I've just lost hope in terms of getting better. </p>

<p>[38:28.6]</p>

<p>I've really been hoping and hoping and hoping to have a point of not necessarily remission, but having it let up for a while. And I just—- I mean, if I talk about it statistically, it's probably [not] going to happen, but I hope for it. All I can do it sort of—- I do have hope that wherever we move to will be easier on my body, but that's about it. (pause) </p>

<p>It's funny actually because I've actually sort of put my foot down on certain places, specifically because I know that as intriguing and as interesting as they would be, I know that they would be impossible for me. (pause)</p>

<p>[39:41.3]</p>

<p>The University is taking people, for example, for certain types of—- they're trying to build up their faculty, so my husband could very well, could very easily get tenure track instead of having to do this—- not just tenure track, but come in at a much higher level than he would somewhere else because they're really trying to establish a bunch of things. But it sounds great and I would love to live in England. But when all is said and done, I know that physically the damp weather would be more than I can handle. It's not like—- there are places where I at least know my way around that are damp. I've never lived there, so I don't even know my way around.</p>

<p>[40:33.8]</p>

<p>Whereas London is relatively damp, but I actually know my way around there better than I know my way around here. So that wouldn't be as big of a deal, plus I have acquaintances and a support system. I'd veto Seattle, possibly for the same reasons. He was pretty okay with that too. Again, for the problems with weather, etc. but also because of the fact that I wouldn't be able to be very self-sufficient there. I mean, I've lived in California multiple times. It's not a place where I could be self-sufficient, not unless I lived in the middle of Los Angeles, which is not California, you know. (chuckles) It's not all like that, but it definitely is feeling like I can very strongly say "Hey, there are—-"</p>

<p>[41:44.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Limitations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Limitations, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck with the weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. I will see you Tuesday. If for some reason I know that I am not going to be physically able to come here on Tuesday, I will know by Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll probably know by Sunday, so I'll let you know.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, today I sort of put into motion a decision I have been wanting — I think it's probably for the best. I'm trying to get transferred to a store that's closer. So we'll see. If so, then I will be working full-time because that's what they have. There's a personality that I work with at the store that seems to really — I cannot win this battle. Every chance I get, this person gets a chance to really really try and make me feel like I'm an idiot. And I don't foresee it getting much better in the future. That's not my official reason because if I tell management that's why I'm doing it, they're going to try and resolve the issue. Because this person is very close with management and is highly respected, it's never ever going to be a fair discussion.</p>

<p>[01:12.2]</p>

<p>So I saw today that there actually is an opening over near me. I texted somebody I know who used to work with me (inaudible at 01:18.3), asking if they would put in a good word for me. They are super excited about the idea of me coming there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [So I went to discuss it]. It was like "Great, I'm so glad you're being really supportive." So that would be good. We'll see. I don't know whether or not it will go through, but I told my boss as I was leaving that I was trying to transfer. I was like "You know what, I've been doing this for 18 months, something like that, and I just really need to get closer into the city." She seemed to be non-committal about that, but that's fine. (pause)</p>

<p>[02:02.7]</p>

<p>I just — there are things that I feel as if there are battles that are worth fighting, and this is not one of them. Lately it's been my tendency to whenever everybody is in one side and against — like they are of one opinion and I am of a separate one, to think to myself "What am I doing wrong? What have I done wrong?" But at this point, I just feel like that can't be. I feel like this is just this person is looking to try and, I don't know why, curry favor. I don't even understand her motivations at all. She's retired. She retired from a very successful career. From what I understand, she's very comfortable. I know that she's jealous that I work a lot less hours than she does. At the very least, the kind of comments she makes make me thing that she's jealous.</p>

<p>[03:09.7]</p>

<p>She's going out for a lead position. I don't really understand why because based upon her circumstances, it makes no sense whatsoever that she's doing any of this. It's like I don't really understand exactly why it is that at 65 she's having this drive to do this. You know what? I don't care that much. I'm not her competitor. I never have been. Just because I have seniority over her doesn't mean — like in terms of seniority literally, not necessarily in terms of anything else. I just don't get it. (pause) And I'm sick of feeling awkward. I'm constantly feeling like I don't get what's going on in the situation. I'm sick of feeling constantly like I'm saying something, and everybody else is going "What? You're not making sense."</p>

<p>[04:08.2]</p>

<p>You remember that one time I read a text message and I responded back and — different person, but you know what? I'm done with that right now. I'm also actively looking to try and potentially get out of the industry, at least a little bit. [I'm working] a little bit because I like the benefits, but possibly just do something else too. I'm just — I'm a bit burned out on the personality and things like that, and if things become too big. Like the company has become way too big. (pause)</p>

<p>[04:53.8]</p>

<p>I'm sort of in this place where I'm constantly feeling a little bit confused, all the time. Like whatever I choose to do, it seems to be the wrong option including inaction, action, whatever. Whatever it is, I'm just doing it wrong, and I'm sick of feeling like I'm always wrong. So I've got to figure out something where I can win for a little bit. (pause) So I'll see what I can do. (pause) Maybe it's cheating per se, but right now I just need something that I can really do well and really succeed. Not that I don't succeed, but I need the confidence. (pause) I need to feel special for a bit. I'm not. I'm feeling like I drag on everybody's life that I'm around. (pause)</p>

<p>[06:03.6]</p>

<p>And there's nobody in the world who is going to do it for me, in terms of making me get out of this rut and feeling like I'm a giant burden on, quite literally, the earth. Except for me. So I need to sort of regroup and think about what I can do to try to set myself up to feeling like I am a valuable contributor. (pause) And I hate that. (long pause)</p>

<p>[07:19.8]</p>

<p>I just don't know what to do. I guess I'm lucky. (pause) I've got a lot of talents. Some things I just need to fix and break the habit of. I don't know how, but I've been able to force myself to stop doing things in the past that have been unhelpful. (pause) I guess it's time for me yet again to reinvent myself. (long pause)</p>

<p>[09:12.8]</p>

<p>It is really devastating to feel bad about who I am all the time. Not just who I am, but my choices that I make and whatever I do. I'm sick of feeling so damn awkward. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Awkward how?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm not entirely certain of what's going on at any given time. (pause) This morning I walked into work and that same person who always drives me crazy is like "You're here early." I said "Yes, this is when I could get here." And then she's like "So why are you here?" Then it became a "Well, you do know that this person is uncomfortable with you trying to help them. They don't really want your help. You're stepping on other people's feet."</p>

<p>[10:12.3]</p>

<p>I'm just like "You know what? I am just so done with this." (pause) Or just being like I don't know where at any given time who is in charge of what, do you know what I mean? I just feel very disoriented. And by doing that, it makes me feel very much not confident, and I think that lets me be prey to people who do that kind of thing for fun, in terms of pick on people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You talk about being disoriented to interpersonal stuff that's going on at work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Disoriented as in who is doing what at this point and at this time.</p>

<p>[11:11.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the one who said that the other person didn't want your help, does it shake your confidence that you're right about her wanting your help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what happened? Did you go to see the person and they were —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only had a couple of seconds beforehand, and she's like "I feel like I'm torn in the middle of this. I just don't want to be in the middle of this conflict." I'm like "I don't really understand the conflict. I don't want you to feel like you're in the middle of a conflict."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is the person you were going to help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who you had mentioned yesterday that you've done some mentoring for, and who was doing a training of some kind.</p>

<p>[12:10.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then she said —</p>

<p>CLIENT: She feels as if she's in the middle of some sort of conflict between myself and somebody else, and she's getting pulled in the middle of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Which was news to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. But she was really — but it's not like — that is news to me but I still didn't get the read of "I don't want your help." As opposed to "I see that there's some sort of [pulling little game] going on right now, and I feel like I'm dragged in the middle of it" is a different story than "I don't want your help." (pause)</p>

<p>[13:12.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it sounds quite disorienting and jarring in that, at least as I understand it, before you set foot in the store today you just thought you were going to help this person out because you've helped her out with other things, and didn't have a concern about it at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I said "I don't have an emotional stake in this really. I was just trying to help."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you got the first comment —</p>

<p>CLIENT: She makes a lot of comments about my comings and goings. A lot. As in almost every single day, which is kind of bizarre. (pause)</p>

<p>[14:16.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of being confronted with two people who are seeing things very differently and in ways that are bewildering.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And the way she speaks to me makes me feel like I'm constantly on the defensive, and therefore I'm very nervous and I get very obsequious and just want to make people happy to make it stop. (pause)</p>

<p>[15:10.8]</p>

<p>And I could very well be in the wrong a little bit, or a lot, I don't know. But at this point, I am unwilling — there is enough behavior that I really feel like discussing it isn't going to help, because this is obviously something that she is getting some sort of benefit. This is not a misunderstanding. She's getting some sort of benefit out of picking on me and running to management to tell them. (pause) And misconstruing things that have nothing to do with her, like "Oh, your person was here looking for you and you weren't here. You promised them this." I'm like "I promised them nothing."</p>

<p>[16:02.1]</p>

<p>She potentially thinks that she's holding me accountable, I don't know. But you know what? Combine that with her saying "Oh, it's been a long time since I've had a weekend off or had two days off in a row. It must be nice leaving at one p.m. every day," that kind of thing. Done. (pause) It's bad enough that she already makes me feel bad about being who I am. She has made just very friendly comments, saying that I'm being too complacent about life and how she jumps out of airplanes, and she's gone on Safari, she's gone zip-lining, basically all these different things. How she's embracing life, and how she wants to spend the next 50 years of her life, this and that.</p>

<p>[17:05.4]</p>

<p>She does Facebook and this and that. And you know what? I don't care. If she is of an older age and she acts younger than I do, who cares? You know what? I can't. Obviously I can't go zip-lining, but you know what, if I have a certain frame of mind, that's my own business. I'm not hurting the customers. I'm not hurting my colleagues. It's just not for me. And it's okay for me to decide I don't want to do something. I have not had so much peer pressure in my entire life. And because she's kind of grandmotherly-like but yet cool and hip and wears cool clothes and acts very cool and things like that, a lot of people like her because of that.</p>

<p>[18:00.4]</p>

<p>I have no time for this, really. I'd just rather get into a different store. I've been wanting to get to a different store anyway. This is just the shove that I needed. I know that I can't say that to management that way because no matter what it is, I've known management for long enough to know that they're going to say "If you've got problems with conflict, it's going to follow you everywhere you go. Why don't you — you need to improve this now."</p>

<p>She was used to being one of the most senior people that had all the connections. I admit that all my connections have gone dry, most of them. I don't care. If she perceives some sort of threat, that's really interesting because I have no ambition. (pause)</p>

<p>[19:02.9]</p>

<p>And if I'm just reading this entirely wrong and that's just the way she makes conversation, like "You're here early. It must be nice to leave at this point. What are you doing here?" But you know what? Then I'm misunderstanding it. But when all is said and done, oh well. I could be misunderstanding what her intentions are, but I really don't think so. If it was just that, it would be fine. But it's that, plus being a tattletale and a bunch of other things. That's the problem. (pause)</p>

<p>[20:42.8]</p>

<p>I mean, last week when I was coming in late because I had to talk to management, it was about this same person who was running around telling people that somebody was expecting me there, but then yet again I hadn't taken care of my obligations when I didn't. It wasn't true. It's just like, I don't need this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened when you talked to management?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They claimed it was fine, it's over. But yet at the same time, they think I need to work and [square it out with Jessica] as to what's going on and find an understanding. But then they also say "Your track record of having these kinds of mistakes show that maybe that's not true."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe what's not true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That you aren't making these mistakes. Or people are ready to jump to conclusions because you have a poor track record of making mistakes. Sometimes I just say that I did it and I'm sorry, just to get them off my back when I've done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you mentioned this last week.</p>

<p>[21:44.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also the fact that that track record is being kept by one person who runs to management and talks to them about it. (pause) I seem to be, and this is terrible to say, I seem to be better when I'm pissed off than when I'm sad, because at least I'm willing to act on something. Or even if I know that I may have a warped sense of view for it, at least I'm not passive. Because normally at this point in my life right now, I've just been "Oh, I'm such a screw up" and I go into Eeyore mode like "Oh no, I guess I can't do anything right."</p>

<p>[22:49.5]</p>

<p>Wait a second. Maybe I just need to start — maybe I'm overreacting and swinging to that direction, but at least I'm being active towards doing something. And maybe I need to vilify a few people to do it, because otherwise I think to myself that I'm too empathic towards the other person, what might be right and what might be wrong, and I need to stop being that way. (pause) I need to stop seeing the other person's side, because obviously it's convincing me that whatever it is, I'm in the wrong. Maybe just a little bit. I know there's shades of gray to be had, but I'm really not quite ready to be there quite yet.</p>

<p>[23:50.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you may, I'm not sure about this, but you may have — and give me a minute to explain it — you may have this sort of omnipotence thing that gets you into trouble in the following way. That you figure if there was a misunderstanding, that somehow it must be your fault.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, why would anyone bring up any other reason why? I naively believe that people are working in the best of intentions, and are working with perfect rationality and perfect clarity. (pause) Does that make sense?</p>

<p>[24:56.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, yes and no. I think I hear what you're saying, but I can only imagine that you must have some motivation for seeing things that way because it certainly has not been your experience.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is what I am. I mean, I would never try to do something like this if I didn't really feel like maybe that it really was true. (pause) Because I over-analyze things, I wouldn't take an action like that or do anything like that if there wasn't a reason for it.</p>

<p>[25:47.9]</p>

<p>To me, games like this whole politics, who's like the most superior person thing, this is exhausting. I just unfortunately assume that nobody would do this if I wasn't really a sucking drive on their lives, and I was making their lives miserable and impossible to work. (pause) The way I would operate, I give people the same — does that make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, yes and no. Like I think I appreciate the logic that you're referring to, but I also sort of know that you know better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but by instinct. Know better by instinct and by experience are two different things.</p>

<p>[26:55.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess in my experience, instinct of the sort you are referring to, isn't usually instinct.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I meant more —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's more a motivation for it. There must be some reason why you want to see it this way, that you don't want to acknowledge until it gets to this point when you're really quite pissed off about it and quite hurt about it. You don't want to acknowledge her ill intentions or scheming-ness. Or maybe you're willing to acknowledge them, I think you've mentioned them before, but you don't want to —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to believe it's that person's modus operandi as opposed to a temporary thing.</p>

<p>[27:51.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you get (inaudible at 27:52.1) to maybe even acknowledge it or play along, I guess until you really get pissed off and then you decide to leave. (long pause)</p>

<p>[28:56.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I just assume — I don't really know. I would like to believe that people have good intentions. Especially when someone has a long track record going for them, showing that they do have good intentions, and many people have had very positive feelings about them. I have to assume that I'm getting a wrong read. (pause)</p>

<p>It's very easy to assume I'm reading something wrong when I'm feeling disoriented so often. When you feel constantly like things are not making a whole lot of sense. It's not that they're not making a whole lot of sense, there's something a little bit wrong all of the time. It's very easy to say "Obviously I'm not seeing this situation correctly." (pause)</p>

<p>[30:24.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could also imagine that you detest and are really adverse to the sort of political and interpersonal infighting or cattiness, or whatever you want to call it. I don't mean you won't react or be assertive with people, but this sort of jockeying or maneuvering or indirectness, I think you really don't like.</p>

<p>[31:28.4]</p>

<p>And I wonder if that's some of what you're avoiding in wanting — I'm not saying this is the only reason, but I imagine it's one of the reasons — for wanting to give people the benefit of the doubt, long after there's really any doubt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, quite frankly, by writing the person off as being underhanded or very political, that means I have to spend the energy of constantly monitoring what's going on to make sure that I don't get screwed. It's easier to say that I've obviously misread the situation and give them a clean slate. That means I don't have to be as vigilant for somebody monitoring the things that I'm doing and tattling on them.</p>

<p>[32:40.3]</p>

<p>I detest that kind of behavior. One, because I find it the most irrational and impractical bullshit on the face of the earth. I don't understand why anyone would devote their time to it. But two, because I'm not very good at it. I think that if I was any good at it, I don't think I'd still want to do it. It's just not who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense. I think both are important. I think — and I'm glad you wouldn't want to have anything to do with it in any case. It's not how you were raised, and it's not how you want to conduct relationships. You probably wouldn't. It also seems to me that it makes these situations so much more vulnerable and bewildering.</p>

<p>[33:47.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now don't get me wrong. There are people who, right off the bat, I get a bad feeling about and I will never let down my guard. There's lots and lots and lots of ways that I pick up on that. But this is more subtle than that. This is not the person who obviously has something wrong and they're looking to do (inaudible at 34:14.1). This is much more subtle than that.</p>

<p>And so unless someone seems to basically be wearing a beacon on their head that says "I like to exploit people because it makes me feel good about who I am" — (pause) I just find the whole thing so exhausting.</p>

<p>[34:44.7]</p>

<p>To give you an idea of this, okay, I had a discussion last year about how when I went to visit my family at the beach, I wasn't really because [inaudible] isn't really the beach, this and that. I was like "You know what? It had the word beach in it. I'm describing a place. I'm not trying to be pretentious. All I was trying to say was where the hell I was for the past three days."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You want the longitude and latitude? If that makes more sense, I'd be happy to put it in those —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like honestly, "That's not part of the beach." I'm like "You know what? I really don't freaking care. You asked me what I had been up to and why I got some sun." I have no emotional stake in whether it's truly the beach or not. I just don't give a fuck. You know, if I wanted to go somewhere pretentious, I'd go to Ibiza in Spain and fly back, to be honest, or I would go to a private island. If I really wanted to do something pretentious, I wouldn't go to the beach.</p>

<p>[35:48.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's worse because I think when something like that happens, you feel terribly ashamed by being labeled pretentious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I'm being grilled too about being asked where this is. I'm like "I don't know, I was there for two days." Same person, by the way. It's not even being labeled as pretentious. With that particular person, I just don't give a damn because she quite obviously has feelings about that, about wanting to be that way.</p>

<p>[36:54.6]</p>

<p>I don't know what to say about this, really, to be honest. I have a background that I was raised in. I could not change it. It had its positive moments, it had its negative moments. I think it was overall positive. But I don't think it was any better or any worse than anybody else. When I was with my friends, we used to play games where we'd pretend we were poor and living in Jamaica. Yeah, I know, it's so sad that we had these conversations. But it's what it was. And it makes me feel like I need to make up random shit just to not have to discuss my life. I had no idea that in any way, shape or form that this was a matter of hot debate as to which city is actually this. Don't care. It had the word at the end. That's what I was using.</p>

<p>[37:58.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. My point is you don't just think to yourself whoever brought it up "That person is just a fucker."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel ashamed about it because quite frankly, I'm embarrassed for her that she has to spend her time —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it sounds like it really does get to you in some fashion, though. That's my concern about all of this, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It didn't bother me until — it's the aggregate of having every single part of my life dissected. That kind of stuff doesn't really bother me until it gets dissected on a longer scale.</p>

<p>[38:53.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You meant the same person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, mostly it's the same person. Occasionally other people, but for the most part, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about the way she keeps at it or keeps after you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She keeps tabs on my lifestyle which is weird and creepy. She keeps tabs on everything I do. (pause) Don't you find that to be a little strange?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. But — of course. But it doesn't sound like it was that that bothered you with the thing about the Beach with her. It sounded more like it's because she was treated you as though you had been quite pretentious, which is clearly not where you were coming from.</p>

<p>[40:16.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually really felt more like she was correcting me on my geography.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. More like she was telling you that you were wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Than about saying you were pretentious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah, it was more about that. It was more like "Oh, you're wrong. It actually doesn't count." This whole long thing about what is and isn't correct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The geography of the Beach.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. The geography thing around here just drives me a little bit bonkers because occasionally I will say I was somewhere and they'll say "Oh, that's not really that place, it's this place." Like it's cut up a lot. I'm like "You know what? The closet subway stop to me is Central. I don't live in the Square. I guess I live in Hanover." These are distinctions without difference to me. That's not a pretentiousness thing, that's just —</p>

<p>[41:21.1]</p>

<p>I do a lot of estimations in my life because it's easier as an engineer. This is going to drive me crazy as a mathematician. We often estimate the number 2 pi as the number 10. You can actually do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 2 pi is 10?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You can if you need to, because if you're just trying to [see a scale], you know you just need to go to a power of 10 —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Order of magnitude —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, if you need to know the magnitude of something, you can use 10.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've got to stop, I forgot —</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I was always working with people who are physics people (inaudible at 41:57.8), they were just like "We can figure it out from the order of magnitude. That's all that matters."</p>

<p>But to me, it's a distinction without a difference. And the fact that I've just wasted this amount of my life having this discussion over something I don't care about and actually don't even remember the details. Maybe that's conversational, maybe not. Maybe I'm the one who is warped and doesn't realize that it's just like a "Oh, let me tell you little bit about the history of this area, and this is actually where these lines are and therefore anything past this Avenue is this."</p>

<p>[42:35.1]</p>

<p>But you know what? I don't have that emotionally — I don't care that much. And I can't say that. So it's more like I wish people wouldn't correct me on things that have no impact on anything else in life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now, but we'll talk on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. See you Tuesday.</p>

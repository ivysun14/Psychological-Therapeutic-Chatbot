<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I feel bad because I missed my — well I had to reschedule my individual therapist because we had to work late. Or our boss wanted us to. And then I scheduled it for Friday morning and I missed it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You overslept.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like I haven't done that much deep work on it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Did you see them at all?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Last week? No.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah see I didn't see mine either because I had to reschedule too. Because we had to work late for our boss.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah it was like overtime last week. And then I've also been thinking how you noticed that I didn't show emotion. I think that's just how I was raised. The last time I cried to my Mom she told me to stop pitying myself. And we got into a huge fight. And then she died. So. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean your sister said the same thing about me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:11) It was yesterday.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Um. Let's see. We sort of had an ultimatum. (inaudible at 00:01:23) about moving to Vermont. And everything. My stepfather sort of stepped on the whole thing. He sort of did a 180. Well yeah basically a one hundred and eighty-degree shift on what he thought we should do which was kind of frustrating. I'm not saying he's wrong necessarily. But nonetheless a little frustrating. So. The shop space that I found up in Vermont I can't enter into. And I'm told we need to stay in the New York area and get our feet on the ground. [00:01:57]</p>

<p>I just don't know if this a good place for us to do it. I don't know. There is this letter that he wrote us. You might as well read it. You might as well because it makes a big difference in our lives. It's not an unreasonable letter. But I would like you to read it if it's okay with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want me to read it later?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. Now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now. Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: If it's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine. (inaudible at 00:02:23)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It can't be a bad thing.</p>

<p>(inaudible background conversation) (pause in audio at [00:02:25] to 00:03:45)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. What are your thoughts about the letter?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I hadn't read for a minute since yesterday I guess.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: My Dad also wanted me to -. He was also questioning me about (inaudible at 00:03:58) expenses or health care. So now I'm also wondering if (inaudible at 00:04:02) my healthcare either. So it's a $120 for that too. [00:04:10]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well if you adjust the rate.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just saying.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's a sliding scale.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I mean — but we—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't take BCBS?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mine doesn't. (inaudible at 00:04:21)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well there is two different kinds of it I think. There is like — well we have two different plans. And then my primary care doctor only takes one of them. Not the other one.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So anyway. Yeah we have two different health insurances so. Through BCBS. But long story short neither of our psychologists or whatever take it. But apparently (inaudible at 00:04:43) it's not a big deal. (inaudible) pay for mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you said over the next two months.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well he'll continue paying for the healthcare stuff forever. I think he's obligated under the trust to do so. One of his obligations under the trust is to pay for health insurance and healthcare stuff. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it speaks to a broader issue of whether you want him to continue.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. You might just want to be independent from him so you don't get so affected by it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know but I don't see that happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ever?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it should happen. I should be self-reliant. But I'm not.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And there are resources — I don't know. Probably not for your addiction doctor. For therapists there are resources. I know you have a really good —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's why he'll keep on paying for this indefinitely. But I need to get a statement from you so I can get it on to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah I need one too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because I owe you money right now. I don't know if Jessica does. But—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well I think everything — last week's session and this week's session. I do want to talk to you. I don't know if I even gave you that contract before so —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh the one you e-mailed?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Did I give you that before? [00:06:04]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the few sessions that you missed I usually just charge my regular fee if people miss sessions.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I was charging you half for the few sessions that you missed. So I'll charge you half—</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: For the ones from last week where we cancelled. (inaudible at 00:06:20)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: They were cancelled last minute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't — actually (inaudible at 00:06:24). But within 24 hours. I'm usually very strict on it if I reserve that time for you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't reserve it for somebody else. So then there's nothing I can do with that time. So I (inaudible at 00:06:37) to that a lot because I do technically book my hours.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. I get that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But going forward I can't charge you half the session anymore because I'm very protective of my clinical hours. But I'm okay doing that for last week. Just charge you for half the session.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, what was I going to say? Maybe it's beside the point at the moment. (chuckles) Oh you were talking about a bill. I'll make sure to get you a bill. [00:07:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although it may be — well I guess - . You paid for some and you paid for some. So you want bills for the separate ones, the ones you paid for?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: We can split it 50/50.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well you can just (inaudible at 00:07:11) and then we can mark off which ones were paid with the credit card.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:07:12) Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah just mark down the ones that were paid for by credit card.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because my Dad asked me about certain days. They seemed like they were right in a row but it was right when we first started. (inaudible at 00:07:25)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you started. Right. There were a couple of times I think I saw you at least twice in one week.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:07:29) I just want to make sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll get that to you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So her job is ending. The music shop. What you think you've got another two weeks?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. He keeps not being very — I mean it's easy you just move the stuff out of the shop but he keeps (inaudible at 00:07:45) to do work at his house. (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah it's a silly thing. Where it's like we shouldn't be doing whatever. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:07:48)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: The point is our job is ending. So we have to get new jobs. My disease has been acting up like crazy. And it makes me really sick and then I can't get to work. And that's just the way that is. [00:08:01]</p>

<p>And you know I can't get a good job if I feel this way. So. And this is independent of using drugs. I mean I just feel sick. I haven't used — but the point is I just feel sick. And so I don't know what to do about that. (pause at [00:08:24] to 00:08:30) I mean like yesterday you went to work.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I stayed at home because I didn't feel well. But I think very often I sleep like all day and you don't go because I'm asleep. And it's like, "What the hell?" Because we go together. You know?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like Jessica uses my — I'm just saying that's how I feel.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I know but that's because you're the one who wants to be at work.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sometimes I sit there and he doesn't have anything for me to do.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Eventually we're — I mean I get paid more at work. I'm more—He needs me there more. I guess because there is heavy lifting. And I can lift heavier things than Jessica can. I don't know. There are a lot of tasks where it's going to be [Jepardo] and I moving the stuff. [00:09:09]</p>

<p>If it was Jessica and I we couldn't do it. If it was [Jepardo] and Jessica they couldn't do it. That's just how it goes. Some stuff where it needs to be all three of us moving stuff because it's too heavy. But not very often. Anyway.</p>

<p>I guess we're going to get separate jobs. I don't know. It sort of rotates around. Are we going to stay together? And honestly on that whole question I just feel like I'm numb at this point. I mean you know? I think about it all the time but I didn't bring it up. Because it's been enough time. And I just don't want to deal with it. Because I feel like I have all this other shit I have to deal with. It's just one more thing. You know? So it's almost like Jessica, I think we're just going to stay together by default or something. Because I don't want to deal with not being together. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>So it's not good. It's not like positive. It's just neutral. And we had sex some last week. Or whatever. And that was good. I guess. That — Can you do me a favor — that light right there? Turn it off or just — not that one. The other. The halogen one is like killing me. I can't see. No, no. That one. You can turn the other one on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry about that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:10:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So I don't know what to do. I honestly don't have an opinion. Like he said something in here — (inaudible at 00:10:45) bothers me. (pause at [00:10:48] to 00:10:54) Just something about like whether or not — if you and Jessica are going to remain connected, this will be important for her too. It's just really insensitive. It's like I don't know. I don't know. I mean obviously we're going to remain connected because I haven't done anything to separate. [00:11:13]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So you're thinking about being sick and not being able to work. If you worked for yourself then yeah you would still have a job (inaudible at 00:11:22).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Really stupid. No I can't open — I can't start my own business right now. That would be stupid. It's not a good idea for me to do that anyway. So.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It'd be nice to have a job where you worked for somebody but then get your own commissions too. Like — (inaudible 00:11:39).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I guess if I worked for a woodshop then I could also do work in the carpentry (inaudible at 00:11:44) too. (pause at [00:11:46] to 00:11:54) One thing I've been thinking about is just turning the whole thing on it's end because I think one other thing he has to cover under the trust is educational expenses for beneficiaries. And I am one. Just be like, "Yeah I'm going to go back to school." (inaudible at 00:12:10)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do that? [00:12:13]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I'm curious too.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah I think so. I don't know. I'm not really sure. I clearly don't like just — I mean I have a degree. I did well in school before. I got good grades. You know? I'd have to take what — the MSAT's? It's like for a master's school. What do they call it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You take those?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No just for getting into a master's program. You have to take another standardized test.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't feel nearly as intellectually intelligent as I did when I was just leaving college. It's been a decade. I feel actually really not nearly as intelligent as I did before. Whether that's from using drugs for the last ten years or —.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not being (inaudible at 00:13:02).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not being into acting. I don't really know. [00:13:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think one really important question for each of you and the two of you together is whether you can sort of create a more adult life for yourself.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you're self-sufficient and you rely on each other rather than your families. I mean I can't help but think that would only improve your relationship.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Of course it would. I just don't — I just feel too close to a nervous breakdown to do that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And part of that would involve me getting a better job so it's why I planned and need to go to those classes. But I'm sure I can find some locally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are plenty of opportunities. I'm sure you can —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't feel — I've had a series of bullshit things happen to me. And I just don't feel good. I feel like shit. I feel like I'm asleep on my feet. I don't feel happy. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>I feel depressed constantly. I mean — I've got lots of anxiety. I don't feel comfortable with my wife. I feel like my family is — are being real hard asses with me right now. Right when I feel like shit the most. Like I just don't feel good. I feel like shit. I don't feel like doing this. I don't feel like being alive. Honestly. I really don't. I'm just being honest. I don't feel suicidal because that's not what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>You know a huge part of that is what Jessica did. And I don't — it's like the biggest part of it honestly. My Mom dying, honestly I could've taken in stride. It sucks. It's really, really depressing. And sad. The way she died sucks. And I'm sensitive to the fact that Jessica's Mom just died too. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>And we don't have any friends in the area anymore. I don't have trust in my wife anymore. I just don't feel good. Sorry. I don't. I feel like shit. My Dad was just telling me — he's not. He's usually pretty much a hard ass. But like he was just telling me last week — I only talk to him on the phone. He was like most people would not be dealing with this shit as well as you've been dealing with this shit. But I just feel numb. I feel hardened. I feel numb. And I don't feel happy. I don't feel like getting up in the morning. And consequently I don't. I sleep until I wake up. I don't care. I really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have some thoughts about what you're saying. But Jessica, what are you thinking? [00:16:01]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I was thinking about what his Dad said. How other people would be dealing with it. But I would imagine they wouldn't try to deal with it as much. A lot of people maybe. And they'd just keep going to work or something but not really dealing with their problems. I'm not really sure.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm not dealing with anything.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. And then at first when he was talking about trying to think about how it was before I did this to him. So. Yeah I guess we were more motivated at the time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't even know if I want to like get a divorce from Jessica. I don't even know where I'd start. I'd be a wreck. I'd be fucked. [00:17:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's what family can help with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. And clearly they don't care. Or they care but in this very sterile, hands off way. My stepdad said I was a carbon copy of Mom recently. My Mom was totally crazy. Bi-polar. The whole shooting match. Alcoholic. Bi-polar. It's just a really offensive thing for him to say. And it's the best way to make me be that (inaudible at 00:17:27). I don't know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What did your sister have to say about that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's being callous too. So. (pause at [00:17:35] to 00:17:44) Yeah part of me just wants to kill myself so all these fucking people feel that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get that. I get that. That's what — if you hurt yourself maybe people will see what they've done to you. Including Jessica I think.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But just getting fucked up on drugs doesn't do it. People might know —. [00:18:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah it makes me look bad. No one registers that that's me hurting myself. And so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I honestly don't know how either of you, or you as a couple, can feel good about yourselves if you don't— I think that you feel badly that—. You know you feel like you don't have any self-efficacy. Self-confidence in the world about making yourself in the world. I don't know how you could feel better about yourselves until that happens. Until steps are made for that. Feeling like a child who is so dependent on a parent you can't stand is a terrible way to go through life. (pause at [00:18:43] to 00:18:51)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know my Dad and my stepmom have this offer for me to move to Vermont and stay at their house. And they think Jessica and I should have separated. So that's their solution. [00:19:04]</p>

<p>Which just made my stepfather pissed off because where my health insurance would be coming from. I don't have any solution. I don't have any answer. And it's got to come from within me but I don't have it. So whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are you so sure about that?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay maybe it is within me but you know I'm not sure about it. It just doesn't feel like it. (pause at [00:19:24] to 00:19:49)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I agree with you I guess that we should be independent. Or figure out how to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Of course. I mean I intellectually understand that I don't want to be dependent on these people and want to be self-reliant. And all this stuff. [00:20:01]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Jim was talking about weaning you.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Jim was talking about weaning us from his dependence so I would [take it] seriously.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you reacted somewhat more positively to the letter. Or maybe I'm mis - .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I didn't react negatively. It's totally reasonable. I'm 31. There is nothing unreasonable about what's in there. Other than I don't think it's what my Mom would've done. I think he's supposed to be the trustee for my Mom's money. So I'm like this is not how my Mom would be treating me right now. At all.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You said yourself that she was crazy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She was crazy. But whatever. But it's my relationship with my Mom. If I'm dependent on my Mom, then fuck off.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But you're —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I know it's not healthy. I'm just saying.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But she's not here right now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get that. Obviously. This is not how it was supposed to happen. My stepdad is 15 years older than my Mom. He's in his mid to late seventies. He's like 75 or 7 or something. [00:21:06]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like - .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He was supposed to die first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like in your families not much was expected of you? Or somehow your confidence in your abilities was undermined?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. I think they expected a lot of me which disappointed them.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't get her family at all. I understand my family because it's totally fucked up and crazy. It was pretty apparent what was going on.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Did they expect a lot of you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah they expected a lot of me but they're all totally fucked in the head. And giving me mixed messages and multiple households and everything. I didn't get a really consistent upbringing. I don't get it. But maybe I don't know what I'm talking about because I wasn't there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah I think Jessica started by saying that you felt put down when you were crying, which is one of the reasons that you feel you're not able to express sadness. [00:22:06]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well yeah I think that um—maybe in my family. I mean of course my parents loved me and everything but I think they just want to make you feel better. Like right away. I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: They want to make everything okay. All right. Two things. One. In Jessica's family the husband provides. Okay. And I don't think (inaudible at 00:22:32) screw with this. Right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That has been the case.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just the deal.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:22:37) expected it - .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Women stay home. They don't work. And the husband provides. And it's totally weird.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's not that the women stay home and not work. That was my Mom. She had four kids. And my Dad made enough money.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Dude, every single —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Lori has three kids and she was home for a little while. And now she works.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whatever. Actually almost every relationship on both sides of your family is like the man works and the wife doesn't. It's true. [00:23:02]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay. All right. Amanda and Tyson were —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay so Amanda —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: They got divorced. (chuckles) Sue and Carson.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sue and Carson have been — whatever.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:23:10)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And people who still live in Virginia.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh yeah, (inaudible at 00:23:15).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Whatever.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just not even talking about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's a very patriarchal fucking family that's all there is to it. And I love them very much. It's nothing personal. It's just true. And there is this expectation from her Dad that I provide. That's just how it goes. And whether or not you see that being the case that's how I feel.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well he expected me to be less dependent on him if I was married.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I mean in a way that makes sense. Because why would you get married if you're not mature enough to.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. You tell me Jessica. I'm not the one that cheated on you. Fuck face.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that accomplish?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It just helps me vent that anger. [00:24:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean to be hard on you but it's just like —.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just me venting anger. I'm really angry. We haven't gotten in any major arguments. And I haven't been mean to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not trying to find fault.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I know I'm just trying to say it's probably the first time I've insulted in like a week almost?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know. Whenever you're angry. I say you have every right to be.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah I know.<br></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was Jessica talking about sort of the husband providing, is that what made you angry in this instance? I'm just trying to figure out what —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right now? No. No.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh when we were just talking about my family?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You said it like are you mature enough? Like if you're mature enough to get married. And I'm like okay well I was at least mature enough to get married in that I knew I wasn't going to be unfaithful to my wife once I did. I thought that was an easy one. I thought that was like an easy, fucking thing to understand. That speaks to a level of immaturity that I don't understand. I'm sorry. I'm really pissed off about that still. [00:25:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And, and, and but I've no outlet to express it. And with every other stress that's on me, on us, rather I don't feel like it's becoming increasingly unfair for me to hold it over her head. So it's exactly as I said it was going to be weeks ago. Or a month ago. Or whenever it is we started talking about this stuff. Is eventually I get just numb to it and then we just continue to live our lives. And we never actually get dealt with and she'll have gotten away with it basically. It's bullshit. It's all bullshit. I'm —</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't feel like I got away with it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You know, whatever. You would have if you hadn't volunteered it. I'm just angry. I don't have —. (possibly crying) (pause at [00:25:51] to 00:26:13) No one understands how far out on a limb I am. (pause at [00:26:15] to 00:26:24) And basically the only person that could be sympathetic with me is someone that betrayed me. Sympathetic to me and someone who betrayed me. So it's all bullshit. (pause at [00:26:33] to 00:26:58) (moving around in chair and sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jessica when you see Michael like this do you ever want to reach out to him? [00:27:01]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah I feel really bad because I always want to help him but I don't know if he wants me to be close to him when he's angry at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think Michael?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. (crying) I'm just losing it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean I would be hugging him right now if we weren't in this session.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm losing it, okay? (crying) (pause at [00:27:32] to 00:27:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Michael, what do you feel like you're losing?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I — (pause at [00:27:52] to 00:28:13). (crying) I'm fighting the urge to just really be crazy. Okay? [00:28:15] (pause in audio till 00:28:38)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Sometimes I feel like I should provide for him more. So like right now maybe if he was married to somebody that could provide for him it'd be easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Provide for him how?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know so he wasn't dependent on - .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: In other words like we're equally dysfunctional. We're fucked. Both of our families have basically said they think we should get divorced. And then Jessica cheats on me repeatedly basically saying she thinks we should divorced. [00:29:08]</p>

<p>It's like I'm the only person that has — (pause at [00:29:11] to 00:29:32). We probably just should. Okay? This is obviously not good for either of us. I'm no good for her and she's clearly no good for me. So fuck it. But I don't even know where to start. I don't know if I would survive it. Okay? I'm in the most untenable position right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean survive it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't think I could survive us getting divorced. Okay? I think I'd kill myself or something. Right? Like I said I feel like I'm in a completely untenable, between a rock and a hard place, totally fucked position in my life. [00:30:13]</p>

<p>(pause till 00:30:21)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you feel like you need Jessica and at the moment you resent her?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Sure. Right. (sniffs) (pause at [00:30:29] to 00:30:36)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What do you need me for?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Maybe that's the whole thing. Maybe I don't need her. Maybe she just sucks. (pause at [00:30:40] to 00:30:46) She just fucked up my life for the last ten years. I should just get over it. And kick her out or whatever. You should go down to Virginia on Friday and stay there.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You can't tell me where to go. [00:31:02]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I can't tell you what to do. I don't really feel that way. I don't actually feel that way. But—I just don't have any answers. Okay? (sniffs) I feel like if I go and get a job I'm just going to get sick and I'm not going to be able to be there. And I'm going to get fired immediately.</p>

<p>And the way I am with our current employer —I've worked with him for over ten years—He'll put up with me being sick. He's okay if I don't show up for a couple of days on end. Most places are not like that. So I think I should just go back to school. I think it would be way better. Just go back to school full time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That'd be cool.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It'd be cool. (shifts in seat) But it seems like kind of a cop out because my stepdad would be forced to provide for me during that time period. And maybe he wouldn't even pay for my college. [00:32:08]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah but it would help you get (inaudible at 00:32:09).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I need to look at the fucking terms of the trust to see if he'd even pay for it. See even if the terms of the trust specify he has to he might not anyway.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:32:17)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I feel it'd be copping out. I'm going back to school just so he'll continue to pay for it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But that's hard work. You'd figure out once you were there so it's not really copping out right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's hard work but it's not as bad as going to work. Schedule your classes when you want them and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like — yeah. I mean there's still structure. It's less structure than a regular job but there's still structures.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get that. I was (inaudible at 00:32:41) in college. In school. (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was I going to say? Is your disease the way it is really barring you from regular employment?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It fucks me. I can't do things. I get sick. Really, really sick. No one understands. It's not like I have cancer or something. But I've got a chronic disease. [00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know a lot about your disease.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And my doctors have said this is probably going to be the thing that kills you someday. I mean it precipitates colon cancer and a whole bunch of other horrible things. So —.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ever have surgery for it?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. So I have doctors — I have so many doctors telling, "You have a chronic disease. And it's really horrible and everything. And it's going to cause you a lot of pain but oh we're not going to give you anything for the pain. And you're expected to live a normal life because you should be able to live a normal life." I have horrible, arthritic pain. I'm just fucked. Constantly. What do I have to do for these people? I go and actually have myself declared — have a disability? Fucking hell. I don't want that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have periods where—maybe not symptom free but sort of that you can —. [00:34:07]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Occasionally. Yes. Half the time. I don't know. Half the time isn't good enough. Like this morning I hadn't eaten anything today.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:34:20) doing so well last week.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah but I'm just trying to say it's like most mornings I can't eat anything before noon time. Because it just makes me feel sick. The only times that I feel better is when I have an opiate. Once I take an opiate the pain goes away. It makes me constipated so I don't feel like I have the runs constantly. And it gives me an appetite. I'm not allowed to have opiates.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What about smoking weed? That could (inaudible at 00:34:54).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible) I can't smoke pot. If I smoke pot it's going to make me more dysfunctional. I can't work a job and smoke pot. I don't smoke pot like that. I can't. I mean I used to be a pothead. [00:35:06]</p>

<p>That's how I graduated from college — being a pothead. (laughs) I can't do that anymore. It makes me feel like a space cadet. I can't smoke pot. Although it is supposed to be really good for this disease. Settles your stomach. Makes you have an appetite. (pause at [00:35:24] to 00:35:33) I hate this all being about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's all about you?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I don't like — maybe. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's all about him, Jessica?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's not all about me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: We've been concentrating on him for the last (inaudible at 00:35:48). And that's okay with me but that's not—.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Talking about me for the last —.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But this seems like a pretty prominent dynamic in your relationship. That you tend to be sort of — sometimes I see that Jessica is kind of shut down. Or almost bewildered and not sure what to do. [00:36:08]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's what I'm saying. It'd be better if I could (inaudible at 00:36:14) sometime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Then that person can make money. I mean not that money is like — .</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah money is the fucking end all.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well no. Independence is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean if money was the end all and you just got endless money from your stepfather — I mean I don't actually think that would solve anything. And if anything it could make your situation even worse.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Because you have to feel like you can do things yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It's the same reason why like really poor people would rather be given a job than a hand out. Right? (inaudible at 00:37:01)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I need a job, okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. No I get that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: If it weren't for the support we'd be homeless. Okay? So—. [00:37:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I have a couple of thoughts. One thought is — you know the one thing that you guys lack—like when you were saying Michael that you feel you have nothing. The one thing that you guys lack is a real strong sense that you have yourselves to rely on. And regardless of what else happens or what other shit you have to deal with or whatever else people do to you that really fucks you up; that you can rely on yourself.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah I don't feel like I have any self-reliance at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think both of you feel that way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I can't trust myself to get out of bed in the morning. I can't trust myself to do anything. We have papers everywhere. We don't have — I don't even know who I owe money to. Let alone how much. We have so many little anxieties. Like our storage unit ... We must owe like $1200 rent there. I haven't paid rent there in a year. [00:38:07]</p>

<p>At some point we're going to get — my stepdad said, "Avoid crises." But my whole life is a crisis. Every five minutes it's a crisis. What the fuck does he know? Everything is set for him. He's living off the interest from my fucking money. Fuck you. (shifts in chair) Basically. Do I feel in entitled to that money? Fuck yeah I do.</p>

<p>Sorry. I'm exactly the same my Mom was. My Mom felt entitled to that money that she eventually inherited her whole life. She felt like she got a shit deal. Whether or not my Mom did — I know she fucked me as a kid. So —. Basically he doesn't want to spend the money because it makes the interest less and that's what he lives off of. It's just self-serving bullshit and I'm sick of it. [00:39:14]</p>

<p>He's telling me about how he went to Europe in 2001 on a vacation by himself and cheated on my Mom. I'm like why can't my wife and I go to Europe for just like a week? Just a week. Just to get away from everything. Can we please just get away from everything and not have to worry about anything for a week? That's all I want.</p>

<p>For just a second. To have a break. If we go to Europe I don't have to worry about anything for just a minute. (pause at [00:39:44] to 00:39:56) And then when this old fuck dies I can do whatever the fuck I want. Pretty much. Within reason. I know it's supposed to be nest egg but it's still nearly a million dollars. It's like I know it's a lot of money. It is a lot of money but it's not that much money. You have to be earning money too. [00:40:10] (pause till 00:40:19) If we never spent a dime of it the interest on it would be $40,000 a year.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But he uses it so it doesn't add to it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: [Point?]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well I'm just saying —.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm saying when we have the principal the interest off of it is more money than we make in a year right now anyway.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh after.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah but then the money that you get is subsidized. I mean treatment — (inaudible at 00:40:42).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get all of this. I get all of this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not—</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I'm just trying to say there are certain hypocrisies in our fucking world that I can't get my head around. I never have. Not just in my personal world. It's the world at large. It's such bullshit. It's all such bullshit. Systemically. It's all such bullshit. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>I don't even begin to understand like how the system works. Like we're (inaudible at 00:41:05) microcosm and our little life and whatever is going on. Like I have way bigger — like fucking epistemological issues with the way the world works that make me fucking crazy. (pause at [00:41:18] to 00:41:27)</p>

<p>I mean like I live in existential dread. I'm not trying to sound all dramatic. But I do. I'm not a happy person. It's bullshit. (pause at [00:41:39] to 00:41:47) That's another thing about having babies. I don't know if this is the fucking right place to bring a kid. Right? I'm not trying to be like — I mean I still want to have a kid with you if that's what you really want. And that's what I want too or whatever. [00:42:01]</p>

<p>But it's just like between you cheating on me and everything else that's fucked up in the world — dude. It's really hard. And everything else is so fucked up. And our lives are so fucked up. So basically what we need to do is get our lives in order.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And then in my little corner everything will be neat and tidy.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: At least it'll be easier to deal with.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean fucking people starving to death all over the place.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It'll be easier to deal with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, here's one of the big questions for you as a couple. Can the two of you actually serve as a support and encouragement for each other? To better your lives? And feel a greater sense of autonomy and self-empowerment.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't understand how someone could be supportive of me and just a few months ago cheat on me. It's just bullshit to me. And by the way, when we're meeting with you, this is when I say all these things. Okay? [00:43:09]</p>

<p>I don't usually say this stuff when it's just the two of us. I want to make everything all right when it's just the two of us. The last week has probably been a good week. Relatively speaking. We haven't been arguing. We've been relatively happy. Relatively. Then we get in here, and I'm like, yeah Jessica this is how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't think that you're not thinking about it all week. (pause at [00:43:35] to 00:43:43)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (possibly crying) There's not enough time when you have to work and do everything else to feel this way. It's really fucking unfair of you. When you were supposed to be getting a job. It's just bullshit. It's just bullshit. Is this done yet?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop in a moment. Why did you feel the need to stop right now? Because you're so upset? [00:44:03]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't have any answers. And this hasn't gotten me any closer. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the few things you're saying — there are dilemmas that you're thinking about that I think on some deep, existential level just don't have any answers. Like why is the world unfair?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah I get that. It's a silly thing to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I do think —</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But after feeling this horrible for these different personal reasons like just magnifies that shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. I totally get it. But the question is you want answers from Jessica. And I think that that's important. And I think Jessica actually wants to give you some answers too. I do think that one of the things that prevents that from happening is, as I've said, this dynamic where, Jessica, you really get shut down. Sometimes you just look bewildered almost. And I want to know more about what goes on for you so I can help bring you out a little bit more.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't want a wife that's bewildered by me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not even sure if I was making the point that she's bewildered BY you. [00:45:05]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Or — I don't know. I don't want someone that's (inaudible at 00:45:07) like they're in headlights all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that how you feel about Jessica?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're angry. You guys have got to get to your individual therapists. I don't — I mean the worst thing that I could do is play this parental role saying, "You should do this."</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No I don't want that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That — yeah. But I do feel strongly — get to your individual therapists. I understand last week was a — but I just think you guys can do so much more than you're doing now. I really do. In my heart of hearts I believe that. I don't say that to everybody.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:36)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I really believe that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:38) for each other.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:45:39) capable in certain ways. Like (inaudible) people that accomplish a lot. (inaudible at 00:45:46)</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know we're not. I know we're not insensitive, bad people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you also have a lot of capacities that you guys are just not drawing on.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah that's what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the question is how—</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot. A lot of adaptive capacities that you're not drawing on. Either not drawing on or (inaudible). [00:46:04]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Is it because we're not being forced to because of the support from family?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I don't have specific answers about that in particular. But I do think that's something that I want to continue talking with you about. But we do need to stop. So next week. So you're not here Monday. And so morning works better for you, right? Is that the case?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I'll let you know what I have in the morning. I know next Wednesday I could meet at 10:50.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Jessica you're not going to be here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not going — what are you—.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No I'll be here Wednesday actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah next Monday. So is 10:50 a possibility? Is that early enough in the day?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: What do you think?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (whispers) That's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Wednesday. 10:50. Okay. So we'll do that. I'll e-mail the confirmation and I will also e-mail you the statement in the next day or so.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll e-mail for the few that have not been paid yet but just a whole invoice.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I need to print it out and mail it to him.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He has to have things printed out. He probably wouldn't even let me e-mail.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He wouldn't let me e-mail. He doesn't even trust me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well he doesn't know how to download things. I tried to show him.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well he just doesn't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay I will see you guys next week. I hope you have a good Easter. Okay?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thanks I appreciate it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Thanks. Okay.</p>

<p>THERPIST: Take care. [00:47:17] [End of audio]</p>

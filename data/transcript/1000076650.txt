<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Today is February 10, 1971. This is Carrie's sixth session with Tyler and the last session is mislabeled. It's label is fourth session, it's actually the fifth session. 11:10 and we're going to go to 11:45. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT (Inaudible) 0:00:59.6 Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT  I was in you teaching and I had this class and we were doing improvisation to get into drama and I had been very successful with the first period class. The second period class was two people having to do anything at all and I just felt that you know I might as well as let them do what they want to do rather than sitting there, there's not listening anyway. I just there always sort of sitting in a corner and I just like they're talking about me constantly. I know this one girl, she just cannot stand me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR How old are they.</p>

<p>PATIENT These are juniors in high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay. Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT So we were doing these improvisations and it wasn't working out, I wasn't quite (inaudible) 0:01:38.0 more uptight now than at the time instead of less so all of a sudden I was just so sick that I grabbed this girl, there was music on, people were doing it so only she (inaudible) 0:01:49.2 get the hell out of my room. Just like that. Well, I felt so guilty afterwards, it was just horrible, there was someone observing, I don't care about that, but I just felt so, she wasn't the one anyway but it should have been. I had no idea what I did during the whole period, I know they are bullshitting me all the time in there, I just think she's getting off easy, she's (inaudible) 0:02:15.9 stuff like that. But that's how I want to run my class. I don't what you know the (inaudible) 0:02:21.7 thing. All right. So after class there were these two girls, the other girl when I hit her she went oh shit you know like almost I knew it was coming. So this other girl went out you know and the other girl said she ain't going to come back ever. So that just of blew my mind (inaudible) 0:02:39.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You really feel (inaudible) 0:02:44 Is that a big thing for you? Like you really believe she's not coming back anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT I did I guess then. I saw (inaudible) 0:02.55.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay, but at the moment I'm just saying you felt like you really did it. That was it. It's all over.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, I really and I didn't even think of myself. You see that's what I've done. I didn't think of myself. I felt guilty about saying hell. I say it, it's part of my (inaudible) 0:03:13.7. Really going to get out on my ear. You know then the next topic came into my mind. And then I could</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Fear of losing control.</p>

<p>PATIENT Well I did, I completely blew up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT I mean I went from doing nothing and tolerating everything, being this loose personal thing, to grabbing this girl and saying get the hell out of my class. A principal I mean that blew my mind because I had this concept that it's not my class, it's self directed learning, but really underneath it all I don't feel that apparently. Well I sort of exploded so I (inaudible) 0:03:42.4 this girl who I had there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I don't know what (inaudible) 0:03:45.7 I think I get where you were. Oh okay I'll write it down go ahead</p>

<p>PATIENT So (inaudible) 0:03:55.0 I talked with this girl the other one who wasn't kicked out and should get kicked out and the first day I came in there she slept when she and I first came in so she wouldn't look at me so why don't you sit down and discuss this do you want to do do you want to (inaudible) 0:04:12.8 She looked at me and says you know no one likes you. You know that was the first thing she said, no one likes you. For some reason it really did bother the hell out of me but then I figured you know that's really understandable I didn't like my teachers either when I was in high school. Well this sort of blew her mind kind of and then she says if you think I'm going to kiss your ass I'm not. I said you know you think I'm going to keep on kissing your ass so you know why did you ever start kicking my ass you know. She said I'm sick of the whole thing, you're all hypocrites and then she said you think I want why should I help you know what is going on when a student teacher comes in, you don't know anything about you know I want a real teacher. Well she kind of threw all this shit on me and I guess I handled it all right (inaudible) 0:05:01.9 and she said I would rather be in here so I gave her three alternatives. Well I hated myself during the whole thing. I mean I just I cannot I don't like what I am, I don't like teaching because I it's like</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:05:21.8 you threw yourself into the fire and you're burning now. (inaudible) 0:05:27.1 and all that. That's like partly me and partly you. I'm sure you're in a very hard situation. None of those, you're going to make a lot of mistakes and in all of the things (inaudible) 0:05:45.6 whether you're going to make, you don't have a lot of right decisions to make. Most of the things you're going to do in that situation are going to be wrong. That's the nature of that situation. </p>

<p>PATIENT You see I can't handle that. I can't handle being wrong. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're going to feel wrong (inaudible) 0:06:02.6</p>

<p>PATIENT Well you see, I feel guilty all the time. It's an incredible strange feeling. I felt guilty about those kids in there talking about premarital sex and I haven't slept with someone. I feel guilty, I felt like a hypocrite. I felt guilty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR We're going to get into that guilty (inaudible) 0:06:22.8. Close your eyes for a minute. Try to get into that. Don't push it away just stay with it okay. Let it intensify. See if anything comes to it, what comes to it if anything. Don't try to push it just let it come. Images. Words. Anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT I feel like I'm drowning you know like that feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:072:02.1 deeper and deeper. Feels more suffocating.</p>

<p>PATIENT I get really scared I feel frightened sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:07:14.8 why you're scared.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:07:22.2 do the same thing with the fright. See what the fright is like. Where is it in your body</p>

<p>PATIENT It's all, it goes up one arm </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Up your arm. Okay. Stay with that, stay with your</p>

<p>PATIENT Now I get real now I'm getting really tense I feel my stomach going around. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay concentrate. What is it doing? Around and around what is it</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah so you know I feel like I'm getting compressed a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Push pressed in to find </p>

<p>PATIENT No. Yeah and also like I'm completely misunderstood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay I'm misunderstanding you now. All right. (inaudible) 0:08:39.6 or am I misunderstanding or are you feeling misunderstood. That's important.</p>

<p>PATIENT No I feel misunderstood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR By</p>

<p>PATIENT Well it's like I just sort of feel misunderstood a lot of the times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I want to know though if I'm getting where you are at.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah you are</p>

<p>COUNSELOR How are we connecting.</p>

<p>PATIENT I wasn't doing very well feeling into my body </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay so that's not too good. </p>

<p>PATIENT It's not too easy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay. Okay that's not important. Let's let's forget it then. We'll try that again sometime okay. We don't have to do that now.</p>

<p>PATIENT All right. You know so that was the sound I just like I take it like intellectually I know not to take it personally while I mean (inaudible) 0:09:38.6 she gave me all this shit and I you know you see like I know how so easy it is to act and I don't want to act in a way that they are also looking for and when she said hypocrite I understood it personally perfectly because that it's like there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR That's how you're feeling, you're feel there.</p>

<p>PATIENT I feel yeah I feel like that to an extent because see I don't even I guess I don't really feel like I want to even be in it like I don't know if education is where I think it is a whole pile of shit I honestly do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:10:18.9</p>

<p>PATIENT Like I don't</p>

<p>COUNSELOR When she says that to you when a kid says that you and (inaudible) 0:10:24.8 at this (inaudible) 0:10:25.5 thing</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:10:25.7 yeah and (inaudible) 0:10:26.6 But you see and also you see they don't want me to (inaudible) 0:10:31.6 this other girl I kicked out I saw her today. She said to me things like I didn't plan to give you a chance the first time I saw you. She said you know you come in here she says you know she says I know you from New Jersey. You're from the east coast and I don't know how the hell she found out. I know you're from the east coast and she says you'll go back you'll go back to what you know white middle class surburbia she said and we want (inaudible) 0:11:01.1 to know it's not all going to be a bed of roses. I said my god lady my life isn't a bed of roses honey and I almost wanted to I really wanted I wanted to hit her. She had a hell of a nerve thinking that my life was some great big bed of roses. Hell I had you know wealth stuck to me and you know I don't want to do any of that stuff and I don't want to be a teacher like that and I want to swear and I want to kick and I can't stand a lot of them you know and I can't get into it you know I can't get into it at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're hurting</p>

<p>PATIENT Well I just yes I am. The whole thing. Yeah. Well I guess that's it you know and then you come in with just damn pat statements for everything. Well Jennifer you just can't take it it personally. Steve what a ridiculous thing to say to someone. That's why I don't feel like talking to anyone about a lot of things because I guess I don't feel like talking about personal things like how I feel about people in fact we talked about that once before and talking about someone and how you feel. I just don't get that damn stupid pat things like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You remind me of where I am. I think I'm at a similar place but I think we're actually doing it differently but I think you feel like you got clobbered yesterday, is that right.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay. Yesterday faculty meeting. I was involved in it (inaudible) 0:12:27.2 It was a vote on whether to continue a clinical program of mine or not. The vote went ten to two. Ten against. Two for. Something like that. Two for were myself and a gentleman. What it was it was a personal cut It would have been really a personal slap, a gentleman and it would been at me except that they don't recognize me (inaudible) 0:13:03.7 (chuckling) Okay so that's why I am half a hour late today like it just knocked me out. I couldn't even get up this morning. Forgot to set the alarm well the only reason it went off is because it went off yesterday you know. I'm lucky I'm here, I'm here by accident at all and right afterward it felt like (inaudible) 0:13:28.2 relieved but when I got home wow it knocked me out. I could barely but that's what it was like. I think that you are in a similar situation somehow. Only out of the dimension of being clobbered. </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR But I think that the clobbering for you may be coming more from the inside. I hear yourself hitting yourself. So you're hitting from the outside. Okay. I see yourself now from hitting your ownself, beating yourself up a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT You know I always end up doing that no matter what. I always end up beating myself literally all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR How come</p>

<p>PATIENT I guess I don't like myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR What a pity. What a waste</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Well okay more about that. Why this, do you know what I mean by that how you didn't hear me right what I was saying that's too bad because you really missed but that's not important how I feel that's how I feel but it's important why you feel that way, you know what's under that. Why should I see you so differently? What is it come on. Why shouldn't I like you. What are you hiding from me?</p>

<p>PATIENT Well you know, that's different you know that's different sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR How is that different?</p>

<p>PATIENT It just feels different. I don't feel like you know I don't like you know you take me (inaudible) 0:15;08.1 you know it's kind of how I feel about a lot of things. I guess I feel like you have to do that with every person you meet up with forget it but then they don't want to hear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. You have to be more assertive.</p>

<p>PATIENT Like I don't want to play a role with all these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You don't have to. How about just keeping quiet that's hard for me. That's really hard. I have a hard time. Do you have a hard time doing that too? (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT What? Being quiet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. Like the next time someone says something to you you have two choices. One how you feel saying that. That could be dangerous stuff. That kind of thing is being hypocritical instead of something else. But maybe you could just well what I have to learn to do is to say I think I'm not going to add to that (inaudible) 0:16:04.9 I'll see you later. Right. Now talk to me like we're both being caught for self exposure. I mean I get how to feel. You felt like that (inaudible) 0:16:19.0 getting mad at that girl and throwing her ass out. But that's a whole bunch of other issues kind of taking you back to the authoritarian freedom issue like you were worried about whether you really were authoritarian. Just modeling freedom authoritarian issues. Wasn't that an issue you brought up?</p>

<p>PATIENT No. That was an issue yeah. (inaudible) 0:16:48.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So what was that for? I think my whole thing I think there's a conflict on that for you or that is an issue you are struggling with now. That's not the primary one. The guilt is another issue that you brought up. Which way do you which one should we talk about? What issue, pick an issue. </p>

<p>PATIENT All right. Not being able to say how I feel sort of. You know let me get this out right. Like I was talking, do you ever, like I feel like I'm tuning out to people lately a real lot like I was saying something to this girl I was talking to her and she said oh we were talking about freedom or something like that and bringing up you know kids and she said it was unfair to bring them up like (inaudible) 0:17:51.0 and stuff like that and I was saying what I was thinking was that's not really true but just when they realize you know what their freedom is versus what's going to be restricted on them and that they are going to have a big hassle (inaudible) 0:18:06.5 but they understand from the beginning that they are going to explode when they get to their first big hassle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:18:15.2</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT Well as I am saying this to her I just want to say to her oh hell and leave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Oh I see another issue. </p>

<p>PATIENT That's what I'm talking about, tuning out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay and she says this to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah well it was just sort of talking, just sort of talking I feel like she was, it wasn't genuine. I didn't feel it wasn't genuine and I didn't get the hell up there at 9:15 in the morning and drag my body over there but I said I would and she said we would discuss this book she read she doesn't remember any of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR She doesn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT She doesn't she never finished reading any of them. She doesn't care about that. I can't explain how I feel. Like I'm </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Pulled apart.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. All these things I just. Yeah. You know it's really hard to take first of all it was hard to take off for her and the girl saying I don't like you no one likes you. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Someone said that to me (inaudible) 0:19:40.3 Like I've managed to alienate the faculty, staff and most of my (inaudible) 0:19:49.9 Okay. There's some major exceptions. (inaudible) 0:20:02.5 My problem let me do my problem, my problem is (inaudible) 0:20:15.3 by definition and my norms are not like building a rocket to the moon we're building way of being with each other. It's kind of like my image is I've been invited into the Catholic Church and I go in there and I say I'm not so sure about this praying business. (laughing) I feel like that's what I'm doing is going into the Catholic Church and saying hey I think I might have a better way. It's was like listening to (inaudible) 0:20:46.0 put on your beads and listen and (inaudible) 0:20:53.6 in your local Catholic Church. Then I shouldn't be surprised why I say anything when I get some noise on my personal style. I'm torn. </p>

<p>PATIENT Do you doubt your personal style?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. I hope to get into it. On the one hand when you are taking so many blows that can be painful (inaudible) 0:21:31.0 today tonight or tomorrow I would start seriously looking for another job. Hopefully it won't be (inaudible) 0:21:39.6 </p>

<p>PATIENT When? (inaudible) 0:21:46.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I can't tell whether at this point I'm shaky. I've become modest all of a sudden questioning. I can't tell what to (inaudible) 0:21:59.1 become part of the problem. Also, (inaudible) 0:22:03.6 my Dean called me last night and his thing what he said to me was now I can't tell whether my talking with him helped to destroy the thing we were both trying to build okay but not only you're lost but you feel like you have because of you</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It may be the right to (inaudible) 0:22:30.8 I don't think they are right on the issues but maybe we helped to destroy something or I helped to destroy something and I don't think so, I don't think so. At least for me I didn't speak at that meeting until I knew it was all over. I was one of the last people to speak and I said what I thought it was. Nobody agreed with me. (inaudible) 0:23:11.7 </p>

<p>PATIENT Well how did you feel afterwards?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I felt it would be kind of hard to fight. I mean I came here I knew it was a losing fight. (inaudible) 0:23:39.2 The only reason I came here was to (inaudible) 0:23:42.5 I kind of wanted to stay in New York (inaudible) 0:23.44.0 so (inaudible) 0:23:52.1 </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:23:55.2 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR I had a couple of feelings for you. (inaudible) 0:24:03.3 I felt it was a personal loss yesterday (inaudible) 0:24:07.3 I contributed to the problem too maybe I don't know. This is the first time in my three years (inaudible) 0:24:25.3 </p>

<p>PATIENT You all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:24:28.2 As far as I remember maybe I'm exaggerating to make a good point but (inaudible) 0:24:39.1 (chuckling) but that's where I'm at. </p>

<p>PATIENT Do a reissue</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah let's do a reissue. </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:24:46.3 when I listen to you know this different (inaudible) 0:24:50.0 I think you are really sure about what you are doing and you may be unsure about what you were trying to do even though they destroyed it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah right</p>

<p>PATIENT You could say you know they're bizarre or right on or (inaudible) 0:25:05.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR I'm shaken I mean I'm somewhat shaken. I'm not so sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:25:15.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Well every time I get under (inaudible) 0:25:18.4 when I go into myself and I get underneath it (inaudible) 0:25:22.9 Right now I'm not into it. Right now I'm holding I'm suspending. I'll have to wait to go inside myself for a few hours (inaudible) 0:25:35:6. I do that occasionally every time I lose I mean the battles I have been losing recently here have been incredible I mean chop chop chop. Every time I go into myself I still (inaudible) 0:25:51.0 I still come up on the bottom end of another thought. You know. </p>

<p>PATIENT See I don't go into myself. When I know that I do I jump around so I don't have to. I like I never really went into why the hell I want to teach. I didn't really I wanted start my own school (inaudible) 0:26:17.0 teaching. Pipe dreams I guess</p>

<p>COUNSELOR What's wrong with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT That's all I have I think. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR A lot of people (inaudible) 0:26:26.3</p>

<p>PATIENT I'm an asshole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're rotten. </p>

<p>PATIENT I need you. (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:26:40.8</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 026:43.3 real rotten now</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Get right down to it. So what's the difference between you now and yesterday before was it yesterday that you did all those asshole things? And now how are things different? How are you worse off.</p>

<p>PATIENT How am I worse now. Well in a way like at the time I feel I'm better off sort of because you see I can very easily now shift the blame on my whiteness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Shift the blame to who to who?</p>

<p>PATIENT Underneath it all I mean I think if you're a good teacher (inaudible) 0:27.46.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:27:52.7 Not that easy not that easy. You're doing (inaudible) 0:27:55.0 good people wouldn't touch you (inaudible) 0:28:04.0 a black problem not white. </p>

<p>(inaudible) 0:28:15.9 Here's a guy who did a workshop on institutional race and managers for whites. Here's a guy who worked in Harlem as a (inaudible) 0:28:31.9 street worker for two years. A little Jewish boy (inaudible) 0:28:35.9 okay. He's done a lot of it for years on blacks. He would not touch a all black problem mainly a black problem for all the tea in China because he is white. Couldn't do it. That's a reality you know that's a reality. Not that it can't be broken but if you think you are going to do that in student teaching you're crazy. You're crazy and you belong in here talking to me. Okay. Now argue with me tell me I'm wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT Well I mean about that I just feel myself strong you know I think that it's a cop on both sides because it's (inaudible) ultimately for any sort of racism in all changes of society whites are going to have to interact with blacks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay well what's the percentage of blacks in your class?</p>

<p>PATIENT 100</p>

<p>COUNSELOR 100 percent?</p>

<p>PATIENT Right (inaudible) 0:29:50.9 I wanted it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:29:55.9 And you are saying to me that (chuckling) (inaudible) 0:30:04.9 </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:30:05.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Listen you were doing this a long time before you met me. Don't blame me. (chuckling) All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT So that's another thing. You Jennifer you get yourself into all this, see that's it, that's it. I get myself into all these situations (inaudible) 0:30:28.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You push yourself. You have a characteristic that I have. Okay. Let me tell you what it is. It's hard for me to say but it starts from my nitty gritty gut. I do the same thing. It's that your na�ve. You are really na�ve in some situations. You don't believe that?</p>

<p>PATIENT No. I don't think I really am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR The best the most experienced of mices the most student centered the most liberal left people that are working in the area that you are working in wouldn't touch that thing with a ten foot pole only because they are white. You can blame virtually all of your problems just on the fact that you are white and where you are na�ve is to think that these personal characteristics of yourself are why you aren't making it in something the way you want to with those kids. Naivet� comes around thinking that you can do something without getting all this noise and like you are going to win those kids over. You can't because of your whiteness today is what I am saying. Do you see what the naivet� (inaudible) 0:31:40.7</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR As a result of that what you do is you start blaming yourself okay. That is my 25 my two cent interpretation for the day and I think it's right on. Think about it. You are in a hard situation (inaudible) 0:32:03.2</p>

<p>PATIENT Well I don't know why I have this incredible feeling that it's easy for me to (inaudible) 0:32:08.7 to know (inaudible) 0:32:11.1 she's right on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:32:15.3 right. (chuckling) You are a dramatist. I mean for you (inaudible) going on stage. You aren't just walking through life, you're in there, you're really,</p>

<p>PATIENT You see</p>

<p>COUNSELOR True</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah right and I have incredible ego about certain things like that. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Click click click. Right</p>

<p>PATIENT (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Right that's how you are. That's okay. That's beautiful I think personally. Will you own that?</p>

<p>PATIENT I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:32:54.6</p>

<p>PATIENT I can't stand being guilty, I'm sick of being guilty about a lot of things I do. I really am sick of that and I can rationalize myself out of it and stuff like that. Plus last night do you know what happened to me last night? (inaudible) 0:33:11.4 I was at a table with friends and so a couple turned around and started talking to us and the guy I was with is a complete ignoring me like I wasn't worth anything it was only the guy that was worth anything and that just sort of . Why am I throwing that out I don't know but it just made me angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR That's more of the same but I don't think you see it as the same. I mean that it strikes me as the same. Your in a position where you're put down for a characteristic that is not functional to what you are doing but as a prejudice that is. On the one hand you can't teach (inaudiable) 0:33:55.4 black but on the other hand you get you're not worthy because you're a woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You are in a very oppressive system wench.</p>

<p>PATIENT So what do I do about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's going to feel like you are failing a lot. Okay. Like you're not coming across enough and it has nothing to do with you personally. You are not bad because you're having those struggles. That's the world you are in. Stop thinking you are so fucking crazy. Do you see what I mean? You are somehow beating yourself for your protection. You want to be in a situation where you are really loved and to be who you are is to be loved. You want a family like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay. And you wanted that family (inaudible) 0:35:01.4 Okay. You interpret that as being like you are the bad person who is making a family not work. Ain't true. Ain't true. You ain't got that much power. You know like it's a hard situation. You didn't create that. You are not God nor (inaudible) 0:35:30.3 (chuckling) So funny. Okay. That's my wrap another two cent wrap. You are in a hard like I see such a hard situation and beating yourself and that's naivet�. Okay. That's like there is a wall there, you don't notice it and you run your head into it and you wake up and say hmm I really blew it I put the wall up and you didn't put the wall up. (inaudible) 0:36:08.4 That doesn't resolve the guilt I understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT Why is that yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR It probably has to do with life something early you have got to get into your family a little bit, what was it like.</p>

<p>PATIENT Oh I yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR What was it like. You got that guilt in your family probably, some situation. What happened? What was your old man like? What did he make you do? </p>

<p>PATIENT You know a lot (inaudible) 0:36:38.6 Like I said before just pushed like pushed out to be the best in everything we did. I remember when were little we were in these races and we all </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You never got made it did you? I mean no matter what you did it was never enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT No, I yeah. I never felt it was enough, I always never felt it was enough and we never got to the straight praise kind of when it was done. That was dad I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Like when you won you never said well that's really fantastic but it was more like sort of well (inaudible) 0:37:13.5?</p>

<p>PATIENT Or next year it's going to be tougher. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. Right. Never given credit for what you really were. </p>

<p>PATIENT So you see I'm never satisfied for what I am. That scares the death out of me. I'm never satisfied with who I am. You know (inaudible) 0:37:34.4 That's horrible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR How big of a wave do you have to make?</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:37:46.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:37:47.2</p>

<p>PATIENT I know there will always be one bigger. You know there was this English course I took. (Inaudible) 0:38:00.1 I got an A in the course you know and I got back my paper yesterday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Halt, halt. (Inaudible) 0:38:15.2 That struck me as being an important part. When you did something well you didn't get the praise you deserve. Instead you got ignored, (inaudible) 0:38:30.0, deflection onto something else, what happened when you really deserved all those things. Were you just ignored or how do you interpret what happened to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah, it was like ignored (inaudible) 0:38:45.3 It wasn't that big anyway so it was like</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Oh it was diminished? </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah it was (inaudible) diminished.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You felt put down. </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah it was built up and then when I got it was (inaudible) 0:39:01.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR And therefore</p>

<p>PATIENT It was always, I feel like I was always (inaudible) 0:39:06.4 done it better and that was always brought up somehow. I mean it was just</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Look at so and so.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. Did you see so and so. So and so did it so much better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR No wonder I mean. I'm relating now to like (inaudible) 0:39:26.3 now (inaudible) 0:39:29.1. It's very hard (inaudible) 0:39:33.6 really cut out a task for you (inaudible) 0:39:34.4 if you can do that one maybe you finally get the praise. I mean you picked an impossible situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:39:41.5 White in a black school (inaudible) 0:39:44.3 I was going to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You picked an impossible situation you know what I mean. I don't know what that means okay. What are you doing from one to two or one to one thirty?</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:40:00.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Can you hold for fifteen minutes and let me leave for fifteen minutes okay? (Inaudible) 0:40:07.5 and we'll do some more okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT All right. Do you what me to come back?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So now what? What happens? All right. </p>

<p>PATIENT We're talking about you know why I feel a need to achieve and I'm not into (inaudible) 0:40:35.0 and also like there's a real lot of competition (inaudible) 0:40:42.5 for a girl in my family and my oldest sister has done very very well academically but (inaudible) 0:40:57.7 I always felt that any time I did anything wrong especially in school she said because I was her sister. (Inaudible) 0:41:06.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR So you're going in to that (inaudible) 0:41:09.9 you're really trekking on your own, you're really by yourself. That's what it sounds like to me. Why are teaching at a black school? See what I mean? What you said with your sister it sounds like before it was you were making it because it was your sister. Here's one situation (inaudible) 0:41:36.9 See what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT No yeah no I was thinking (inaudible) 0:41:44.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I don't know. Does it fit? Say it out loud. Does it fit? Try saying I'm in that classroom and prove I can do it without my sister. Say that. (Inaudible) 0:41:57.5</p>

<p>PATIENT I was in that classroom proving to myself I can do it without my sister. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:42:05.4</p>

<p>PATIENT No</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Nice try</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:42:17.0 Well maybe it does in a way (inaudible) 0:42:18.4 because I can't say it enough because I am so close to my sister. I really like her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR I'm not saying that was the whole answer but I thought it a part of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. I think it's also I know it's a big thing like sometimes invent my minefield and feel that (inaudible) 0:42:44.1 society's concept of a teacher is intellectually inferior (inaudible) 0:42:49.6 teacher. I could never deny (inaudible) 0:42:53.2 to be a teacher and feel superior to that. (Inaudible) 0:42:58.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:43:02.0</p>

<p>PATIENT I know</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I know. (laughing) </p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah I think I feel that too. Of course I never (inaudible) 0:43:16:9 It also in a way it just I mean I don't even know if this is true I mean (inaudible) 0:43:23.3 if something is true that you wanted to say (inaudible) 0:43:26.4 I wonder if I also kind of really want to fail. (Inaudible) 0:43:31.3 This reason like I felt like I was pressured into being a teacher. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR Sounds like it. Does it sound like it to you? That sounds like that could be part of it too. Part of it. The reason you are in there is for a lot of reasons, you are teaching in a classroom for a lot of reasons. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Because you want to achieve and because you want to fail. Because you want to do it without your sister (inaudible) 0:44:06.8 </p>

<p>PATIENT And I also wonder if I really would like it if my damn parents didn't like it so much you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR That's the other end of it</p>

<p>PATIENT You know academics Is really good and you good profession and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You are in a no win situation. You're in there because your parents want you to get into it but if you are not </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:44:40.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah. (Inaudible) 0:44:43.5 The button. There is an off button on the other end all the way to the, the other end. </p>

<p>PATIENT Up down</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Hold hold</p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:44:59.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Okay it sounds to me like you're in a hard position in the teaching thing. You can't decide whether you're in there because of your parents or because you want to revolt against them and if you're getting out are you really getting out because you really want to get out or because you're just revolting from them. Right</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR That's the dilemma I see you with. </p>

<p>PATIENT It also scares me that I feel like maybe I will never be happy in anything I ever do. I really feel like I'm a loser.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR Yeah I don't want to diminish that. You're in a hard situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT Well (inaudible) 0:45:51.0 the situation like I should even seen me here last quarter. I was a wreck. I took therapy last quarter. (Inaudible) 0:45:56.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're not even a good patient (inaudible) 0:46:00.0</p>

<p>PATIENT But I couldn't talk in class I was so sure so (inaudible) 0:46:07.3 and I let them screw me kind of and they screw you (inaudible) 0:46:13.0 and you' re letting them do it. I felt that I was being persecuted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You are being persecuted. You are that's a reality okay. The other thing too okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR You're on a reality tour. You're in a very tough situation. You are in a no win situation. You're fighting the lost battle. That's worth it for me sometimes. Like I fought a lost battle here. It was horrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT I can't take that (inaudible) 0:47:01.4 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR You can't take the lost battle. But yours is not a lost battle yet. </p>

<p>PATIENT But see everyone can (inaudible) 0:47:09.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:47:22.1 I talk to a lot who are talking about the same issues. Same thing. You got a harder battle to fight than I do. </p>

<p>PATIENT (inaudible) 0:47:44.9 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR (inaudible) 0:47:49.7</p>

<p>PATIENT Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR I'll be right back. (Inaudible) 0:48:29.5 Yeah I think you could use a (inaudible) 0:48:32.0 I feel like you are very into me today. That you really listened to me today. To who I am. I didn't feel that the first couple of hours so much. I feel it more now. I felt that in the first few hours like you did not (inaudible) 0:48:57.0 but now I feel that you are communicating with me better. </p>

<p>PATIENT I felt like (inaudible) 0:49:04.6 I felt funny saying that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR What were you saying, oh no that was very good I liked that. </p>

<p>PATIENT But see then I was thinking how I felt you know when I first said that and stuff and felt a little bit uptight and I guess I do feel like (inaudible) 0:50:09.4 other people. I felt a little tense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR It's good that you asked me how I feel (inaudible) 0:50:17.7 That was very helpful to me. I want you to do more of that. And the tape recorder is going to run out. (Inaudible) 0:50:28.6 give you some help with this. Okay.</p>

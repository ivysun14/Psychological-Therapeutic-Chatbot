<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very low cost. I don't know if they need to call and confirm with you that that's what it is, but if so, just let me know ahead of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I know that sometimes with this kind of thing, people are unwilling to confirm or deny whether or not you're seeing somebody, or something like that. And I try and realize that when it gets really bad in winter, but that's about it. I hate doing that kind of stuff because I feel like those are the services needed for people who have a lot worse problems than I do. But if it's going to help me be more able to get out when I physically can't walk, it'll be a big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you didn't mind just sending me an e-mail that says I can talk to those folks, for various reasons, that would be great. And I will talk to them and confirm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If they call or whatever, yeah. I don't think it'll be really necessary till we actually get snow on the ground, that kind of thing. And my justification, technically I feel—I have to justify it in my mind, because I feel like these services are for people who are worse than me, is that if I do fall on ice, because I'm on steroids, I can end up with a hip replacement or something like that. You know what I mean? I have to like, in my own head make it OK. I don't like to do that kind of stuff. [00:01:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do want to make sure that I'm at least careful. (sigh) OK, so I think a few weeks ago I mentioned to you I feel like sometimes I have to keep vigilant, because if I don't then all hell can break loose in my life. Like making sure that everything is going to be OK, keeping an eye on things, that kind of stuff. And we'd talked about whether or not this is really founded or this is something more like an anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean it is founded, it's not just anxiety?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is definitely valid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday, my husband comes home and gets a letter from his grandfather. His grandfather who has had all kinds of elder—I'm sorry? Yeah, fell, had elder abuse type of things, that kind of thing. He hasn't really talked to him all that much, but that's pretty normal. But it was typed. His grandfather has never typed and never used a computer. But it was definitely printed on a printer. And it said something along the lines of "I am no longer willing to pay your student loans, love Grandpa," and then it was signed by him. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>As far as we know, he's never paid any student loans of his. At all. He may have guaranteed some of them, but like trust me, we've got the creditors calling, they're not paying student loans. You know? This seems like—I mean, since Mike hasn't heard from his mother in a few months, this sounds an awful lot like somebody put him up to this. They even typed it out and had him sign it, you know. It's very weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fishy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Very fishy. Especially because I can't imagine that they—I mean, it's possible they know we're living out there. We didn't actually really know their address entirely, or whatever. So this is very fishy. And very cryptic. That's all it is. That's the whole message. But it's typed. With a signature on the bottom. [00:03:21]</p>

<p>Yeah, so I was pretty upset about it yesterday because I'm like I have no idea what kind of game they're starting now, but there's obviously some sort of little passive-aggressive bullshit that he's been dragged into. He's 92 years old. Chances are, he's not doing this stuff on his own. I mean, it's possibly that his student loan people have been bothering them because we haven't had the money to pay for student loans. It's entirely possible. </p>

<p>That being said, as far as we know, he hasn't been paying them. And we know that his mother and his aunt have executive stuff over his money. Like they have countersigns. So obviously there's something going on. And I would think that if he's paying them, they wouldn't be bothering us anymore. [00:04:09]</p>

<p>I mean, this is all I can do to like construe what's going on—and quite frankly, just my husband is not exactly the most fiscally knowledgeable person on the planet. Hell, he doesn't even know what he does himself half the time. But I would think—he has no memory of this. If there was some sort of agreement I would think that I would have heard about it maybe. This is obviously some sort of like—shit is about to start happening all of a sudden. Like we're going to all of a sudden get disinherited, or whatever. You know, I mean like this kind of stuff, this kind of little thing happens, and then all of a sudden, boom. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It kind of foreshadows something. [00:04:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So Mike's mother was very unhappy that a child that she is in no way related to—Mike's father's third wife's child—wasn't invited to the reception. We had a very beautiful children's reception catered, alone, like for them, the food that they wanted, and entertainment, and at the time, like a PlayStation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not a lot of people are willing to do stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We even had special invitations sent out so they could check and see if they wanted chicken. I mean, there's little fake—they had little cupcakes made to look like—I mean, it was not meant to be in any way a slight. It was meant to be a—culturally that's something that kinds of happens in my parent's families and friends. [00:05:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's wonderful. A lot of people basically say, no kids. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we had paid babysitters, [inaudible [00:05:34], lots of things for them to do. Fabulous stuff, right. We even would have done a [inaudible [00:05:39]. But she didn't like this idea, because one [inaudible [00:05:44] for families, and so if Nick, who is now like 20, wasn't able to come upstairs, then she wasn't coming and nobody else was either. And so she called and left a message on my mom's phone, and then all of a sudden, once this happened—which by the way, my parents had to actually get a bond. If there were children upstairs in the area it was—Carnegie Music, sorry, Carnegie—no, it is a historical site. Anything with those names attached to it is. </p>

<p>They had to float a $50,000 bond for damage potential for one child on top of all the costs of the wedding. Yeah. I mean, they get their money back, but they had paid for the bond in the event that something happened so they don't get entirely held back. They had to do this just so they could accommodate one child who would've been just as happy with all the other kids downstairs that she wasn't related to. And then that was just the beginning of everything else that started happening. It's always like one thing—and all she did was leave a message on my mother's answering machine about this. [00:06:50]</p>

<p>So this is the kind of like one little passive-aggressive thing that starts—I mean, I can think of literally dozens of activities like this. And it's just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you must be really worried about the other [inaudible [00:07:04] thing. Not even knowing what it could be about. [00:07:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I am kind of annoyed with this because I feel like I have to somehow—not really monitor everything, but because my husband doesn't always pick up on this kind of stuff—and I hate to be like this, like "Hey, can you make sure that I'm around when you talk to them, because I want you to realize what's -" Because all I'm saying is, he is so indoctrinated into things, he doesn't even realize what they're saying to them sometimes. You know? </p>

<p>And so I don't mean to be like a muckraker or anything like that, but I feel like I need to sometimes be on guard to see what's going on. Because this kind of stuff, it always ends up badly. It always ends up really bad. And I don't even know like—I mean, it's possible something else is going on on that end of it, that something else is happening, but I have no idea. You know? Not a clue in the world. And it's kind of scary to see what's going to happen. [00:08:14]</p>

<p>We were never expecting to inherit a cent from Mike's grandfather. Although he did very well for himself, that's not the way we are. I don't expect to inherit anything from anybody. I have a lot of friends who are very entitled, and they're like "Hey, I heard you're going to leave this to me; can I have it now so I can go to France?" I think that's kind of—I mean, more than kind of, I think that's exceptionally crass. I've actually had friends who have stolen from family members because they thought that they were going to get it anyways and therefore they were just getting it earlier. [00:08:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, not friends, but I've had acquaintances that have done this. Not really friends. But the point though, is that we don't want—that's not what it's about. I mean, yes we are perpetually broke, but it's never been about money. And in our family, like, that's not what it's about. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no, you didn't want to ask your parents for money like for some fairly basic things until last year. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't want to ask them for money for anything. I don't want to ask anybody for money. You know why? Because I'm an adult, and one of the things that's really wonderful and has given me the biggest gift of them all, which is the ability to have ingenuity to try to figure out how to make it work. You know? Even if it is "Oh my God, I'm going to go over and"—like, I'm actually thinking about going and working at one of the bath stores over the holidays here in the Square. It won't be as hard on me—it will still be hard. But if I could just do a quick 4-hour shift in the Square and have Mike pick me up, like pick me up like walk over and pick me up and help me walk home, that is a lot more doable than hauling my butt out to wherever it's going to be snowing. So just to get some extra money. Not even for Christmas, because people think about this Christmas thing. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>Mike and I haven't given each other gifts, really, in years. The bike was the first—my mom even paid for it, I didn't even know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your new bike?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My new bike, yeah. My new bike that can't even go anywhere because I don't have a good enough lock, apparently. Like I've had two people warn me when I was locking it up, they're like, "Yeah, I wouldn't leave that bike there because that lock isn't good enough." Apparently like you need some sort of Kryptonite lock? Apparently like ones that just have like a combination that you set isn't good enough. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the fact that two independent people warned me, like bicyclists, that makes me think that there's a valid reason behind this. Like there's somebody that knows -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if Harvard Square is sort of a hotbed for bicycle thieves.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People know, like this is something it seems like they're passing along the knowledge. They're like "You need to get something, it's called Kryptonite, starts with a K." [00:10:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, do you know what those are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've seen them. They're those big metal things you use? Yeah. So I'm just waiting for it to arrive in the mail. But yeah, my new bike. That's the first—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did you get the bike you ride?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The cheapest thing that was at Target. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) That's right, you got it at Target you mentioned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so nothing fancy right now. Because I don't really know what I need to do, I just need to get myself back on a bike again. It's just this cute little cruiser, that's it. Nothing fancy. I think it was like $100 bucks. But I found out my mom actually secretly gave the money to Mike so he could go do this bike buying thing. [00:11:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right, I remember you talked about that, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My mom was like "Let me show you how to be a hero. Go and buy the bike when she's at work; have it show up [inaudible [00:11:30]." So anyway, the bike thing. But that is the biggest gift that we've given each other literally since probably 2004. So we're not like all about like "We must have Christmas." We're not like Valentine's Day -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there's s a lot of justifying going on today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really worry that I am going to be like—and not from you either, I'm just really like—I'm feeling like I need to get my ducks in a line because obviously Debra the gold-digger or whatever is going to be up—I have real good reason to believe this. This has happened before. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds like part of your response to being afraid of what could happen, and sort of not knowing where you're going to get hit, is to kind of go over and justify that you're not doing anything wrong. Which of course you aren't. But I guess it—[00:12:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to be prepared for when that phone call comes or when that whatever comes in the mail, that I have a list of things about how we have not done anything wrong. Because in my head, I have to, because if I don't—if I get caught with my pants down, it's going to be an ugly situation. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have to talk to her, deal with her at all? Like, you guys aren't getting anything from them. They're not—</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. They could be secretly paying some small amount of Mike's loans that we don't know about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even if that were true, it certainly isn't really benefiting you anyway . In other words, like, do you have to take her call? Do you have to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: She never calls me, she calls Mike. But then I end up having to deal with the situation, because at any given time, he—I'm glad he used to actually know what our bank's name was. Do you see what I mean? [00:13:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess (pause) do you anticipate that you'll have to deal directly or that you'll have to talk to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I will—I have to keep—coach him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand, right. That she'll get in touch with him, he will take the call, and you will have to deal with it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, even worse: she will talk to Uncle David. Uncle David is Mike's grandfather's younger brother, who is an attorney, who also knows my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Everyone in Cincinnati who have a certain amount of clout knows each other. They know each other very well; they go to each other's Christmas parties. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then I'm going to hear from my parents about how we've screwed them over. This could happen. And I'm not saying this in a way that sounds paranoid. They have said some things to Uncle David that has passed along to my dad before. Like, as in like, get on the phone, tell Uncle David about how Mike's left him on the hook for the student loans, and say this and that and the next thing you know my dad's calling and saying "Why are you leaving Mike's family on the hook for student loans?" [00:14:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm surprised your dad assumes Uncle David's telling the truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uncle David would be telling the truth, because he would believe -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I understand that part. But I guess—well, you said you haven't told your parents much about what Mike's family is like, so they wouldn't know to doubt what they hear, even if sort of the messenger, being Uncle David, is honest, the message isn't. I see. But they wouldn't know because you sort of shielded them from knowing about his family. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As a way, essentially, I think of taking care of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) But there's a lot of things like that. Like this is—and again, I'm not imagining this, a lot of things, this is actually how information has been transmitted in the past too. So (pause). It's just—and the worst part is that Uncle David's health is in bad shape, so I don't even want him to be used like this. You know? They don't even like him. [00:15:43]</p>

<p>I like Uncle David. They think he's pretentious and a pain in the ass. I think he's completely normal and he likes to be eccentric. If he likes to dress up in like Victorian dress in June—or I'm sorry, Victorian dress on Christmas Eve and do a true Canadian Christmas, that is not pretentious. That is having a good time. He has a couple hundred people over to his house. That's the only time of the year he ever does it. And he does the whole—like, he has a little colonial house. </p>

<p>So I don't know, the thing is that they've got kids in the family and all this other stuff, and so I don't want to have—the thing is they love to do this circuitous, like never talking to anybody directly kind of thing. And Mike's mother knows better. She knows that Mike knows nothing about money. And it's not because I've wanted—I'm not trying to hide this or keep it in the dark. Because there's a lot of spouses that do that. You know the whole thing of "[inaudible [00:16:34] doesn't know, because that way it's easier"? Everything's written down. Like it used to actually be on a chalkboard until I realized it was kind of stupid to actually write down all of our bank account numbers and passwords on our chalkboard in our kitchen. But I had to, because I wanted to make sure—I really feel like it's really important to have an open thing. But he just has no interest, you know? [00:16:52]</p>

<p>And so (pause) at any given time, I don't think he knows how much money he owes in student loans. You know? He definitely knows what bank account we have right now, because he's the one that opened it up with the credit union over at the university. But you know, it's up in the air a lot. </p>

<p>It's (pause) deeply frustrating to have to go through this again, because I am really not up for any of this crap, you know? I don't know what they are trying to accomplish, and I don't even really want to spend that much energy on trying to figure out what kind of weird hatched plan this is this time, other than obviously that I am—not really I am, but she is lonely, and therefore she's causing trouble. You know? It's just, it's so freakish. I'm just so sick of it. I really am, you know? And (pause). [00:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you get a bit kind of anxious and vulnerable and defensive instead of pissed off?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no. I've gotten pissed off before. (pause) For most people, I get pissed off, usually. This group of people, I used to get (pause) you know, I used to think "Oh my God, they obviously know something I don't." And I used to get upset. Sometimes I would get caught so blindsided, that I'd never even realized what was happening until it was too late. Like me getting naked in a hallway. I didn't even think, I mean it was a busy day, I didn't even think twice about being thrown out of the room to get dressed. Until I'm like "Wait a second, there's people going up and down this hallway and it's dirty." You know? I don't even think about it. So I have anxiety because I don't like to be put in those situations where I don't necessarily—if I don't prepare for things—[00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. You're caught off guard like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm caught off guard. And next thing you know, I'm being talked into something or being done to something that has nothing to do—anything to do with us, you know? And that's the big thing for me. I don't like how easily we have been taken advantage of over the years. (pause) And—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, so you're very wary, and very worried that it will happen again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Very.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really want to be able to see it coming because that's sort of the best protection you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) If this is just one big thing to make an excuse to write us out of like some will that we've never seen or some sort of an inheritance thing, that's fine. I don't care. Yes, there is money to be distributed; no—honestly, I mean it's not like I'd turn it away, but it's not something that is—that's not our point, you know? [00:20:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just, it's just (pause). I am sick and tired of being the black sheep, so that whenever something goes wrong, potentially, that we're the ones being kicked around. And if there's some sort of misunderstanding, no matter what we do, we're still going to get kicked around on it. </p>

<p>Like maybe some creditor called and said something to Mike's grandfather, and we misconstrued this—we'll never get a chance to actually fix this in anyone's mind, because that's—because we're already like—we're not doing drugs, we're not spending money, we're not even going to Europe anymore, you know? It's not like—we don't even own a car. These are not big things. We are really living as simple of an existence as humanly possible. But (pause) for reasons unknown, we are considered to be excessively decadent by that side of the family, and it comes back to haunt us all the time. You know? [00:21:11]</p>

<p>(pause) And it makes me really pissed. (pause) So (pause) For a person who's not especially wrapped up in my—I mean, I want to be able to pay my bills, but not like "Oh, I need to get ahead" thing? I have been awfully accused of being like obsessed with money. And that really bothers me a lot. Because it's not the way I was raised. You know? (pause) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>And (pause) I'm just so sick and tired of being—behind my back, because no one ever speaks to me, that decisions are made about who I am that have little to do with actually who I am. But because they make me so damn nervous—when [inaudible [00:22:25], I may be giving the wrong impression. I don't know. All I know is that when they're around, I want to go dig a hole to China; but then again I can't, because one, I get accused of trying to get attention, and two because I need to protect Mike because he's just as vulnerable as I am.</p>

<p>The one time that I was emotionally overwhelmed by being around them all, I was accused of running away to get attention. I'm an only child. Just after we got married, we were at a family reunion and I was meeting all these people. All these gregarious Italian people. [00:23:06]</p>

<p>And I was just feeling—we were staying with Mike's aunt, and I'm like "I just want to go lay down for a bit, I'll see you later." I'll just mention it to my husband casually. Like, I'm an only child—being around that many people—super overwhelming. That wasn't about attention, that was like needing some downtime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think you're really attention-seeking [inaudible [00:23:29] that way [inaudible [00:23:30].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but not even that, I can't handle that much stimulation that long. I know that about myself. So I just take some time, come back when I'm ready, nothing—like, no big thing. But that was construed badly and so I know now that it is better for me to just go to the ladies' room and have a couple of breaks like that, than to—I mean, so I have to have coping skills, to like—[00:24:00]</p>

<p>But the thing is, is that no matter what, this influences my husband. A lot. (pause) And (pause) he was trying to keep me out of some of this stuff today, like yesterday when we got the letter he's like "Don't you worry about this. You know you're out of this now. You don't want to talk to them, you want nothing to do with them." He says "I'll handle that." And I'm like "How are you going to handle it?" And he's like "No idea in the world." Great. I'm so glad that you're willing to handle it, but hoping you find—he's going to go see a therapist, so talk about that and do this. But it's like (pause) he's not able or willing to walk away. Or at least he's not able or willing to walk away other than by just not calling them. But it's just, it's a lot. It's a lot to have to deal with. So, I don't know. [00:25:00]</p>

<p>It's really, really tempting just changing our phone numbers, though. (snorts) They don't call that much, but that way there'll be no more surprises. But I don't know, it's a lot to have to happen. It's a long type of process. I'm just so sick of everything to do with this whole family, because it's—it's exhausting. (pause) I especially don't like the way they make me feel about myself. They are so damn convincing, when I'm in this moment, they convince me so easily that there's something wrong with me, and they're all so awesome. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I wonder how that happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I really don't know. (pause) [00:26:00]</p>

<p>Because I have so many people in my life—people that are really important to me can't do that to me. And I know it's partially because I really, really wanted a family. And I've even tried being honest with them about this. Like, that was stupid. That was possibly one of the stupidest things I ever did. But, you know, I wanted—I'm an only child, I have no siblings, I don't have a whole lot of family. And I really wanted this.</p>

<p>And you know, it was just the right time in my life where—and when I first met his mom, she seemed really cool. She seemed like they have the same sense of humor. Like there didn't seem like anything wrong with it that would make it seem bad, you know? At the time, she worked in database design and did all this stuff. I mean, it seemed like there was a lot in common, and she was educated, and this and that, so there was no good reason why in the world, you know—[00:27:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:27:01] would be fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd be fine. But it wasn't. (pause) And (pause) I'm not the first person who has had this problem with them. I'm certainly not the last one at this point.</p>

<p>You know, although I don't like to spend a whole lot of time around Mike's ex—it's mostly because she's crazy, not because of like jealousy—but she has implied with they're—that—this is a problem, when you actually deal with someone who has like mental problems, when they start talking conspiracies, it's really hard to accept—figure out what's real and what's not. She is of the belief that they use actual interrogation tactics to break down one's will. [00:28:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mike's ex-girlfriend, Chastity. Like to get you to like lose your ego, and then therefore they can remold you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This being—"they" being Mike's family?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But knowing that she also is not mentally together makes you also doubt that. But she's like "They will tell you things like"—and she points out these very, very good things, like they'll say things like "I hate all men, but I love you" to Mike, to get him, to break down his ego, so that he's remolded, like these [inaudible [00:28:39] things are getting you to do this or do that. These things that are impossible situations. And so she sees it as like some sort of terrorism. I don't see it quite as strong as that, but I'm not entirely uncertain if there's not a grain of truth to it, you know? [00:29:00]</p>

<p>And I do know that they have made other—especially Mike's mother has made other people in the family miserable. Mike's aunt, who you know, they all live in that big old compound up in—I call it a compound, they don't like that word—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A place in Missouri?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This place in Missouri, this 10,000 square foot place that has multiple entrances, which to me sounds like, you know. Yeah. Mike's aunt, she sort of was off-again, on-again with this guy that she dated back in high school. Like they met each other again after the divorce and all that kind of stuff. Mike's mother can't stand him. She finds him to be—she is rationally, just like she was with me, she can't be in the same house with him, she can't do anything like that. And all these various—raising the ante problems. And so when that started happening, Mike called his aunt and said "I know what's happening in this family." So it's obvious that it's not just me. [00:30:03]</p>

<p>But when I was 22, I didn't know any better. It's taken me all this time to finally see this period, this behavior, come full circle. And see that it's down to so many other people in the family, to the point where Mike's little brother looks to his younger sister to know how he feels about things. What he thinks about things. And that's, again, kind of disturbing too. (pause)</p>

<p>Still doesn't want to make me call up Chastity to find out any more information, because she drives me crazy, like I said. It's hard to explain. She's—I mean, when I say crazy, I mean kind of like black helicopters crazy. This is not the only conspiracy theory she thinks of. So it's hard to digest talking to her about it. But I also don't really want to fish for questions, you know? (pause) [00:31:00]</p>

<p>I'm just kind of (pause). I was really hoping to walk away from all of this. Like I literally had this resolve of "this is going to happen," and then this letter came. You know? And then of course, Mike over at the funeral was thinking to himself "Oh my God, if I were to die my family wouldn't have anything for me. They wouldn't even write—no one would be able to speak a eulogy, there would be no pictures, because they just didn't care." And it got him really upset, that my parents would be probably planning and also paying for Mike's funeral. </p>

<p>And (pause) I think that really, first of all, the good news is that having been to a funeral of a suicide, I don't think anytime soon he's ever going to think seriously about it, because I think he's seen the repercussions of what happened and how horrible it was. But the other thing is, is that him thinking to himself that his family wouldn't even be saddened—it's not even like a—to him, I could see him saying "OK, I'm going to hurt them finally by doing this." And eh, they might come in. Probably not, you know. That's a lot to have to—for him to process. [00:32:19]</p>

<p>And (pause) they don't know him. They don't know what he's interested in or what he does. They don't have any desire to do so. (pause) But at the same time, I don't know why it is that they felt like they have to hurt him all the time too. It's like, if he's not bothering them, why are they punishing him? That's the part that I can't figure out. (pause) You know? (pause) [00:33:00]</p>

<p>And (pause) the only thing that I can personally wrap my head around is they're hoping that he'll leave me, and then they can have him back to themselves. Leave me, or I will die, or something. Like I will no longer be in the picture, and then they can do whatever they want. You know? It's (pause) -</p>

<p>(phone beeps) Pardon me for a second. They usually don't do that twice. OK.</p>

<p>It just, like I said, it's just—I don't get it. I just don't get it. And, like I said, I don't really want my children to be involved in this. You know, yes, they are not even thought of, like they're not alive. But you know what? (pause) [00:34:00]</p>

<p>This is just (pause). This isn't family. This is some sort of mind game. You know? (pause) And it's just (pause) I have to every so often tell myself, "Stop trying to make sense of this because it doesn't make any sense." But at the same time, I also have to protect myself and my family. Not just my parents, but my husband is my family. And he's very negatively affected by most of this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) We have decided if he does need to get surgery for his—the various brain issues, we decided, we're making a decision of not telling any of his family. At all. Because that way, they can't disappoint. You know? And it's a terrible thing. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>We've thought about this. If we're going to have children, one way or the other, we're not going to tell them either. (pause) It is easier that way. If they happen to find out, that's great, but (pause) it's not (pause) it's the only way. (pause) It's not really a "I'm not talking to you," it's just a "I'm not volunteering information, and I'm not getting off my duff and calling you" kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if this feels like the best way to protect yourself and what matters to you. [00:36:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that they really pose a tremendous threat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do. And there's also even worse, is that really coming around, Mike's sister's family right now could also be a very big threat. She's (pause) she's the kind of person that if she got really mad, she would accuse Mike of trying to hurt one of their children. She now knows that Mike owns pornography of people who are relatively young. That's all we need, is that kind of thing. And she is the kind of conniving human being who would do it. She wouldn't do it lightly, but if she were to some sort of massive gain to it, yeah. She's jealous of the fact that Mike finished school. She's jealous of a lot of things. [00:37:00]</p>

<p>And there's really nothing to be jealous of. She has everything we want, you know? Family, a home, stable job, that kind of thing. So there's (pause) there's nothing really to be jealous of, you know? But (pause). That's just my take on things.</p>

<p>My mom, occasionally, when I tell her vague amounts of things, not very much about what's going on—because she came from a big family, so she's like "Well aren't you glad you're an only child, because that way you don't have to deal with squabbles?" And I'm like, I don't—the worst part is I can't really let her know—these aren't squabbles. You know, these are like big things. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>But I mean, as much as I really, really want to have siblings, it does kind of make me a little bit grateful that I don't have any siblings I have to deal with, because that's a lot. (pause) You know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it'd be nice if you'd have nice siblings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That would be great. That would be great. I mean, it's not that she doesn't know all of her siblings, it's just they have—all of them have been born into very different worlds, whether they be different countries or different ages and things like that, and they're just different lives—they're just so different that sometimes they don't see each other's perspectives on things. Like Aunt Virginia and her, right now they're having a fight because she thinks that the way she's treating the boys is like not being sensitive enough, and she's like "Yeah, I've got three boys. You had one extremely sensitive girl child, so I think that I have a better grip on"—that kind of stuff, you know. [00:39:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You're very sensitive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, compared to like three boys that wrestle for fun? Yeah. Not that sensitive, but you know. (sigh) I don't know. The way she wants my husband to be treated makes me think that maybe I was sensitive, because she's like super aware of things. Like "Oh, you need to make sure that if the two kids who are of teenage age get iPads, then the [inaudible [00:39:44] gets"—like, she's way too worried about balance, that everything will be [inaudible [00:39:50] out, and we're like "No, this one knows how to read, these ones know how to read and this one doesn't," you know? [inaudible [00:40:00] don't see it as that. So that's like their kind of squabble, over who's a good parent. Not like "you're stealing from grandpa." [00:40:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's a whole other level.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So (pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom does run into people's lives a little bit, which is part of the reason why I don't let her know about it, but (pause) it's not as strong as all that. I mean, she definitely would become involved if I let her. Like, she would totally pick up the phone and like do something. And that's also another thing, is that I don't like people fighting my battles for me. I don't need to get my [inaudible [00:40:48] mommy or daddy on the phone and get them to straighten things out. (pause) And they like to do that, so. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>But, I'm just so sick of this stuff. I really am a simple person. I don't like to have to deal with games. I like things to be exactly as they seem. And (pause) maybe that makes me whatever, I don't know, but (pause) I just don't have the energy for this kind of stuff. That's a lot to have to deal with, you know? I feel like I need a mind map or [inaudible [00:41:30] pictures to figure out where the relationships, like this is going to influence this, and who's like with this. It's (pause) it's (pause) it seems like an awful lot of work for no payback whatsoever. Whether it be this is dangerous or not, even in gossipy families, I'm just not into that kind of thing, because it just seems like a lot of work for very little payout, you know? [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's just who I am. (pause) And I think that's the reason why it gets me so distressed when it happens, is because I am so straight-shooting on those things, that not only can I not understand why anyone would do that, but I also find it—I get bitter, because I'm being taxed. So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it catches you off guard when people are that way. It's not sort of so much how you think about people or how you live or operate in the world. I think it's not your first impulse to think that that's what somebody's doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Absolutely not. And even, I'm actually really glad that I stopped looking—there was a period, just because I was being dealt crap all the time, where it was starting to bleed into my belief in other people too. That seems to, you know, stopped in general, but that's—it's not like I believe that other people are trying to screw me or anything like that, it's just that, you know—I don't know what it is. [00:43:11]</p>

<p>I don't—I can't even describe—that's the thing that also pisses me off. I feel like I can't make a 90-word executive summary of what in the world's wrong with this fucking family. You know? It just (pause). I'm a person who's made my living and made my existence off of taking things that are very, very complicated and explaining them in metaphors and finding relationships and getting other people to understand very complicated concepts very simply. Maybe there's a lot of details involved like in the middle, but you know? And this is something where I cannot, for the life of me—and I probably won't understand it, but it's also just exhausting to—the maintenance on it is just crap, you know? [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to have to finish [inaudible [00:44:06].</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. I will be back in tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you then.</p>

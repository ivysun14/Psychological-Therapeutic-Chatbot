<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we had our last session on [DATE], which is exactly three months ago, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have been treating you for major depression and as of that date, you were on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Provigil 100 mg in the morning.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Restoril 15 mg at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's start with the Restoril.  How often are you actually taking it, are you taking it every day or as needed basis?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been taking it every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, looking back on the Restoril, you have been on it for almost, um, you started the Restoril in September two thousand and four, actually, yeah, and so that's four, five, six, two and a half years now on the Restoril.  Restoril is the type of medication called benzodiazepine which we use it for an extended period of time kind of, the term is not really immunity, but it can become ineffective.  Have you noticed anything being on the same dose for pretty close to two and a half years?  The same medicine, same dose, what impact it has on your sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is the Provigil?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Restoril or the other name being Temazepam that you take at nighttime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I definitely sleep pretty well.  I take it with the Zyrtec allergy medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how long -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It pretty much knocks me out for -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And over these two and a half years, you have not noticed that Restoril used to work good and doesn't work anymore or is it working as good as before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's working as good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you have not lost faith on Restoril, the other name being Temazepam?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good, okay.  I have noticed that you have not needed to increase the dose either.  Have you tried at any time taking more than one?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think when we first started we were doing it, but I think I was sleeping too heavy and had a hard time waking up then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you backed up to one of them and that's working all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This one is working all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now the Provigil that we are using now because you were having a difficult time staying awake during the daytime.  Sometimes Provigil has been used to push an antidepressant to make it stronger, what we call augmentation, we are not doing it in this particular case, it is mainly to keep you awake during the daytime.  How is that working out?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think with the Wellbutrin it's okay.  Periodically now and then I take allergy medicines and sometimes that slows me down so it doesn't really affect that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So do you take the Zyrtec all the time or from time to time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what else, do you take some extra allergy medicine on top of that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> During the day I might use Tylenol Allergy capsules and that's about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.  How about Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in the morning, what is it doing for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not really sure.  I guess it gives me a little boost to keep me going.  Lately it hasn't seemed, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel happy?  I mean, you had a major loss, you lost your dad and it's about a year now, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That by any sense is a major loss, by any standard, but do you believe that emotionally speaking that you have recovered?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think a bit.  I live with mom so I guess I worry about her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How she does.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is she maintaining, uh, reasonably good health, physically speaking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Reasonably, yeah.  She has some problems here and there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's got some kind of intestine problem that really can knock her out for a half a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But other than that, she's out doing, was doing gardening last night and otherwise she's doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So she must be in good physical, I did some gardening yesterday.  I'm still sore.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  She gets sore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you give a hand to her on gardening or you don't enjoy those things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I used to live in apartments in [DEIDENTIFIED] so I've never enjoyed it, but I do it.  I do mowing and edging and most of the yard work.  She tends to a couple little gardens.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about mowing, who does the mowing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You do that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you enjoy doing that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you actually do, apart from the job that you have, what do you do for fun?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not very much.  I visited a friend in [DEIDENTIFIED] this past weekend.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We've known each other since college.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And periodically we get together and do some stuff and I enjoyed that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it a he or a she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about a she?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  The only girl I've stayed in touch with was in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And we write here and there.  She became a nun this past year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She became a nun?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but we're close friends.  We met in [DEIDENTIFIED] and we did some traveling together and stayed friends over the years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Otherwise, I haven't met anybody here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No girlfriend?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. So, I think lately, well, [NAME OTHER] lost his dad two months ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The gentleman in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I went down to the funeral and I've been down once or twice since then.  He was glad I came down and helped.  He came up and helped when dad died.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Kind of [INAUDIBLE]? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And next week is my [AGE] birthday so, I can't feel very excited about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Better early than never, Happy Birthday.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why are you not excited?  [AGE] birthday, why there is no -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No family.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Half a century.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Things haven't worked.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean by that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No family for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You always wanted a family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it just never worked that way.  I'm not good with girls, never had one that lasted and in years I haven't been able to meet anybody that stays interested.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your eyes look teary.  It's okay to cry.  There are some tissues if you want to use them.  What do you think is holding you back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess I have trust issues.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Anybody broke your trust?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess some here and there have over the years.  Lately, it's just, I'm not an outgoing person, I keep to myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you enjoy that, being a quote unquote private person or is it a fear that's keeping you inside your shell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It could be some fear of trusting someone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What is the fear?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  Opening up, it's never been that easy.  I guess a lot of it is I never dated until after college.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I really didn't have a lot of young experience.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was kind of a nerd and kept to myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now I have known you almost, pretty close to, pretty close to three years now and from time to time I have pushed you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have I ever broken your trust?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what happened where and when that the trust was broken?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  I can go back years, trouble with mom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Tell her stuff and you'd hear her, things you tell your mom and she'd be telling the neighbor and others and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The way it is sir, um, teenagers have that kind of trust issue because, um, they have a fight with the girlfriend or somebody in school or something, they come into their mom, mom you cannot tell nobody, but as and when we age, there is a traditional thing called generation gap and what is important for our generation may not necessarily be important, like I have a teenage son who is [AGE] now in just about two months, it's not that important to him -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if somebody was about twenty or thirty years older than us, their value system can be quite different and that's why we usually try to mingle with people just about the same age group who have a similar line of thinking, value system, and fun and this thing and that thing, there is a match in the chemistry.  Not always parents fit into that category, so what you are telling sir, may not necessarily be very unusual or atypical so when you go to your friend in [DEIDENTIFIED] do you share stuff that's from inside of your heart or do you still keep it closed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I still probably keep it closed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why, he's your friend?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  I never learned to talk to people like that.  My parents used to keep me - I didn't have a lot of friends when I was real little because I had allergies and asthma and I think the asthma part scared them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So they were protective of you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so I didn't have a lot of outside friends, go over and sleepovers and go to play with other people, they kept me around the house and I think that just really inhibited me over the years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you cry these days when looking back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I try not to.  I think when I talk with [NAME OTHER] here and there, we talk back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do you cry in session with her?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you believe that there is some need for it?  Sometimes crying can kind of give you a little break.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Could be, sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about if I suggest, medication is not a solution to this problem and that's why I suggested for you to go and talk to [NAME OTHER] because she has a lot of experience in these areas, but just to add, extend the help of hand, if I increased the Wellbutrin, would that be all right with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We'd done that before and I ended up getting sick with it.  It gives me too much of the jitters.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about this?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are now taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in the morning.  If I use Wellbutrin XL, the next step would be 300 which is doubling the dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We've done that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Instead, if I used Wellbutrin SR and use 100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the afternoon, not night, afternoon, we'd be going up 50 mg total daily dose.  Do you want to try?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tad bit more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not a whole lot.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, 300 -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You might be able to handle 200.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 200 might be -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the SR you have to take twice a day though, XL is once a day.  XL does not come in 200 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Be it SR or XL, you cannot cut the pill, keep that in mind, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what we will do, maintain the way you are meeting [NAME OTHER].  We'll change the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in the morning to Wellbutrin SR, SR 100 mg twice a day and that should be eight o'clock in the morning and two o'clock in the afternoon.  Don't take too close to bedtime, you might have trouble with sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we'll leave the Provigil as it is, which is 100 mg in the morning.  Down the road, I have a hunch you may not need Provigil if you can handle the Wellbutrin SR and we'll leave the Restoril as it is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which will be 15 mg at bedtime.  Because I'm making a change in the medication, I'd like to see you back in four weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Last Restoril was written in March for a month's supply with one refill, so I don't need to write any.  The same was the case for Provigil so you should be good till the end of May on those.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm going to write the Wellbutrin prescription only today.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Remember the second dose you must take before about three o'clock in the afternoon, no later than that.  If you do that, you might have a problem with sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any questions for me, sir?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, not right, not yet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get to go home now or have to go to work again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm going to go home.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll see you in about four weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you need me for one reason or another in the meantime, feel free to call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's hope that that will not be necessary.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I see [NAME OTHER] Thursday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The day after tomorrow?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Thank you, sir.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye-bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye-bye.  See you in four weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

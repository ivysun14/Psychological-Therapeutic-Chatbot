<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...theoretically, of course, someone else is going to do that. And then in the corner of it they can see things. They can see where they screwed up. A lot of people...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is a long day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, theoretically it is a three-hour day. One, two, three. Sometimes it has been where you put them. And then of course, well, put stuff in between them, as it is convenient to do so. [inaudible phrase 0:00:45] telephone calls and [inaudible 0:00:48] things and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this a usual thing for you? To run three services a day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this is like a Catholic holiday, so I don't know the holiday exactly, but a real special day. On this particular day in the calendar it is a usual thing. It happens once a year and there are a few other days that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not Ash Wednesday today is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It is what they call Ash Wednesday. But since I don't actually participate in that, so, I sort of watch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not Catholic yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. They don't seem to mind that, unless of course somebody wants to find some reason to be. But actually that hasn't really happened, so. It is a reason if somebody wants to find a reason to be, somebody wants to find a negative reason it is a useful negative reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems to be something that shows up less and less. They have enough problems with, there's a kind of shortage of organists and sometimes they have problems otherwise, that I like to overlook. Some [radical short conference (ph)] something useful happens in the process. But even still if you get on somebody's wrong side it is amazing how nasty things can get if it is a past [agarian (ph)] It seems strange and so sometimes I think he is just not connected to the rest of the world because he does such peculiar things. [0:03:14]</p>

<p>I have this friend that has access to commercial recordings because she is an editor of a magazine that sells women's rights articles things like that and she is always a very enthusiastic concertgoer. She's been [inaudible 0:03:31] She does with lots of people and she goes, "Oh what sort of things do you like? What sort of music do you like" and the answer comes back Italian Opera because it is Italian, you know. "Oh well, I can see these, let me get two copies of everything [inaudible0:03:52] so, and she does that with everybody. It turns out that a few months later Levy comes around to me and says, "Gee I met this person who was going to give me all these CDs and where are they?"</p>

<p>So I thought, first of all I thought, "Gee this is really weird." I can't imagine anybody having the chutzpah to make that particular question. So I sort of stalled him off and said, "Oh, well what do you have, what do you want to have? What are you interested in?" So he told me and I did manage to get one of the recordings in his direction. And then he comes up to me a little later and says...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I missed something there. I think I missed something in what you're telling me. She was giving you those things and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: She sometimes gives me things and gives other people things and when she finds somebody that she wants to befriend, she befriends them by channeling recordings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And did he...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she frequently makes the offer to lots of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she was giving you things, and she was making the same offer to him and he was not getting them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Every once in a while I get something from her. But it was like I guess he thought. Oh, and here's what he said to me, "Now I've got a source of those things." So the result is that he was given this list of what he has, and I guess he thinks sometimes telling anyone [inaudible 0:05:25] will drop into his lap.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He gives you the most?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He gives me the most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he never sees her, never. She is just somebody he met one time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes but does he know you're getting CDs from her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he doesn't know anything that she didn't tell him. You know she gives CDs to people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is hard for me to follow you today. I'm not sure if maybe I'm not concentrated, or you're telling me a very complicated story.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it is a complicated story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what is going on. Because I feel like I don't understand what you're saying. I mean, what is the significance of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The significance is, if you meet somebody for one time only, and the person makes some sort of promise of say, "Oh, you know..." It is sort of like an exaggerated promise. I'm not sure why she does it, she sort of does it with lots of people. I guess he took it seriously enough to come to me and say, "Why haven't I been getting this?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did he come to you? That is the part that I don't get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is the part that I get too. Why does he come to me? I mean, it is like, I guess it is because I'm the only connection he has with this person. If I start to really dig at increasing his collection. And then, but it is not only why does he come to me, but why does he say to me, "Where are all the recordings that I'm supposed to be getting?" It strikes me as the sort of thing that most people wouldn't do. It would take an enormous amount of nerve, doing that. I mean, I can't actually conceive of coming to somebody and saying, "Why aren't you bringing me these things that I was promised, one time, and I met this person casually a year ago."</p>

<p>But it doesn't to be an unusual sort of thing for Levy. So I'm trying to decide if I should every once in a while try to get a hold of something and give it to him. Maybe that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you supposed to give him something, I'm not sure?[0:08:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Indeed, why is anybody supposed to give him something? But if he is obviously coming to expect it and I don't want to go to the trouble of saying, "Levy, your expectations of what Karen is going to do are a little exaggerated." Or, "If you want something maybe have you called her? Speak to her."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know? Are you in possession of knowledge as to why he is not getting the CDs?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. She doesn't even think about him. I guess I could say to her, "Well, Levy tells me he is interested in opera." Sort of drop a little hint and see if she picks up on it. Except, I'm not sure... I really don't like Levy all that much to go to all the trouble with another friend just to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not simply, "I don't know, why don't you ask her."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess because it took me, as it was such a shock, I know, I know, because it was such a shock when it came up the first time, and it was so hard for me to believe that I was actually having this conversation with anybody on this basis that it didn't occur to me to say, "Why don't you ask her." The only thing that occurred to me was that I got to get out of this before I say what I really think, which is, "Levy, you're a fool." Or, "Levy your sense of social obligation is badly skewed." Or whatever it was I would have said I was trying to avoid saying something like that.</p>

<p>So I guess I just wound up digging myself in deeper because now he has this list of things and. I suppose that if nothing appears he... As a matter of fact he already has. He gave me the list and he came up to me a couple of weeks ago and said something, I don't remember what it was and I said, "Patience, patience." I guess that was a mistake too. [0:11:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You assumed some responsibility over these.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It looks like I did, didn't it? Or at least it looks to him I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think this is on your mind now? This is the first thing you're telling me about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because the man has just been totally irritating. I think he's got it... Well, he is the supposedly the source of the terrible things the whole staff is saying about me. It appeared on these mimics that were shown to me. Somebody showed this to me as a warning included in these contract negotiations in two months, so "watch out," basically.</p>

<p>It is so obvious that all of this material came from Levy Hatcher that just by nature who it was and who the other people are. And lately he does, I give him this list of stuff and you have to make a list of hymns for however many weeks it is to the dance and sometimes he just ignores it but sometimes he sends it back with slightly sarcastic comments like, "Why did you do that?" And basically comes across as hostile, even though he pretends to be something else. [0:12:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does he pretend to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he's a Catholic priest so he projects a very upright and virtuous and he somehow... I think that these people are ingrained to the point where they have to convince, somehow convince themselves as well. So the result is that everyone else can get the sense that the man is acting out of some sort of personal spite. I've seen this in the couple different instances.</p>

<p>And he'll find a way of turning it around and turning it around and twisting around what people say, and shading it so that he can keep himself in the sort of light that he wants to project. Which is kind of difficult to deal with because you really can't be honest with these kinds of people. IF you're honest with them they are likely to find a way of twisting it around and using it against you.[0:13:54]</p>

<p>I'm not making this up. Because other people have said the exact same thing. AS a matter of fact, the other guy who used to be in this position and wound up being the associate pastor, the vicar, warned me before I quite understood how the man would twist and turn things around. He also told me stories of things he used to do to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just told me, "I'm not making this thing up." As if I might doubt what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just cautionary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come you think you were cautionary?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, because it is sort of the nature of this sort of interaction that the only information that you get is what I bring. And if I bring you some sort of... If I bring you the information that somebody has it in for me, then I think if I were doing this, the first thing I would try to find out is, "Why and is there real basis for this and can you..." And if there is not, I mean you would definitely want to know if there is not, and I think I would want to poke around a little bit to find out if there really isn't. And if there really isn't, then there is some useful work to be done. [0:15:38]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean in terms of whether your thoughts about Levy are justified or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it would be somewhat of my job to try to find out if you are piecing the wrong...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is my speculation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then, I'm not doing it, so you are making sure of it, that I'm aware of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it is not so much that it is that if it really is your job then I'll save you the trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't worry about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't worry about it. It is real, that's it. And sometimes I suspect that I might really get this sentence even if it wasn't true, because sometimes I think I do. But in this case it really is, so what I have to do...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are two things. First of all you're thinking maybe I suspect what you're saying and you're making sure that I don't, because this really happened. And then sometimes, you're saying, you suspect yourself a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, there could always be an element to this that is really something that I'm doing. But I figured out what I had to do with Levy, regardless of what he does, is just avoid... No matter how nasty and unscrupulous and how viciously the man will use anything. Well, what it comes down, he'll get angry, he'll get angry at some little slight.</p>

<p>Like I made it clear one time that there was something that he did that I didn't agree with and I didn't like, and I only did it because he asked me. If he hadn't asked me, it wouldn't have happened, but I made it clear and then all the sudden he started to do nasty things. I mean, that is pretty clear from what the other guy said about this man's history. But I guess the way of handling Levy, regardless of how much of a little child he behaves, if I'll just avoid being trapped by that and just take the opposite stance, then he can't... it is very hard for him to do anything about it. It is very hard for him to... [0:18:12]</p>

<p>The way it works is that the only way that he can really bring up whatever phony stuff that he is bringing up against me, he can't justify it to himself unless he thinks that somehow I am resisting or putting him in that light. As long as I didn't do it to him, then he can't do it to me, at least for very long. Hmm. That doesn't make a lot of sense. But it does seem to work. Don't let him get you down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The reason that I asked you before, why you feel, and you didn't answer me, why you feel... Are you having any thoughts as to why you're telling this to me now? Why this is on your mind as you're coming into this room.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just came from there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. So it was very much alive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it was sort of alive and at the same time I think I confused a little bit of it because he gave me this list with all sorts of comments on it. So I just had to revise and here it is. And here are suggestions and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you're telling me this, I had a thought. And I'm just wondering. I will just tell you the thought and you tell me what you think about it.</p>

<p>I particularly kind of noted it to myself when you said that you feel you couldn't criticize him. You cannot tell him something that is not completely affirmative and appreciative of him, because he will then retaliate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were saying, especially with very shortly after you had this cautionary moment where you were kind of making sure that I was with you, that I'm not having my own thoughts, that I do not doubt what you're saying at the moment. I came to think there is something on your mind, some criticism that you have on me that you can't criticizing because I will retaliate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How would you retaliate?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I'm completely off? [0:21:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: We'll think of something. Do you want me to think? I can think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want you to make up things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't make up anything. [inaudible0:21:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you see, part of my listening and in this sense I guess you did tap into something that might be my state of mind as a therapist. Part of my listening is not complete. That is, it is not about judging the reality of what you're saying, or not or thinking if this is happening or not. But I always, or at least at this moment I was thinking and I asked you, "Why are you telling this to me now?" It is always important to me to figure out why we are talking about this. Now is it supposed to mean about other things. It must have meaning. So part of my thinking always looks at what you're telling me, at certain points, not always, looks at it as a metaphor, OK?</p>

<p>Now, what are you telling me? You're telling me a story that has a meaning. What are you telling me? And I think this is what you picked up when you said, "Really, I'm not making it up." Because I guess that you're picking it up that I'm sort of listening in one ear and the one ear is thinking. [0:23:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: My speculation is, I feel almost embarrassed to sort of step into that role this is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What role?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean... Well, assuming to know what somebody else is thinking is just something that this not... A lot of people I know get upset by that, or profess to be. Camille is always saying, "Don't tell me what I'm thinking!" All right, I won't tell you what you're thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I assume you tell her what she's thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't tell her what she's thinking. I only tell her the way she's coming across. So I get the sense that you're doing or...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you're doing...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's get back to this. I think we're at why is [inaudible 0:24:14] tell people what I think they're thinking, doing my thinking for me, how does that come about. I just was avoiding that one for quite a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What have you been avoiding?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been avoiding telling her what I think she is thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're used to doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she said that I did. It didn't occur to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we just had a moment a few moments ago where you were [inaudible 0:24:44] to tell me what I was thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's why I am apologizing. It is something that I've been trying to avoid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that you need to apologize for that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so. I found myself trying to avoid doing that. And besides, I think that people are perfectly capable of saying what they think, it is a more civil way of going about having a conversation, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying in other words, that there is no need to guess what you're thinking.[0:25:25]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you can wait until they can choose to tell you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I can make a speculation. But only in [inaudible 0:25:34] terms, speculation. Not to be something that sort of cuts off the... You know, I know people who do that. Think they know what is going on and go on that basis and then they might find they really don't, and sometimes they don't find out whether they know it or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is it important to know what other people are thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is not important to know what other people are thinking. It is important not to make an assumption of anything that precludes ever finding out. Especially if the other person wants to tell you, that happens a lot to me, with some people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're doing a lot of work in your mind, guessing, and assuming and you precluding yourself from knowing what is really going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I try not to do that. Or if I find that I'm making assumptions about people, if I realize I'm making assumptions And sometimes I try to stop making the assumption. Because it might be true. Or even if it is true, it is the only reason I continue to make the assumption, and then it is going to stay true. Maybe. [0:27:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe Levy is a good example. Even if it is true, I don't have to continue to accept the negative aspect of it. So, going around and around if nobody notices, maybe he'll forget about it. Probably not though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you let [inaudible 0:27:37] know. You came back to speak about Levy, which brought me back to thinking about where you left.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where we left. We left several things. What things are you talking about now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one thing that [inaudible 0:27:52] is whether between us something like this is going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether I'm [inaudible 0:28:04] something that you're thinking...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you have assumptions about me that you are keeping to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of testing them in reality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, testing them in reality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you mentioned a conclusion before that you put it that you have an assumption that if you criticize me I will retaliate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I made that assumption, that if I criticize you, you will retaliate. Maybe that is an assumption you have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually though, I did a dumb... Other than... Well, most people retaliate. Because usually when you have some criticizing, nobody finds it particularly welcome to be criticized. So I supposed that is kind of good social practice to wait until you're invited to. Or if that ever happened, we've been past that. Since if I am not in the habit of criticizing, I am in the habit of dredging things up to criticize. [0:30:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you want me to try?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That won't help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not really, I just told you that I was going to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Maybe I am leading you in a direction that follows my assumptions. And keeping it aside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely put Levy aside too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is interesting though, that we would both move aside together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I came in with Levy, and you took it as the echo, so goodbye echo, goodbye Levy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a sense you are agreeing with me that they are related. You're saying, we drop this we drop this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK, if you want them to be related. You're the one that made the link to begin with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you accepted it now. You accepted the link. You accepted it about Levy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I don't like Levy very much, but it is sort of fun to talk about him every now and then. It is really fun with people that know him, because... Except you know, I think he is a bit different. I guess they trained him very well. [0:32:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trained him very well?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to say that some of the most vicious people I know through [inaudible 0:32:16]</p>

<p>Actually the thing I was thinking about that I need to deal with is cut back on the... Cut back on the demands of the office because I was going and going and I can't go there as many hours as they want. It is hard for me to bring it up, so. I keep forgetting and coming back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bring it up there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I guess I'll have to do it. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow. Yes, I think I will. I keep saying I'll do it and I'll do it. It is like, of course the person, the doctor - She's like a [inaudible 0:33:26] doctor, she's a little hard for me to relate to anyway. A lot of people have trouble relating to this person, so... I don't know why that is exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why what is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Trying to decide why it is that she is hard for me to relate to. Think it is because she is from such a completely different background, ultimately. And I guess it is because I don't quite understand that particular obsession, which doctors seem to have, at least this one, to pursue these... Oh it is... There is a certain kind of aggressiveness and a certain sense that these things will ultimately prevail. I don't know... It is hard for me to see how the soul of [petitioner (ph)] can take these cases which sometimes will run for five, six, seven, eight, nine years, in which you're basically taken off contingency And you're pursuing And pursuing aggressively And...</p>

<p>I don't... It has got to be a real obsession that makes people able to do that. And I don't quite understand it. I don't quite understand how she is able to do that through such an enormous amount of drudgery. If I could figure that out...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I might decide that I didn't want to have any part of it. I'm almost able to decide that now. I don't understand it. But I guess if... I think it is because she gets patients that she can identify with, a similar kind of goals to pursue. If you can do that then... [0:36:49]</p>

<p>And of course she is in that world all the time, like I just said, she' in that world all the time And I'm not really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is hard for you to go in, go out, go in, go out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually yes. It takes a little while to get used to it. If I could work...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it to come here, be here an hour, 45 minutes, leave, be away for a week, come back, how does it feel? Is it awkward getting out to some kind of state and going out of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it depends on what happens because sometimes... Occasionally it is sort of... One time I remember something happened, And I don't remember what it was but it was sort of like whatever it was kept continuing on for a day or two. And that was sort of weird. Whatever happened sort of spilled over every place else and that doesn't entirely happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying it was weird?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it is unusual, because it doesn't seem to be all that rare, but it still sort of strikes me as odd that that does happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't remember what it was that spilled over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it has... sometimes we talked about this little room and I think that is it. Because that is something that never happens to me under any other circumstances. It is almost like in any other context it is almost a useless concept.[0:39:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Going to the little room, or entering with somebody else, and this happened. So it... Yes, I think that one is... Yes it is nice to go there, but then it is like not getting out. I want to come back out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you stayed kind of in the room?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe, I'm not sure. It was weird because it was like I'm not connecting up with people I usually do. It is kind of getting kind of dangerous or troublesome.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you alone there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was I alone there? You mean was anybody else...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible phrase 0:40:43] It was just a question. Did you feel alone there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did I feel alone there? You know it is hard to answer because it is... I have to put myself back in the context, which is very different and I just have to think that I remember being uncomfortable. Maybe, I guess. There wasn't anybody else involved. But that doesn't. I guess, perhaps. I must have been. I must have been. It sort of went on for a while and then you have to fight your way out, I guess.</p>

<p>I think it has happened other times as well, maybe not as dramatically. [0:42:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The same feeling that you are in this room that we're talking about, or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, going through being there And being kind of isolated, at least isolated from anybody else And... But I think it is seemed to find that I don't relate very much to, I don't relate to people who say they don't notice it And they don't understand And you sort of got some distance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel more distant yourself from other people when you are in this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What are the recent words that don't nobody seem to, don't seem to express what the... It is sort of like nothing and same kind of modern thought I guess, not being on the same wavelength I guess. I guess that is distant. Out of pace may be better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's [inaudible 0:43:54] if this is happening here. You come here in this room and focus on something different is going on I think</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the way we think together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes. Actually sometimes I think it is not that evolved because I find that I get really feeling deprived when I don't have, when I am unable to practice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you have to come here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No because I have other stuff to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can these...</p>

<p>PATIENT: How can that happen?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. How is this connected?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel that you are hesitant to... for us to even discuss things that are not good, that are happening, the things that are troubling you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you saying this is troubling or that... I wasn't actually having any sort of [inaudible0:47:03] at all. Troubling maybe, but good or bad, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. So you remember that next week we are skipping.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh next week is skipped.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is skipped. So I'll see you in two weeks from today and for that week we'll be in another room. So if you dial this number, your key, I'll come and I'll get you from the waiting room at three o'clock. I'm sure you noticed that there's a lot of renovation going on in this building so..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything is painted a different color.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is going through something. It will be uglier, I assure you because I've seen other rooms. But for that week we'll be using another room while they're...</p>

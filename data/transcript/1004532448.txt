<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see, I have just a couple more things about the appeal form and then...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I had a couple of questions (inaudible at 00:00:12).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Let's see, the first is I'm actually going to send it in today. I decided I really needed to write a little letter with it partly to indicate like what we were asking for as far as 12 to 24 sessions, and I figured I'd make the case based on the severity of your symptoms based on the fact that you had to use some of your outpatient visits for partial hospitalization. And (pause) also to give yourself more time to figure out if you were going to get other coverage or sort of pull together resources you needed. That was kind of the argument that I was going to make. Does that seem reasonable to you?</p>

<p><br>
 CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the other thing is I hadn't realized how quickly they wanted that turned around so it's pretty late which is my fault. So I was going to sort of apologize and, you know, I'm sorry. I've never seen a form that's got to be turned around that quickly. [00:01:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is okay. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It made me feel that if they deny it because it's late that like it's quite a fair to me that I would take some - like that would reduce the cost of the sessions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if it seems fair to you, but it doesn't seem necessary to me because it's the kind of thing that (pause) seems like it's more on them than on either of us. So, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, we can sort that out as it comes back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. So, so I guess the first question, I mean, I've been thinking a lot about kind of our talk yesterday, the first question I had is, the therapy I've had in the past has been really, really useful and really helpful in terms of sort of what you're talking about and figuring out how the past relates to the present, figuring out why I might be doing things that seem inexplicable, but that the way in which the past carries into the present, the way in which past relationships influence my expectations of present relationships, and so on and so forth. And knowing is really good, but understanding doesn't automatically lead to change (laughs). And so I guess I'd like to not necessarily today but at least to talk about it, but more just like to be aware that like for me one of the most frustrating things is, is coming to an understanding and then finding that that means, practically speaking, nothing in terms of improvement in my well being. [00:03:06]</p>

<p>Sometimes it does lead to improvement. You know like I found that in forming new relationships I'm able to use what I've learned and form much healthier relationships. But I'm not better (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's kind of the first one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I mean the right perspective - what really matters is dealing with what's being played out in the treatment and to some extent outside of the treatment. That's kind of where the action is. There's always a story to tell like how to relate to the past but I don't generally see that action as having as much to do with figuring out what happened in the past or come to understand it. There's got to be a level of (pause) emotional engagement in the way that it's playing out in the present in order to really, I think, effect change. Yeah, understanding can be helpful but only when it's sort of very closely connected with a sense of charge or emotional engagement in whatever the issue is. (inaudible at 00:04:57) abstraction like I mean that sort of can be good to know. And for instance, tend to me a much more healthful change. [00:05:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that address what you're feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. It does mostly. I'm trying to figure out where the gap is and how to articulate it. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I've in the past (pause) I so often all the time find myself in situations where I say I am doing this thing that has negative consequences. I know why I'm doing it and I'm still doing it, and I don't know how to not do it. And so that is kind of where the gap has been for me in therapy in the past. [00:06:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think you (pause)... My impression is there's a pretty big split for you between what you know about how things are and sort of what you know about yourself or what's realistic and how you feel. I mean I'm sure there's a lot I don't understand about that. I know there is, but (pause) it seems to me like it seems very frustrating. It sounds like it renders you in a way kind of impotent or helpless in the face of the things that are most upsetting oftentimes. And then at some other level that's totally useless you know better. [00:07:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just unlike almost any other problem that I have to solve. Typically if I understand the problem I understand the answer. And when it comes to my emotions and my behaviors that is not the case and so I have to find a new way of dealing with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if I follow that's something that you really would like to get better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see any way to get better without that. Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. And then I guess my second question is to ask you something that's important for me to know. Why do you do this? Why are you psychologist? Sorry to spring that on you. [00:08:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) It's fine. All's fair in love, war, and therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me more about why you want to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what we're talking about doing is a pretty important relationship. And everybody in my family... I was kind of raised with the thoughts of the best career is one that is satisfying to the soul. And what's satisfying to the soul is very often service to other people. And so I have a lot of religious workers and a lot of health workers in my family. And those are the two models that I really know and that I can kind of work from. And so as part of my understanding of those models is extremely important to me to respect your privacy. Like that is really important because there's no way you can possibly do your job if you don't have that. [00:09:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about privacy or like what aspect of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like this isn't friendship. It's not (pause)... You need to be able to go home at the end of the day. And I also... You have a lot of patients and you spend your whole day going through the most emotional part of people's lives with people and that's hard. (Laughter) It seems to me like it would be very hard. There's a reason why I'm not heading forward in doing therapy. (Pause) But I guess it's very important to me to - It's clear to me that you are going to have to set boundaries for yourself and it's important to me to respect those boundaries until I'm not asking you. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>At the same time a relationship is mutual and so part of figuring out - for me to figure out what this relationship is or its going to look like I need to know what you are in it for in so far as you are comfortable sharing if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I guess I sort of hear a couple of a different worries there. (Pause) One of which is about how committed I'll be like whether I'll be committed enough or in this enough. [00:12:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's less that. It's more that I think there's an extent to which shared values are going to be important.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which ones?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean to put it bluntly I need to know that you care about people. I mean I do know that you care about people, but I guess I need to hear some kind of articulation of that or from you. And I guess the second part is that for me relationships are necessarily mutual. And that means that in some sense I need to be taking care of you as well as you taking care of me. [00:13:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I was thinking it was more like you were worried about overwhelming me and letting me know that I'm going to need to sort of make sure I'm clear about what the boundaries are so that doesn't happen to me, but now it's something different. It's more like it's really important to you to be upholding your side of this relationship however we sort of unfold... [00:14:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although the fear of overwhelming you and needing to know where the boundaries is also very important because I'm going to be so afraid of overstepping then that I'm not going to take - like it is very hard for me to call you after hours. It is very hard for me. I trust people really easily but I don't rely on people easily. It's very hard for me to ask somebody to put themselves out for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so in that sense this is a very risky thing you're (pause) starting to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) I'm not just trying to evade answering your questions directly. (Laughter) But I do want to understand more about the first one before giving you more of an answer to it. When you say (pause) you want to hear something about my caring for people for the people that I work with, I think, is the part that you're interested in. [00:16:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean I guess how you feel about the people you would with describes part of it, but it's more like this seems to me a really, really hard job. (Pause) And in some sense the role that you're required to take on is not a role that is (pause) naturally human relationships. It's not a role that anybody has a right to expect from anybody else so why would you do that? [00:17:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so hard? What is it that you imagine? I'm really not just trying to deflect or something. I'm really just trying to understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'll be talking about to say like the frames from which I'm coming from talking about teaching like one of the most wonderful things for me about teaching was having these kids in my class that I know that if we were the same age they would be incredibly cruel to me, and I would not like them. And I would not see any value in them, and being able to support them, and love them, and see the good in them because we were in these different situations. So in that sense I can really see why it would be easy to or it would be - I mean not necessarily easy, but it would be something you would set out to do to be in relationships with people that you ordinarily would not choose to have in your life. [00:18:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And for you with the teaching, if I follow the motivation there, is like you can care about and be there for, and help these kids because of your role as their teacher in a way that (pause) - even if as their peer you wouldn't be doing the same thing. You wouldn't be able to teach them letters and stuff. Like you're saying you wouldn't have probably had any kind of positive relationships with them at all. And so the role of teaching gives you a way to have a much more positive, connected, kind of nurturing relationship with them and that's part of the value. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Am I missing anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's all right. And so as it relates to me I sort of get into all these close and nobody I like emotionally in relationships with people which I might not be doing or it wouldn't be in the same way as say in my outside life or if I had a different job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also I mean the expectation from you in that relationship is that you're going to be unconditionally supportive. And as I understand it both from what I've experienced and from what I've read that is one of the primary expectations of a therapist. And like Jesus (laughter) that's a lot to ask. I mean not unconditionally saying whatever you were doing is right, but unconditionally nonjudgmental I guess. [00:20:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) And so (pause) you're saying it must take tremendous commitment in some way to consistently maintain that sort of entirely supportive or nonjudgmental position at least as much as humanly possible or something like that? [00:22:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you're wondering (pause) how is it that I'm committed to people in a way that allows me to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm just wondering why is this a life that you would choose? (Pause) You know I know that's a lot to ask. [00:24:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah which I guess is sort of perhaps a bit of playing out of how much you're saying to sort of why you asked in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you mean? Never mind. I get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so or I have an explanation for it in my head. And it isn't that I'm saying this job requires an intense commitment from you and what I'm asking from you right now is the sharing of something that is very personal or could be (laughter); that would be if I were in your position. [00:25:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're... Yeah, either way you're looking for a sort of demonstration of my commitment either in answering this personal big question or in sort of more broadly wanting to understand why I want to do this sort of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause until 00:27:48) Here's why I'm kind of unsure how to answer your question. It's because (pause) while I'm certainly quite committed and invested a lot and have a lot of trained experience doing this kind of work, and I'm on one hand happy to speak to all of that. There are some things about it. On the other hand my concern is to do with it relates to the way that the process works in the following way. (Pause) If I talk about my commitment to this or in a sense what's in this for me, then I think it sets up (pause) a certain kind of expectation around how much you are or are - I mean for you around how much you are or are not kind of contributing to or playing into that. [00:30:20]</p>

<p>I mean in other words if I say oh I'm in this because I like being close to people, or I'm in this because I like helping people solve their problems, or I'm in this because I like understanding the way the mind works, or I like something along those lines of why people do this kind of work. Then for you there's an extent to which you're gratifying or not gratifying, or disappointing, or succeeding at keeping me happy. Like if I say I'm in this because I like to understand how the mind works and we're not learning things about how your mind works or you come to have a stake in it one way or the other, there's some point where you want to make me happy and feel satisfied with how this is going. There's a kind of structure around how you'd think you'd do that. [00:31:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess that's (pause) what concerns me about being more forthcoming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean you do realize I'm going to construct your own reasons for myself right? [00:32:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that'll be useful to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that'll be useful to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would hope to both of us. I mean to tell you the truth that's why I actually don't think it would matter. I don't think it would be the end of the world if I gave you an answer because (pause) either way it's going to wind up being about how you felt like you were pleasing or disappointing, or succeeding or failing, or maybe at some point stymieing me. So yes I'm sure - I mean we all do that in this kind of treatment. Yeah like the (pause) you know the particular ways you come to do that will, I imagine, be important, reflective, diagnostic, and so forth. [00:33:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I guess that's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) Fair enough. Why do you say you think? (Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of take people on their own valuation. And while I don't know what your evaluation is then I'm less certain of - I feel like I have less to go on. And so it's a kind of risk that this relationship involves for me is harder to commit to (pause) which doesn't mean it's impossible. [00:34:48]</p>

<p>You know in a sense you really have answered my question, but it was a question I needed to ask.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it that I've answered it? I'm not disagreeing with you. (inaudible at 00:35:04) which I could articulate but I'm curious to your thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By taking it seriously and recognizing it is important and (pause) by giving me an honest answer, if it's a honest non-answer. (Laughter) [00:35:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And also I mean the concerns that you bring up, I think, are probably the case for everybody. But I think they're particularly concerning for me which tells me that you (pause) which tells me that you're good at knowing who I am so that's helpful. [00:36:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or that you're reading me right or whatever. Okay. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh it's just A, it's just a very strange kind of relationship and B, it's very scary for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. (inaudible at 00:37:07)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) It's very difficult for me to be in a relationship where I don't understand why I am of value to the other person. [00:37:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems to me that this is one of the most fundamental ways that you feel safe (pause) like confidently expect that you can have relationships with other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is to know who you are for them, or what they value about you, or being close to you. (Pause) And I guess I (pause) - other than hope in my answer to your question that while I didn't, in a way that I imagine is frightening and possibly also frustrating, kind of gave room to hold on to that I also show that it was for reasons that in my view are in your best interest. We could disagree about that, but as far as I can tell I'm trying to answer in a way that will help. [00:39:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tough I appreciate the worry and frustration I (inaudible at 00:40:05).</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay. I mean it's much more interesting than if you'd answered me directly. [00:40:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I always like. (Pause) Yeah, I don't know that I'm going to go any farther with that right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. What else occurred to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Well the main - I've had a really good couple of days which I would feel good about except that they've been a good couple of days primarily because I've just been avoiding everything and not doing any of my work. And in the same way that I need to know what (pause) the other person values in me, I need to be useful in some way. I just haven't been of much use. So I'm pretty cheerful but also just really angry with myself. [00:42:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, of course, thinking about the fact that I'm angry with myself just ruins all the cheerfulness. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because you haven't felt you're contributing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:42:24) anything at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. I guess that impetus is really strong in you to be contributing, to be of use. I mean that's kind of what you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you always kind of somewhere on the useful contributing scale? Do you know? [00:43:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a way that correlates reasonably with how you're feeling about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah. (Pause) If I'm not doing something why am I here? (Pause) The problem with that is I know that's pretty unhealthy in a lot of ways. But I also still believe it like think that it is true. (Laughter) So that's one value system that I haven't reasoned with. It's not like an emotional remnant. It's part of what I value. [00:44:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well I guess I would imagine that your head and your heart may be on different time scales on that one in the sense that I would imagine emotionally if you'd gone a couple of days without feeling that productive you can feel really bad. But in your head you know if you needed a bit of a respite or whatever like sometimes people need that, it will help you get back to work later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just never does actually help me get back to work either. (Laughter) Yeah, it just leads me further into this pit of sloth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's my main preoccupation right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop in a minute, but I just wanted to check in with you about one other thing which is there's probably - I'm sure there's more to talk about this I do want to make sure that (pause) however you felt about calling the other night wasn't (inaudible at 00:45:18) felt it was important to call me again and you would wait doing it. I mean you're feeling good about it. I heard what you said earlier about calling people and that kind of thing. [00:45:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's going to keep being hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not exactly sure why, but it's really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It was a tough call to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel that after (pause) really bad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not particularly worse. (Pause) Yeah. I mean part of that is I don't know where your boundaries are like I don't... Part of it is I've never had a therapist tell me that before so it's completely unprecedented for me. [00:46:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Like what; the call?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except my psychiatrist and that's like if you're going to the hospital, you can call me. And part of it is I grew up in a household where my dad didn't ever get to come home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know what it's like to actually be on call all the time and I know the impact that it had on our family. And that while that's something that... I mean being a missionary is his vocation, it's what he belongs doing, it's hard. [00:47:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. No, it's like a 24 hour.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't (pause) See in the same sense it's important to me to respect your privacy. Like it's important to me to take care of you in that way. And I don't know - like I don't know how to value myself enough to ever call you. But then I... And it took me a year to realize my psychiatrist actually wanted to tell her all of my symptoms. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. A lot of this seems to be about taking care of other persons in various ways and (inaudible at 00:48:05) your commitment to that and uncertainty about (pause) how to value what you need or might want from somebody versus what they need or might want from you. [00:48:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't have any good scale of valuing what I need or want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now but we'll talk more. There's always some feelings you go around you know deciding on phone calls and things like, but we can certainly talk more about it. I mean if there's any way that I can make that sort of a less stressful decision for you or (inaudible at 00:48:57) helpful to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh crap. I am going to be gone next Wednesday until Sunday. So I can e-mail you about...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, why don't you e-mail me and we'll see if we can reschedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No problem. Don't worry about it. [00:49:20]</p>

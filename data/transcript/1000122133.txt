<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Same thing as last time? Just talk? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the thing that I've been thinking about quite a bit when I decided to come here the beginning of the year, I thought that it would be a really great thing to do that every time I dreamed to write it down. To see if that meant something. Since then I've only had three dreams and they're really nonsense. I wrote them down, put them in a file, but it was clearly just a bunch of jumbled thoughts in my head. Days that I came here, that night, I got up the next morning and didn't think about I had been dreaming. Then I was doing something then I thought, Oh I just remembered a dream I had last night. I'd like to relate it to you because I think for once it might mean something. It might just mean nonsense again. I don't know whether I believe in whether it does mean anything or not. But anyhow, it was about a lobotomy, which by it self says something of the day after I first saw you. [0:01:17.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well before I analyze what I think anything it has to do with it, do you mind if I just give you the whole thing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Ok. That's fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was a med student and Dr. Blackwell was a physicist here; the doctor directing things. A different kind of doctor. I was one way down in line somewhere, not a top dog med student at all. And they wheeled in the next patient which was for a lobotomy and I was suddenly the number one assistant. Dr. Blackwell started explaining why a lobotomy was necessary. He said the basic reason it was necessary was because of the exorbitant rates for psychiatrists this poor boy had to have which it doesn't make any sense at all. He mentioned $10.00 an hour is a horrible rate. This seemed to be the entire rationale. [0:02:21.2]</p>

<p>Well the boy was about an 18 year old boy, blonde. He came to during this explanation; the rationale as to why a lobotomy was necessary. He seemed perfectly sane, and so Dr. Blackwell to prove his insanity, mentioned one of the strange practices which was to cut himself and with the blood to use it as a salve for hives which he had. The rationale that this boy gave was that it worked. Well the next thing that happened was the boy was on anesthetic and on the table and everybody else was out of the room but Dr. Blackwell and myself. Just as he was about to make the incision he mentioned he was having an opening in his research group. Which was real important to me now because I'm looking for research to do as soon as I get the test over with. It is very hard to find a group to do research with and Dr. Stacks is one of the better groups here. [0:03:20.2]</p>

<p>Well he just begins to make the incision in the boy's forehead and he comes to again and he gets up and he tries to run out of the room. Two guards attempt to stop him and he alludes them. He runs out of the hospital and sometime he picked up two physics texts along the way. I know the text; Halliday and Resnick, it's a standard first year physics text. I can see the books in his hand. He runs off into the woods and his main motivation is not to get away but to hide the books. He does hide the books. Comes back out of the forest and now he is no longer really frantic about getting away. Three men surround him. One of whom was a physicist that I worked for at Argon National Laboratory two years ago. A few words pass between the two of them. I don't remember them at all. [0:04:22.0]</p>

<p>Oh I missed one point that I think might be important. When the boy was first awake in the operating room, he was asked to show that he was insane. Dr. Blackwell said here are three dots on a piece of paper, what do they represent. To the three dots he added a line and said it was the University of Los Angeles book store. It's really like nonsense. I know I laughed at it too but I wrote it down because I was remembering the whole thing. I don't know. He was explaining how great the book store was; all this tremendous reading material. It became quite evident at this point that he was very well read. Very well read. That happened early, now back to where we are now. [0:05:11.6]</p>

<p>As these three men sort of surround him, he's now in another book store and I don't know what book store it is. It's not the NYU; it's just another book store. A student book store. And he's in a crowd of students and the crowd realizes his plight and they try to hide him from his pursuants. He's just looking at this wall of books again saying, "Oh this is paradise, all this is great reading material." And the crowd just engulfs him to hide him from anyone who's chasing him, and they do so and they succeed in keeping him away from the people that are chasing him. [0:05:46.6]</p>

<p>That's it. Those are all the facts and I tried not to analyze it myself because if I did I wouldn't be telling you about it. I think I might have facing it. It's clear the guy is me. I think that's pretty clear. Why he wants to hide the physics books, I really wish I knew. And why he's afraid of it. Well clearly anyone should be afraid of a lobotomy, especially if he's sane. This one may or may not have been. But when I thought about it I think the personal thing that has bothered me most probably in my life, the personal thing that I'm least willing to discuss with anyone, is the sexual problem I seem to be rid of. I barely discussed it with myself and here I was discussing it with you. This probably might have stimulated the idea well that you're probing into my mind farther than anyone has and maybe I have a feeling that you shouldn't. In other words maybe it's like a lobotomy. [0:07:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I'm digging in somewhere and it makes you feel like getting away. Like making me stop that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's probably what it's about. I don't know. The proof of the insanity which was the blood and the hives doesn't fit in much at all. That might have been some strange current running around in my mind or is it something else? I don't know anything about dreams. This one I think merited mention. I don't know what...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like in some ways you can connect some kind of meaning without really understanding it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the meaning that I do connect is moderately disturbing especially in light of the fact that it happened right after I saw you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Disturbing that this should set off that. [0:08:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean if the logical interpretation, I mean if I just took the most naï¿½ve interpretation, the first part that I told you about is that I'm afraid of telling you anything. The second has something to do with physics. Why would I hide the physics texts in the wood and forget about them? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's sort of disturbing too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do I have a desire to just forget about this part of my life which has been all consuming lately? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That dream coming up so suddenly after being here makes you wonder just what on earth is behind there that I don't know about or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's probably true. I haven't given much thought to dream analysis at all and I don't know if you think its poppycock or not. I thought that one was particularly interesting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't think its poppycock. I think it can often give you ideas of what's sort of going on in your mind. I think it can be meaningful. [0:09:04.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other dreams are just hilarious but they don't have any meaning, and if they did sort out the junk what is it? I really never realized how little I dream. I also often ask if I dream in color. Now it's clear that I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do in Technicolor. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well all I remember is the book was definitely Halliday and Resnick; it was a blue book with a red thing on the cover. That's the way the book is. That's how I identified it. One other dream I had paprika in it. I remember the red paprika. Oh I should mention some people came over last night and they were friends that knew me well like two years ago. And they called and said, "Hey I'm in town we're going to come over." I said, "Great come on over." I hung up the phone and immediately thought oh gee I'll have to change clothes and comb my hair and shave and stuff. Why am I doing that? They know I'm staying home studying. But I changed clothes anyhow. Then I was really worried about how I was going to act. I didn't make an ass out of myself. I crept inwards is what I did. I hardly emoted at all and we just had a little talk, discussion, about where our lives are going since we parted two years ago. But I was very much ill at ease during the whole thing. [0:10:41.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty much holding yourself in and trying not to make an ass out of yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I didn't come away with any feeling of disgust with myself, which so frequently happens, but I also came away feeling that there'd been no real interaction. I hadn't communicated with the people whom at one time I knew fairly well. I think they knew me. [0:11:06.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like in trying to stop making a fool of yourself, you stopped everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't end up not liking myself afterwards over which is what commonly happened. I would say, "Oh why did you do that?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This was different. It didn't end up with you disliking yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was all because I'm starting. I don't know if I'm starting for the better. I mean it's just sort of observation of mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a change. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Say can I ask you a question? Did you purposely fumble with the microphone last time when I first came in? I thought maybe you had to make sure my first reaction to you were blind was that I could see. [0:12:00.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I don't remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought maybe you had. I thought about that and I noticed how there's never been any problem with anything at all. Like the way you just put on the tape. It didn't fit in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. What happened is I didn't know which chair you were going to sit in? So I moved the microphone back I think probably from the edge last time when you sat in this chair. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I thought that that was one of the standard things that you might have done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Is the basic format of what we're going to do just for me to come and talk mostly? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah sort of. The idea is that what we think is helpful in therapy is for people to explore what they want to talk about. It's like you talk about what you want to and I'll try and help you through that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it puts...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Puts what? [0:13:00.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes it more all consuming with me because rather than going out and saying, "Well I'll wait until next time, we'll come in and we'll talk some more." I'm thinking about what will we talk about next time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I guess that's good. I don't know. It makes it more than the twice a week thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes it something that you think about in between. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like this dream thing I've been thinking about it quite a bit or just thinking about what to talk about. There was another thing. I had dinner at another friend's house and met some new people then. They were very very nice people but there wasn't much interaction involved and I don't think mainly because I was sort of a fifth wheel. That was a couple of nights ago. [0:13:59.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean you were trying to fit in? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The conversation was between them and among them. Well it was two married couples and one had a baby so there was more to discuss there. It was a pleasant evening but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were extra. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which didn't bother me. It was neither here nor there. But last night was something different again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Plus it was the people from out of town. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um. I think there might be a different way that I act with old friends. I don't know. I know when I meet high school friends again my most important thing is to express to them the fact that I'm really well educated now. I'm schooled and they're out in the world selling insurance and stuff. This was the important thing to me and oh Jesus really was obnoxious about it and had been obnoxious about it. It seemed to be the thing that I was fighting last night. [0:15:06.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To not do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Meaning I was a physicist and wanted to talk about my work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something happens when you see these people that you just get this urge to show them. Tell them all about this. Kind of play up the differences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think so. I once made an observation and I don't know if it's true or not. I think the NYU probably is the ultimate step in it that maybe belies it and says it isn't true. That all through my life I seem to have chosen a group that I can excel in rather than one that would be challenging. Rather than apply to... Well I was accepted at Princeton and rather than go to Princeton I went to Ryder. And a rationale that now I think is probably because I know that I could do better at Ryder. In high school I made the decision that I never would really excel. And I wasn't athletic enough to excel in the standard sports where there's a lot of competition like basketball, football and everything, so I chose swimming because if I put enough time in it I could overcome my lack of athletic prowess. I excelled somewhat. [0:16:33.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like choosing things that you could come out on top of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think New York is probably the ultimate thing that that would indicate. Although it might be. See when I decided to come to graduate school, all I wanted was to go to graduate school, but when I decided on which graduate school, the rationale was I'll go to the best one that will admit me; knowing of course that Harvard and Stanford wouldn't admit me because I went to Ryder as an undergraduate. They can afford to just take people that went to MIT and got a good physics education. Well I came here it being the only really good school that accepted me. I think that I knew when I came that I might have bit off more than I could chew. I don't know. I'm certainly not one of the better physicists here. [0:17:46.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is different like you're more in the middle of the pile here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It might have been. Yeah. Maybe I was just so with this tremendous ego I thought I could pull it off. No because I knew my limitations I think in physics. The more I think about the whole thing it seems to boil down on ego probably. [0:18:14.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of you thinking too much of yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. Pretty sure. Sometimes I go the opposite way but not really. I'm trying to think of an example. A good example, I don't know if you know Ti Sam Yung the restaurant down here, the Chinese restaurant. A great place right? Well we would go there, a group of us, and the standard idea was that we'd get about five dishes for six people or something like that. It became clear that everyone was going to eat as much as they could eat and for some reason, I wanted to, I really did and I was the biggest one there. I should have eaten more than anyone else and yet lately whenever we go there I go out of my way to take the smallest amount of everything. I think maybe I'm beginning to realize that maybe most of my motivation comes from this severe ego thing and maybe I'm trying to overcome it in small ways. But there aren't... [0:19:24.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Overcome it by say taking less food you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like when we clean the apartment out. I always do more than everyone else. I think I have this desire to do more than my roommates. I think it's good. That's one part of my self that enjoy. But it's only lately and I think it might be a reaction as I begin to examine why I behave the way I do. Maybe I'm starting to realize it. I'm probably an egocentric and maybe I'm trying to fight it out. [0:20:00.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like trying to go the other way and make up for that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I mentioned last time that I looked at the bad qualities in my parents as I grew up. I look back now on them, see which ones I've adapted and those are the most important things for me not to have. Like my father's temper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like going the other way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really pleased that you're doing that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'm pleased in the sense that it all makes for a nice guy and everything but it isn't me you know. I'm really getting confused when I talk about this. I don't know why I do certain things. I don't know. You see when I behave that way it's as though it's not comfortable to me because that's not the way I'm feeling at the moment. Like when I clean the apartment and do more than my share, I'm really mad that I'm doing more than my share. I wouldn't say anything and I really go out of my way to do more than my share. [0:21:25.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not natural. Like it's artificial. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the first time that I really noticed that too. I mean just now that I said that. It's very much like the way I behave when I'm with other people, that makes the problem that we're talking about, when I'm interacting with people that I'm worried about impressing. Again it's that honest. I'm not being honest with them at all. Do you have many people that are completely unexamined when they come in? [0:22:07.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A good number of them. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I could see where it just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have been completely unexamined to me either. But I can...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but things are getting so confusing. It's really different than it was supposed to be. I was supposed to come in here, talk for a few minutes and then you sort of spend the rest of the time straightening me out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see. So what's different is like the more you talk the more confused you get instead of the more straightened out? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well hopefully what will happen is I'll eventually get everything out and it'll start synthesizing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's pretty natural by the way when people often come in and get more confused as they begin to think about things they've never thought about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I suppose that I say things which is a great reason for having the tapes. I say things I will say them seasoned with my own analysis of them rather than as just an observation of my life. I'll say I do this because of this and then later I might say that I do something else for some other reason that is not consistent at all with the former reason. I keep thinking that I'm doing that you know. [0:23:24.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep thinking that you might be inconsistent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah which bothers me because I have a very consistent life. I mean personal matters are very well organized. Maybe I should mention that. That's probably one of my strongest characteristic traits and it's not a very deep trait. I don't know. It doesn't say much about my personality I don't think. That's that personal matters in my life are very well organized. I have like every letter I ever write made in duplicate and filed. The most trivial letter. An example, which is kind of an amusing example, we met our neighbors, one night when one of the girls, they're all teachers across the alley was grading papers. We made a sign on a big sign on a piece of paper and said, "Hi, do you want to play bridge?" We roped some broomsticks together and stuck it out across the alley and tapped their window. That was three years ago now. Subsequently one of my roommates and one of her roommates is now engaged. It looks like another one is going to. It's been quite a relationship between the apartments. But I saved that thing. I have that sign on file. It is the most ridiculous little thing. Why save that sign? As it turned out it's going to be very nice because the guy that wrote it, who's hand that it is in, is the one that's getting married to one of the girls over there. Had that sign up and may have not gotten married so I framed it and gave it to them as a wedding present. I think my most salient personal characteristic is that everybody noticed. [0:25:11.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being organized. Yeah. Yeah. And that's something you're very proud of too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No reason to be. I mean anyone could do it. It's just going to the opposite extreme. When I went to high school... Hey that's a good point. Coming up with all sorts of goofy things. When I went to high school I was really sloppy and like I'd go home and do this homework and I'd be lucky if I'd bring the right notebook to school to hand it in with. I didn't have anything in order. But I think this organization came when I went away to college. No I was going to say it happened very suddenly but it didn't, it took a couple years of college. [0:26:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The switch came when you went to college.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And got away from my parents. Yeah. I guess a lot of changes happen to people then. It's really reached its ultimate now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your organization.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I came to the NYU in 68 that was a big transition, of course, for me. Of course when you have a transition, if you begin to organize everything subsequent to that transition you have an entire block of your life completely organized. That probably was the reason why I came to the ultimate. I've got every paper I've ever written since 68 or every transaction I've had I have a record of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was it that you said about coming to a new place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you see I can't look at my life at Ryder as a whole unless I have a record of it because the early stages of my life there there's no real record of. I mean academically, financially, or anything. But ever since 68, you can ask me about anything that has happened since 68, any letter that I've written, any assignment that I've done, any check that I've written. Of course that's no big thing. But I have it. [0:27:30.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It sounds like that gives you kind of a solid feeling. A good feeling to have that all there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it is more of an obsession than I feel good. Yeah. I guess it does. I guess I do feel good. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you mixed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I have any feeling rather than mixed feelings. I think it's just a trait of mine that I realize I have. I have two very sloppy roommates so it's a real strong problem with the community rooms. Sometimes we have it aired out but others we haven't. That's interesting that I can't... The metamorphosis in my life came about I think well the strongest one probably when I first came here. All through undergraduate school, those four years, there was a slow one. That I think that eventually here went over the hump... [0:28:43.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the building but the really big changes were here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. I've mellowed since then. I was nearly a radical, not quite. I don't mean this politically. I mean the way I just treated life as a whole. Another thing that I did, in 67 I spent a year in Europe and I kept a diary there. I wonder if that's got anything to do with it. I kept a diary when I was there and every day... When I came back I worked at Argon National Laboratory and I was a just punk kid and didn't know any physics and I walked in there and was given a secretary and a technician. Wow, I didn't know what to do with either one of them. Both of them were just luck. I was the only one of all the students that had them. The technician I got because his boss had just been transferred very suddenly and he had no place to transfer to. And my supervisor, who by the way was the guy in the dream that I mentioned, one of the three that surrounded him at the end, my supervisor said, "Well why don't you work with this new kid we have coming in." So I had this technician who knew more than I did but yet hung on my every word for guidance and a secretary who was willing to type for me. So anyhow I took this diary that I had and while it was fresh in my mind, I wrote and wrote and wrote and I had her type it up. So I had that chunk of my life in a book form. All very neatly done. [0:30:34.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's satisfying to have that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. I sort of look forward to being 95 years old and sending my grandchildren up to the attic to get that so I could read it to them. It's really bad writing but it doesn't matter because it's my own words and it'll bring back the thoughts. [0:30:58.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The memories.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I wonder if that is the first real time I took a bulk of my life and organized it. I think it probably is. Yeah. There's no real way to know how I felt at different times of my life. If I could just sort of sort it all out. That might be it. You see right now I know how at any given point I know how I feel because I wrote this book and I'm sort of like writing another diary. It's such a big part of my life. I might as well mention it. I suppose I've tried to avoid it to fight the ego thing. It's something I'm very proud of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. Wait. What is that again? Oh I see. I understand. You're not going to tell me because you can't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I came in here and I decided well I'll tell her what's necessary but there's no sense... Well anyhow on Saturday I swam the English channel. That is probably a really big thing and I go into a crowd and big deal. Well the summers of 69 and 70 I trained very hard and the people that I trained with I got to know. They're a completely different world of people. A completely different sphere. They're the older group that I mentioned. Remember I said the...[0:32:19.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are the older group.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got to know them very well and I started right after the channel in September of 70, I started writing about them and what had happened because again I had a diary. But the diary, I didn't write for the purpose of avoiding my life or anything I wrote it strictly for the purpose of keeping track of my training schedule. And yet I put it in parenthetical expressions here and there so I have the summer of 69 and the summer of 70 down on paper.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that too is down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm writing again on that. [0:33:05.9] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're writing about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've stopped some shortly because I don't have time, but I wanted to put that down. You see a diary is one thing but to put it into a tomb, boring as it might be to anyone, as a record for myself is something different because a diary just sketches what happened then in my mind. And my diary does just sketches what happened that day, whereas I want to write how I felt and how my relationships have developed at that point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something much more complete and not just the momentary feeling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Unfortunately the thing about 69 and 70 is that there's more about what my weight was and what my stroke rate was than how I was feeling, but nevertheless it's recently enough in the past that there are enough things here and there about how I felt. [0:34:06.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't go back and finish it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If I get to it shortly that is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before you forget it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The channel thing has been something where I sort of reacted oppositely too. Like lately if I'm in a group and I have friends that know and I ask them not to mention it to others, boy that isn't like me at all. I'm really proud. One time I was at a cocktail party and one of my friends new it and he mentioned it to another person, a third party that I didn't know that he knew, and later on as our paths crossed and he said, "Hey Kevin said that you swam the channel." I said, "I did what?" and just denied it because I knew that I could get lost in the crowd again or that I could brush it off and maybe it would go by as a joke. That isn't like me either. [0:35:16.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you say it's not like me, you can't figure out why you do it or something strange or something? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I really like to bask in the glory of it. That's me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet you don't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's why there's no sense in my trying to avoid talking about it here. Yeah, I wonder, but that never bothered me. That's strange. It's the same thing as me not being myself. That's where the whole thing started with right? Not acting in social encounters like myself and yet these things where again I'm not acting like myself don't bother me at all. I don't end up hating myself for having denied the swim. [0:36:13.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a different quality to this not being yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's so confusing. I wish I would have known how ridiculous this was going to be I would have kept track of my entire life for the last couple of years. It certainly wouldn't have been hard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you could have used it here you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could pull out...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And drawn on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: August of 1969 file that we (Inaudible at 0:36:56.1) I thought lately I've been very content because I haven't been seeing people. Lonely and bored somewhat because I'm doing the same thing all of the time, just studying. Of course, I never get the opportunity to do something that would make me not like myself. [0:37:22.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like not being with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Basically what it is. It's so unlike me too because... I don't even know what I mean when I say me. But anyhow, when I look at like what is me I kind of look back to personal behavior say before I went away to school. High school because then your contacts with people are just so long. I mean you've known people for ten years and they see you every day at school, your peers, that there's no way in the world you can put on an air. No of course since then my thinking has changed an awful lot. I've become my own self rather than believing everything that people told me. I've changed but yet when I look back on behavior, I think I've grown away from myself rather than towards myself. Rather thinking I've grown towards myself rather than away from myself. I wonder if that makes any sense. I also have a file called worthwhile quotes. Whenever I run into something that I think is worthwhile, I clip it and put it in there. Gees I wish that I had them dated because they're so different. I've done this now for about three maybe four years, and some of the thoughts just revile me now but I keep them in there for historical records to have. I should remember that file next time. [0:39:20.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a file like that too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's comforting to know that I'm not the only crazy person. Gee wiz I keep trying new things that I want to bring up all the time. Do you think it's possible to find in a person one sort of motivating drive to find why he seems to do things? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you trying to look for that in yourself? [0:40:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Why do I do what I do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes you tick? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It would be comforting to know in and of itself. It's really strange that as examining as this discussion is well basically with a stranger. I find that fascinating. I think probably it's the only one that it could be done with maybe. You see unless you've got someone you're really in tight with, you build up so many walls and barriers, be the small or unimportant, that you couldn't talk about everything. I don't know if there's anyone I could talk about this sexual problem with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But me being a stranger makes it easier to talk about. [0:41:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And of course by virtue of the fact we've talked deeply about things, you're no longer a stranger. Strange part of that. I think probably the thing I've been avoiding is being more explicit about the sex problem but I might as well be. It bothered me quite a bit for a while. As I said, I don't know why, but I noticed finally that it only happened when I was stoned. By the way the reason that I stopped was not because of that. The reason that I stopped was because of this test coming up. My rationale is its like training for swimming.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the reason that you stopped getting... [0:41:53.2]</p>
<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My rationale, like, for swimming is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:41:58.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, give up everything. There's no sense not doing everything. Like of any one given day (inaudible at 0:42:02.9) five mile, they don't stop after four and a half just because that last half mile isn't going to help. Certainly the last half mile isn't going to help with everything, [does it] (ph)? So I've decided, you know, all sorts of things. Like the biggest (inaudible at 0:42:13.8) is I'm not going to watch any Cubs (ph) games.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a big thing for me, well, anyhow, where was I? I lost my train of thought. I know (inaudible at 0:42:25.6), oh, the smoking, yes. So I stopped the smoking and when I did, it never happened again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought back, and sure enough, the only times it did happen was when I was smoking. So I probably won't go back to smoking, I (inaudible at 0:42:38.9), just try it, see what happens when the test is over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:42:43.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyhow, the basic problem was that I was just taking on some of the characteristics and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I would - first of all, I should mention that, like, it would happen during masturbation and then to check it, I sort of, like, went up to see June when I was stoned. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To check...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To see if my motivation was - you know, if I was becoming transsexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I went up there and it was fine. I mean, everything was normal, so that was quite comforting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the only experience (inaudible at 0:43:29.0) came during masturbation, which I would fantasy having intercourse sort of with myself, which is - yeah, my breasts would become erotic or erogenous zones. And wow, I'm just beginning to realize that's probably boils down to the ego thing too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean about yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe in my mind the only one worthy of me, horrible thought. (Inaudible at 0:44:05.1), though, I don't know. But yeah, it was something that was really on my mind. And the four or five times it didn't seem to be abating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then came - well, the 1st of the year when I stopped smoking and that was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, prior to what you're saying (inaudible at 0:44:34.4), it sounds like that you're saying maybe it wasn't - it sounds like you were thinking before that wanting to have intercourse with yourself - with the feminine part, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the feminine part was that my body would take on feminine characteristics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see, but then it sounds like you said, well, maybe that was not just some sort of transsexual thing, but maybe that has to do with how I feel about myself compared with other people somehow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. The more you hear about the sexual abnormalities, you hear that they're probably as much physiological as psychological. And this might have been - and I think I mentioned earlier - a physiological thing that is just sort of a small, little part of - I mean, no one is a hundred percent male, a hundred percent female.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:45:39.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe these feminine characteristics that I have just came out because of the fact that my mind was messed up chemically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because I've made this analysis, I felt much better about the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now in talking about it, I think, well, maybe it is something psychological too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, it worries you because you can't pin it down at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not sure, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably - it worries me most when I thought that it seemed to be a trend that was taking place, and it might, you know, just completely...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might have been something to do with the fact that I was pretty much frustrated at that point. You see, the relationship I (inaudible at 0:46:43.4) with June because she's - I think (inaudible at 0:46:46.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was certainly not a good one at all. I mean, it wasn't - it was exploitive more than anything. And that it has been a while since I had a good relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so you didn't have a good, satisfying relationship with anybody? And you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's strange, I don't know. (Inaudible at 0:47:15.4) I seem to be mellowing (ph) and going over (inaudible at 0:47:16.2). I mean, I don't have the hot pants that I used to. I don't - I'm more worried now about getting my degree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Than about sex?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you see, I was (inaudible at 0:47:29.6). They say that - that's one of the reasons June, I think, is so clinging to me is that she's aware that she's not going to get married, and she's looking for someone. And that bothered me a little when I saw my friends dropping like flies and getting married. Then I saw too many of them changing diapers and stuff. And I decided that that's - (inaudible at 0:47:53.1) was 40.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I mean, I don't have to be in any hurry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and maybe I have other things to get through right now that worry me more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One other thing - I hope I'm not confusing you (inaudible at 0:48:18.6) too many things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're worried about that's what will happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the thing is, you know, if we talk about a problem, which - well, if we talk about a problem that I'm worried about, that's one thing. And if we talk about me, I mean, I could just go on and on and on and on. And we could just be feeding information into that tape recorder over there without ever having settled anything down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:48:41.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And may be - every little bit that you add - initially when you add a bit of information about - what I add (ph) a bit of information about myself to this bank of knowledge that we have, it certainly can be helpful. I just came in and said, well, help me, you couldn't do anything. But if I give you information, that's fine. But I - there certainly must be a point where the stuff I'm giving you is just - it's got to be confounding more than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it does seem that way to me. But I guess there's one thing I'm not clear about, and that's how you feel about the tape recorder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I had mentioned it a couple of times (inaudible at 0:49:19.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, okay, for starters, when I first came in it was really disconcerting, okay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I forgot about it. And since then I've really - I'm happy that it's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I've never been able to really straighten everything out. But if I just keep doing - hopefully, because it's recorded, it's there and it can be, you know, straighten around and the pieces will fit together, and it will make some sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, like you could listen back to it, is that what you're talking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, one good. I don't know (inaudible at 0:50:00.5) new me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you were thinking maybe I could (inaudible at 0:50:05.1)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but the thought is that if there is going to be any - you know, if I am going to change the things that are bothering me, I'm not going to change it by an incomplete analysis of myself. [0:50:23.1]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a complete analysis (inaudible at 0:50:24.6), oh, this is cool, a complete analysis that's right into the file system.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's why I like the tape recorder because it's just putting me in the, you know, the manila folder.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The file and diary, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's cool. Well, before you mentioned the tape recorder, the thing that I was going to mention - another part of me - after the Channel I started to look for something else. And I guess this fits into the, you know, always finding a group that I could excel in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I decided I was either going to solo across the Atlantic or climb Mount Everest. And I've begun a real concentrated effort on solo sail across the Atlantic. Concentrated effort on doing research and seeing which of these are the most plausible. I mean, I read six or eight books on Everest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've got three or four on sailing that I'm going to read as soon as I get the exam out of the way. And it really shows that I'm achievement oriented, you know? I just can't be - well, here I am, you know? I got to say, well, I did this, I did that, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This number - it seems that way anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, and keep adding more things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You find you want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like - oh, yeah, see, there's another thing I thought of and that's all this work in physics sadly boils down to one little piece of paper that they're going to hand me in an envelope, and it's going to have an M, an F or a P, a Masters, Pass or Fail on it. It has to be pass in order for me to go on with my work. And that is the thing I'm thinking of, that little piece of paper, you know? [0:52:23.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not at all any knowledge of physics. Not being competent in my field.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but you eye is on that piece of paper?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because that's - I don't think that's my fault. I mean, that's what the university (inaudible at 0:52:34.2) I have to have, that piece of paper before I can go on and do anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, so you don't blame yourself for that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's a rationalization. Yeah, you see, if I were to develop to a point where I really was comfortable in everything I'm supposed to (inaudible at 0:52:54.8) for this exam, and then didn't pass it, I couldn't comfortably say, well, that's all right, I knew it anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I should be able to say that. I don't think I could. Yet, I don't know. Well, at any rate the whole thing (inaudible at 0:53:14.4) it seems to me (inaudible at 0:53:19.7) my life boils down to, well, after I achieve something saying, well, all right, this is the next thing. And it (inaudible at 0:53:24.7) substantial - not substantial, very well defined thing. You know, this is what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's well defined?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The next thing in my mind. I mean, it's very clear what it means to sail across the Atlantic. It means getting in a boat on one continent, and then getting off of that boat on the other continent with no one else having helped you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like the goal to - that some people might have to have a happy family life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, it's very worked out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And very clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And well defined.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well defined, yeah, mapped out or map able (ph) out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not nebulous or anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and that's - maybe I only pick ones that are well defined. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but you can say, this is exactly how it will go? [0:54:21.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Four years of my athletic life was spent with one goal, and I never reached - never attained.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was the school record in one particular event. And I did it within, you know, fractions of a second, never got - and that probably did a lot to me. Having something, you know, that was there, well defined. And when I left I had sort of a guy that really respected me a lot. I don't know why. We swam the same stroke, and when I left I said, you got to get that record. And I didn't really want him to get it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For his sake, I wanted him to get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For your sake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For my sake, so that his name would go on the board and it would clear that even if I had held it, it would be erased after he reestablished the record. And that was pretty much blatant ego that made me want - you know, wanted him to do it. By the way, (inaudible at 0:55:25.9) told me that he did get the record.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did he? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that was satisfying for me. Well, Wednesday at ten?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could I see your (inaudible at 0:55:34.3) watch?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you ask me next time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, all right, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ask me next time because I'm (inaudible at 0:55:40.6) go do something, but (inaudible at 0:55:40.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would imagine it would be an engineering feat to make a (inaudible at 0:55:50.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I'll see you Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you at ten, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, goodbye.</p>

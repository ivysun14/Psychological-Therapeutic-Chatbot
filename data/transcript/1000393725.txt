<p>PATIENT: (2-minute silence) It's, it's a strange reaction I have to (Clears throat) beginning today, because I have been thinking about something.  I—, it's what we were talking about yesterday.  And, I've been thinking about it a lot, last night and then today.  And it didn't seem to — I mean it was bothering me in that there was something I knew I didn't fully understand or wouldn't face.  But, I'd still think about it, and it wasn't something I kept saying, "I'm not going to think about it."  And I expected not to mind talking about it here, but now I feel very reluctant. (Pause, Sniff)</p>

<p>I know when I went home last night and was thinking about it, I was thinking if the thoughts I'd ended on, which were, I don't know almost, almost a way to deny something else I'd said earlier.  Because I, I remember I kept saying — it was almost to convince myself, too — that it wasn't that I didn't think I could become pregnant, so much that I was afraid of it, of being pregnant.  And then, and that was thinking in terms of specifics, things connected with pregnancy. </p>

<p>But when I got home I kept thinking, that's not really it or, it m—, it's part of it, but there's something much more important.  And I think earlier I'd sort of gotten at it when I said something about I'd, or I don't know if I said it that way then, but at home I was thinking of it more that it was some kind of a test of how feminine I am.  And I'm afraid I can't meet it.  And I'm not sure whether I'm afraid I can't meet it to the point of not being pregnant, or if it's that after I'm pregnant, which sort of asserts my femininity, then I can't meet it.  And this is what I don't understand. </p>

<p>And then, today I was, when I was coming down on the subway, there was a woman sitting with a child on her lap and her husband next to her.  At least, I assumed it was her husband, since they were obviously together.  And it just struck me then that — well first I thought I'd love to be just like her, having a child.  And then I thought, no, I wouldn't, because then I'd be responsible.  And I can't even feel responsible for myself.  And then I started thinking of I'd be responsible to the point that, if something happened to MSCZ, I might be totally on my own, so that I'd have to provide in every way for the child.  And then, also I was thinking just in terms of a way a woman has responsibility  for home and for the children.  I didn't even know if I could do that, even if MSCZ were there.  And that made me think again of this fear that somehow I can't function as a woman in a, in a responsible way. (Pause)</p>

<p>The other thing I've thought of off and on today, and I guess this particular thing I hadn't wanted to think beyond just remembering something I dreamed last night, but — and I don't know whether it has any connection with earlier, because I went to bed fairly early and uh, (Sniff) in a way I wanted to read and in a way I wanted MSCZ to want to make love to me.  And he didn't come to bed right away, so I started reading.  And then it was kind of late by the time he did, and I, it was sort of I was back thinking, it's too late now.  But I didn't really just say no.  And so he did start to make love to me and I responded enough so that I didn't want it to end, but on the other hand, I felt angry that I was responding, I think.  I don't know, I felt angry about something, anyway.  And I didn't have an orgasm. </p>

<p>And then it — in the middle of the night I woke up.  And I know it was really a dream, because I was dreaming that we were having intercourse.  But it seemed like it was real, and I was close to him, and it was as if I just had to get away. (Sniff, Silence, Sigh, 2-minute silence, Sniff)</p>

<p>It's funny, I'd just — I started thinking about what I did at school today, in terms of — I had planned to leave early and get home and do some work on the reports, and instead, I just sort of hung around.  It sort of happened that uhm, FBS didn't have much to do and she had to wait until 3:00 because she had a dismissal.  And so she came in to talk, but then I chose to just sort of sit and chat, rather than get done what I wanted to and leave.  And, it was almost as if I didn't want to leave.  And I realized too I started thinking about it, because I don't want to think about other things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes, for example the dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) In a way I suppose, both things that I've mentioned today because in both cases, n—, in the way I react toward intercourse, and in the way I react about just being a woman and particularly having children, I don't understand it.  And I know there's some kind of a t—, I don't know tension, or clash or contest between 2 different feelings in me.  And I don't understand how I've come to feel the way I do, and I keep thinking of that, rather than just thinking well, this is the way I feel. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know whether I'm just wandering because I don't want to think about all the things, or whether there's some reason I think of this now.  But, I suppose I was thinking, just trying to think to some extent, how I was feeling last night.  And all I would think of then was the fact the woman who lived under us, moved.  And yesterday was when she had the movers come and she finally left for good.  And I was feeling sort of sad last night because I liked her, though we hardly ever saw her.  But I don't know, just somehow, it was a familiar situation.  And now she's not there so things are different. (Sniff)  And then I thought of my assistant, who just finally found an apartment today.  She's been looking all fall.  And how I, I really did feel happy for her. (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's seems funny to me that I can control myself in so many ways, but I can't keep thinking about something, because now I'm thinking about some reading games I can play at school.  And I know when I start doing that, that I'm avoiding thinking about something else. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Why do you feel you're doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm, why am I avoiding thinking about something else? </p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, specifically the 2 things you say you feel you're avoiding.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it just occurred to me that it was almost — because I have this habit of not letting myself think about things that are disturbing.  (Pause, Sigh, Pause)  And if I think about the fact that I can't get beyond just recalling if I had the dream, it almost seems that when I think of having it, having had it, and the fact that in the dream I was enjoying the fact I was having intercourse, and woke up not wanting to have that feeling anymore, I, I don't understand why it's a feeling I don't want to have.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What occurs to you?  What possibilities?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, I thought at some point that while I was here, it must be somehow related to the fact that once I wanted to have intercourse with my father.  Because I can't understand why else I would think of it as such a bad feeling.  And I, was just —</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Interrupting) But it's here that you didn't want to talk about it, which must mean something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't think I'd want to talk about it anywhere. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, but you did think about it, at least, you said you had thought about it.  It's here that you block yourself.  It's me you don't want to talk to about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, I don't understand why I wouldn't want to talk about it with you.  Except that I was just remembering another part of this feeling.  Because it wasn't even in — I don't know, when I woke up, it wasn't even as if I'd had some dream where things were happening.  It was just a feeling that I was having intercourse, and it was as if there were just a penis.  But there weren't, there wasn't a body or a person.  I mean it wasn't that I was thinking of having it with MSCZ, so much as though I was just aware of the feeling of a penis inside me.  And maybe that has something to do with that I don't want to face who it was I was thinking of, or whether I was thinking of anyone, I don't know. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think that — at least now when I think of it, it bothers me that (Clears throat) it wasn't connected with MSCZ, really.  Because it's almost as if, if the dream had been specifically MSCZ making me want to have intercourse with him, and then dreaming that I was, I don't think I'd feel the way I do. (Sigh, 4-minute silence with intermittent stomach rumbles)</p>

<p>It's almost as if then I just come to a point where I, I don't know what to think because I don't understand.  And I was just wondering (Clears throat) why that dream was so upsetting, whether I was just afraid of feeling that way at all, and that it was somehow wrong to feel that way, just — I don't know how to, I don't know, I suppose the way to say what I was thinking would be almost as if it were some kind of a lust or something, and evil or bad.  And then the other thing I was wondering is, if what I'm afraid of is that it means I'll become promiscuous or that it means I could become promiscuous, in that it isn't any one man that I want to have intercourse with. </p>

<p>And the next thing I knew I was thinking about the gym teacher that (Clears throat) I had to do something with today.  And I — he had been South over the vacation, and I remember while I was working with him thinking, he looks very handsome tanned.  And it was — I was very aware of him as a man.  Yet, I didn't think in terms of being physically attracted to him. (Silence)</p>

<p>(Clears throat) I don't know (Softly), for some reason I think again, of something that came up when I was talking about my reaction to that New Year's Eve party I went to, when I was so upset about MSCZ flirting with the girl that he was.  And also being upset at the dinner partner I had, and the fact that the dinner partner didn't seem to want to be with me.  And it was sort of the combination of the 2 things that I remember thinking or, I even said here, no matter how many other men showed they were attractive to me, attracted to me, it wouldn't make any difference, because those two things had happened.  And I, I keep thinking of my father when I think of that, as if somehow I'd been trying to make up for his lack of interest. (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Have you found yourself thinking about MSCZ's flirting from time to time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean, that particular incident? </p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhuh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Clears throat) I think I've thought more of the fact that I said what I did, whenever it was, last week I guess, about, it didn't seem it would make any difference how many men were attracted to me.  Because for some reason, I hadn't ever thought of things that way before.  And then that would make me think of MSCZ's flirting.  But, I don't think I've thought so much about MSCZ's flirting.  Ah, (Clears throat), I don't know whether this came to my mind again because last night MSCZ spoke with one of the people who'd been at the dance.  And the fellow had been one of the men who'd been near me most that evening.  And it wasn't — well, in a way, I mean I knew he liked being with me, but, half the time he was talking about the firm which he's left, that he used to work with MSCZ.  And, really I think he feels very insecure about it.  And so he needed to talk about it.  And then he talked also about his wife, and so in a way, I knew I was trying to attract him to me to keep him there, because it made me feel good that he was.  But in another way, not much was happening, and his wife ended up feeling about that situation the way I felt about MSCZ and the girl he'd been flirting with. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Which was how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, feeling very upset that he'd spent all that time with me.  And therefore, ignored her.  Although to me, the situation was very different, because (Clears throat), people enjoyed her company and she always seemed very busy and well taken care of.  And, I don't know, it makes me think maybe I looked the same way, when it wasn't so, to me.  And obviously I guess, it wasn't so to her, because she was upset. </p>

<p>I remember though, when — I think it was the next day after the party — (Clears throat) when I knew MSCZ had just been, I don't know, making him, uh — he felt more masculine — the fact that he could flirt with this girl and she would be attracted to him.  And that there wasn't really anything else in it.  But somehow, it was bothering me.  And I think it still does if I think about it now, that he needed, sort of get that boost to himself.  And also part of it was that he was flirting with the girl in a way that I would notice.  Because he was aware of wanting me to see he was flirting with her.  And somehow the fact that he needed something and, or needs something, because it isn't something that disappeared.</p>

<p>I don't know, it hadn't, this, now this is something I did—, hadn't thought of before.  It just struck me that what he needs is a response from me that will make him feel more masculine.  Before I, I was thinking of it more, that it was unrelated to me, it was something he needed completely from within himself. And (Clears throat), but to make him feel more masculine, I have to be able to be more feminine. </p>

<p>ANALYST: And you are afraid that to be feminine, in the sense that you dreamed about, at least, is a sign of evil lustfulness, it's bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that way I must.  And then, just now when I was thinking of being feminine in order to make him feel more masculine, it was almost I'd have to accept a weaker position, and I mean, it was just a sign of weakness, really.  That, or — I don't know how to explain it.  I mean it would be — I suppose I was thinking of things like it would mean not constantly trying to be aggressive with him, and assert my opinion, or my, hmm, almost authority, I guess.  Because I think this is something that really bothers me, that the thought of the man being in charge of the house, and the wife being sort of under the man.  And I, I don't even think of it in terms of there are things that the man would decide about and then the things that a woman would decide about.  But simply, if you accept a man as the head of the household then you are subservient if you're a woman. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it seems like I fluctuate from either fighting that and wanting to be, well, I always have said, sort of an equal voice in things.  And that uh, I don't know, it's like always deciding together we'd be sort of co-leaders or something, which is a concept I'd always had that this is the way my parents were.  And I don't know why I've had it.  And then other thing is, I'll suddenly switch and be very dependent and accept him as being the authority, but almost as a father and not as a husband.  Not accept him, but I, I try to make him be the authority as the father over me. (Pause)</p>

<p>And if I think about what I have some vague feeling is being feminine and an attitude toward authority or whatever you can call it, it's almost as if I, I know there is some way that being feminine means in this regard.  But I don't, I can't visualize it. (Pause)  Or if I start trying to, I can get as far as somehow feeling that it has to do with sort of a breaking down of authority, and there'd be certain things that would be a woman's area for decision.  And then there would be things for a man.  And I can keep seeing the house is an area for a woman.  But then I kind of don't understand what would be for a man, except then it would make a woman subservient.  And that, I keep getting back to that, but — (Silence)</p>

<p>For some reason this comes to my mind and (Sigh), I was thinking about the fact that MSCZ does not want us to have a television in the house.   And there've been times when I've wished we've had one.  Because either there, there've been good specials on, or else, if he's away a lot or working very late a lot, and I'm tired, I think it would be nice just to have a television to be able to look at once in a while.  And yet somehow the fact that, I think also he's saying we aren't going to have one, that makes me feel, well we are, too.  I can go buy one.  And then, then I just know his attitude is if he feels we aren't going to have one, he's the one to decide.  And, recently we were talking about it, and he explained why he felt that way, in such a way that I agreed with him as I never have before, and understood what he meant.</p>

<p>But I don't know, there's — I just feel very mixed up about — I mean this just seems an example of here he wants to be the authority, and I don't know whether I want him to be or not.  And I do—, I guess I'm afraid too that, if he starts being the authority in things like that, it would be as if he were just telling me, "We're not going to have a television."  I'd be just sort of a mindless creature who would then say, "Whatever you say," and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So explain. Clemency. All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we all had to create these big, big poster boards and stuff like that. So it should be really, really fun. They did one last… no, it was in the summer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I know you’re doing this through the student organization.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s for my class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But why? You said, “I waited till 41 to get all soft.” What does that mean, Yvette?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I’m like a crab egg now. Everything is like if I see something and somebody is struggling or they hurting and then there I go. Ooh, what can I do? What you need? Oh my God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that soft?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. Because I cry at everything. I cry when I’m happy. I cry. Oh my God. I’m like, what? (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you see that as being a negative?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) No. Maybe to some people if they don’t know. But I mean no. No. [00:01:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you’re just in more in touch with your emotional self?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I am. Yea. All those years of being… and now, yea. It’s different. It’s like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’s different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it just comes now. And I just say forget it. I let it come.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you’re OK with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that’s been the final theme of our work was all the sort of traumatic situations you’ve been through that you’ve sort of kept bottled up. And maybe you just don’t feel that you have to do that anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t think I have to do that anymore. And now I tell you, oh man. Now some things I may. But sometimes I just… if I feel like doing it, I just do it. Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s quite a change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did what you told me to do, too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You said when I’m reading, just read.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right. That’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I’ve been doing it. Oh, it was so hard at first. (chuckling) Oh my goodness. I had that dictionary. (laughing) [00:02:01] I’m afraid to pull it out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought about it. I said, “Nope.” Dr. Peterson said, “Do not pick up the dictionary. Just keep reading. And just keep reading and just let it go. And just keep on reading.” And I’m noticing I can get my work done a little bit faster. And I really didn’t… well, at first I did. I was like, oh, look in the dictionary. And I said, “No, don’t get the dictionary.” But then I go back and I’m like, no, I got to know. But then I was like, nope, just don’t do it. So what I did, well, I put the dictionary out of the room so I couldn’t reach for it. So I got like three dictionaries sitting on the table. They all got different stuff in it but… (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yvette, you crack me up. So wait. So you were able to not look up words. That’s huge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, that’s big. Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s big. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So tell me how that felt to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Weird. I’m telling you. At first, I felt like something was missing. [00:03:03] Like I had to get the dictionary. But then I don’t know. It was like when I took the dictionary, I didn’t feel like going in the room to go get it. So I was like maybe that’s what I need to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what did you learn that you understood as you read?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if I keep reading then later on that word would make sense. So I’m kind of getting that. And then, too, I noticed that now when I’m listening to people talk and they use a vocabulary word that I’m unfamiliar with, guess what. I just made this big discovery that was in my face the whole time that listen to the word. Look at the word really, really good. It’s just an extension of this word. If you really look at it, it’s nothing spectacular. It’s just that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re looking at the root word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Where at first, it’s like I’m reading it and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think our work is done. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, and I’m like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s really huge. So wait. Let me just make sure I understand. So you read without having to pull out the dictionary every time you don’t…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …know a word. And how much has that sped up your work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, a whole lot. Where it would’ve taken me let’s say a few hours to do like that one little itty bitty assignment, I noticed that I got it done… because now I’m not going to lie. I did stumble. I was really trying to figure it out but without the dictionary. And then I said, no, I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to read. I’m just going to read it. And when I was doing it, then I noticed, I said, dang. Man, look how much faster. I would say I got it done where it would’ve normally taken me let’s say four hours. I got it done in half the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Two hours. So you saved yourself two hours.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I saved myself two hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you could do… use for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s pretty significant. [00:05:01] Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you take away from that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I don’t have to put all this pressure on me. (chuckling) And I started laughing. I said because you told me that. But I just couldn’t get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But so what made you finally get it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I was tired. Do you know what I mean? I am so serious. I was just… my body just didn’t want to move. And I mean, even to pick up the dictionary. I knew I wanted to but I just didn’t have the energy to pick it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. And I don’t think you should never, ever use a dictionary. But…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it’s… I mean, you’re always going to run across words you don’t understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s a confidence issue. It’s kind of trusting that you’re going to get the context.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So once you remove the pressure of having to learn, know absolutely everything…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …you can read for the main idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Exactly. [00:06:00] I was like, oh wow. I’m doing this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I’m like, oh man. So all this time this… what? Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you just had to trust yourself. And you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know what I did today? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’d you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something that I ordinarily would’ve ran from but I didn’t.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: An e-mail came. It’s my school e-mail. And I said, hmm. It was Undergraduate Research Program. And I said, well, it’s not like it’s directly toward me. It’s for all students and all disciplines. So I just have to get it. I’m just going to read it. And I was reading it and I saw the word “research.” And I’m like research, ooh. I shy away from research. I hate research. At least this is what I programmed in my head. </p>

<p>I don’t like research because the computer does not like me. I type in what I want and it gives me something else. That drives me nuts. Then if I really need to do something and it freeze up on me and everything is time sensitive, I am nuts, right? [00:07:09] Made me not like the computer very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I’m not a fan myself. But OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then when I read that, I said OK. I said, well, do I have class? What do I have to do? I said I know what I’m going to do. I’m not going to work that day. I’m going to go and check that out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you checking out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The Undergraduate Research Program. And when I went - when I first walked in - I was looking at everybody. I said, there ain’t no students in here. (chuckling) Ooh, that is not for me. That was for faculty and staff is what I was thinking. But then when I walked up then and they just said, “What is your name? Did you preregister?” I said, “Yes, I did.” And she found my name. She said, “OK.” She said, “Go ahead. Find your seat. Get something to eat.” I said, “Ooh, eat food? OK.” </p>

<p>So went and got me a cup of coffee and I was looking and I found Selena Snow and some people. [00:08:01] I said, oohwee. And after then I saw Professor Wyatt. I said, oh no. This isn’t for me. This is all… this is for the higher ups. This is not for students. I’m in the wrong place. But well, since I’m here I might as well eat their food and drink their coffee and… (chuckling) And so I did. And then I started looking around. I said, oh, I think he might be a student (inaudible at 0:08:21). I said, what difference does it make? They told me to sit down. So I was like I’m battling. I’m having this battle with myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you stopped questioning yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And when I sat down and I was drinking my coffee. And then I introduced myself to the people at the table. You know I’m a friendly person. I speak to everybody, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then I sparked up a conversation with two people and had no idea that I was sitting next to the provost. I had no idea that I was. And I was just… they said, “Well, what is your major? And what made you do this.” And I’m just being myself. And I’m just talking to them and everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re just being you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And when I looked at the name tag, I said, ooh, provost. [00:09:03] It’s OK. I said, oh, maybe I should’ve been a little bit more professional. And then I was like, no, don’t worry about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say professional, how are you not professional?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean, because instead of me using like a lot of comfort words and just being comfortable, I think I would’ve been more…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Comfort words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …articulate with my words. And like my comfort words like yea, you know. And I mean, because…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? Because the provost never says, “Yea, you know.”?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, but I thought… you see, there I go again. I mean, but because it was an inaugural thing and I thought… and then I said, dang. I’m underdressed. (chuckling) Well, I didn’t know. I said, well, I’m not being… I’m not a recipient of anything or anything. I’m just visiting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re a student.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And I am just visiting. And I had to put that in my head. And then I’m like, OK. [00:10:00] And then when they started the program and I was hearing about all the things that they were doing. And I said I am glad that I came. I had no idea. I said all that garbage I put in my head about research, I said I have to eliminate that because research is a good thing. </p>

<p>And when I see the differences, it’s just like you hear people talk about all this person you read about in the newspaper say, “Oh, this person. They’re a researcher. They’re this, they’re that.” And I’m just thinking this smart person and they play with dirt and they look at books. (chuckling) And they write all these papers. (chuckling) And now I’m sitting here and I’m listening to them and thinking I like this. I think that I would like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when you wrote your business plan, you had to do some research on the business plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually no. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you know how to write a business plan?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Oh yea, well, you’re right. I did look for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. As a student, you have to research things…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I did that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …all the time - how to write a paper. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I find interesting about this story is how you were uncomfortable because you didn’t figure out if you were supposed to be there. Then you became comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you talked yourself out of being comfortable. But when you are you, you’re comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you are authentically yourself, you’re comfortable and people respond to you. You’re exactly the type of student who should’ve been there - smart, capable, energetic, dynamic, interested, focused. That was for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I felt like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I did. I felt like that. And…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you, Yvette. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like wow. I said, here I am now. Another dimension in my crazy world that I feel like now I have to try it out. [00:12:09] And now I’m thinking, here you go again. You’re adding more stuff onto your plate when you can’t already handle the stuff you’re doing now. But I keep picking up stuff. What is my problem? It’s like I walk around and I see…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you enjoying what you’re picking up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That’s why you’re doing it. See, the difference is you’re enjoying it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it’s so much. I am already overwhelmed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. And it’s November. I mean, the semester is about to be over. So that’s (inaudible at 00:12:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. But then next semester, I’m already a mess. And here I go again. Now I just signed up for this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and we can talk about ways to take certain things off your plate. But this is your time and this is the first time you’ve gotten a chance to focus on what you want. So you’re probably like a kid in a candy store.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am. I feel like a little kid and I have to tone it down sometimes. (chuckling) [00:13:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you, Yvette.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my goodness. It’s funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am so proud of you and happy for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like a little kid. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) I mean, it’s always been there but you are really growing in your confidence and trying new things. And growing and stretching. I mean, the fact that you are able to read without kind of having to stop. I mean, you’re really beginning to trust yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, and oh man. Ooh, it felt good, too, because I was like golly. I was beating myself up like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you’re not anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you probably won’t go back to doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t think I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t think you will either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I don’t not… mm-mmm. I feel like OK. I want to do this. I want to do that. I want to try this. And then I’m thinking don’t go committing yourself to stuff when you’re going to have to be there for these people and then you’re not going to be able to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you probably have enough now. [00:14:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had enough before I went there. I shouldn’t have went there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. But it’s an opportunity that you really…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And I’m like God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you’ll enjoy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Why do I do this? I have 15 credit hours for next semester. But…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me stop for a second. So why… besides it’s your time and besides being interested in all these things, why are you seeking out these opportunities?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to get a good job. No?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s only a very small part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s a small part?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I believe it to be a small part.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought that was the big part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-mmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-mmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I enjoy it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Besides that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Well…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re at this research presentation. And I said it’s made for students like you. And what did you say to me? [00:15:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. The more confidence that you have in yourself, the more you sort of seek more opportunities to grow because you know you can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that makes a lot of sense. That’s why I keep picking up stuff and that’s why… and just before I came here, I saw Desiree and I told her, I said, “Girl, next time you’re ready to do something, e-mail me. I’ll help you.” There I go again committing myself to stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are handling it. You are… I mean, you have 15 credit hours but you know you can do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Can I have your honest opinion?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don’t know if I made a mistake or not. My classes next semester is basically all communications classes. [00:16:05] (pause) I think three of them are communication and one is the second English that I need. And then the other two, I’m not really worried about those because they are just workshops. So that’ll be over with in no time. But I’m a little concerned because I’m thinking about all the research, all of the writing. My brain is going to crash. I’m just wondering is that like academic suicide? Like really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it’s academic suicide?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I’m wondering.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it is? (pause) Just yes or no, forced choice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don’t.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. That’s right because you trust yourself. [00:17:03] It may be a rough semester but you know you’ll get through it. You trust yourself. You’ve been doing this degree program for a while so you know what you can handle so no. (pause) No. (pause) And your first response was no. That’s why you signed up for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you know you could do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no. I told myself I did it because I didn’t want to wait until 2015 to graduate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. But Yvette, you also know you can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, but I’m scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I’m thinking…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you’re going to do it anyway. That’s the great thing about you. You’re scared. Do it anyway…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Do it anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: …as well as five other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And do you know that’s what my… the thing was in Toastmasters? I feel the fear and going to do it anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did that. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’ve been doing that. That leads me to some thoughts I have we’ve been talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m listening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) We’ve done our stuff here, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We did?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Haven’t we?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don’t read… I don’t need my dictionary as much more. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean I made a lot of progress. I do feel that. I’m much lighter now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was always there. It was just about embracing what’s there. You’ve always been smart and capable and ambitious. But you just…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just had to figure it out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. You had to look at the data. The data is you’re a good student. [00:19:02] You do well. And now you’re finally starting to enjoy it. And the restrictions for enjoying it and challenging yourself and doing the things you’ve always wanted to do. And so nice smile. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And then I mean, like yea. A lot of stuff going good. My granddad doing good. I was at his house Sunday and walked right through the door. And he had the radio blasting. And he was in kitchen. I’m like, “Daddy?” He’s like, “Yea, I’m in the kitchen.” He’s in the kitchen making his steak and his rice and everything. And I was like all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things are going well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m happy for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yea. Oh, thank you. I mean, because I’ll tell you. It feels really good. And then I had to think to myself. I kept saying, why did I lose that? What is it? And now it seems like that I don’t have much to do. I’m about to lose my mind (inaudible at 00:20:02). (chuckling) Because I’m so used to always, OK, I got to go do this, do this. Got to go here, I got to do this, got to. </p>

<p>And now I had to tell myself, I said, wait. So today is Tuesday. And I said, I got to meet with Dr. Peterson today at three. I want to go over here to the inaugural thing and check those… check that out and see if I like it or whatever. And then I said, wait, class. My class is doing a presentation on the Hall of Governors. That’s why I was like, what a minute. What about class?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you’re managing. You always manage and you’re managing. And if you’re honest with yourself, you’re enjoying it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, I’m enjoying it. I’m enjoying the…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m enjoying you enjoying it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, thank you. I’m even trying to pull other people in with me. I hear people saying, “Oh, when I get this bachelor’s, I’m done.” I said, “No, you’re not. You got to come back and get that master’s degree. Then you got to wait two years.” I remember you told me that. “You got to wait two years. And then we come back and try for that Ph.D. You have to do that.” [00:21:04] And everybody say, “No, you’re going to do that.” And I say, “And you’re going to do it with me.” (chuckling) So I think they will think I’m nuts. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what you do you think it would be like if we didn’t see each other anymore even though I’ll always be there. So if you ever need to come back for what I like to call tune-ups, I’m here. But…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am definitely going to need a tune-up. Yea, you cannot go anywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have been here a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to retire from here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will tell my boss that. But what would it be like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Weird because I’ll be thinking, oh, it’s Tuesday. I got to go see Dr. Peterson (chuckling) But…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you’re ready?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I’m OK. At least now since… especially since you told me I can always come and see you when…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yea, well, I’m good as long as you’re here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’m here. [00:22:01] But the things that we started off working on, it’s always been about the confidence issue. Some of it’s been about the trauma issues or understanding how you felt stuck or delayed and how your life circumstances led you to not be able to go to college at 18. But wow, you’re doing it now. You are doing it. What do they say? You’re doing the damn thing, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey. I am so happy for you, Yvette.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my goodness. Oh, thank you. And then I like the research thing because they were like, “We want ideas.” And I’m like, oh man, my head would be so full of ideas. Really? I said that’s right up my alley. Oh my goodness. And then I just talked to the mayor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t… I’m not familiar with…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, she’s the mayor of the area. And she’s also Toastmasters. And I think I was telling you about the (inaudible at 00:23:02) club here. [00:23:05] They… with the… how… CP… CBA - the business college. And what they do is they come up with different ideas on how to generate revenue and stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right. And your idea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was thinking. I said, OK. So the mayor, I contacted her to see if she could help me out with the…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look at you contacting the mayor and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: …ideas. And I was like, oh, it feels like Yvette. I said, “Oh first mayor, how’s your foot?” (chuckling) I thought I should say that first. I would call her for help that her foot messed up. Let me regroup for a minute. “How is your foot, mayor? Are you OK?” It’s just like, “Yvette, yes girl. My foot is fine. It’s better.” I said, “OK.” I said, “Well, I don’t know how busy you are but I like to run something by you. And if you can help me out with this, I really appreciate it.” [00:24:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just decide to contact the mayor. Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she told me… or actually texted me and said that she had a funeral to go to and then a meeting. And then she texted me back and said she’s sorry she didn’t get back with me when she said she was. And I told her, “I understand. I learned that patience is… to be patient is a virtue. So it just be my better luck that I give you the time you need so then maybe then I can get what I need.” So…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yvette, you are on your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope so. When you say that, I believe that. Because every time you told me to go do something and I did it, I’m like, well, you know what? Dr. Peterson know her stuff. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Well, thanks. You know yours, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m like, you are the bomb. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) You are so silly. (chuckling) Thank you. But I mean it’s really been a pleasure working with you. [00:25:03] I will miss seeing you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you…</p>

<p>CLIENT: No you won’t because I will pop in here in a minute and I will say, “Is Dr. Peterson here?” (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you’ve done… you’ve really kind of got in touch with yourself, embraced yourself. That reading was the last…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, that was because that was like, oh, I would get so frustrated. And then when you fall asleep at the computer and then you try to wake up thinking that you was at the last spot where you was before you nodded off and then you’re somewhere else. Now your paper just really don’t make sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, but…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m not doing that anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And… but you’ve kind of accepted that the human brain works the way the human brain works. And you have a very excellent brain. And you don’t always need to stop yourself or question yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because at that moment, it is what it is. And later on if you recognize the problem, then you go back and fix it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But until then, keep it moving, girl. And I’ll tell you this is what I’ve been telling myself. I am so serious. [00:26:01] I’m like, no, you are not going to get the dictionary. No, because you can make sense of that word. That word is not that hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how often do you make sense of the word without having to look it up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Without having to look it up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I would say about maybe half the time that I…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it most times it doesn’t interrupt your understanding of the main points.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At first, it does. But if I just keep reading, then my mind automatically goes right back to that word. And I’ll say now, OK, I get it now. Then I just go ahead and read it straight through.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said OK, yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then if I know what I just read, like say the last two paragraphs and then I’m looking at the… well, the first two paragraphs that I read. Now the last two paragraphs that I read. Yea, it’s in the middle. Now put it together what you just read. It has to fit. Either it’s going to be something negative or it’s going to be something positive. [00:27:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you get it. And you can always, when you’re done, write those words done. If you want to go back and look them up, fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the flow of reading, right, you will mostly get it from the context clues. And even when you don’t, right, you still will understand the main idea of what you’re reading. And then when you’re done, you can always go back and look those words up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go back and look them up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last word we had at Toastmasters was rejigger. And I had…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rejigger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rejigger. It’s not even in a dictionary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to ask them, “Where did you get that word from?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does rejigger mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It means to readjust, to change. And I… what I try to do is I take every vocabulary word that I’ve learned from Toastmasters and I will like to use all of them in one huge sentence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that’s what… no, Dr. Allen. Dr. Allen. Professor Allen told me, she said, “Yvette, you are something else.” And I said, “What?” I didn’t realize that I was doing it. But I like to play around with the words. (chuckling) [00:28:04] And I would take… we had… it was like an oral class. So everything that we did, we had to do it orally. So when it was my turn to read, because she wanted to make sure you could use these words the correct way and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is all with Toastmasters?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, this was with IDSS [ph], my class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what I was doing was every word that she would give us, I didn’t realize that I would incorporate that word with the next word that she just gave us. And I just kept building it. I just kept on building it till when it was my turn to read, well, it took me so long because I… (chuckling) And everybody was like, “How did you do that?” (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a real passion for knowledge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s what a good researcher does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, they do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. (pause) Shoot, I’m a researcher. [00:29:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) That’s… that… I mean…</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s what…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s part of who you are. You have a real passion for knowledge. And that’s why all of these things you’re doing are exciting because you finally trust yourself. You notice other people trust you have confidence in you and you’ve adopted a lot of it for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And you’re right. I am starting to see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:29:28).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because at first I wasn’t doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I don’t know why that was so hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, for a lot of the reasons that we talked about. Family background issues but not anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. And I’ll tell you, you just wouldn’t think that it’s stuff like that that can make you like block out certain things. Man that is crazy. Well, I think that’s a good kind of crazy, though. (chuckling) Wow. So yea, I’m good. [00:30:00] I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you’re going to keep in touch and let me know how you’re doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yea. I could leave you a voice-mail, “Hey, Dr. Peterson. It’s Yvette.” (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Yvette, I’m really happy for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s been great working with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You are wonderful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you are wonderful, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am so serious. You are wonderful. I have yet to bump into you in the hallway. “Dr. Peterson. Hey.” (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) You’ll keep in touch every once in a while to let me know how you’re doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I sure will. Yes, I will. Indeed. I’ll tell you. I will be stopping by here popping my head in this. The girls in there, they’ll tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Well, do you want to go a little early so you can do all your things out there for…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that’ll be pretty good because I do need to run to Family Dollar and maybe… I hope they (inaudible at 00:30:53) with chips in it or something. I don’t want to walk around carrying stuff for the thing all day. So…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My pleasure working with you. [00:31:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mine, too. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. All right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You are the bomb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are the bomb, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ll tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m going to spread the word. “You can go see Dr. Peterson.” I’ve been telling people, though. I have. I’ve been… and I don’t know if they came. I tell them. I said, “You don’t have to be ashamed. Don’t worry about it. Just go in there. She’s going to take the shame right out your butt. I’m telling you.” (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) I’ll put that on a t-shirt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, right? And it’s going to have to say, “Take the shame right out and then put it in the back of your butt. Hello.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You’re so funny. Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. Please do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:31:40). I will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Take care of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, you too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Bye, Yvette.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

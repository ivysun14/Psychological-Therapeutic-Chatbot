<p><b>DR:</b> You said you were on some medicine, what was that for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how, did that clear up that problem?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, would you say you're depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel depressed yourself?  Like on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is the worse you could ever feel and 10 is the best, where would you say you are right now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Why are you depressed now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because, I don't know saying it go right.  Everything always going wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, like what's been going wrong lately?  There's a Kleenex right over there if you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, I had an understanding about filing my taxes and  my PO told me that I'm supposed to get in my federal and my state, but instead I bought a car and she tell me I'm in violation of my probation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you didn't fill out the tax thing right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I didn't get in my taxes, and because I bought a car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, so are you threatened to go in jail because of that or [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, and, um, what other things are going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need my own house.  I'm scared to send to my kids to school because they keep getting into fights with the kids.  They fought a whole school bus and kids started bothering them.  I'm trying to get them in another school.  I don't have my own house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  How old are you kids?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your grandmother?  When was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In '04.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Did she sort of raise you a lot?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was talking to my probation officer.  I'm tired of going through this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, when is the last time you were feeling good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, like the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of this year?  What, what happened then that you were feeling good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing, I just woke up feeling good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just for like 1 day?  Okay, how do you remember that day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was happy that day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you just kind of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And the next day my uncle got hit by a van.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  How is he doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He don't remember nobody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about in your family?  How many brothers and sisters do you have?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know, but how many full brothers and sisters do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Six brothers and 2 sisters.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And where are you in your family?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm the second to the last.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Suicide?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, one brother is bipolar, schizophrenic, and he in prison.  That's the one I grew up with.  My granny raised me and him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm, um, how about your parents?  Did they have a history of seeing a psychiatrist?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  My daddy was old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, was there alcohol problems in the family?  Did your parents drink or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your mother?  How about with you?  Um, is alcohol a problem?  Have you ever had a problem with alcohol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about cocaine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] used it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, did you have a problem with it at one point?  Pot?  When's the last time you did any drugs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Last Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What did you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Smoked some cocaine and marijuana.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about prior to before that?  You know, would you say you do that once a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I was actually clean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, for how long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Had you gotten in trouble previously for having dirty urine?  With PO?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] began and when I first got on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's okay.  That's, [INAUDIBLE] okay, um, and you've never been treated with any medications for this depression.  I mean, you certainly do look very depressed and, um, are you able to get any enjoyment out of life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It always seemed like when I began to, that's when everything started going down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As soon, as soon as you begin to get some enjoyment, things go down?  Okay, um, and a lot of anxiety you were saying?  Okay.  Other symptoms that you're having?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], I just can't sleep and I can't eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about, do you hear voices?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do the voices say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just telling me to stab myself earlier -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was telling my PO, I wish I was dead, because I'm tired of going through this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, where, um, where do you think those voice are coming from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think they're your own thoughts?  Do you think people are out to get you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yup.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, who's out to get you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, I mean, that they're actually out to get you or they just kind of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they look like it.  My family don't do nothing for me.  They don't help me or nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you walk -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is my son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, take it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you walk down the street do you think people talk about you behind your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yup.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think the r, the TV or radio talks about you?  Do you get any special messages?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] in certain songs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Certain songs, like in your head?  Do you think you have any special powers or abilities?  Um, okay.  Do you think things can get better?  No.  Well, let's see, I, I mean, obviously, you have a lot of symptoms of depression so I think we should treat it.  Sometimes when we call an exogenous depression meaning all these bad things happen to you.  When they go on long enough, you can develop an endogenous depression meaning it comes from the inside and, um, that's why, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was referring you because, um, medications can be helpful with that and so I'm going to start a medication called fluoxetine, and you take it once a day and it doesn't work overnight, but over the next week or two you can start feeling better and better and it can help your appetite and your sleep.  Um, and usually it's pretty well tolerated.  If you happen to have a bad reaction to it or don't like it, you can stop it and give me a call and we can talk about what to do or something else, but it really does help a lot of people.  I could also give you maybe on a short term basis some medicine to help you with sleep.  Uh, maybe some clonazepam, like a half a mg to take at bedtime, because I know if you're not sleeping well, things just aren't going to go well.  I, I can't help you with all your other problems, those you're, you're going to have to kind of work out with your PO and stuff, um, and it sounds like some of it is a lot of misunderstanding.  Um, so you bought this car, so that sounds like, did that make your PO unhappy because of the tax issues and stuff?  Okay, uh, who is your PO?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, I mean, do you get along with her?  Did she kind of feel that was an irresponsible thing to do, to buy the car?  So you said you don't have a boyfriend.  Let me ask some other personal questions.  Are you using birth control?  If you do have sex, what do you, do you use a condom?  All right, because you know if you don't, you get pregnant.  How about your, I know you have three [AGE] girls, how old were you when you first got pregnant?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you know, that, have you talked to them at all about, are they sexually active, do you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You don't think they are, but, you know, they're right on the cusp of that so it's really important that, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I had them checked and they don't go no where anyways.  I don't let them go over nobody house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but if they do start going out, you know, you should talk to them about birth control and maybe take them in for those things, because, you know, that's what tends to happen is you get, you know, you've had a kid when you were young.  I'm sure that happened to your parents.  Your mom and they -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my mom was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When she had her first kid or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, she was [AGE] when she had my brother and [AGE] when she had me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My daddy was [AGE] and [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and certainly staying away from drugs, especially cocaine, because that depletes these neurotransmitters in your brain and really doesn't, it makes things just worse and plus it's going to get you in trouble with the PO.  All right, so let me, um, give you, now, uh, you don't have any, you're not on Title 19 or anything are you?  Okay.  The probation will pay for the medication that I'm prescribing you.  You can get that filled here at the pharmacy today.  Um, let me put you in my computer here.  It's [DEIDENTIFIED], is your, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Hello?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hello?  Yeah, I'm getting ready to leave my doctor office.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'll call you when I get down there.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My son.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your son?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, so, um, you take these prescriptions down to the pharmacy.  One, just follow the directions, you take once a day in the morning and the other one you can take at, not, bedtime for sleep.  You take it just prior to going to bed, just before going to bed, and hopefully with catching up on your sleep and with the antidepressant, the next time I see you, you'll start to be feeling a little bit better.  But it only works if you take it.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].  Do you have any questions with that?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now which one is the pharmacy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't been in here before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you park in the parking structure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, then you got one of those, those, uh, things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Valet parking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You did valet parking?  It's right around there.  When you head back that way, I'll kind of show you, um, just before you kind of get to that bridge where you did the valet parking, you make a left and you'll see there's a pharmacy there and you give this to them and they'll give you a months' worth of medication for free.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can you validate the, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I don't, I, I validate, but the not, if, not the valet parking.  Did they actually come and park your car for you?  Yeah, that, that I think they charge you $2 or something for that.  Uh, next time if you park in the parking structure and you bring that to me I can stamp it and I think it's only $1.  Um, and let's set up another appointment.  So you're number is [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Is that your cell phone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so we can leave messages for you there too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what if I saw you, 1, 2, 3, uh, I'll be out of town in 4 weeks.  What if I saw you, Wednesday, [DATE] at 11:30?  Think you can make that?  If you can't, I'll give you my card, just leave me a massage.  Um, let's go Wednesday, [DATE] at 11:30, right here.  Okay, so here's my card and if there's a problem with the medication you can give me a call and leave me a message and your telephone number and then if you take this to the pharmacy, they'll fill the medications.  Just follow the directions.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And hopefully you'll start to, you know, be feeling a little bit better when you see me again, you, you'll be able to deal with some of the issues that you have.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let's stay away from the cocaine.  That's not going to help things.  Um -</p>

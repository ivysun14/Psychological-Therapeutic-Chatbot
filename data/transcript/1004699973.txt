<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh) Thanks for seeing me so late. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Thanks for your flexibility with the time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We should have tissues [inaudible [00:00:16].4] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. I will put a box back there</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Okay. That's just a suggestion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't usually cry on the way over here, but today I noticed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle). It's just been a really long day. My shoes broke. (laugh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been a very funny morning. It was like actually pratfall type mishaps. I wore these shoes that I had worn before but not to walk in for a long time that I had gotten at Goodwill. And the heel started like crumbling off by the time I got to campus. I had to go buy emergency shoes (laughing). And the shoes were too big. And I had to figure out how to wear them because I had no shoes. </p>

<p>[0:01:23.2]</p>

<p>And then I had a shoe box with me, and I can't take a shoe box to an interview. So I had to figure out where to put it. The funny thing was all of these things separately have happened to me before, literally. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh. (chuckle) Like the broken shoes? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just like didn't even pause. I just had it all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just really, really tired. (hard breathing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you need a good cry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I need dinner. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) And probably a good cry. Or maybe not, sometimes that just makes things worse. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:02:30.5]</p>

<p>And to be by myself for like 12 hours. I know I'll be okay. (pause) </p>

<p>(sigh) So the people I interviewed with today are kind of assholes. There were nice to me, but in the, "We're clearly not going to actually send you out for positions." They're just assholes. You know. You know. Yeah. </p>

<p>Saying not very nice things about people who were applying with them, to work with them, while they have other applicants in the room, me in the room. Just assholes. So that's unfortunate. You know, saying that—kind of making me feel like the things that they had not communicated clearly were my fault for not understanding. </p>

<p>[0:03:45.8]</p>

<p>Which is fine, except it made me feel like shit. (chuckles) On the plus side, I might have a job for the next two weeks. One of the other agencies, I called and she said, "Oh! I just now—something came up that I thought would be good for you." I'll hear by tomorrow. Other than that, I'm just really tired. </p>

<p>I think I feel like I'm doing this emotions thing wrong. This whole (pause) keeping it together in order to function, like that's clearly not working. (laughing)</p>

<p>[0:04:35.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me back up and say something logistical first. If you find out tomorrow you get the job in the next couple of weeks, let me know what your hours will be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I'll have some time open in the morning, probably before you need to be there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That might be really good. Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (heavy breathings) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I just (crying) it's hard when you're nice to me sometimes. I realize that scheduling when it's convenient for me when you have availability is—no it is being nice to me. But it—it—it's hard (crying/pause) I don't—it's (sigh) touching is the word that comes to mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also (crying) it's just (pause) you know it's—one of the temp agencies that I've registered—that I'm working with—the people are just really nice, like just super nice to me and really helpful and lovely. And they don't have a lot of temp jobs so they're probably not going to send me out for a lot of assignments. But they're just really nice. And that makes it both harder and easier to deal with people who are going to be assholes, and who are—yeah. </p>

<p>[0:06:42.7]</p>

<p>You know to some extent everybody is going to be exploiting my talents over the next year. (laughing) But the people who are being assholes about it (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a problem with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause/heavy breathing) </p>

<p>[0:07:43.2]</p>

<p>I'm feeling less like an imposition on you specifically though. So that's good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I am having a hard time, I don't know, being here right now. I kind of just want to go home, but I also really don't. (chuckle) (pause) It's like I'm so tired that saying what I think is (pause) enough of an effort that it feels like too much. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. So it's (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and work too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now I just want to cope in the ways that are easy for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:09:21].3] that more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What ways are you thinking of?</p>

<p>[0:09:25.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I mean (pause) having myself isolated from people. Eating dinner is not actually a bad thing (laughing). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't buy a meal here because I'm waiting until I go home because I have actual food at home, etc. And it's like, it's early for dinner so. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it look like if you weren't working here? Would that be possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not. Because I just wouldn't say anything, and that's really hard for me. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you would just sit, and that would feel really uncomfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I would feel bad. </p>

<p>[0:10:46.7]</p>

<p>It is very strange. This is—(laugh) when we are talking and something happens that isn't verbal, I occasionally—actually quite often I'm like, "Well that's not going to come out in the transcript." (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh) I see. Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Yeah. Good luck researchers. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Besides the social sciences aren't actually a science. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>[0:11:34.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh) I talked with Eric [ph? [00:11:44].5] yesterday about cutting myself. It just came up. And he's very ingenuous. And you know. He's my roommate. Whatever. And I'm not [inaudible [00:12:03].7]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I wasn't going anywhere with that (laugh). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:12:32.3]</p>

<p>If you would prefer to go, that's okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't want to do that. (pause) Thanks though. But I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I might actually walk home barefoot. That's probably a bad idea is because there's construction somewhere along the way. But my shoes hurt and my other shoes also hurt. (laughing) That's the thing. I thought about bringing emergency shoes today. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this has happened to me before. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I was like, they don't really fit I my bag. Eh I don't really have any flats that are not beat up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And of course, that's the day. </p>

<p>[0:13:41.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the day. But it's not actually that—so much "that is the day," because I'm just the kind of person who needs to have emergency shoes. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) Uh-huh. Gotcha. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) But I would say now I'll know, but no. You can never plan enough. But I have another interview tomorrow morning. </p>

<p>[0:14:28.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another temp agency?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. This woman has been very nice on the phone. (pause) So I've got to figure out shoes. I'm not wearing a suit again. I'm just not doing it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not doing it. (laugh) Although I stuck my jacket in there, in my bag. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So it's not happening. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. I am, as always, torn between, "Man my life sucks so much," and thinking other people's lives are like this all the time. [inaudible [00:15:41].3] (pause) It feels like I'm working very hard. </p>

<p>[0:16:00.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In here? In general? All of the above?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not so much in here right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah/</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:16:06].9]. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Sorry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's about time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:16:18].5] it shouldn't feel like I'm working very hard, or I shouldn't actually be working very hard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think it's hard for you to relax and not work hard in here. And I think your level of exhaustion (pause) is making you feel like, "Fuck it". </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh) Man, if you think it's hard for me to relax when I'm in here, I have no idea what relaxed would look like for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>[0:16:51.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have sense that there are other settings where you relax</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like when you're talking to friends, I don't have a sense that that—like if you're feeling bad, I have a sense that that can be hard work to kind of keep it together. But if you're feeling okay, it's not the actual make—you know, like "Did I imagine this?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and no. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I both work harder when I'm feeling depressed, and I think I'm more relaxed here than probably [inaudible [00:17:32].4] a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Yeah I guess you seem a little less considerate in some of what you're saying and also like (pause) you're taking a lot more swipes at people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I guess I am. I hadn't even noticed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) Uh-huh. </p>

<p>[0:18:06.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's a good thing? (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) You can't answer that question, sorry. That was mean. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) They are—often (pause) I would say it connotes you're seeming freer and sort of being less restrained. That's how I'm reading it, kind of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm also trying to put myself in the place where I don't feel like shit as much. I don't know if that makes any sense. It definitely doesn't. (pause) You know, when I'm this tired and feel this horrible, it's like if I think about feeling this horrible, I feel this horrible for a long, long time. And if I don't think about, it's like—I can put that someplace else and then (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if...</p>

<p>[0:19:24.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I have a fight with James 45 minutes before we're supposed to go to a party, (pause) I can still have fun at the party and be relaxed. That's actually not fair, sometimes, not always. (pause) </p>

<p>I don't know. It feels like (pause) part of me is (pause/sigh) it feels like part of me is starting to just kind of enjoy talking to you and part of me just wants to cry for the next half hour/until you kick me out. I don't know what I would do. [inaudible [00:20:21].4] wouldn't go out. I found out what it's there for. (laugh) (pause) I think maybe we were talking about different things and [0:20:42.7]. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:20:53.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I'm getting is about (pause) like you feel divided. (pause) And (pause) you're really not sure whether it's better to sort of enjoy having a conversation or whatever, talk about stuff, or focus on how awful you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's more that I am pretty clear that the latter is not what I want to do. I just haven't gotten there yet. That I try to get to enjoy being here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of like push the other away, like stuff it in the closet and shut the door? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pull yourself together in some fashion?</p>

<p>[0:22:20.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. (pause) I don't know. I'm tired. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not getting it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) You're not getting it, yeah. (laughing) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I am just—you just look so pleased. </p>

<p>BOTH: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not getting it either so (laughs) (pause). It's like phasing out of one and phasing into the other, and I'm between states or like flashing very rapidly between states or something. Although now, now that was a problem to work on, so I'm feeling better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>[0:23:35.4]</p>

<p>It's what I do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:23:49].9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I thought that was flashing between states. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh that too. I do that a lot. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But no, I settle myself by (pause) solving problems. [inaudible [00:24:16].5] James and I talked about atonement last night. I'm watching "Angel", which is a spinoff show of "Buffy", and James has not seen it. And the theme of the show is atonement. So it's like they take all of the annoying characters from "Buffy", and take them out of "Buffy" and put them in a show together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>[0:24:46.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I saw some episodes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I watched a couple of individual episodes and was like, "This is really bad." But when I started from the beginning, the story arc is actually, it's pretty good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or maybe my standards are just low right now. But I was talking with James about some of it, and he asked what I thought about atonement. (pause) </p>

<p>And (pause) It's a very—like creatively it's a very interesting thing for me. I feel like you could just keep on working it and working it (pause). But it's hard. It's like it's just never enough. He can never make things not have happened. (pause) </p>

<p>So we talked about theories of justice and law, and I said, "Well, this is why people believe in God. Because that's the only way you can—you need a divinity to make things that have happened not have happened. And to make it not just you put the pieces back together, but it wasn't broken in the first place." </p>

<p>[0:26:24.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we talked about do you (pause) Somebody has wronged you, do you owe it to them—somebody does something bad, the problem is—somebody breaks your shit, sometimes you just want your shit back, but sometimes the problem is the relationship. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like—I have this little porcelain, it was like a saucer or a teacup. And I had it in the bathroom, and I put my soap on it. It was like a little porcelain soap dish, and Kirsten broke it. It cost like $2.50. And it was not a relationship problem because I just wanted the saucer, and I was the one who put something fragile in the bathroom. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't care. Nothing for her to fix. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it the thing James also broke?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad also broke. I bought another one. I think actually I told you James broke it the first time, and I forgot it was Kirsten. She doesn't usually break my stuff. But she's probably [inaudible [00:27:42].1]. (pause) We'll say that it was valuable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>[0:27:50.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or say that it's—no—say that it is the relationship—actually I don't remember which case it was, but do you owe it to that person to let them make amends, to let them atone?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "I don't know." (pause) Yeah I think on the one hand I want to say you get to choose, and on the other hand (pause) I want to say, "Yeah. You owe it to them." (pause) It was a good talk. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:28:44].2] always a good talk. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I mean that's really just talking with James. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. She didn't [ph? [00:28:55].1] write about atonement</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm curious about like legal theory. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently I have (pause) no I have because she talks about it in Iceland and Jerusalem [ph? [00:29:09].2] some about why the trial is important to have. Why you try criminals. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>[0:29:21.7]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Earning a living is so weird (laughs) in that (pause) the things for which (pause/sigh) the things that are valuable in me are so unrelated to the things that people value. I don't know. I was just thinking. </p>

<p>The one really—I did get one really good piece of advice from the woman at the temp agency today, which was, "Say that you can print things as your skill on your resume." Like I'm just—I'm applying to like bottom of the barrel jobs/ Say you can do all the shit that people assume everybody can do. Like make sure you state it in those words. Use those same words. </p>

<p>Which, yeah, I didn't have because I just assumed that everybody can do that and would know that I can do that. So I would talk about other things. But (pause) And things like, "I can create an Excel spreadsheet and charts." Like I guess not everybody can do that, apparently? Or it's like I need to say that I can do this. (laughs)</p>

<p>[0:31:14.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Boy, does this suck. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (giggles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, seriously. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is astounding how much it sucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and that this is where things are for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's just awful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Okay, now you look really pleased with yourself, and I feel like that's just mean. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't actually. I'm making fun of you (laughing). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You almost always take back or undo. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something angry or sad, like things that are sad or make you confused. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I guess it's hard to (pause) stay with like—it's hard to deal with the consequences of staying with those kinds of feelings I guess. </p>

<p>[0:32:50.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I know. I know. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like what I was going to say was less taking back and more clarification but you might prove me wrong. [ph? [00:33:10].4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) I was going to say it sucks less that—it doesn't suck in that these are the kind of jobs I have to apply for. That part doesn't suck. What sucks is that it's hard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it totally sucks that these are the jobs you have to apply for. Where you have to write that you can print or make an Excel spreadsheet or like (pause) deal with somebody who is going to be an asshole about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You're right. It does suck. </p>

<p>[0:33:44.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean instead of being able to do something that makes use of your talents where you can contribute based on, you know, who you are and what you've worked to develop in yourself, be appreciated for it, like for the things... </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) How do I deal with this then? (pause) (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to say, "Why are you doing this to me," but I know why I just don't (pause/crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Sobbing) I have to leave after this. I have to go home. I have to make it from here to there [0:34:48.9]. (crying) And I don't have safe places between here and there. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right. I'm sorry. I mean. I'm not mal-intended, but I take your point. And it's one you've made before. And it's very reasonable. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:35:57.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying/long pause)</p>

<p>[0:36:37.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It certainly doesn't go against the basic gist of over time getting in touch with how you feel to pay attention to [inaudible [00:36:48].6] in circumstances. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but, there is never enough time to be by myself. So, at this rate, it's not going to happen, it feels like. (laugh)</p>

<p>[0:37:11.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would agree that there's never a good time, but some times are worse. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know how—so this kitten, if you make sudden movements still he'll like dart under a table, couch or sofa. And I have like all the Square mapped out like that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where do you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The basement of this Public House has a women's restroom that is like a room with locker rooms, and there is a chair there. And it is usually pretty quiet. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can call Barbara if things are really, really bad. But I almost never do. I have Erica. (pause) That's about it. (pause) You know there's like levels. You know I can go to De la Creme.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: And be sort of on my own. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Not really but sort of. (pause) And there's the bathroom here. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:39:21.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's helpful to know there are places you can go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's helpful to know there are places you can go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But none of—they're—they're more alone rather than alone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you can't necessarily be by yourself in any of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't actually be by myself at all. It's just like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're a little more private than on the street or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:40:12.5]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>[0:40:58.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will you do tonight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. [inaudible [00:41:08].8] Watch some TV. With the boyfriend/roommate, [inaudible [00:41:17].3]. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Knit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Knit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to knit while—I have to do something while I watch TV. (pause)</p>

<p>[0:41:46.5]</p>

<p>I'm supposed to take another of these, like office tests before I go to the interview tomorrow. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not like an application kind of thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I know. But I didn't do very well on the last one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm just going to go ahead and do it because I didn't get a chance to do it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like really [ph?/inaudible (whispering) [00:42:16].5] Which you never know. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible [00:42:21].4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a really good night last night. Yeah. (pause) Eric [ph? [00:42:29].6] and I talked about bacon, like way too much. (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) He had cooked it the night before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then he made it yesterday, and then I was like, "I'll have bacon and eggs for dinner. That sounds great." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm finding him proportionally both more likable and more annoying as—(laughing) time goes on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[0:43:02.0]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't know things that I'm just amazed he doesn't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's just an undergrad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's starting his second year here, which is why I'm amazed he doesn't know these things. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they're very—they're things that it's not actually unreasonable for him to know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like, he has a paper that he wants to write for a journal, his first paper. He has an idea. Yeah. His advisor told him that if he could get it done within a week he could send it out. So he has a week to work on this, which I think is really smart of his advisor. (laughs) He's like, "How do I write a paper for a journal?" I'm like, "Well, you read the journal. Figure out how they structure their arguments." (pause)</p>

<p>[0:44:21.3]</p>

<p>I don't want to talk to him tonight though. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. Is it easy to stay away from him when you want to? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's getting easier. Both—especially he, because he needed it more, but both he and Wes are kind of worried like not to push me when I say, "No, I'm going to go to my room." I really need that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did yell at him yesterday. I told him not to give me any more advice on [inaudible [00:45:00].6] (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Decide one more time [ph?/inaudible0:45:06.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) Not it was my [inaudible [00:45:05].3] again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>[0:45:07.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) And he said, "Okay. Okay." And then he like did it again while pretending not to and I'm like, "That's exactly what I mean."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's stop for now. Keep me posted about next week. I'm pretty sure I'll have 7:45 appointments on Tuesday and Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I mean our regular time Wednesday is fine as well, but if it would be easier for you to be here earlier so you could be at work or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I don't know exactly where the job is. I think it's downtown, it almost certain... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:46:05].6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Alright, well let me know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. Have a good night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks, you too. </p>

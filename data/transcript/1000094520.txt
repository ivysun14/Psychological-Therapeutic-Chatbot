<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you see people through this program exclusively or are there other programs also - other stuff also?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Other stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come you ask?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I, uh, I came here to discuss - I still don't know what we're doing. I don't feel that I don't - I go after our session last time you said - and if I understood you correctly or not. The impression that I got was that your goal was kind of like to ... be able to let go, what come - what comes, come what may (inaudible) this person is, not have any expectations or requirements that things progress a certain way, anything and kind of go with the flow. I'm like I feel I understood it correctly but if that was like the goal then I'm like what am I doing here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had - I got to say that I'm sort of surprised because ... when we left last time and then that you called ... kind of the program and you called me and you said you would probably not want to continue, I was sort of surprised because it didn't seem like we really discussed I'm assuming how to satisfy it or ... unhappy you were coming in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I - this has come up a couple times already.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I almost feel like anything I tell you will on some level be disappointing and I - I'm not sure what to say. I can totally appreciate ... that you want to feel better, that you want some change to happen in some way. That you'd like me to help you do that and give you the answers or provide you with something. Does that sound right to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sure it sounds right. I came in here with some very - specific areas that I felt like - I could use so help on. [0:02:54.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I said since I came away from those few comments made last time -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like ... I see how that - how to address any of these points here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I could try to explain it again. I'm just wondering if any explanation I give because we - we have - we have discussed what we're doing in therapy or how this works -</p>

<p>PATIENT: We have or we have not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have I thought a few times early - even earlier than that. You had asked me how does this work or you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And your answers were extremely passive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They were almost like - I don't know. I mean ... how they advertise or describe this program not advertise - I want to the ad when I spoke in person to the head of the program said this is an experimental program and we have different kinds of therapy and there's - there's the accounts of behavioral and there's one other thing and - whatever. And I'm like I'm collecting some kind of analytical framework almost. That you remain - relatively speaking have a blank slate kind of thing and - and you said one time let you talk. So okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said I'd let you talk?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. You said I didn't let you talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So you know fair enough. So I came in today with things I necessarily thought I wanted to say or had to say or anything but I felt like ... you should have to talk because I'm doing at least 80 percent of the talking - maybe 90.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember - last time you said you didn't think I said. It felt like I was following a script ... and you wanted to go back to something else. I just felt like also -</p>

<p>PATIENT: You continue that idea you wanted to discuss - one of the things you wanted to discuss was happening here. Nothing's happening here in my - in my - from my - from where I sit. What's happening here is you're being this blank slate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not - you're not injecting your - your opinions, your personality. You're just being this super laid back, gentle, you know how does that feel. You know I've got to say. So I'm like okay. So nothing's happening here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess when you say that I'm just thinking to myself how hard it is to intervene or have a dialogue with you sometimes. To have us listen to each other. I'm thinking about the time when you came in two sessions later and you said I had said something that offended you. You didn't tell me then or the next session. And then you told me. I guess just personally it sensitized me to want - not wanting to hurt your feelings or not wanting to criticize you because it sounded like you - you told me it was unsafe in here. You didn't feel safe talking with me. [0:06:02.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a little unfair. That particular event was a - we discussed it at the time. You - I felt at that particular - in that particular incident gave one extremely ungenerous interpretate - something goes over to my interpretations and that's what I was complaining about. That did not mean that I want you to say nothing that could in any way be perceived as a challenge to ... anything that I'm saying or thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Maybe -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like are you saying that I'll -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe I miss perceived that then. It seemed like you - you had felt really hurt by that. You consulted a fellow priest. He's - when -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was strange that through all the - in seven hours we spent together you - it is like that was the one and a half times that you made any kind of a suggestion of interpretation or whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was such - it was - it was an extreme - whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't mean that you can't offer interpretations or - or - or challenges or questions as to why I'm saying or feeling something or what is it - whatever I. I feel you have been extremely passive. I - I take part (inaudible) for that in the sense that you feel you try to let me talk. I'm doing all the talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe (inaudible) be quiet a little bit but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just wondering if it's also hard to express how you're really feeling about what's going on in here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing's going on in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I slept for four hours every week and I talk and you listen every nicely. And I don't know where - where I'm going or what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if the goal is just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well this seems like a - this is a lot of information now that's coming out now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've said this to you from the beginning I feel when I have a goal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said it to you last week I felt that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But to say it's - with much more directness I don't feel like anything is going on here sounds like there's a lot of disappointment. What's going on inside?.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds like you're talking ... I don't need you today to say it sounds like there's a lot of disappointment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's upsetting to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That it - what - it's just being extremely positive and saying something completely inaccurate that's not going to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you want from me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I - I'm just saying to come here and I'll say I'm sort of something and you'll say it sounds like you're disappointed or I come across kind of agitated like I am a little bit right now and you'll say you sound agitated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you a little agitated? [0:08:55.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe more than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. You've never seen me angry. And I'm torn because I - they keep - they keep asking to fill out those forms. You know are you trying to protect your therapist God forbid or I don't know what that means. Or they go if you were the human being on Earth say you know you're not successful - you're not - I don't play that game either. I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you're disappointed that I've been passive, that you haven't gotten -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want mind if it's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything that you wanted from here and it's been lacking in clarity what the hell it is we're doing, how it's going to work, the explanations I've given you have not been satisfactory. I think that's completely fair. I don't - I want to get this all out on the table. Let's get it out on the table.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it could be and I (inaudible) with this. This all coming from a complete distorted understanding of what the nature of the process is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From a lay person like myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've mentioned to you in the very beginning that I've had like previous experience when I come to the first therapist meeting years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I was extremely like whatever and I had had some kind of experience there and ... I haven't spent years of study. Certainly not the practical stuff from that chair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I - I'm not saying though I could do anything better or - nor do I think different about it then the guy on that side of the chair. I'm just saying that what is it with this process is about - how's - and I had these problems 10 years ago also. But I said I want to understand how - what's happening here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The therapist was not really in flavor of the going into that. So he finally gave me a book that he felt shared - what kind of therapy he liked to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And kind of presented what that was about. And I found that very interesting. So I've always felt that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it helpful though? In a way that you want to be helped?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It - it - no. It was helpful just to ... I'd like to know if there's a system out there that many therapists and clients have been the history of the field of psychology apparently found helpful and useful and it's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But see I feel that even now I ask you a question about you ... and we're off on a -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fair enough. What was the question? Say it again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it helpful for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was what helpful for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: These previous therapies. This book. To - it sounds like you have an increased understanding. You learned something. You've read a lot of books. You've participated in a lot of things - a lot of understanding but you're - sounds like you're still - the problems are still there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Granted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And one of your disappointments that I completely can empathize with is that you like to understand what's happening here. You would like to understand maybe what - what I'm doing or not doing at all and how that's supposed to help you. And it's been confusing. It sounds like it's not been satisfying. Is that - does that sound right? [0:12:07.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt that you didn't understand me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So maybe - is it understanding more about how this will work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The doctor gives you a pill. You ask him how it works. You feel better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. But you don't - you - it seems like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if you - but if you don't feel better than you might want to ask the doctor what is this pill?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is it supposed to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But if he says you have to be on this antibiotic for 10 days and you don't feel better in 3 days, this is 30 sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. To be taken to (inaudible) for 10 days - the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And it doesn't work unless you take that whole thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see a difference after a few days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You feel a lot better after 3 days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's what's going on here. You should have no interpretation of ... feeling any different until I don't know. Throw out a number. 20, 25 Are there policy rules for I never promised you anything. Maybe after 30 you're also not. I want to feel that you're doing something that's going to get easy - you know whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And until that all those questions are you know questions are very unrealistic. Have you solved the problem? It's like 2 + 2 = 4. It's not like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So are - is it the questionnaires that are bothersome when you - when the point it has you thinking about -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm at this point I have the - this idea of I don't - I - I'm thinking from the other side. The idea that you're yes I've solved the problem when things seem unrealistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I do want to feel and I guess I need to feel that there is some kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I feel that from you all the time - every session. You're coming in with some kind of stress or some kind of dilemma or conflict and you're going to tell me about it and you'll like some input or feedback or some way of thinking about it. And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or even some insight into what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I feel very - very on the spot for me to please you or to satisfy you. And many times I feel like the things I've offered have not been satisfactory and they may not have been but I feel like anything I'm going to say is not going to measure up. It's going to be a slogan or it's going to be a - a trite reduction of how to do something and ... I feel torn on how to respond because I feel like there have been several events or experiences that maybe you wanted advice, feedback, something and it's been disappointing. I also feel that you have very high standards even from the beginning wanting to know you know about my qualifications. I felt - it made me feel a certain way about how I'm going to help you. I don't have any doubt that I think I can help you over 30 sessions and that what we're doing would be helpful to you. [0:15:03.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You never shut up before. You never said I have no doubt. You always said oh maybe we'll try and we'll field goals and you never said that before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But to continue doing for another 22 sessions so it's going on 8 sessions ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Something would have to be different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Asking for qualifications I mean (inaudible) comes from asking that question but you know the time you said and I'm sure that you said this is yearly and I asked (inaudible) believe it. It's a fair question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I - people get called priest with - who never took formal tests. That's just the way it is. In both (inaudible) professions you don't put that shingle up and call yourself by a title and so you're (inaudible). Or in other exceptions you can pay somebody to (inaudible) doctor and you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm guessing that you had a lot of thoughts about what was going on between us ... that I was unaware of. Whether it was - that's my fault or not but I just feel like there were things going on for you about what was going on here or not going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't have been unclear to you after our last discussion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been in a lot of sessions. I said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You gave no indication that you weren't going to come back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. I told you I missed the training for the first time and I suspect something's going on there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - well that was not the unconscious (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But was there something - I mean obviously now you're saying that there was something more to that but that was a very indirect way then I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So was there -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't - I don't think it was positively. I was - it just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So - so is there a more direct way of communicating what you're experience is or what's going on there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not new. You're - you said - you said it. I've come in here and I've had some kind of dilemma or whatever. I come to you and you - you've said that you're - you realized I felt disappointed. I'm going to tell you something now. Something new now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For me it feels new. This whole session feels completely different and new ... to me. We're talking about the disappointments, what's going on and what's not going on, what you're not getting, what you want ... in a very direct way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very direct way. That feels different to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It (inaudible). One of the issues I had on my paper I filled out I don't know why or why I feel so ... lacking self confidence in many areas. One of the issues I (inaudible) about. [0:18:20.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes. Right. Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where - where does that (inaudible) going? I'm not - I don't know the process of you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's think about it. I mean let's think about it in here as far as the confidence to directly tell me you're disappointing me. I'm not happy without the -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not a confidence issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's that I don't want to make another person feel bad. And I've - and I've already - like in my mind the way I see it I've already (inaudible) you off enough. Like you said you're disappointed or whatever. I'm going to have to go rather than more blatantly that - I don't think you're coming through here. I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what would happen if you made me feel bad? What are you - what are you afraid will happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just want to treat the next guy like the way you'd like to be treated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. Say that again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Treating the next guy like you'd like to be treated. I wouldn't like it if someone made me feel bad - some. And I would feel bad if someone told me yeah you're not coming through and - and x, y and z.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's hard then isn't it? Because then what has to happen instead? If you're afraid how I'm going to feel because you don't - you wouldn't want to feel like that but yet you - you're having these thoughts - these feelings. You don't want to share them with me because you're afraid of how I might feel hurt. You don't want to hurt me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A number of times already you have heard me quite loud and clear and have said you feel put on the spot. You feel a lot of pressure I'm putting on you and so on and so forth. And ... I - even now I'm not questioning - your intelligence or your - honestly or none of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what if you were? What if - I'm not saying this is happening but what if there was part of you that didn't quite believe me? Or wondered how smart I am. Whether I can really help you. Whether - I don't know. What if that was going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. If you felt -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm talking about for you. [0:21:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand but I'm coming from not wanting to - hurt people's feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hurt my feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So if you're saying that you're feeling pressured or whatever that I'm asking you for your - special qualifications then - which is no where near as threatening or has -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it hard to look at me now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? What's going on here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's less hurtful to know the person you're criticizing or not to look them in the eye and put them down ... or say something that's perceived as a put down or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And what would - what would happen if you put me down? If you were to harshly criticize me or let some of these feelings and thoughts you have inside of you out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be (inaudible) this idea of not doing to someone else what you wouldn't want them to do to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is that? So then you shouldn't do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wait. Do it in as nice of a way as you can. Gentle way you can or whatever. I'm still not as good at that. You're saying forceful or whatever but ...that's what I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how do you think you are at that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) pretty good in the sense of being more gentle around you - more (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm feeling like there is a lot more inside of you that you are as you say afraid to hurt my feelings. I'm just wondering how you're using this. Is it a Christian law that says you shouldn't do that? I mean what is this - this kind of phrase you're saying you shouldn't hurt somebody or you shouldn't do something -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You should be familiar with this golden rule.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is it just the golden rule? The golden rule is - is - is telling you don't say what you're really thinking. Say it in as nice a way as possible. Don't hurt this person's feelings. Keep these other feelings inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not to hurt the other person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) you have to say while you try to do it in as gentle a way as possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to hurt someone's feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I'm just wondering if there's - I guess it feels like there's problems for me and then trying to understand you ... when I don't really know ... what's going on inside of you. I'm hearing an interpretation or filtered through kind of the nice filter.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been much more direct than you have mister.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In general. You've had much more careful not to say something that - with that one exception that can land a really wrong way than vice versa.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're probably right. You're probably right. I don't want you to feel bad either. [0:24:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you have the ads for that across your door that you - you care but you care too much about the client's feelings. We assume that you are supposed to care about the client's feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I'm supposed to be in here and not give a darn about your feelings. I mean that was kind of weird. I'm not supposed to care about protecting your feelings. To me that's kind of weird. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think there's a way though that we could both ... work towards ... respecting each other but letting out some of these things that we're afraid is going to hurt each other?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well okay but you're the guy who has to work on more of that than I do. I let out some of the stuff. You let out almost none of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You just agreed with me that you probably protected me a lot more than I protected you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're the guy who would have to change more in that area than me ... to follow what you just said now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess sometimes I feel afraid to do that ... because I don't want you to feel bad. Right? I want you to feel good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the - the basic tenant ... the therapy. You can't give interpretation that the client's not ready to hear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know it may be also a trap that we fall into as we relate to each other where we don't ... we don't uncover some of these things that are going on here - our experiences. What's going on inside of us truthfully the things we're afraid to say ... when we don't want to look at each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I don't know the answer but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you don't know the answer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the following issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That - okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mainly that - what we're doing here is not about what's going on inside. It's about what going on inside me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So on one hand you could be pure Freudian and not say anything at all about yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or like my first therapy was very much along those lines. He'd have me lying on a sofa and he didn't say a word the whole time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it is - and there are a million ways of doing things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So from your side of the bench you have to figure out what - what to say, what not. The last therapist I saw was friendly. You know talked about himself rather early. We were more like you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know that I need to talk about himself. You're - I think you're absolutely right. It is about you and your experience and how we communicate and how we relate as well. I feel - in this session I'm sharing more about things I've thought and things that have gone through my mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You didn't say anything new. You felt challenged. You felt that ... put on the spot, etc. You said those things before. [0:26:54.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what if -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what if you were to ... find out what I can handle? In your thoughts what's going on for you that you didn't need to protect me. This is for you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I - I would think that you deserve that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. One can argue that I'm a client. I can - I can say anything I want to. Yeah, you can argue that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I would go further than that. I would go much further than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because I'm wondering if - if there's something else going on for you that you don't deserve that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Deserve what? Feel to not talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. To say the things and - and if I can tolerate them or you're - I - you're saying you're worried about how I'm going to feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm coming in here and I'm telling you you saw this from (inaudible). I feel I've been burnt a far amount in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has become more (inaudible) to me to try not to do that to other people. I mean talk to them or all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not doing that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Obviously I - I'll slip up sometimes. I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll say something that offends someone. I said about thinking but (inaudible) but what I'm trying to do ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're trying to do is what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Protect people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Protect me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happens to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel good. I remember 15 years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A guy 15 years ago said to me you always make people feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But I'm talking about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not - you make other people feel good. It's true. What I'm talking about you - this is -</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's if I felt - I felt pretty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This - this time it's for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You notice how you're invested in how other people feel. You protect them. And there's a fear there for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A fear?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I'm - you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean we started this session about you and what you wanted or what - and what you're not getting and how you're disappointed with how things are going and now you're telling me you feel good and you want to protect other -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I didn't say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to protect -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I feel good when I'm able to make someone else feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And you - and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not hurting somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But we're talking about it now with me ... that you don't want me to feel bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we have a bit of a ... kind of a dilemma.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's the dilemma? [0:29:56.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there's that part of you that doesn't want me to feel bad, right? You want me to feel okay and not feel bad about myself and not feel like I'm a bad therapist I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And (inaudible) is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to leave therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Which is thought out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) dilemma. How do those two things cause (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because a step of it is here to help you and I'm trying to help you. We're trying to work together and there's things going on inside of you that you don't want to say to me because you're afraid you might hurt me. So you're choosing then to leave.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. And not on the same page. That's okay. That's fine. I was thinking that I'd - if I wound up choosing to leave is something that you know again if I were sitting in that chair I was running the (inaudible). So I'm trying to - how to believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're trying to help - this leave.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I were in that chair -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the positions were reversed I would feel - I would feel bad so I'm trying to help is leaving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm not helping them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's hard for me to do. It's the hard part that you made ... I don't find it (inaudible) to ... to tell - to say what's bothering me but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think it's - you don't find it difficult. We just spent this time - how you're afraid to hurt someone's feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I have to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We - we were on the phone -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't even want to come in. You wanted to talk about this on the phone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get a call from you saying I think I want to stop. So to say you're not afraid to tell somebody directly how you're feeling -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not afraid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to hurt my feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not it. That's the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said how could you - I don't feel like (inaudible) now. Could we talk over the phone if we're going to talk about it? It's my - it's my - my super ego that comes in and says - says let's do this and let's do this nicely and (inaudible) know that - let's solve this part of me. It's like I don't want to do this. You're not really - you're not doing what I expected. I'm leaving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not doing what you're expected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm leaving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And yet you continued to have these problems and have the - the suffering.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was that a threat?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I'm just saying. It's just at least it's - it's worth being aware of even if this is our last session, it's worth at least being aware of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am aware of that. [0:32:43.2]</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think my ... opinion of what therapy can do for me let's say ... is not so high. Even though like (inaudible) therapy (inaudible). So you see a guy for ... I don't know - seven months ... and (inaudible) told that if I recommended that I go on the medication because I was depressed. That was very helpful. It was worth it. So far as more insight as to why I do x, y and z or just there was one good - there was one good insight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's what we're trying to do is get insight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I guess part of what I would imagine we're doing is ... not just understanding why you might be afraid to hurt my feelings or hurt anyone's feelings or why you might try to say the nicest thing possible, but really get out what actually is going on inside of you. What you're actually feeling and how you end up communicating it and how you might end up communicating - feeling it and being aware of it a different way. Getting what you want. You're talking about how you want to make everyone feel good and that feels good to you. It feels safer. Maybe there's other things going on ... but you're not getting what you want ... at least from what you tell me. And here if there's an opportunity to learn how to change that pattern or how to see it or gain some awareness of it -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Beautiful. Insight. You've just described very eloquently in a few sentences the kind of things that I thought the process was supposed to be about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I feel like we have -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) from the category of insight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I feel like we have the material here in this session and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So why were you so like that's what you thought this was about getting insight. What part are you disagreeing with? [0:36:02.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I guess also feeling it - experiencing it in here not just intellectual. There's a lot of intellectualizing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pushing away and using stories and antidotes and symbols for -</p>

<p>PATIENT: A way to deal with pain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It doesn't go away, does it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. It's scary to kind of open up ... look at the pain or let it out or to have these fears. It's easier to let away, to have a story and I'm - it's - maybe I wasn't able to do what I was supposed - trained to do or what I wanted to do in a previous session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am all in favor of the kind of process that you just described. What - why are you talking this way? What are you afraid of? Don't talk that way. What - you know everything - everything you just described there sounds very worthwhile. We haven't done any of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think we've done any of it today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well at least - at least we started defining what we're doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you've never asked those questions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm doing it this way. Why are you doing it that way? What are you afraid of? You don't do it that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're absolutely right. That you're saying that we've had this - break up so to speak to have - to even have this conversation ... about what's going on for us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We haven't even come to that yet. Why have we in 7 sessions never asked a question like ... there's something - there - some reason -?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something's really wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That you've never asked the question - a question similar to ... well why are - why are you saying it that way? What are you - something you're afraid of here or whatever it is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more - it's more been - sounds like you're sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I don't know if I quite see it that way. My experience feels different - now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you think of one conversation we've had like before today that was - that was in the ball park of the kind of questions we're discussing today? [0:39:01.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess just the last session when I felt like I was just trying to draw back to you and I and what was going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing happened there either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I felt that - I felt that I disappointed you when you said - it seems like you're following your scripts. This doesn't feel right to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because nothing was happening there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It felt like that was kind of shut down so perhaps I should have pushed it more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's nothing to push there. I thought it was a lousy - example of you know what's going on here and how might this be an example of how you -?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Respond or - or get upset. It was real - oh and I see that anything was going to happen there. Maybe you saw something like that happening but I didn't see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was like what are you asking me for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It felt like a lousy ... time or example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it sounds like for you that seemed like a lousy - not a worthwhile -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I get angry at you and you say okay or I'm just thinking you're going to get angry at me or something like that. So then okay I understand it but that - I had not been angry at you. We were just talking about whatever we were talking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you're like so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like there - there's been some anger at me that goes unexpressed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe to protect me or for whatever the reasons you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I said - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So -</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't what the (inaudible) was. Is there anger there or (inaudible) for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I - I'm pretty straight forward with my emotions. I think -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But - but wait. What? You're straight forward with your emotions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. Yeah. I think I'm angry (inaudible) about I'm angry or I'm sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. What prevents you from just saying it directly? Is it just because you want to do it nicely and you want to - you want people to like you and you don't want to hurt their feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Often. I think usually with exceptions. I think about it. I know that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have had a problem of ... many people say things straight out and you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what would happen if you hurt their feelings? Is it just not nice? I mean what - what would happen ... if you hurt my feelings?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the only - the only way that I would have had a ... a thought - the only thing I would perhaps have said that would have in my mind would have hurt your feelings would be something like ... you're not being - coming through for me. [0:42:15.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - I've already said it. I was like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've said it? I don't know if I've heard you say that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not in those words but you - like you said you felt I'm putting pressure on you and sometimes just bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel to say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you just said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I said this before that you have responded.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm asking you now how does it feel to say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To say what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you just said. You're not coming through for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Oh. Well number one like you said already so why say something to knock another person. Like I said - I said that you said how you felt pressed or about when you're ready.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just asking how you feel saying it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. It - it -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's - I mean -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like that's not a nice way to talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean - well how does it feel saying it when you just can say that to me directly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did it feel -?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To say you're not coming through for me? What - you could even say it again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Who am I to make (inaudible) like that? What I - what am I a slave or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like this is how you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. It's part of it also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're not coming through for me and you got to have - what gives me the right to?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you notice what you're doing? What's happening? You're saying something pretty directly. You're not coming through for me. And yet it's shifting to this kind of levity and jokiness. When - what the content of what you're saying is ... can you notice that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why - why - why switch to a joke?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not asking you why. I'm just saying -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just saying we can notice it. We can notice that when you say something -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. It might be - I don't know. I'll have to think about this but ... you have to say something that ... it feels wrong because it offends the other person - trying to make a joke along with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No. I'm not asking - I'm not asking you for an explanation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. That's what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. Yeah. We have to stop for today. So I don't know what your plan is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You said before you had no doubt ... that this could be a helpful process for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what - what - I mean I know that right. Do I have a right to say ... how many hours or sessions or whatever it is until I feel that way? [0:45:03.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have the right to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have the ... experience to make the call. It feels like I'd like to get results after one session or whatever it is I - every session -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every session you want results. You want something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. There you go. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a real -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. There you go. So I - I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe we can just even be aware of that in theory if we continue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We've been aware of that I thought - (inaudible) from the beginning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But - I guess I'm not explaining. Being aware of the disappointment then and how that's operating. In a way to say it sounds silly or abstract or simplistic. It's going to be about feeling it. It's going to be about these moments. It's going to be about us both taking some risks and then avoiding things and then saying what we can tolerate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds great. How did I get you to what we call the (inaudible) means bottom line, right? If this is a program to deal with certain concrete issues as described by me in writings -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Experiencing these moments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know that I can say much more than that. I - it's hard to know how you're going to get from here to there ... with your unique -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Problems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So my question is can experiencing enough of these which are like little moments made an impact on ... pretty big issues that I (inaudible) came here for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just seems ... unlikely - quite unlikely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds pretty hopeless ... in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel it's a failure too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm failing therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds pretty hopeless. It's like I won't be able to help you. Therapy won't be able to help you. None of these things will help you. These little moments won't help you. This increased understanding of what your emotions or whatever you feel is not help -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that's valuable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what - it sounds pretty hopeless. We do have to stop for today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot different. Feels exactly the way it feels. I don't have a check on me. I feel exactly the same way I felt a dozen years ago. A therapist who ... I think was subscribed to the things you're saying very much. [0:48:21.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are we going to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wait for six months and if I decide I think I should - would like to leave this (inaudible). So maybe if it's (inaudible) you - you've kind of come up with a way you can - so I think I'll put them on the spot there about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Take 2 for 40 in (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are we going to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. And I - I know my ... out of my (inaudible). Are you - no. You're just helping it. Now that's a different question then a silly question on the stupid sheet. Has the problem been solved?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not asking for a - for a (inaudible) - is it helping?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you feel this is progress in something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a really fair question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you haven't felt that. It's been disappointing and hope of anything will help you. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So - so I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not everything's a science. Lots of things are art but art also producing on canvas. You produce something. You see something taking place in front of your eyes. I - everything that I'm use to looking on or doing, I'm use to seeing something happening - something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know. Maybe it's not a fair question. You could tell me or your professors could tell me. It's not a fair question to ask someone is therapy helping you. All they could qualify that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think it's a fair question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. You're welcome to continue. [0:50:54.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I don't know who to speak to about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (Inaudible) idea. Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't hurt, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It couldn't hurt. It couldn't hurt. It could hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might help. And I think it could if you think it's helping but you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What - what does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll call you. You have the right to know if I'm coming next week, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to say right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I can't say right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Call me.</p>

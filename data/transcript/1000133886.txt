<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session Four.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I could have come Wednesday, (inaudible at 0:00:29.2) Well he probably planned something else so I won't bother. You said you wanted to talk to me about something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yes. Well I figured out what to do about it. I wanted to ask you if when I was calling you round a bit that who is this friend, that you�re wondering about if I should give them your name. But I decided I wouldn't do that.</p>

<p>I've been calling some places and getting this incredible bureaucracy thing, one person says, �Well I'll let you...' Like they don't know where there are things, or they say, "Well I'll let you talk to my supervisor.' And you talk to the supervisor and they say, �Well you talk to somebody else.' [0:01:14.1]</p>

<p>So I now have two places to call but I haven't gotten ... you know I haven't been about to call them. One person isn't there... so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is... I thought there was a good session on the phone. I thought I opened up more about what I thought was part of the problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had a feeling too that I think I'd opened up more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't thought much about it since... you know that explained most of it. But you said you really felt this was a problem. [0:02:00.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said I thought what was a problem?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This, that not only that it was a problem, that it really limited my choices even more. That you agreed that black men do have more problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I think I said I don't know about that. But that it ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I talked to my mother and she says this couple was black. But several people have told me that this adds to the problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I just don't know whether that is true or not. Because I don't... I haven't gone out with enough black men to know ... whether it is true or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But would seems that way</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it seems that way to you anyway, that that would make a difference... [0:03:10.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to other...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that that is discouraging I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you said something about — the problem is not, is the... the problem that you see is that I have to start believing that it is possible to go out with people. Then it will be my choice to decide how I feel about men, or have any (inaudible at 0:03:47.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. Say that again. If the problem...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if I feel — maybe my problem is that I feel that I can't get a man. Put it that way. And if I didn't feel this way then I could think more about whether I wanted one, or how badly I do — how independent I feel about... [0:04:11.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't remember what I said exactly, to tell the truth. I think what I said was that that was probably standing in your way of finding out whether you really wanted a man or not. Because when I want things, but feel that I can't... I think I want something, but think that I also can't get it at the same time — sometimes I'm not clear how much I want it until I think I can get it. Kind of complicated thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But how can I believe that I can, which it's true that I can which my mother believes. And certainly there are other handicapped people who are much worse than me that date. Then the question is, why hasn't it happened? [0:05:02.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why hasn't it happened to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or why hasn't any relationship that I've had gone beyond that stage of flirtation. It hasn't gotten serious. Why is it?</p>

<p>And I'm always left with some hopeless crush or infatuation that I have to struggle out of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always the one left carrying the other person. Yeah well I guess what you're saying is, is it possible first for you to date, and you don't know that. You don't know the answer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know. Because if it is possible I don't know what has been wrong. I really don't understand. [0:06:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let's see. It is found — it is probably not simple, for one thing. My own guess about it, and this is only my guess, you know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... is that it certainly, well I know it is possible for people with serious... with your handicap, to date. Because I know — I don't know exactly in the first place how deformed you are or whatever, but I know that people much worse off than you do. But I agree that it certainly, it is probably like it makes it more difficult and complicated to get somebody that you like to go out with you, there is no question. [0:07:01.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I think it is a very complicated thing. It is probably like — if you didn't have a physical problem, first of all you probably would have had a lot of dates, just growing up. And then you'd have a lot of experience that you don't have. And so the whole thing would be different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So my guess is your personality has — you know anybody's personality has something to do with it. I'm not saying that that is why... like you might date easily if you were just you, but maybe you have to... I don't know. Like I said it is a complicated thing. Your situation maybe you weren't around (inaudible at 0:07:52.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And do you have any idea what kind of personality factors would be barriers? [0:08:03.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way I would think about it, myself, would be not... I would think about it in terms of — what would be particularly attracting, rather than what would be barriers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What would be attracting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About me. Oh I don't know — I suppose being friendly. I actually feel friendly. I think I'm friendly. And you know I have a friend who has a friend who says that she thinks the best way to be most attractive to men is to have a sort of independence. Not feel that you have to date someone, that you have to be going steady or married or anything. Being busy living your own life. [0:09:10.5]</p>

<p>Now, you know I've done that. I've done these things but perhaps if a person does not really feel independent there is some kind of anxiety that reveals itself. Now I don't know. I don't know if I'm — how good an actress I am, how well I hide this. But somehow men get the sense that I'm going to be too dependent, or that I'm not...</p>

<p>I don't know, maybe it is something that they don't reason out, just something that keeps them from being attracted and they don't know why, and I don't know why. [0:10:03.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well are you saying that you — one factor, one which may, I don't know what it has to do with... a lot of people (inaudible at 0:10:10.9). But you are saying one way you do feel is kind of pushed toward being dependent on somebody and wanting somebody around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes and I feel that maybe this shows. I've been accused of being a little snobbish. Now I don't know how I can... I don't know how I reveal all of this at the same time. I mean I know that my choices are limited, I suppose any woman's choices are limited, but I suppose that if there are personality factors it would be a barrier to men that would like me. Even though it may not be as many as there would be if I didn't have the physical thing — but certainly I'm not helping. [0:11:08.6]</p>

<p>I'm not helping to attract, I'm not being attractive to those that perhaps would. Perhaps if I were different there are men that I would attract that perhaps I don't because I lack confidence or something. I don't know. Just hashing around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, just hashing around too. No I hesitate to say this, and let me tell you why first and then I'll say it. Because I think that this kind of thing is often not helpful because you are who you are and it is hard to suddenly change just to attract men and so forth. But I know from when I was a teenager that — you know from what you read in the magazines anyway — the kind of things that are supposed to attract men. [0:12:06.7]</p>

<p>Which are being warm, being interested in them, being fun to be with. All those things. Well taken of, looking nice, attractive. Those are the kind of things.</p>

<p>And I think there is a lot of truth in the fact that people who are really genuine and interested in other people get back what they give from other people.</p>

<p>But you see I know all that stuff. I'm not sure if that is helpful to you or not, probably isn't. [0:12:55.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well being interested in a man, I think being interested in people, not necessarily a man. Because you know, this works differently with some men. For some reason they find the woman who is not interested important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But there is ways of being interested. There is a way of — being interested in them means that I'm talking about things like caring about them, really interested in what they are doing, in their work, so that you've got to hear about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Without being sloppy about it, like, �Oh tell me all about you.' And, �Poor little me I'm nothing, but you're so great.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right, right. That is right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you should still project, I think, confidence in yourself. I think — I don't mind listening to a man, but I don't know — that is like the stuck answer. That I feel that when a woman starts putting down with a man she doesn't know to well, �Oh tell me about this, and tell me about that.' He almost knows it is a trick. But I think that she should be open if he talks. I don't know. [0:14:10.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it depends. If he like, the times that I talk to men that I really am very interested in what they are doing. So it isn't a trick. Sometimes it isn't a trick.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So same with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is what I meant, that I'm sure there are personality factors. I'm sure that if I had a wonderful, beautiful, sparkling personality I'd have wonderful, beautiful dates every night. So I think that it certainly contributes to it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In spite of other factors, that is always a factor. Personality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you think? I mean that is how I think. [0:15:00.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm sure that all things work to some point. Depends on who the man likes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Men like different kinds of women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except that I felt — I accept that I don't feel that I'm anybody's type.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel like you are anybody's type?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they say there is something appealing about every woman. There is always a man that finds something appealing in some woman. And I don't know, nobody has found it in me. If they have they haven't said...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you find it in yourself, and do you feel appealing (inaudible at 0:15:55.7) in yourself? Or do you feel you are kind of dull?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. If I'm in a good mood. But see I have friends though, and I feel if I were repulsive or something I wouldn't have friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is still... it is like questioning yourself. Am I — do I have qualities that attract people? And sort of weighing, I have friends yes, but I don't have men. No. They are going back and forth everywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what's appealing to people know, I've changed my mind about what is appealing. I thought that being — I don't know — I thought that being interested in an honest opinion would be attracting. Not that I became interested in anything because of it. [0:17:15.2]</p>

<p>For example, I used to think that men would like me because I played the piano. Or because I talk about anything politics or books or anything that I might be.. whether it be politics. Or just be aware of a lot of subjects. And I used to think that this would... When I'm in a good mood I feel my humor is pretty good, at least some of my friends think so.</p>

<p>Of course I never show it (inaudible at 0:18:07.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I'm too...Well see when I'm here I'm — well I'm thinking too hard here. I'm trying to sort out things, this is not a natural situation even though I'm becoming more relaxed about it.</p>

<p>But yet I don't know, I've seen — I'm not putting women down, but there are some women whom I feel are just very dull that attract men. So I don't know what is attractive to men.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever... for example I feel that I have met men that admire me, but this does not, this does not make them attracted, they are not necessarily attracted because they admire something that you do. [0:19:08.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well okay let's take this playing the piano, for example. Or no, let's take talking about being able to talk about a wide variety of subjects .</p>

<p>Now that I think about that, I think yes. Probably that does appeal to a lot of men, not all men, you know. And probably does contribute to them liking you. And it is probably like, yes, that does — but that in combination with other traits. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>But it sounds like you're pointing to another thing, which is like you are feeling like what you elicit from men is that they look up to you. That they don't feel close to you. Is that it? Don't ...? [0:20:00.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. Maybe they don't relax.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe they don't relax? You get that feeling sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it depends on the man. I don't attract intellectual men. Like I said, I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you getting at though, when you said they didn't relax?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know, that is just a guess. I've been told this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've been told that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not by a man. I've been told that men don't understand me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't understand you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They probably don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't understand you because in some way...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, no. That my lifestyle is a lot different from most black women. [0:21:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I find this very hard to explain. I'm not in the social mainstream. I don't go bowling and ... I can do these things but they are not necessarily a regular part of my life, like going to parties and going bowling and playing cards and just sitting around bantering about anything.</p>

<p>I don't know, I just don't have a certain kind of repartee with a lot of people. [0:21:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't have a way of talking, you mean? A certain way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah a sort of, I don't know — this place. This small talk, the way people... Well I do this more than I used to — you know now this is very hard to pin down. You know, �Did you go to so-and-so's party last night?' And a conversation that goes on like that. I thought maybe I didn't seem normal, or like a regular guy enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you don't... well part of it sounds like you don't go to these parties, so you don't have anything to say. [0:23:04.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mean parties, I mean — you know I seem to be apart from a lot of people culturally. I am a part of it and yet I'm not. I seem to have collected, I seem to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a different style of life than most of them? Separated off from them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But yet I'm not really separate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are only partially, is that it? Or in certain ways. But the way that you are separate is in not having conversations about certain topics that they talk about. Is that it?[ 0:24:07.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid I've gotten into something that I can't explain. I really, I don't have the vocabulary to explain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well take your time. It may be something you haven't thought through. Is it hard to get a hold of it? [0:25:14.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know how people understand each other because of some kind of common cultural bond? Well I grew up in this culture. I went to Lee High School which had a mixture of ... which was a racial mixture. And I went downtown to a music school where I met a different type of person, and I grew up in a poor black neighborhood. And the neighborhood was one way, and my mother was a person who was a pianist, who was into classical music. [0:26:07.8]</p>

<p>And my aunt was religious, and there were so many cultural things coming at me that I never settled into one kind of group. And it is almost as if I can understand different kinds of people, but I sort of shied away from the lifestyle of the neighborhood which was just sort of a way, not bad like the ghetto is now, but sort of that way. I sort of leaned toward being bookish, reading and umm....</p>

<p>Yes, yes. I did like to dance, I did like popular music, and I did have friends in the neighborhood, but it seems as if I was more drawn towards... Well first of all I think I was a romantic person who would rather read about English kings than worry about jumping rope outside. [0:27:23.6]</p>

<p>And I got into this, with this imagination. And now I'm more comfortable with people who go to concerts and read books than I am with other people. And yet I still am friendly to everybody, but I find myself only being comfortable with a small group of people. And I'm afraid it is the way I am and the way my lifestyle is. I try not to be like that. That I seem different to a lot of men. They don't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To the men from your neighborhood, you're talking about. [0:28:02.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well men who've grown up in black neighborhoods, who've grown up in a social milieu that I'm not a part of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I sounds like you have grown up in a different social milieu with different influences.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you have been influenced by all those other things that came in, and you do have interests that are different from many of the men in your neighborhood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't live in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well in whatever neighborhood you're in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't really meet men from my neighborhood. My social contacts are sort of at work, they were at school, and now they are at work. But the people that I would — of course the faculty was integrated anyway, so I meet all kinds of people. It was integrated culturally and racially.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the people you meet in the faculty, you're saying, are culturally different from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Only some. I was saying, black men very often...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about black men on the faculty. [0:29:03.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Black men most of the time...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are they culturally different from you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some respects. And I'm not making a value judgment, I'm just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No I understand what you're saying. It is like when I came to this university, like I have been brought up in a very different community than here. It is like different groups of people. And you growing up one way, don't immediately fit in with a whole group of people who have been brought up a different way. With different interests. I mean I think that is what you are saying. You're caught in this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know how much of a factor that is to my problem. Because like I said men come from all kinds of backgrounds, and that doesn't work either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well have you met men from — have met men with whom you feel culturally in-tune with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how does that go? I'm trying to see what difference that makes, that helps you to see a difference. [0:30:12.7[</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well sometimes the race is different. Or ... and then with music though, sometimes the men are (inaudible at 0:30:28.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is another difficulty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this year my rapport with people that have different interests is better than it used to be. I am more comfortable with people with whom I don't have a lot in common, and they are more comfortable with me. But this has only been in the past year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you'd like is to get even more comfortable with those people, I guess. [0:31:03.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well to a certain extent. I don't want to get into this bag of wanting to be accepted by everybody. I still want to be myself and have my own interests and my own friends. And I think the more comfortable I feel about what I am and what I do, I think the more comfortable I am with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what you'd like to do is, I guess, to have rapport with people who are unlike you, but still keep your own individuality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Because I enjoy the same things they do. People are surprised to see what I do at parties, but I don't go often, it is just something that I can do. I can adjust to another situation. But yet it is not something I ever do all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't get the importance of that. [0:32:00.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it is not important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I didn't get what... That is something they are comfortable doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because like I said there are a lot of cultural influences in my life, I suppose in everybody's life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess your feeling is of being between groups. Not exactly like the neighborhood where you grew up. Not exactly like many of the people at the music schools, I guess. Not exactly like any group that you're associating with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in a way like an outsider with all those groups. [0:33:06.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't feel lonely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. Not being part of a group, but I was just saying that perhaps this would be a factor with men. That I don't seem like I'm a regular part of their social milieu that they are running. I seem different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I see. That they ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I don't know what they are thinking of me. I don't know if they are thinking that I'm snobbish or... I don't know what they are thinking about me. I haven't given much thought to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To how they react to that difference. [0:34:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think they are thinking much of anything, about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're saying though that you don't have a very good idea of what they would be thinking if they were...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. Well those men I'm not too concerned about. I don't know what men I am concerned about, I really don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering what...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know kind of man I want to attract. I know black men with whom I have a lot, that I have something in common. But you know they've been married before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you say you're not sure what kind of man you're even aiming at.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'd like someone with whom I have something in common, but I don't know. The past two years I've had less of an image of what I want. I used to have an image of some kind of scholarly person, I know it's stupid... [0:35:11.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stupid what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh some kind of brainy person who did research. But I don't have any clear image of what I like because the person that I've been infatuated recently with is certainly different from any person that I expected to fall for, which I think was the physical attraction.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that before? I think that I'm attracted to him because I wanted to have him (inaudible at 0:35:44.6) on the table. Or maybe I don't know like a new physical awareness or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A new physical awareness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you hadn't felt before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I told you before that I saw the black men I would like them intellectually and then I would be physically interested. But I would mostly fall for them because I thought they were smart. Something like this. But with this person it wasn't that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a new dimension.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I told you that I think he's basically intelligent enough. Not an intellectual person, but he is very intelligent, and people sort of like that other type that I've been talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the neighborhood type thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No not... yeah, well he's black and before him some of the men I've been interested in have been white. But it wasn't race that caused this, it just happened to have something in common. [0:37:08.1]</p>

<p>And then I felt that I decided a few years ago that black men were hostile to me. So I decided that I didn't care about them in that way. And a lot of black women feel that black men are hostile toward them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Towards you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Toward them, themselves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So after you made that decision, then you wrote the law.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I thought the physical thing was impossible too. I just thought, well they are all physical and they don't care about anything else anyway. And I don't know what I think anymore about them. I have less set ideas on anything about black men, white men, what kind of man I'm looking for. Or personality type. I have no ...</p>

<p>I just don't have any idea about it. I have no set goals or no set image. [0:38:19.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you really changed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what that implies. I don't know if I'm feeling less need, or feeling more hopeless. And I find less and less that I have crushes on men from a distance. Like seeing someone around, �Oh I really like that person.' I don't find many men appealing on sight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You used to find a lot of this, but you just don't get that interested in them, when you see them at a distance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think that I would become interested in anyone that I didn't know unless I became... unless I got to know him and he showed an interest in me. I don't think that I would just develop a crush on somebody. [0:39:14.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't just fall for somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fall for somebody just out of the blue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying kind of what that means about you, or you just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't know what it means. And I find that the more I feel this way, the more relaxed I am with men. I banter around with them more because I don't care as much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every conversation with them doesn't seem really important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No it just doesn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What they think doesn't seem that significant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. [0:40:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And does that make you happy? Being more relaxed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would like to be more like that. I don't know if that means that my self-esteem is growing. Maybe it is a hopeless feeling. Maybe I don't care because I feel — what is the use?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't tell whether it is really feeling worse or better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really know what it means. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound pretty happy about it, I guess. At least ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't want to care. You see I still have this infatuation, it's not infatuation, it is not gone. And it still makes me miserable. And I'm getting better, I'm coping with it better, and my behavior with this person is better.</p>

<p>I used to have sort of a hang dog attitude around him, but now at least I'm putting on a good show, and I'm acting more carefree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're pleased to be able... [0:41:09.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm pleased with my behavior yes, if feel I have some of my pride left. But I like this feeling of not caring because it is much more relaxing. It is a much happier feeling. Nobody likes being infatuated with someone that doesn't feel the same way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is easier for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. You know I told my mother about what you said about meeting other people with the same problems, she thought that was really great. [0:41:09.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'll keep working on that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if you don't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no, I intend to. I also tried to call the girl that I know who has had... I think she had polio when she was growing up. And she is not, she can walk, but with the braces. But unfortunately I can't — her telephone number is changed or it is unlisted, and I haven't been able to run her down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What about that personality idea?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About... ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What personality factors are attracting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you think that is something I should think about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. [0:43:02.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well do you think there is any way I can figure out what personality factors, or what might be barriers. What barriers I might be setting up, through my personality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do I think there is a way you can figure it out? Yeah I do. I mean by just the kind of thing that I'm talking about. Taking how you feel what it is like and saying you do want to be different.</p>

<p>I was saying for me personally, it is very hard to do that because it is like, �Well now I'm going to decide to be interested or something.' And it's hard because to me that feels artificial. And that is why I'm not likely recommending that, but it depends, you might be in a different place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what happens if the real you is not appealing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that is why it seems that it is somewhat superficial to try to get a certain personality so that you attract men. But you're talking about what happens if I'm just not appealing. [0:44:15.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm. Maybe my personality is not appealing, I don't know. To men. Or to any men. I can't get over that feeling that something is missing. That there is something that other women have that is missing in me. It sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it feels that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is... there must be something that is not there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a piece missing? [0:45:01.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something that doesn't reach them. Somebody said that when a man is looking for a mistress he wants a woman who makes him feel like a man, or boosts his ego. Maybe somehow I don't do that. I don't know how other women do it. They talk and behave the same way I do, nothing extra. But I'm just wondering — what do they do? [0:45:22.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any ideas what they do to make men feel like men, for example? I'm trying to find out if you don't have the ideas, or it is something different than not having any ideas.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have too much of an idea. They listen to men and they talk and laugh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I do the same thing. Of course I tend to be more, of course I'm moodier sometimes than other people. And I'm friendly and more open sometimes than I am at other times. [0:46:03.8]</p>

<p>Maybe I try too hard, maybe ... You know, like when I talk to this guy that I like. Every time I, after I've seen him I think - I mean I don't see him socially — I think, �Oh I acted too independent to him. Oh I bet he thinks I should along with him. I bet I was behaving like a little girl. I bet that I didn't seem intelligent enough. I think that maybe I wasn't jovial enough.'</p>

<p>Then other times, if we laugh and talk, I think, �Well I was too simple.' But I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you think of a way that you'd like to act that you'd be happy with? [0:47:04.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well I don't know. The way we behave so often depends on the person we're talking to. I think different people bring out certain...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With him, for example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he is not too serious a person. He is serious, and talks about problems, but he is a great kidder, he can kid around. And I can do that. And I think he enjoys humor. Sometimes I have heard that, at least he thinks I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to see if... Sometimes when you do feel good about how you act around him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is when we've had some laughs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. When you are kidding around, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or having had a serious conversation about anything that is going on between us. But I can't get over that feeling that other women — maybe they listen more, maybe... [0:48:09.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is the feeling is of something being...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe they're giving the impression more of they think more of themselves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that is what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe he likes them better because he feels they look better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then that is it, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe he feels that they are more womanly. Or maybe they have experience from dating or having been married, like some women have been married. Maybe that experience gives them something extra that I don't have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you feel is just a real lack of something in yourself. Like a hole is there or something. [0:49:04.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, but as to what it is, I can only just make quick guesses.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What it does is it leaves you up in the air, and really not knowing which way to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How can you ask a man, �What does this woman have that I don't?' They'll never answer. Because people always tell you, �Well it depends on the man. It depends on the woman. A man has different tastes.' This is the answer I've always heard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you ever ask a man that? Did you hear that from a man?.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I asked a man, this one. And of course I didn't get a straight answer, just a quiet... [0:50:03.8]</p>

<p>But I felt that part of what was wrong with me was the fact that I could ask that. Why am I so unsure of myself that I have to ask someone what's wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought that was wrong of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I think that is a weak sign right there to ask someone what's wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is weak not to know it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or to feel if there is something wrong, or to care what someone else thinks to that extent, that you would question. The fact that you would question why you're not as attractive as other women, Or the fact that one would doubt one's attractiveness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is even the doubting of it that is wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it is wrong to show doubt. I think perhaps that... I think that for a man to be interested in a woman he's got to feel that she is sure of herself. [0:51:10.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so if you ask him - what is wrong with me? Then he'll realize that you aren't sure of yourself, and won't like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or that I don't think they think this out, but you appear weak and not worthwhile. I think you don't appear special to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On the other hand, you get information which you can use for another man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But men don't give the information, they just flatter. You know that they find other women more attractive, but they won't admit it, and why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So far they haven't admitted it. You haven't been able to have a straight talk with a man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not with this man that I've...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not with this man. And it feels impossible to have a straight talk with him and really get the truth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They will not be honest. [0:52:03.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He'll tell you like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I suppose he would feel that it would only be his opinion anyway. I've asked my sister if she knows what men have said about me. And she won't tell me. Or she says she doesn't know.</p>

<p>So I have no feedback.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds like you're very much in the dark, and feel very helpless about how to get that information, and even bad for wanting it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah maybe I shouldn't care what they think. But it is said that we don't see ourselves the way others see us. I have asked countless people. [0:53:01.2]</p>

<p>I have asked girlfriends if there was anything that should be a barrier to my attracting men. And no one has ever said that they find any wrong. Even my mother says that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And your conclusion from that is what? I gather your conclusion is that they are not being honest with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My conclusion is if it is true, then what is wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is your conclusion about them saying that. That ..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps they can't. Perhaps they are...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that sounds confusing too. Because if they are being honest and there is nothing wrong, then still men aren't attracted to you, then what does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then there must be something wrong. [0:54:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like a part of it is inability to get — like you can't get answers from these people which really satisfy you. And you feel somehow that you can't get the truth. And that sounds like something that is maybe possible to work on. Like how do you get somebody to tell you how they really feel about you? Like what would happen if you said to them, �Look, I hear you saying this to me, that there is nothing wrong.' To this man. Or, �I don't feel like I've gotten a straight answer from you. And I really would like to know. � [0:55:11.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my mother said she's fed up with the questions. Because she says, �I've told you that there's no reason why it should be impossible for you to date, or get married.' And she just said she's not going to answer the question anymore because she says she's told me already.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's tired of hearing about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's not tired — well in a way she is ... I wish that I could accept that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's beginning to sound like that... does that make you feel...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm beginning to think that maybe. Maybe I've been wrong. [0:56:05.7 ]</p>

<p>Maybe. You know the past couple of weeks I've been thinking, well maybe it is not impossible. I've got a couple of friends, girlfriends who've told me that I do attract men, but then I don't react. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what they mean by that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think there have been a couple of instances where we've been out maybe drinking beer or something. And they've noticed that men were friendly, but I don't think they took note of the situation, that in these instances the men were strangers and sort of ... Well the situation wasn't conducive to striking up a relationship, or in instances where they were almost bum type.</p>

<p>And, but you know... But I'm friendly to people that I meet, and I'm friendly in my work situation. I feel that I'm friendly. I'm being very honest. I feel that I'm friendly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we're going to need to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh okay.</p>

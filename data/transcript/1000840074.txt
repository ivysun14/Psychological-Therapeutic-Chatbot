<center><p><b>Transcript</b></p></center>

<p>Berg 1:  Um, let me ask you, what do you suppose that needs to be different in your life that will let you know that it was a good thing that you came and talked to me today? Um, that it was a good thing that you had done this?</p>

<p>Robin 1:  Probably, um, helping me realize that, you know, a lot of things that, that go on are just normal everyday life. Um, you know, that, that I'm no different than anybody else. My experiences are all the same.</p>

<p>Berg 2:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 2:  'Cause sometimes I, I sometimes blow things out of proportion and think only those things happen to me, but when in fact, you know, they're just normal everyday occurrences.</p>

<p>Berg 3:  Okay, okay. So suppose you find that out. [Robin: Mhm] That what's happening to you and how you react to things are pretty normal. [Robin: Mhm] How is that going to be helpful, how would that be helpful for you?</p>

<p>Robin 3:  It gives me peace of mind.</p>

<p>Berg 4:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 4:  Um, it lets me know that I'm not the only one out there pulling my hair out.  (laughter)</p>

<p>Berg 5:  Okay, all right. And so you have peace of mind and you say, "Ahhh, I'm like everybody else, I'm no different."</p>

<p>Robin 5:  Well, in the things that happen to me, how I react to those things is what will make me unique.</p>

<p>Berg 6:  Right. So you react when you know this. You will react, oh well, it was just one of those things that happens to people.</p>

<p>Robin 6:  Right, instead of getting frantic.</p>

<p>Berg 7:  Right. Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 7:  I'd be much more calm.</p>

<p>Berg 8:  Calm about [Robin: Right] your reaction to whatever.</p>

<p>Robin 8:  Right, right.</p>

<p>Berg 9:  Okay. That makes sense. Okay, okay. So suppose you are, so suppose you are calm. [Robin: Mhm] You say, oh well. You know one of those things in life [Robin: Mhm] and be able to go on. [Robin: Mhm] I guess that's what you're talking about.</p>

<p>Robin 9: Right, right.</p>

<p>Berg 10:  Instead of being frantic, you just say, okay, well, you know, [Robin: Right] take it with a grain of salt and just go on with your life.</p>

<p>Robin 10:  Right.</p>

<p>Berg 11:  What, what would that be like for you?</p>

<p>Robin 11:  It would be control. I'd have a lot of self control.</p>

<p>Berg 12:  Self control.</p>

<p>Robin 12:  Yeah, um, that's one thing I probably lack the most.</p>

<p>Berg 13:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 13:  Um, I'd, uh, um, I'd be easy going. I wouldn't constantly be thinking all the time, and, um, it would just be matter of fact, you know. I wouldn't be overanalyzing situations.</p>

<p>Berg 14:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 14:  I seem to be very analytical.</p>

<p>Berg 15:  Okay. So, what would you do instead of analyzing then, when you've got
that point?</p>

<p>Robin 15:  I'd just, you know, throw it up to the wind and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Berg 16:  And say, oh well, that's life. That's what you would say?</p>

<p>Robin 16:  Right.</p>

<p>Berg 17:  Oh well, that's how it goes.</p>

<p>Robin 17:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 18:  And just may be able to move on with your life.</p>

<p>Robin 18:  Right, and not think that, that it's going to be the end of the world, you know. Tomorrow's a new day.</p>

<p>Berg 19:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 19:  I sometimes look at a situation and study it too much and think that my whole world revolves around the decision that I make or how I react. When, in essence, it doesn't.</p>

<p>Berg 20:  Really, okay, all right. So suppose you are able to do that, [Robin: Mhm] suppose you are able to do that. [Robin: Mhm] What would people around you notice different about Robin that would let them know, "Ahhh, she is able to let things blow into the wind and then go on with her life."</p>

<p>Robin 20:  They would probably say that I'm finally growing up. (laughter)</p>

<p>Berg 21:  Okay, okay.</p>

<p>Robin 21:  Um, they'd say that I was more easy going, [Berg: Easy going], um, not stressed out. Um, uh, more fun to be around.</p>

<p>Berg 22: More fun to be around, okay, okay. Um, are you married?</p>

<p>Robin 22:  Yes.</p>

<p>Berg 23:  Okay. So you live with this man you are married to?</p>

<p>Robin 23:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 24:  Okay. What would he say?</p>

<p>Robin 24:  What would he say?</p>

<p>Berg 25:  What would he say he would notice different about you?</p>

<p>Robin 25:  He'd say that nothing gets to me. He'd be surprised that nothing gets to me.</p>

<p>Berg 26:  He'd be surprised. Okay, all right. So that's what he would say. "Ahhh, nothing gets to Robin anymore. She is handling it."</p>

<p>Robin 26:  She's handling it, yeah. [Berg: Okay] His question would be so, like, how long is it going to last? (laughter)</p>

<p>Berg 27:  Or I was thinking, what have you been drinking. (laughter)</p>

<p>Robin 27:  Yes, yeah, well. Usually he's always, "Well, what book have you readlately?" you know.</p>

<p>Berg 28:  Ahh, okay.</p>

<p>Robin 28:  "What answers have you figured out now?" You know. [Berg: Okay] 'Cause he knows I have a tendency sometime to even try reading different books, trying different ideas of how to, um, just handle life, you know. And he'll say "Oh, so, what are we trying this week."</p>

<p>Berg 29:  So he will see you, what, setting aside those books?</p>

<p>Robin 29:  Um, if I tell him that I didn't get it from a book, yeah, he'd be like, "She's putting the books," he'd be like, "Okay, what's really going on," you know.</p>

<p>Berg 30:  Oh really. [Robin: Yeah, yeah] Okay. So, he finds you easy going, fun to be around, [Robin: Mhm] um, sort of, uh, say, you're in control. Well, tomorrow is another day. [Robin: Mhm] I'll just start over. When you are able to finally do that, [Robin: Mhm] he sees you doing that, what would be different about him? What would he do different?</p>

<p>Robin 30:  I think he'd eventually be calmer. Yeah, he wouldn't be, have such a quick temper. [Berg: Okay] Um, um, the, well, actually, in some instances, he might try harder to get at me, to get me going, you know, get me upset. But eventually he would give up and just . . .</p>

<p>Berg 31:  And say this is for real.</p>

<p>Robin 31:  This is the real thing. She has really changed.</p>

<p>Berg 32:  This time this is for real. Ahh, right.</p>

<p>Robin 32:  Right. Then he'd eventually, well, I, I, I'm a firm believer, and it works. I know it works, but like if he comes home and he's, he's angry and is using, you know, a harsh tone or a loud voice, if I just remain calm and, um, speak, softly, eventually, he starts, you know, leveling out. So, it eventually rubs off. So, hopefully, he would be the same.</p>

<p>Berg 33:  It sounds like you've tried that.</p>

<p>Robin 33:  I do.</p>

<p>Berg 34:  You do? You do try that sometime on him?</p>

<p>Robin 34:  Mhm, mhm. And it works.</p>

<p>Berg 35:  Okay. When was the most recent time you had been able to do that?</p>

<p>Robin 35:  Sunday.</p>

<p>Berg 36:  Sunday? It was three days ago.</p>

<p>Robin 36:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 37:  Okay, tell me what happened. What did you do?</p>

<p>Robin 37:  He was upset. Um, I forget what he was upset about. Um, oh, he, he was saying that, you know, um, that I don't pick up the house. We had had company and a mess had been made, and I didn't feel like cleaning it right then and there.  Well he wanted it cleaned right then and there, and he was like, you need to clean this right now. And I'm like, no I'm not going to clean it right now. He said, you know, you never clean house, you're always gone, blah, blah, blah. You know, he just went on and on, and I said, well, I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm not
going to do it. And I sat down. Then he, like, looked at me and he's like, she's not going to get up and clean it, and I'm like, no I'm not going to get up and clean it.  And actually, I'm going to go out for a little while. And he was like, "Oh."  Eventually I went upstairs and started getting ready. And he was like, "Where are you going to go?" And I said, well, I thought I'd go shopping, and do a little shopping. "Do you care if I go? Can I go with?" You know, just, (laughter) it's horrible. I sometimes feel like I'm playing a trick on him, but it works.</p>

<p>Berg 38:  Uh huh, uh huh. Is that different for you what you had done on Sunday?</p>

<p>Robin 38:  It, yeah. It takes a lot of initiative on my part to do that. Um, most of the time I would have probably said, I'm not doing it, you know, and it would eventually would have gotten into a fight. [Berg Oh] But instead I just, it's one of those, I sort of pick my battles so to speak, you know, what I'm going to stand up and say no I'm not going to do or what I am going to do, and not back down on it.  And if I do that, then I pretty much have my own, um, um, plan worked out how I'm going to do it, you know. But if I, if I don't know really one way or the other, that's when it usually gets out of control.</p>

<p>Berg 39:  So, when you pick your battle, that's when you are in control of things?  You are in self control?</p>

<p>Robin 39:  I think so.</p>

<p>Berg 40:  Yeah?</p>

<p>Robin 40:  Yeah, um. (sigh) It's like if I know I want to do something, [Berg: Right] I'm not going to let anything stand in my way. Um, I will be, I won't turn a deaf ear.  I'll listen if he has objections or, or, other people have objections no matter, no matter what it is, not only in the marriage, but then I'll say, well I've already made my decision. These are the reasons I made my decision. I'm going to do it. End of discussion, you know. And, um, that's when I have real control.</p>

<p>Berg 41:  Is that what you mean by picking your battles?</p>

<p>Robin 41:  Mhm, mhm. If it, if it's something I really want to do and believe in.</p>

<p>Berg 42:  And you're definite about . . .</p>

<p>Robin 42:  And I'm definite about it.</p>

<p>Berg 43:  This is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Robin 43:  Right. No one's going to change my mind. I'm not going to let anybody get to me, and I'm not going to get upset by what anybody says. I'm going to do that [Robin: Yeah] that you're not going to let him bother you. No matter what he said.</p>

<p>Berg 44: Oh. So, how did you know that on Sunday that's your battle?</p>

<p>Robin 44: That, I, I really didn't know.</p>

<p>Berg 45: What told you that's the battle.</p>

<p>Robin 45:  Well, I guess it was that I didn't want to fight. I didn't want to get into an argument about it. It was not worth it. Um, so, therefore, I just wasn't going to do it. No matter what he said, I wasn't going to let it bother me. Because I didn't want to, um . . .</p>

<p>Berg 46:  And you knew that.</p>

<p>Robin 46:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 47:  You knew.</p>

<p>Robin 47:  Right.</p>

<p>Berg 48:  Wow. [Robin Right] How did you know that?</p>

<p>Robin 48:  (laughter) I don't know. That's a good question.</p>

<p>Berg 49:  How did you decide that?</p>

<p>Robin 49:  I don't know, um. I was tired for one. [Berg: Okay] Um, well, and, plus it's a repeat pattern.</p>

<p>Berg 50:  Oh! Okay, um. So, you've been through this before.</p>

<p>Robin 50:  I've been through that before.</p>

<p>Berg 51:  Okay. So you knew it was coming.</p>

<p>Robin 51:  I knew it was coming. By the comments he made, and I just thought, I'm not going to do it again. I'm not going to argue with him. I'm not going to get upset. I'll just, I'll just, no. I'm just going to get out of here for a while.</p>

<p>Berg 52:  Wow, wow.</p>

<p>Robin 52:  So . . . It takes, um, uh, almost guts on my part to do that.</p>

<p>Berg 53:  Was it hard Sunday?</p>

<p>Robin 53:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 54:  It was hard.</p>

<p>Robin 54:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 55:  For you to decide this is it. I'm going to stick to my ground. This is my ground. I'm not going to move, and I'm not going to argue about it.</p>

<p>Robin 55:  It wasn't hard to decide. It was hard to carry it through.</p>

<p>Berg 56:  But you did.</p>

<p>Robin 56:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 57:  How?</p>

<p>Robin 57:  Um, I guess it's the will inside of me.</p>

<p>Berg 58:  Really. Are you that kind of person, that has this strong will?</p>

<p>Robin 58:  Yes and no. Um, or it's one of those things. Sometimes I, I'm really strong willed, and other times I'm not. It, it sort of depends, um . . .</p>

<p>Berg 59:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 59:  How I'm feeling at that particular moment.</p>

<p>Berg 60:  Right, right.</p>

<p>Robin 60:  One thing that I, I really dislike about myself is I let my emotions take too, too much control.</p>

<p>Berg 61:  Really. But you didn't Sunday.</p>

<p>Robin 61:  No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Berg 62:  How were you able to do that Sunday?</p>

<p>Robin 62:  It must have been self-control. (laughter)</p>

<p>Berg 63:  Yes you were, you definitely were.</p>

<p>Robin 63:  I don't know. [Berg: Huh] Um, I just, it wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth the argument. It wasn't worth the effort to even, um . . .</p>

<p>Berg 64:  That's all it took, just for you to decide this is not worth it?</p>

<p>Robin 64:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 65:  That's all it took?</p>

<p>Robin 65:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 66:  And it sounds like he got the message very quickly.</p>

<p>Robin 66:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 67:  Right?</p>

<p>Robin 67:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 67:  "Uh oh!"</p>

<p>Robin 67:  Yeah, it's like, "Ooh, she's really not listening to me."</p>

<p>Berg 69:  Yeah, and she made up her mind.</p>

<p>Robin 69:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 70:  Ah hah. Now you are able to do that with him. I imagine you are able to do that with your baby sometimes?</p>

<p>Robin 70:  Mhm. Oh yeah, yeah. But I don't have to do that as much as far as, he minds.</p>

<p>Berg 71:  Of course not, of course not. I mean 19 month old baby is not going to be the same as the husband.</p>

<p>Robin 71:  Right, right.</p>

<p>Berg 72:  Uh huh. So who do you, I mean, who do you do that with?</p>

<p>Robin 72:  Um, I'm learning to do it with my sister.</p>

<p>Berg 73:  Your sister?</p>

<p>Robin 73:  Mhm. Um, my sister can get to me just about as much as my husband can.  In other words, it's like they know the right buttons to press.</p>

<p>Berg 74:  Of course, of course they do. People close to us, they all know that.</p>

<p>Robin 74:  But, um, she is younger than I am, but she's always thought of herself as more intelligent, more knowing, more, not better, but everybody, if we are together, everybody thinks she's the oldest. She looks older, acts older, dresses older. [Berg: Okay] You know, that sort of thing. [Berg: Okay] And, um, she has a tendency to just hit the right buttons, and for the most part, I'll lash back at her, like, basically like a child when we were children and we would fight it out verbally. Well, there's no point in that. It serves no purpose and all we end up doing is hurting one another, so, I just say, well I'm not going to talk about that.  There's no need to talk about that. Then she eventually drops it and we just go on.</p>

<p>Berg 75:  So she's learning to come your way.</p>

<p>Robin 75:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 76:  So you can do this with your sister. Sounds like you figured it out, how to do that with your sister. [Robin: Mhm] You figured it out with your husband.</p>

<p>Robin 76:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 77:  Okay, and who else do you do this with?</p>

<p>Robin 77:  Basically anybody that gets on my nerves. (laughter)</p>

<p>Berg 78:  Really?</p>

<p>Robin 78:  I try, you know. Because, I, like, I don't have to do it with my parents.</p>

<p>Berg 79:  You don't?</p>

<p>Robin 79:   No.</p>

<p>Berg 80:  Oh, okay.</p>

<p>Robin 80:  My parents don't, they don't bug me, I guess you could say. I don't get annoyed with them. [Berg: Okay] I don't get upset with them. [Berg: Okay] Um, but those people that know how to get to me, I have to learn myself how to not let them get to me, [Berg: Right] and that's, that's, I guess that's the technique I just sort of am trying to learn, and it's, it's so hard to follow through with.</p>

<p>Berg 81:  It is.</p>

<p>Robin 81:  Mhm. Because that's where my emotions come in.</p>

<p>Berg 82:  Right. But how is it that with your sister and with your husband, like Sunday, [Robin: Mhm] how is it that you do not allow your emotions to come through?</p>

<p>Robin 82:  (Sigh) I guess it's because I had control of my emotions to begin with.  [Berg: Huh] Umm. Because, like, here's an example. I can be frustrated or upset over something that happened during the day, and my sister will call, and instead of telling her, you know, I'm not going to talk about that right now, I'll get real defensive because I've already been upset because of everything else that's happened during, during the day. In other words, things build, but like on Sunday, it was like I was mellow, and, um, I wasn't going to let anything else get to me, so. . .</p>

<p>Berg 83:  So when you are mellow . . .</p>

<p>Robin 83:  I can use it a lot easier.</p>

<p>Berg 84:  You can use it, ahh, okay, that's what you mean. Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 84:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 85:  So when you are tired out when you've been through a lot, that's when you are likely to become more emotional.</p>

<p>Robin 85:  Right, yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 86:  Okay, got it, got it. Now, are there times when you have been under emotional stress and still be able to say no, and be in control of your emotions?</p>

<p>Robin 86:  Not yet. (laughter) Um, a couple of times I've come close, um, but not really. Not yet.</p>

<p>Berg 87:  Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 87:  I usually, usually then go to the tears or, you know, I'm real good at slamming things, um, [Berg Okay] to let my frustration out.</p>

<p>Berg 88:  Okay. Is that what you mean by being emotional?</p>

<p>Robin 88:  Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 89:  So, when you get frustrated?</p>

<p>Robin 89:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 90:  Right, right. So, let me come back to this. If I talked to your husband, I know he's not here, but if I were to talk to your husband about Sunday or some days like Sunday, where would he say he thinks you're at on a scale of 1 to 10.  Let's say 10 means he feels that you're there, in terms of handling your emotions, and you don't slam doors, and you don't break into tears, and you are able to handle things. And say, oh well, that's just the way it is and just go on. That's 10.  He's very confident that he believes you can do that. 1 is that he saw you at the worst period in your life. [Robin: Mhm] Where would he say you're at between 1 and 10.</p>

<p>Robin 90:  4 or a 5.</p>

<p>Berg 91:  4 or a 5?</p>

<p>Robin 91:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 92:  He would say that?</p>

<p>Robin 92:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 93:  Where would you say you're at?</p>

<p>Robin 93:  I would say a 6.</p>

<p>Berg 94:  6?</p>

<p>Robin 94:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 95:  6? Wow. Uh huh. Now how did you come all the way up to 6?</p>

<p>Robin 95:  It's really funny. My husband says I'm in a cycle. [Berg: Okay] Um, he thinks that I have severe PMS [Berg Ah hah] and that's what he relates everything to because he, he basically can see the cycle, that I go through. And, um, but taking that out of consideration, I am pretty even, um, and that's why I think it's a 6 where he thinks I shouldn't have, um, any PMS. I shouldn't have any, uh, ah, um, I shouldn't have any of those symptoms. Um, in other words, and during that time, he, I think he does it deliberately, I mean we've argued this point several times. I think he agitates me more, um, and it bothers me more, um, and then, uh, and it wouldn't be so bad if he didn't agitate me, um. But it's like I blame it on him, and that's why I say I'm at a 6, um, where he thinks he does absolutely nothing different all month long, but yet, um, at times I think he gets worse.</p>

<p>Berg 96:  Okay. So you have different ideas about that [Robin: Mhm] between the two of you.</p>

<p>Robin 96:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 97:  Of course you know you are right. (laughter)</p>

<p>Robin 97:  That's right, of course. We know that don't we.</p>

<p>Berg 98:  So, what would you say you would be like when he thinks you have moved up from a 4 to maybe, about up to 6. He sort of tends to agree with you.</p>

<p>Robin 98:  Um, he would say that I wouldn't throw any fits. There would be no more slamming, [Berg: Okay] no more yelling. [Berg Okay] Um, and then he would say I'd moved to a 6.</p>

<p>Berg 99:  So, even when you have disagreements [Robin Mhm] you would not slam the door, that kind of stuff. Is that what, what he's talking about.</p>

<p>Robin 99:  Well, sometimes when I get mad at him over something he did, I just, I don't know, I slam cabinet doors. He doesn't like the way I slam the cabinet doors, you know, you know. That, if I would just calmly close the doors, then he would think, you know, she's got control again. Um, but actually I do it more just to get at him than . . .</p>

<p>Berg 100:  Do you?</p>

<p>Robin 100:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 101:  Oh.</p>

<p>Robin 101:  Because I know it bothers him.</p>

<p>Berg 102:  Oh. So, sometimes you are in control when you decide to do that, [Robin: Yes, yes to get him upset.]</p>

<p>Robin 102:  Sometimes, yeah. I am in control when I . . .</p>

<p>Berg 103:  When you decide to do that.</p>

<p>Robin 103:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 104:  Ah hah.</p>

<p>Robin 104:  It's more getting at him.</p>

<p>Berg 105:  And he doesn't know that, he doesn't know that?</p>

<p>Robin 105:  Well, I don't think he does. I think he, he, he thinks it's me.</p>

<p>Berg 106:  Okay, okay. So, he and you have a very different ideas about your temper.</p>

<p>Robin 106:  Mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 107:  Ahhh, okay. You know, it sounds like you are in a lot more control than he thinks you are. (laughter) Is it?</p>

<p>Robin 107:  I would say yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 108:  You would say yes. Ah hah.</p>

<p>Robin 108:  'Cause he's, um, it's one of those, it's so hard, I think, in any relationship, but basically between a man and a woman, because they think so differently. [Berg: Right] That I don't know what he's thinking, but I'm trying to think what he thinks and react, you know.</p>

<p>Berg 109:  Ahh. Okay. All right.</p>

<p>Robin 109:  So, I usually know what buttons to push.</p>

<p>Berg 110:  So, are you able to then, if you decide, [Robin: Mhm] when you decide this is what I am going to do, are you able to even during your cycle, be calm about, without slamming the door?</p>

<p>Robin 110:  Yes.</p>

<p>Berg 111:  You are able to do that?</p>

<p>Robin 111:  Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Berg 112:  Even during your cycle?</p>

<p>Robin 112:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 113:  Huh. And he doesn't know about that.</p>

<p>Robin 113:  No, no. He, he, he doesn't believe it.</p>

<p>Berg 114:  Ahhh, he doesn't believe that. Okay.</p>

<p>Robin 114:  A lot of times he doesn't even know.</p>

<p>Berg 115:  Right, so. Okay. So let me come back to this then. When you have more, when you believe you are normal and you are calmer and have peace of mind, what will you do about that between you and him? What will you do different?</p>

<p>Robin 115:  Well, the one, I mean, I, when I am calm, and let's say, um, we have an argument and I'm not calm, and I don't try to get him calm, and we end up having a fight or a disagreement, and I use those words so loosely. It's not like, you know, it's just like anybody else, um, we will have a discussion, I'll say, you know, "Well, Ed, look at it from my point of view, you know. Um, you're just not getting it. You're just not hearing me. You're just not understanding what I am trying to say." [Berg: Mhm] And he's like, "Well you know, if you wouldn't do this, this and this, then I wouldn't do this, this and this." And we try to compromise [Berg: Mmm] for the next time, you know [Berg: Mhm] that things might or might not get out of hand. [Berg: Mhm] We do try to have that time where
we're both on common ground so to speak and analyze what had happened.</p>

<p>Berg 116:  So how much percent of the time would you say you are in common grounds, the two of you?</p>

<p>Robin 116:  Mmm.</p>

<p>Berg 117:  Overall, if you look at your life overall.</p>

<p>Robin 117:  80% I would say. Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 118:  80%? I would say that's pretty damn good. (laughter) Don't you?</p>

<p>Robin 118:  Yeah, I think it is.</p>

<p>Berg 119:  Okay. So, when we are only talking about that 20% of the time when you disagree, when you see things differently, [Robin: Mhm] he thinks it's your emotions. [Robin: Mhm] Is that what we are talking about?</p>

<p>Robin 119:  Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 120:  But you don't think it is all your emotions, that he thinks very differently.  He sees things very differently than you do.</p>

<p>Robin 120:  Right, right. Well, a lot of times, one flaw that I do have that causes there to be a confrontation is I will let things build up.</p>

<p>Berg 121:  Ahh, okay. Right.</p>

<p>Robin 121:  And then when they've built up to the point that I can't handle them anymore, [Berg: Okay] then I let him have it with both barrels. [Berg: Okay] Um, and sometimes, if, if I would take like the incident on Sunday and just handle it there and let it go, [Berg: Yeah] most of the time I don't. I'll, you know, I'll get upset and say well, you know, I'm not going to do it, end of discussion, leave mealone, and I would harbor that, you know. In other words, he talks to me harshly, I talk to him back harshly, but then I remember that and then ...</p>

<p>Berg 122:  Ahh, the next time . . .</p>

<p>Robin 122:  And I bring everything up. [Berg: Okay] But, yeah, if I would just, it's sort of like if I would handle the situation right there and ...</p>

<p>Berg 123:  Just drop it.</p>

<p>Robin 123:  Drop it, then it would be okay.</p>

<p>Berg 124:  Okay, okay. That's what you mean by saying tomorrow is another day,just drop it and just go on.</p>

<p>Robin 124:  Right, right.</p>

<p>Berg 125:  Got it, got it. Okay, great. Well, I think I have enough information.  This is the time that I would like to take some time, [Robin Okay] think about our conversation here. [Robin: Okay] I want to think about all of this.</p>

<p>Robin 125:  (laughter) Okay.</p>

<p>Berg 126:  Okay?</p>

<p>Robin 126:  All right.</p>

<p>Berg 127:  And we'll get together , oh, maybe about five minutes?</p>

<p>Robin 127:  Okay.</p>

<p>Berg 128:  All right? So, don't go away.</p>

<p>Robin 128:  Okay.</p>

<p>CONSULTATION </p>

<p>Berg 1:  I had, of course, lots of things were going through my mind as I was talking to her, [de Shazer: Mhm] but that's beside the point. Um, I think that she does know how to pick her battle, [de Shazer: Mhm, mhm] but she doesn't think she does, uh, and she would like to be able to pick her battles a little bit more.</p>

<p>de Shazer 1:  That was pretty wise to pick your battle, only pick battles you're going to win.</p>

<p>Berg 2:  Absolutely, absolutely.</p>

<p>de Shazer 2:  Mhm, so, yeah she should, you know, as a homework task, just observe what kind of signals she's reading, or what kind of data she takes in, or what tells her this is a battle that I should choose. And then once as an experiment, um, she should behave as if she chose, when she, yeah, should behave as if she chose this battle, even though she hasn't. Just once, as an experiment.</p>

<p>Berg 3:  Just once.</p>

<p>de Shazer 3:  And see what she can learn from that. Yeah, I think that makes sense.  And she said not yet, right? She hadn't . . .</p>

<p>Berg 4: Not yet, she hasn't been able to do that, right.</p>

<p>de Shazer 4: So you have her pretend or something. Behave as if, um, I think that might be useful for her.</p>

<p>Berg 5: Pretend you decided, uh . . .</p>

<p>de Shazer 5:  No, pretend you chose this battle.</p>

<p>Berg 6:  All right, okay. You chose this as, as your battle. Okay.</p>

<p>de Shazer 6:  Mhm. I think that's pretty amazing that she's saying 80%.</p>

<p>Berg 7:  80%, yeah.</p>

<p>de Shazer 7: That's almost unheard of.</p>

<p>Berg 8:  Really, and you know, seems to me . . .</p>

<p>de Shazer 8:  The baby, too.</p>

<p>Berg 9:  The baby, too. I mean with a, with a baby, she almost has no, sounds, has no problems with that, with the baby. It's just that her sister and her husband.  Those two...</p>

<p>de Shazer 9:  Push the buttons</p>

<p>Berg 10:  Yeah. Push the buttons, she says.</p>

<p>de Shazer 10: Right. So another experiment she might try is when she sees them pushing their buttons, she should pretend they've been disconnected. [Berg: All right] That might be useful too. So you can give her a choice or give her both, you know. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, used to a lot of homework.</p>

<p>Berg 11:  Yeah, okay. I don't know. It sounds like, she says she needs to be told she's normal. [Shazer: Mhm, yeah] So I guess I'll have to tell her she's normal.</p>

<p>de Shazer 11:  Yeah, maybe even slightly above, even slightly above at 80%. [Berg: 80%] That, yeah, not only you and me, but yeah, everybody, back there, the production crew, etc., etc., all agree that that is, at least above average.</p>

<p>Berg 12:  That's pretty good considering she has a 19 month old baby.</p>

<p>de Shazer 12:  Well, yeah, right. That's just a good age to make it feel like there is minus 80%.</p>

<p>Berg 13:  Mhm. Okay. All right.</p>

<p>de Shazer 13:  Okay.</p>

<p>Berg 14:  I'm ready.</p>

<p>de Shazer 14:  Me, too.</p>

<p>SESSION WITH ROBIN RESUMES</p>

<p>Berg 129:  Well, um, as you know, ah, my colleague and I talked just a little bit about what we talked about, and seems to me that not only you are normal, but I would say you are slightly above normal [Robin: laughter] considering, [Robin: Considering] considering you have 19 month old baby and they can really get on your nerves, [Robin: laughter] and you have a husband and a sister who know how to push the right button for you. [Robin; Yeah] And you have, surrounded by these people, and you considering that, and you are saying, you know the trouble starts only about 20% of the time. I would say that's way above normal. [Robin: laughter]  I don't know how many people can say that. Um, so, you know, I would say, um, you are really doing very well by picking your battles. [Robin: Mhm] Sounds like you know how to do that. You know how to do that with your sister. You know how to do that with your husband. Sunday is a very good example of that. And, um, I think that it is really wise thing to do. That we all have to pick our battles as we go through life. [Robin: Right] It's not just with husbands. [Robin: laughter] You know, it happens everywhere, [Robin: Mhm] and so I think you need to continue to do that, decide to pick your battles, [Robin: Mhm] and that's when you decide to have control.</p>

<p>Robin 129:  Right.</p>

<p>Berg 130:  That's where the control is. Now, however, you have these two people who are not terribly cooperative with you, [Robin: laughter] and they know which button to push, and, uh, sounds like they both are very close to you.</p>

<p>Robin 130:  Yes.</p>

<p>Berg 131:  So it's one of those situations, just like a baby, you know, there's good things and bad things, right? (laughter) Anyway, so just, I have some suggestions for you to experiment with. [Robin Okay] Just an experiment. Try this. I, um, that is, that, watch, pay attention to what signals that you pick up, like the Sunday incident. What signal that tells you that this is the battle that you can win or you are going to win. [Robin: Mhm] Like I'm not sure how you knew that Sunday.</p>

<p>Robin 131:  Mhm. By the comments that he made, that he started with.</p>

<p>Berg 132:  Right, right. And so there is something with him and with your sister that sounds like you sort of get an idea about what tells you even before you get to the point what tells you "Ah hah, this is the battle I am going to pick." Something that tells you that. And so pay attention to what those clues are that tells you that.</p>

<p>Robin 132:  Mhm.</p>

<p>Berg 133:  Okay. That's one idea I have. The other idea I have is that perhaps you can, um, just, just one time, just one time, pretend that you decided that this is the battle that I'm going to, I can win. [Robin: Mhm] Okay? And see what you do with that.</p>

<p>Robin 133:  Okay, okay.</p>

<p>Berg 134:  Okay, just once, and that should give you some ideas about how you go about deciding this is how I do it and that will give you more ideas about what to do more. [Robin: laughter] Okay? The other idea is perhaps since your husband and your sister know which button to push with you, I wonder, have you ever thought about maybe you could pretend like you just disconnected the wire, when they push the button?</p>

<p>Robin 134:  (laughter) Yeah, I could I guess. I never thought of it that way.</p>

<p>Berg 135:  No?</p>

<p>Robin 135:  Well, yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 136:  Something to think about.</p>

<p>Robin 136:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Berg 137: And again, try experimenting a little bit with what seems to work, what seems to work best, [Robin: Uh huh] and both picking the battle as well as what you do to pretend like I just switched off the wire. Just disconnected.</p>

<p>Robin 137:  (laughter) Yeah, I think, I think I could try that.</p>

<p>Berg 138:  You think you could try that. Okay. Great. Well, I hope that's helpful.</p>

<p>Robin 138:  Yes, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Berg 139:  You are welcome, you are welcome. Well, thank you for coming.</p>

<p>Robin 139:  Thank you.</p>

<p>Berg 140:  And I wish you luck.</p>

<p>Robin 140:  Thank you very much.</p>

<center><p><b>Treatment Plan for Robin</b></p></center>

<p>Berg indicates that her approach to Robin in future sessions would depend largely on Robin. She would begin the next session with "What's better, even a little bit?" She feels it is likely that Robin will report that her life is better and she would then suggest that Robin do more of the same. If, however, Robin reported that "nothing is changed," Berg would go for details of each day, looking for what was better, even a little bit. Her goal would be to uncover small pieces of success which would serve as a basis to build on the next piece of success. Even if Robin reported that her life was worse, Berg would search for indications of successes and, patiently, work with these. Thus, instead of problem solving, she would focus on increasing successes in the Robin's life.</p>

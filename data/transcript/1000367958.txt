<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) While I was waiting outside I was really having a struggle with myself because I was positive that I was right in coming today.  But because everything looked shut up I just couldn't stop the thought of probably I was wrong and I shouldn't be here and somehow making a mistake like that bothered me.  And even though I checked after you told me what days you wouldn't be here and I asked again, I still doubted whether or not I was right.  (Pause) And I think what must have bothered me about it mostly was, what if somebody saw me and either I had to explain why I was there or else they'd know anyway that I'd made a mistake like that.  Because I began to sort of think of things I could say if I had to explain why I was there.  And it was partly to make myself believe it really didn't matter so much if I'd made a mistake.  But the feeling I had in some ways was similar to that time when the elevator was broken and I didn't feel I could come find you and sort of trapped and cornered and not knowing where to go. (Pause)</p>

<p>It was funny.  After having about, well, I guess it was a week of not coming I was amazed at how much felt I had to make myself come today, that it was something I didn't want to do and how much it was sort of a relief not to come.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Uhm, when you say it's funny, you mean you hadn't expected that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  Except that, well, I find I can't remember too much how I was feeling right before I stopped coming a week ago.  But it did seem to me that whatever thoughts were coming to my mind were ones I was finding very hard to admit.  And so perhaps I'm not so surprised.  (Pause) I think it was right after I stopped coming, too, that I went to see the movie, "Gone with the wind."  And I had a reaction to it that is something I had before when I read the book to an extent.  But it was such a strong reaction, it surprised me very much.  And, and this was the sort of, well, concern that I felt when it didn't seem that Scarlet and Rhet Butler would end up sort of saving their marriage, that somehow she had found out too late how she felt about him.  And it just, I was, I just couldn't get it out of my mind.  And I know it was because I have that same feeling.  Or I have this fear that right now I know I'm not responding to MSCZ.  And sometimes I can and usually when I'm on vacation I can better than when I'm not.  And it's certainly been true this time.  But I still don't have any kind of sustained feeling.  I'm still, I know, too concerned with myself.  And I just have this awful fear that by the time I can stop thinking so much about myself and think of somebody else it might be too late.</p>

<p>(6-minute silence) I think another fear I have, I've been trying to work it out in my mind for a long time and I think perhaps this is another thing that seeing "Gone with the wind"  made me wonder.  And that is knowing that I'm not responding to MSCZ with the kind of feeling I would think would be love, even though I'd like to or even though maybe occasionally I feel something quite strongly toward him, I just, I can't really sustain any kind of feeling that way or very often feel that way.  And it makes me wonder if I really can for anybody.  And sometimes I've thought about MEIR the CHN boy who had seemed to me so important and the one person that I'd ever really felt anything for.  But I think that's something that I've made up in my memory.  I think I had a strong feeling for him but I, I think I've increased it in remembering how I felt because I don't seem to feel that way again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What were you, eh, trying to sort out, eh, when you were quiet, just, just before you mentioned this?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, there's a reaction I have when I read a book that has a romance in it or if I see a movie as "Gone with the wind"  which does.  And I'll think, especially if it, if it has a happy ending and it isn't so sickish sweet that, you know, just, — well, I mean it has to be something more than just having a happy ending.  But if it, if the romance works out and the hero and heroine are attractive then I'll think, well is it, wish like could be that way and I wish I could feel that.  And then I'll think that whatever I need to feel that might be right there except I just don't seem to be able to.  And it makes me realize how much, instead of being aware of what is good about MSCZ and, I'll, I'll just start comparing him to fictitious character and people that I don't even know and be very critical about him.  Almost as if, these, if these things were different, then maybe I could feel what I want to feel and I'm not. (Pause)</p>

<p>And even if it's times when I can feel as close to him as is possible for me to feel or as strongly about him as is possible, I still can't keep that feeling for very long.  I can almost feel myself fighting feeling that way.  (Silence) And I think this inability to respond to his feeling or to allow what feeling I do have, if I really have it, comes partly from fighting being a woman.  And, I don't know, there's something about being submissive and that's not it entirely.  But on the one hand I want to respond to him because he is masculine and sort of well, the aggressor isn't the word either, but taking charge.  But on the other hand I can't give up having control myself.  (Pause) And it's only when he really takes charge, if, if there's a time when we're having an argument or if he had wanted to have intercourse and I wouldn't and by taking charge he just decides he's not going to fool with me and he'll withdraw from me, which is, on a minute scale, leaving me, that's when I can sort of submit then and give in to him.</p>

<p>ANALYST: This has, I gather, happened this last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, not really.  This last week I've been feeling closer to him in some ways than I ever have and happier about being with him and wanting to have intercourse with him, which I've rarely felt.  And I don't know whether it came partly from the fear that seeing the movie started in me or made me realize more clearly or whether it's just because I'm on vacation and more relaxed or what.  But, but again that fear would have been — he didn't do it but it was in effect having him say, "I'm leaving you."  And then I could begin to feel something for him that I couldn't feel until that point.  And that leads me to question just what the feeling is too.  If, if it only comes out of that situation or it seems to come out of that situation, then is it any real feeling of affection for him?  And if it is a true feeling of affection for him then it, then I can't understand why I don't feel it at other times.  I think just generally, anyway, I've become more aware of his position and how he must feel.  And it bothers me very much that, even when I'm aware of it and feel badly that I'm causing it, or certainly maybe I didn't actually cause it, we both did but I'm the one who's contributing the most to it now.  But I, even though I'm aware, I still continue to have whatever the feelings are that make it impossible for me to be another way. (Pause)</p>

<p>Because I keep thinking, when I think about what it is that makes it so hard for me to be, or not even to know in my own mind what being a woman would be, I keep just having this vision of my father criticizing my mother and being in a bad temper toward her and, and always thinking, why doesn't she fight back?  She's old enough and she's equal to him.  And just having seen the way he treated her for so long, I suppose in a way it just made me determined I wasn't going to be treated the same way.  (Pause) And it made me try to keep things in our marriage all very pleasant on the surface and then just nothing underneath.  (Pause) I suppose I was feeling, if you're not dealing with too much emotion then you can't, at least you can't have fights and things of that sort.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I don't, when I think about how my father treated my mother and, and possible reactions she could have had, I, I just don't know if she could have done anything differently.  Because by being quiet, he burned out his feeling sooner.  But it did make me feel I couldn't respect her at that time and I couldn't respect him for treating her that way.  And whenever I think of the fact that I'd like, at least now I think I'd like very much to be feminine, I can't, I don't know what it would be.  Because certainly my mother wasn't.  And I think this must be part of it now.  I just, I don't know what being myself would be and I don't know how much having some concept of what being feminine is would help me. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it is sort of ironic that, having felt that my mother'd kind of lost any identity when she was just submitting to my father's anger the way she was, made me feel I wanted to assert my own personality, I guess it would be, by having control and never letting somebody treat me that way.  And in a sense I've probably lost just as much of myself in it or more so.  Because when I think of it this way, I think I'm, all I must be is just a shrew. (Pause)</p>

<p>And thinking about my parents makes me think of having talked to them on the telephone last night.  MSCZ and I had just come back from his parents', which had been just about what both of us anticipated it would be but we were both very happy to be back to our own home.  And we were both feeling very happy in each other's company.  And then my parents called.  And I would have thought I'd just be pleased that they thought to call us at all.  And I was kind of surprised that they did because it didn't really seem like them, or just that they would even think of me at that time.  But for some reason it depressed me very much.  And I don't know whether it was because they thought of calling me and that didn't fit into my picture of our relationship or talking to them in itself, there was something about it that depressed me.  But I think there was something that I was feeling they were expecting from me that I wasn't giving.  And I, it might have been partly the fact that, although I wasn't that eager to spend Christmas with MSCZ's parents because I never liked the kind of situation that develops at that type of family gathering on his side, I had absolutely no desire to have Christmas with my family.  And it might have been feeling guilty about that to an extent.  It wouldn't have occurred to me to call them and yet they thought of me.  And it must have been that they were sorry we weren't there with them.</p>

<p>(5-minute silence) After saying that about my parents I just couldn't keep thinking about them.  And I thought about a lot of other things, a lot about a couple that I met this weekend, or at Christmas, who have a retarded child.  And they're quite old now.  But just how much they give of warmth and love to their child, who must be, it must have been very hard for them.  Because they, h—, tried to have many children before this one lived and, and to have him be a mongoloid.  And then I thought of a girl who's marrying a brother of a good friend of ours and how, of all the people I know, she seems to say things that are, well, I don't like to use the word stupid because I kind of reserve that for me but they do — and I don't like being that harsh on somebody else but they do seem to be awfully silly, anyway, things she'll say.  And yet even though I'm aware of it, if I'm with her I feel as if I'm down at her level, saying equally stupid things.  Even though I don't want to be saying them, I, it's probably an aspect of something I do no matter who I'm with: I adjust myself for the person I'm with, which is partly why I never feel I'm, I'm anything.  And then I began to think of clothes.  Because when I'm on vacation I always try to go shopping and it's the only time I'll try to buy a few things that I've always thought I'd like to have but I'm always afraid to buy.  And somehow I don't like making up my mind about it exactly.  And I, today I did some shopping and I had to make myself go out of the house and do it because I was afraid that once I got to the store I wouldn't be able to make up my mind and that I would just come away not having done something that I'd already decided I was going to do.  And it made me think of how somehow I think if I can dress fashionably I'll become something else and how I just put so much on appearance.  And it made me think of, one day just recently, I don't remember exactly which day, but MSCZ and I had had intercourse and, the night before and it had been one of the few times up to that point that I had wanted to have it and had enjoyed it.  And when I went out that morning, I passed somebody on the street.  And my fi—, first reaction — this startled me — was that they must know that MSCZ and I had had — well, this person must be able to see by looking at me that MSCZ and I had had intercourse.  And at first it horrified me that — because I really believed you could tell by looking at me.  And then it just sort of pleased me.  Because somehow I thought, well, it must show I'm happy and I must look happy.  And I suppose that's why, when I'm feeling usually unhappy or stupid or clumsy or whatever, that I'm so sure everybody else can tell that I am.  (Pause) In fact, I think I have this childish type of attitude no matter what mood I'm in that whatever it is the people I'm with can see immediately what it is or will feel toward me how I'm feeling toward myself.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I would imagine, then, you must have that experience here, hmm, that I sort of know what you are thinking already.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think sometimes I've felt that way.  But when I'm here, if I feel that way it comes partly too from the fact that this is your profession and you've probably done this so many times that you anticipate things.  So that it's more than just me.  (2-minute silence) It's funny.  On that thought I practically stopped thinking of anything.  (Pause) And I, I'm not aware of thinking, well I'm not going to think of anything because you might be able to tell what I'm thinking.  But because of the association it makes me wonder if that's not what I do.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) Well, your time's up.</p>

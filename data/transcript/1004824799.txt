<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it has been a very unusual four days, given that I have been getting on really, really well, happy, happy. And then like unusually so. Not just status quo happy which was really pleasant, which sounds strange to say like, "My girlfriend's pleasant." [00:00:57] But no, she seemed more buoyant. So then, something—and I don't know what happened. I feel like—and I can think of events. But then, I'm now living in the spare bedroom for the first time ever. (pause) </p>

<p>And so, it's odd. I can't figure out what has happened, (pause) so there's sort of chronology of it. [00:01:56] Things are good. She's looking at houses. We're looking at house. She sits with the computer, looks at houses. Things are good. Things are amicable. We're jokey and fun and flirty and very pleasant. And, all along—so we go out to dinner, I go to the show is on the cover. It's (inaudible at 00:02:29) at the theater and talking about the band. (inaudible at 00:02:33) she's buying tickets. She goes, "I don't want to go but you can go by yourself," because she finds his music miserable but she knows that I like it. </p>

<p>But by this time, I'm thinking, "Yea," but I feel like saw him and that was just a phenomenal concert and then we went and we saw "The Tempest" at our local community theater. [00:03:00] And that was very friendly and fun. And we left after the third act. And I remember because we were confused and didn't want to stay to figure it out. (chuckling) And I realize it wasn't even that the acting was bad, I was just I think Shakespeare dropped the ball on "The Tempest." It's just not that interesting. (chuckling) </p>

<p>Anyway, so I thought I told her. She goes, "It's your call." And I said, "Well, we can Wikipedia to find out what happens." (chuckling) So it's fun. So it was happy. We left. In life, there's something you have to do. One thing you have to do, is like leave a play—so we can check box, right? We walked out of the play, so very friendly. </p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:03:42) So, every couple days, or like every day, it's [The thing there.] (ph) She goes, "Check out tickets?" So I said, "No, no," because I was—but this time I'm studying set theory which I just—which [interesting to use] (ph) for a metaphor because set theory is what belongs to what. [00:04:02] What belongs to what. Is this a subset of that? Is this a subset of that? Or do they overlap? What's the union? What's the complement? What's the universe of discourse? Can you make a cross product? Can you do Cartesian coordinates? I'm really just contemplating what belongs to what and being really distracted and frustrated writing proofs for the set theory.</p>

<p>And here we are a set of two elements. And so I kept saying, "No, haven't checked out tickets." But it was very pleasant. I was glad she's was encouraging. "You could check out tickets." And I kept not doing it. And then Stephanie wanted to go out to dinner on Friday night with her new boyfriend. And she's talking on the phone and she says, "Why go for a night?" And I said, "Yea, fine but there's a concert," which I hadn't got tickets for, right? [00:05:07] But I thought, well maybe, right, that there'd be some (inaudible at 00:05:08). So then, Wednesday night—late at night after she was asleep—I thought, "What the hell," right? She's encouraging me in like, "Go, just get a ticket," right? So I go online. Get a ticket. (pause) </p>

<p>Next day, there's discord because she wakes up with great neck pain. I'm in the back in my own world not being attentive. I realize that. [00:05:55] I know when I'm in math mode, that I am flat. I am just so preoccupied and especially when I don't understand something. So I didn't make her tea. I didn't warm up her thing. I didn't offer her ibuprofen or Tylenol. I wasn't showing concern. And I thought if I had gotten up and gone to work, this would not be an issue because I wouldn't be there to give sympathy, but because I was around and studying, I was available to be concerned and I didn't show it. </p>

<p>So she has a (inaudible at 00:06:39) massage scheduled and then she just goes off like I'm not showing any concern. (pause) She feels like no one in her life is concerned for her and everyone is selfish. And her brother is concerned about his love life and is totally selfish of that because he's married. They have a kid and yet he hates his wife and they want to get a divorce. And meanwhile, they had affairs. [00:07:06] It's [his brother] (ph) why he's moping around because his recent girlfriend broke up with him because he's medieval. </p>

<p>So and then Lucille hadn't been calling even though Barbara went out. She said, "I'm just going to help her out." And so she feels like her friends don't call and she always has to make the effort. And then her boyfriend is being selfish and not normally caring about the fact that her neck hurts, all understandable. I did not know any of this about the brother or Lucille or Emma up in England. I wasn't aware of that. So she's been feeling people don't care. And then her neck really hurts which is very upsetting to her because she can't sleep. And then I don't show any concern. [00:07:58] </p>

<p>So that was a bad deal. So I apologized because she doesn't really acknowledge the apology (inaudible at 00:08:11). And I text saying that I'm really sorry that I wasn't showing concern and I was distracted by math and I genuinely feel bad because if she's in pain in there, I really genuinely feel bad for ignoring it. </p>

<p>So there was no response to the text. I forget what I do. The day goes on. (pause) </p>

<p>I come back, she come with—her son had Wii intersect (ph) at some point or another. And I go in and I say, "I really am sorry." (pause) She goes, "All right, you apologized." (pause) It's strange. I mean, I've offered a sincere text apology. I've offered a sincere in-person apology. [00:09:00] And this is not being settled. It's not one sort of pro-fun (ph) apologies that I've done sometimes. I mean, I really—I'm sad that her neck hurts and I'm really sorry that I was distracted by math. (pause) </p>

<p>So the next day—so now we are on that Friday—I forget how things proceeded but she said something about dinner tonight. And I said, "Yea." I said, "I don't know what you did yesterday because yesterday was not the day to say it. But I went ahead and got a ticket." (pause) She goes, "You never want to go out with anybody." That was just like the pinnacle of selfishness which I found—how did the mood changed so quickly from everything happy, happy, happy to everything being horrible Thursday and Friday? [00:10:04] And then that feeling, I was like, "But you kept like every..." I wanted to say, "But you are the one who's been encouraging?" I was sort of like, "Well. But you kind of encouraged me to go to see the show, the show, to see the show." So I got a ticket and now I'm being punished for having got a ticket. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's sad because—was she upset about you getting a ticket because you didn't—what was it she said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, somehow that the fact that I didn't want to go out with Stephanie and her new boyfriend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was being selfish.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, I see. OK, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of a sudden, I thought it's like totally caught me—where did yesterday come from? Where did it come from? Where is this anger about me not showing concern? I mean, and I feel like that's something that one can feel badly about and yet a prompt, sincere text apology and then a real, in-person apology, [00:11:05] sort of like, "What's lingering about this?" And then—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, what's [another one?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: —the issue of—like it's not like—anyways, so getting a ticket. Anyway, so I guess we'd gone to the gym in the morning, came back, and that's when somehow it came to light. And then she was like off the handle about that. So then I said, "Well." She said, "What are you going to do?" So I was in the back, I was packing my bag, and I said, "Well, I'm going to leave." And she goes, "I think that's a good idea," right? So I pack up my backpack full of my study stuff. I pack up my gym bag full of a change of clothes for the concert because that's my stretchy shirts and my t-shirt. So I put in black pants, sweatshirt. She didn't know this, right. But I did packed clothes. And I just left. [00:12:07] So I went to the library, studied at the coffee house. I don't know what I did exactly. (pause) I really don't know what I did. (pause) </p>

<p>And then, so I had the concert at eight and I thought, "I have no intention of going back home." But I still, it was a feeling of like, "I don't know what's going on?" I really felt sort of unnerved by it. Like, "Where is this rage coming from?" (pause) Especially in juxtaposition to the unusually pleasant time that preceded it. [00:12:58] That's the thing that's—like if it was like building, building, building, building, building and crescendoed. But really it seemed like this overnight thing which just—anyway. So—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I'm like, "OK, she needs her space. Who knows? I'm out." So then if I go back she'd be—parked car at the gym, go in, take a shower, change clothes. It's 6:30. We haven't talked at all. And then if I—well fine I'll just leave the car here. Grab something to eat. And then catch the bus into town at the Center. So I do. </p>

<p>And then I guess prior to that in the day—in the afternoon—she said, "I sincerely hope you're going to go the concert since you paid for the ticket." [00:14:11] And I didn't respond to that because I thought as a rule, as a person, I'm not sarcastic. And in a text, I'm never sarcastic. I just don't believe in sarcasm. I think it's mean. I think it's underhanded. I think it's brutal. And so I'm not. But she is sarcastic and so the problem with texts is that tonality is—it's just out, right? </p>

<p>So I didn't know and I thought so this an angry message, right? "I sincerely hope you're going to go to the concert since you paid for the ticket." And I thought, "Well, as opposed to what?" I mean, as opposed to what? [00:15:04] I mean, she's mad so it's not like she wants to see me. So what's my alternative exactly? And so I just thought, "I don't know." So I was thinking, "All right." Not in an angry sort of way. I just I don't know how to respond to that and I don't want to get involved because clearly, she's mad. And it's like this, "(inaudible at 00:15:31) this text for?" </p>

<p>So I ate. I'm on the bus and then it's like have all the texts obviously and so I mean—but it's only going to be effective, "Where are you?" And she always does "r" which is the letter "r" which annoys me. Like, in my texts, I'm always—I write things out. [00:16:01] (pause) </p>

<p>So, then I text back and in a friendly sort of way and I said, "Well it's not going to be as good as the other was," which was this just phenomenal concert, right, where we met in. And the movie and just the whole thing were just amazing and trying to be sort of intimate. Like, "Nothing compares to seeing that which is phenomenal." So I said, so it's I said, "While it's not what I hoped, I'm on the bus," which I thought implied I was on the bus to the Center. [00:16:59] (pause) </p>

<p>Anyway, so then she took that to mean somehow that I was on the way home. And then it came to light somehow because she—and then she said, "Well." She goes, "I hope you're going to be home." But she goes, "If you're not going to home, then I'll cancel Jeffery." Now with Jeffery, we have to have a post fixed on the back porch. Jeffery is a contractor who came on Friday morning to look at it or, pardon me, he was going to come on Saturday morning. And I already texted her earlier in the day saying that it was going to be at 8:00 a.m. that he was showing up. (pause) </p>

<p>So then I thought, she thinks I'm going to stay out all night, as if I'm going to go the concert and stay all...?" I mean, thinking, "Eight in the morning the next day?" [00:18:07] I just—I mean, she's going to cancel that thinking I'm going to being gone?" I'm thinking, "Where is this coming from?" Just baffled by it? </p>

<p>And so I joke back thinking, well, let's just sort of try to leaven this, right? So I texted thinking—I said, "I'll be home well before 8:00 a.m. unless I'm mugged!" Exclamation point, smiley face. (pause) Thinking—very much just thinking, "Where is this coming from?" So I'm trying to leaven it. And she goes, "Where's the car?" And I'm like, "Why is it—where's the—why? What do you want to do with the car?" I said, "The car is at the gym, da, da."</p>

<p>Anyway, so I'm finally at the Center and all of a sudden, it's like this battle that's going on. [00:19:00] And I'm thinking, "What the hell?" And she's (inaudible at 00:19:02) like I don't know. Is she with Stephanie or is she not with Stephanie? Has she been drinking wine because she gets really punchy when she has a couple Pinot Grigios although she disagrees with this, she thinks she's pretty sensible when drinks wine but she's not. (pause) </p>

<p>So I'm sitting outside the Center and I'm like, "Ugh, unbelievable. Where's this rage coming from?" (pause) And then she's like, "We don't talk. You text, you e-mail," meaning, we never e-mail each other but there was something about she needed to go somewhere. And I said, "Well, e-mail me. That way I can see it," because we have this board (ph) because when she says things then I remember it usually. So if I see it, I remember it. (pause) So I just sent an e-mail to remind me which whenever that was when life was happy. She was like, "Oh." [00:20:03] So she sent me this fun e-mail reminding me. I sent her a fun e-mail back. </p>

<p>Well, then she's like, "You text, you e-mail, we never talk. We are different, blah, blah, blah." And it's like, "You don't understand the context." I'm thinking, "You're (ph) not making me communicate." OK, all right. I can see that can be true. But I think I'm sensitive and I think I'm good at expressing things and I usually want to get to the bottom of things. (pause) </p>

<p>And so, people usually don't describe me as someone who doesn't talk, right? [00:20:56] So I'm just thinking, "My God" I mean, I'm just really just baffled by this, totally baffled. So I go into , and I'm like, "Oh my God." I mean, I'm going in to go see the band and usually I—there's this few—it's like there's all this history. The Smiths and I'm thinking, "Wow." I mean, I'm thinking, it's just sort of observing where it's interesting that this is going on. (pause) And not feeling the jauntiness of Oscar Wilde or the full of irony and wit that is this band. [00:22:00] Instead, I'm going in thinking this person has written this music that means a lot to me and yet I'm feeling a bit on the edge. I'm thinking back over my life, thinking, "Well, I've listened to the Smiths on all occasions over many years. And this sort of just happens to be the way I'm feeling now which isn't in congress with the same as the Smiths. (pause) And it happens to be the close to the Smiths fortunately because his new music sounds the same way. [00:22:56] </p>

<p>So there I am and I'm like, "I don't know whether another text is going to arrive." I'm feeling, "Whatever." And I'm sitting there and looking around and I'm thinking, "This looks interesting. This is fascinating to me." It's just men without partners. We're showing up. Like everybody just all seemed to kind of—and I thought, "Isn't it interesting that this band might have that sort of crowd, just you don't go as a couple. Guys just show." So there was like this row and just like you around and it's like an unusual number of just sort of guys with single tickets and showing up. [00:23:53] </p>

<p>Anyways, I thought, "Huh." So this guy sat next to me. And this guy was sitting for like 15 minutes later he shows up. I thought, "Somebody actually like, this is like a thing, right?" I mean, somehow I assume that it mean something. It means something to people in a very deep way that you show by yourself. It's (inaudible at 00:24:26) something. I mean not by, not without the religiosity of it but just the sense of just it's a solitary thing perhaps, right? In thinking about are there lots of—I'm thinking about this guy as he sort of approached and sat down. And I thought, "How interesting." Like, add him to the collection of others. I'm thinking, "Are there other sad, miserable, angry girlfriends at home?" And are you to assume: "Well, are they gay? So are there boyfriends? Are they alone? Are they out of a relationship?" [00:24:59] (pause) </p>

<p>Anyway, so this guy, I don't know, he's probably like 20s or early 30s, a little bit doughy, had a beard. And so I'm contemplating this. So I look and I said, "It's nice sitting up in the balcony like this because you can appreciate the beauty of the ceiling." It's like the  Center really is quite ornate which I had forgotten about. And he goes, "Well, I've never been here." He goes, "But yea, you're right." He goes, "I wonder how they painted that?" And then that was it. So we sort of made a connection. I mean, we're—and then just kind of sat there. (pause) </p>

<p>And anyway, so the opening band—she was this person who sounded like—she sort of did a cross between Siouxsie and the Banshees and Kate Smith. [00:26:12] Not Kate Smith. Jesus, Kate Smith. That means nothing. Kate Bush. (chuckling) Yea, well that combo thing. Yea, God bless America.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: God bless wine (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing) So that was that. And then the band came out and they're—(pause) I don't know. So there's a sense, there's sort of looking and thinking, "This is a person who sort of in the soundtrack of—(pause) I mean, since being sixteen." [00:26:59] So, and finding him just as persona, just you can't pin him down. It's just this amorphous creature and you just can't pin him down. I mean, in any sort of way. And things he says on stage, you're just—like I don't know. Now you wonder, "Is he's being funny or he's just depressed or he doesn't know what he's thinking." I don't know. I mean, is he gay? Is he straight? Is he asexual? Bisexual? It's like, "Who knows what this person is, right?" And yet, he writes the most amazing lyrics and the most amazing music. And as a person, he just lives in his mansion in Los Angeles and it's like he just doesn't go out. That's just what he is, right? He just doesn't go out. And you just sort of—I can see him just sort of sitting in a room all day long. I'm just like, "Scary." It's just very odd, that. [00:28:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Another man alone. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And also just sort of like amused. Almost like he's listening to things in his own mind that he's sort of amused by. And so then—(pause) and so da, da, da. And then, and I am not—I know people gravitate toward this song. And for me, I think about it in the abstract but I'm not as a vegetarian. One can't help but think about it so "Meat is Murder." And so, on the video screen—that's why I'm sitting there because a lot of times standing but then people are sitting finally. And so then I was sitting and it's funny, I thought, "Well, I'm sort of in this weird space mentally." [00:29:06] And I thought, "I'm aware of the fact this is this phenomenal song I've listened to thousands of times in all kinds of situations driving back and forth, on planes, everywhere." (pause) </p>

<p>And so in the video, it's just in black and white. And it's just like these lamenting cries in the background—as is the case on the album—of just you can like this whining howl of animals in the background. And on the black and white, you see chickens being killed, and bulls being castrated, and cows having their necks cut, and just the grisly gruesomeness that is modern day "how you get your beef, how you get your eggs, how you get your chicken." [00:30:11] And it's just endless, and I'm sitting there and I'm like this. I'm just in my chair and watching this, just watching the visuals. And I'm just thinking, "Of all the times that I've heard this song and just watching it and really getting affected by it." Thinking, "God it's just so sad." </p>

<p>I really think that, just in general, just—I mean, it's just as a representation of all kinds of other auras that you could just send out, just the anonymity of the banality of evil. I [wish it'd] (ph) say, right, that just faceless people who die and faceless chickens who die and how—as the song is going on and on. [00:31:03] And it finally ends and you just—sort of this whipping of the quarter round. And you sort of loathe odd way of hearing present things. And he goes, (mimicking) "And that's the way it is. And that's what they are. And they were." (pause) </p>

<p>And thinking that's an interesting way of capturing that. But yea, I mean, and then we're—and without any sort of—it's not like I don't think he scripts this stuff. It's just sort of him just extemporaneously—(pause) the animals that bark, the animals that are, the animals who have this fate. [00:31:59] And anything else that might have such a horrible fate and yet will go into the next song, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>I think it's just like, man, talk about understatement. I mean, it's just in this very odd sort of really is "Da, da, da, da." and this Norman English accent. And in a very—it's like he's all swallows his words. It's just so, it's almost like not even looking at the audience. It's almost looks like—he looks like a really shy person in a way. And yet he's this grand performer. </p>

<p>He's always walking along the stage, just touching people's hands. There's like all these single—it's all these men up close to the stage and he's always like just shaking hands. And it's always like a—very gentle handshake. And at the very end—for "How Soon Is Now?"—people I think are allowed—and this must be choreographed in some way because there's security there. But people just like want to get onto the stage. [00:33:00] And so they rush toward him. It's always one at a time. And what they do is they give him this very sort of loose hug and he gives them a loose hug. And then it's almost like kissing the pope's ring. It's like they rush up and they give him a hug. And security like makes this mock effort to get—and then they hug and then like sort of go back into the audience. And I think, "You see his efforts struggling." and then they [want to proceed] (ph) onto the stage. He's wearing this pink ruffle shirt with his wine. He tours a pink shirt or he's wearing white or blue the entire time. And then for "How Soon Is Now?" (inaudible at 00:33:29) comes out wearing pink ruffle thing. </p>

<p>And like, so I'm no, like people need to be struggling to be getting on the stage and then give him this sort of fainting hug. And then disappear, right? Yea, security does not ever intercept these people, I think. They rush towards this way to get them. But anyway—and then at the end of the song, he takes off his pink shirt and just throws it into the audience and goes, "Goodnight," and walks off. And then that's it. [00:34:05] </p>

<p>So I don't want to. And then I have my math books with me. So I just walk in, "Do, do, do, do." Go get on the bus and then I'm just on my ride home, just so I can think at home. There's some Morrissey and then I'm reading about math. </p>

<p>And anyway, I get home. (pause) And she had mentioned something in a text. Sort of like the idea of me not coming back. And I thought well, "Either the couch or the futon." I thought, "Well, screw it. I'm just going to get out the sheets and the blankets and make up the—pull it out." It's a nice pull-out couch, futon thing and there I was. And (inaudible at 00:34:55) </p>

<p>And then I go back that night and I made dinner. Except I thought "Well, I want everything to be routine but I'm not going to be volunteering. I'm not going to be trying to connect. I'm just going to be giving her space. I don't know if I want to be close to her because I'm feeling strange." And so we just watch the news, ate. And then I just didn't shut the door because (inaudible at 00:35:30) went to asleep. </p>

<p>Same thing, she came home last night and I was just in the room reading with the door shut. And so today, and I woke up, took her to work because I need to work today so I need a car. And it's odd because I'm not sure to what degree—it's like I don't know what is being played because I feel like I want to be nice. [00:35:58] I think she wants to be nice. But then yesterday when she came home, as she opened the door, I'm lying on the futon. She goes, "You look comfortable." And I thought, I was like willing to be nice. And then it's like clearly, the futon is uncomfortable but more importantly it's not that bad. But what's uncomfortable obviously is having to be—or not really, really having to be—but it's now feeling like I need to retreat in some way. So, "You look comfortable." It's sort of like, " Well, it's not a comfortable situation." And it's not like I'm just sort of like reposing on the futon. No, I'm in isolation. And I'm trying to stay out of your way. And so I thought, "I need some sort of reconciliation that I felt like could have done." I sort of thought, "Well, I'm not going to react to that." But I thought, "Ah, geez. Like, what's that about?" [00:36:51] </p>

<p>I saw this morning—having to react in the morning—but normally I listen to sports radio. It's like, "I'm not. I'm just going to be. Not that I'm not going to sing to myself as I often do. I'm not going to joke around. I'm not going to walk and touch her shoulders and love her in the bathroom when she's getting ready. I'm not going to make her tea like I normally do. I'm just going to give (inaudible at 00:37:20) fully dressed before she even gets up, make breakfast, be in my room ready. When she's ready, then go. So it's like it becomes this very passive aggressive thing. That morning passive aggressive, I've just been trying to (inaudible at 00:37:30).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (sirens in the background) Fireman (ph). You know I was thinking about her saying that we don't talk. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't talk. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:37:54) Yea. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I—(pause) I don't know. And running a parallel to this is, first of all, me trying to be just a nonpresence. [00:39:00] I move things out of the table, everything that I normally do to take care of things such as making a nice dinner, all of that being done. Things that needed to be done, such as getting pictures from CVS and she wanted removing the air conditioner which we normally do together. I did that myself. Things she didn't have to be done but did, like sweeping the leaves off the back porch because were ever so minor. But it's like I'm doing things to be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And not in an angry way. Like, "Screw you. I'm doing all this stuff and look at this." I mean, I'm genuinely trying to process what it is she's feeling. I feel like, "What I have I done?" because I feel like, I mean, "Do I have a really, really blind-spot? What exactly happened?" And I do not know. [00:39:59] </p>

<p>So yesterday she looks—since she was home, she was getting comfortable. And I said, "Well, (inaudible at 00:40:10). And she said, "Well, do you want to talk?" And I said, "Well, I sent you a text that said that for what it's worth, I'm sorry for not communicating better and I got no response from it." So I said, "I don't want to fight but I feel like I put that out there." She goes something to the effect of like, "You don't know what..." But I said, "I don't know what's going on." [00:40:58] She goes, "You have no idea what's going on." And I thought—and that has sort of enraged me. I didn't show that but I thought, "Fuck you." I mean like, "Why?" Well actually there's a guessing game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, clearly at text doesn't work because that's like irritating that we write. She actually wants to talk. I mean, she doesn't respond to text that is friendly and is straightforward that as I could be. (pause) </p>

<p>So then I made a nice dinner and I said, "Well, when you go shower, I'll make you dinner," to actually like put it together. So while she's getting ready because she's talking on the phone, at that's fine. Of course when she's in the shower, I just put it all together and then I ate my own. I just went in the bedroom and shut the door. And that was it. [00:40:58] </p>

<p>So, she got out of bed. I noticed this morning that she put most of it back. I don't know what she ate instead. I know she didn't—(pause) something. And so I'm just baffled where this—I really am Frank. I'm just feeling like I can understand like all the issues. But it's like, "How did it switch?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: How did it switch? I mean, it feels, it really does, it feels like me ignoring her neck pain because I was distracted with mathematics began this cascade that totally caught me off guard. </p>

<p>And so anyways, in the meantime, and running the part (ph) of the tracks, I still have to study. I'm still banging my head against set theory which is OK to make. But gradually I made some traction. [00:42:59] Oh yes, Friday that's what I did. I went over and talked to my teacher. And of course, I'm feeling mad. I'm feeling frustrated. And I sat there. I'm feeling frustrated with this house being up for sale. I'm feeling that it's a backburner. My primary feeling like, "What the hell is going on with Barbara?" And I'm irritated that there's no way online, anywhere, no book explains how to prove anything in set theory and yet the homework asks us to prove it. So I'm mad at my teacher. I'm frustrated with the material. And so sitting there, and he's like—have sort of like a standing thing where on Fridays I'll go and meet with him for an hour. </p>

<p>So we're sitting there at the math department in this little cubby area which is nice on the fourth floor of the science center. And he's a very nice Asian, good guy unlike (inaudible at 00:43:54). And I said, "I'm sorry that..." He said, "I can tell you're frustrated." And he goes, "Yea. Come on in. We'll talk about it how to do this stuff." [00:44:07] And so very patient. But I had to tell him. I said, "I'm sorry. I'm frustrated because feel dumb looking at stuff and I can't get an answer."</p>

<p>I said, "I feel like I have a learning disability when it comes to this. And I feel like I'm not a moron and yet I look and I just don't get it." He goes, "Well, let's do what we did in class." And I said, "But I understand that." And I said, "It's this particular problem when you're doing a complement of a complement and you're subtracting." And he goes, "Well, but let's do this one." I said, "I don't want to do that one." I said, "This is the one I don't understand." He goes, "OK, I know that you understand that one but I think it will help if we actually think very carefully about this one." And I go, "Oh Jesus." I'm just like, "OK, fine." </p>

<p>So begins to teach it. Like, I know this, I know this, I know this. [00:44:58] And he looked at me and he goes, "I see what the problem is." He goes, "When you see something that's written like this, you think you have to come up with all the solutions." He goes, "That's not how we do it. If something is equal to something, we have to somehow use that information and try to get a proof to that point." He goes, "There's a direction to them." He goes, "Mathematicians don't just look at things and think, 'Well, what could it be?' We look and see what's A to be equal to B to. We try to arrive to that." And all of a sudden, I thought, "Oh." That reduces it from infinite to just a finite, particular thing. Is (inaudible at 00:45:45) to it or not? And you use that. (pause) </p>

<p>And then my alarm went off because he set it because he said he wanted to meet for a half hour. [00:46:02] So I put it in four quarters thinking, "Well, it's never going to—it's fine." I meet him for a half hour and put it in (inaudible at 00:46:11) quarters. But he kept talking. And so my alarm goes off. And (inaudible at 00:46:17) the meter. So it's "Frankly, Mr. Pratt." That's my alarm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Frankly, Mr. Pratt."</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he goes, "Oh, what's that?" And I said, "Oh, it's my alarm, it's my meter." And he goes, "OK." So he goes, "Let's just finish this real quick." So I said, "But I'll leave in three minutes" because then, well, it goes on and on and on. And it's like, "OK, I'm going to take it. It's worth it because I need to figure this out." [And in other one] (ph) like I said, "OK, sorry. Thanks for that. I've got to go."</p>

<p>And so he's like very careful and (inaudible at 00:46:46) probably he started out with. Let's just do this quickly. See how it can be done. Do, do, do, do, do, do. He writes it all out and did it very neat. And he hands me all the paperwork and he goes (inaudible at 00:46:57) ticket. (pause) And he goes, "See you next week." So I marched out. I did not get a ticket. (pause) So there's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems kind of similar to the experience with Barbara.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's the thing. Intellectually and emotionally, I feel like there are weird things going on with my math life and my inexplicable relationship life. And both seem inexplicable and I don't get either. Although now I'm starting to move ahead and I get it so now I'm feeling, "OK, I understand this stuff." So I'm feeling calmer about the math world. But now, yea, I can't help but somehow think of sets and subsets and Venn diagrams and things that cannot be turned into a Venn diagram, like if you have four circles. You can only do three, right? You can't do Venn diagrams with more than three circles. [00:47:59] Doesn't work. (inaudible at 00:48:01) think about why, because it gets very complicated. And you can't visualize it. So I'm thinking, "Wow, that's kind of how it feels with Barbara. It's like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —the more I'm realizing limits in some way and trying to put a puzzle together. It doesn't go together and I'm thinking, "Wow, it was together and then it fell apart."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, yea, yea. I mean, it almost seemed like—and maybe I wonder if it did feel this way—like it was kind of like, "Well, you know why I'm mad at you. You should know. You should know." And the feeling inside of you of like, "Well, I thought I knew. I'm giving these—you keep taking me back to this problem (inaudible at 00:48:45)—I've been asking you. I've told you I was sorry about this thing." And she's saying, "No, no that's not it. That's not it." </p>

<p>And I was thinking, yea, but it seemed like you also had a question to pose for her that you didn't know. [00:49:06] I mean, first of all, you didn't know the answer to why she's so pissed. It has something to do with somehow you guys went from it feeling really good and this house stuff is going on. She's feeling pretty good and all of a sudden (clapping hands), it goes another way. What's going on? What's happening? (pause) </p>

<p>And I think that's how you arrive at the answer. I mean, no, not you knowing. And—(pause) Yea, I think she wanted you to know the answer (pause) because I think you're right. It's something deeper than all this. [00:49:59] It's something about—and who knows. I mean my thoughts, just to share them with you, where was it has something to do with feelings about buying a house and what it means for the two of you. I think for you, I was thinking it means a lot about—to you—about her putting down the money. And her taking care of something. And what all of it brings up between the two of you. (pause) </p>

<p>And something that she can't—that it's hard to talk about it. I think that's been true about the two of you guys in this whole thing. It's been a tough thing to talk about, man. [00:50:59] It means so much for the both of you, I think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the highlights, whatever is going on, I mean, at work. I mean, that's the main thing, right? So that informs (ph) everything. (pause) And that I don't want to talk about it. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. (pause) I think you feel badly about it. (pause) And I think she must have some difficulty talking about it too, your fiancé. [00:52:07] (pause) And I got to say, on the other hand, I also think that there's something in it for—I think she gets something from taking care of you too. It does mean something for her take care of you. Take care of this one. She's a nurturer, I'd say. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: She is but she can't stand after when she takes care of (inaudible at 00:52:53) because it's like people end up there usually because of their dumb neglect (ph). [00:53:06] They smoke, they drink, they're 800 pounds, they do drugs, they don't take care of themselves. And the only people she has genuine sympathy for are the people who are just blindsided with something genetic that just—the 30 year old that just... bam. They were traveling and got infected with something and now it's like, "Oh." (pause) Or a perfectly healthy life and all of a sudden they're going in for cancer for no good reason. It's genetics. (pause) [00:54:10] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Well, does she do this with some scorn then, the whole job thing? (pause) Yea, but in her—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yea. And then there was the presidential debate and she said, "(inaudible at 00:54:44) of things to do." It's like, "Find out how to get an (inaudible at 00:54:48) dog. She's going to need one during the election." So (inaudible at 00:54:55) she could have voted because now she's a citizen. This is her first presidential election while being a citizen. [00:54:59] Well, she could have voted prior to that. Well, she could have not for federal elections. If you're a green card, you can vote local and state but not federal. So this is the first time she could vote for a president. And she hates that. And I'm thinking, "Interesting." We're on the same page with that and yet we look at housing in a neighborhood where every sign has a Republican name on it. And it feels like, "Well."</p>

<p>But then we live on a street that is really progressive. This place as a whole is really progressive. (inaudible at 00:55:42) When we look at that area, she goes, "Yea, I know." She goes, "Conservative's are winning here." I said, "Yep." (pause) [00:55:50] </p>

<p>Anyway, so I'm thinking her politics are in the right place. Her heart is in the right place. And yet we are different. And there's this very sensitive topic that's a really, really big issue that I don't know how to deal with in my own life. And yet it affects her and it creates this weird dynamic. And I have no good thing to say about it. It's not like I can—(pause) (inaudible at 00:56:33) that like that comment, blah, blah, blah. It's like, no, it's deeper than that. (pause) </p>

<p>Last week—I forget what day it was—it was Friday morning. Friday evening, pardon me. [00:57:01] Thursday, Thursday, pardon me. So this was the first day of acrimony. I had to go over to the Academy because I was teaching my usual thing. And so, driving around and sort of looking and thinking, knowing at this point that's I was going to go see the show and realizing all of what's going on, and driving around thinking, "Wow, so—" (pause) I don't know. </p>

<p>I guess you know, you know what I've been thinking, right? My history with thinking about thinking, thinking about things I know and don't know and things—[00:57:57] And so anyway, being at this prestigious place, right? And looking at just a miniature Harvard and not so miniature actually. It's a massive campus. It'd been rainy and cloudy and foggy in the evening. And really sort of idyllic in terms of like, "Wow," sort of a brooding fall at a prep school. (pause) </p>

<p>I'm thinking, yea that's—I understand it and I don't understand it. I went to a prep school but not a prep school like that. (pause) And sort of just looking at very, very competent kids now, traveling along and thinking, "They're already at college. They're precocious in this social way: they are independent, they're on their own, they're living here, and they're being taken care of. [00:59:01] They live here in their aimless study." I'm thinking, "That's the mindset." I get that. You're reading—like I get being 17 and feeling that sense of independence that's almost there. And you're reading Camus (sp?) and you're eager and you're just a sponge for everything and you're doing well. And you have people who you like and you're listening to the Smiths. And you feel sensitive to everything and everything is so at the front, right? [00:59:59] </p>

<p>There's like nothing has receded, right? There's no deep past. There aren't things yet that you've forgotten which somehow is important. As you get older like there are things that you just sort of forget. You sort of like (inaudible at 001:00:16) so soon. But at that point, everything is there, all the feelings and thoughts and the future and the sense of competence. And I'm thinking, "There I am. I'm studying in this very grand room because I got there early. And they'd teaching in this very crammed, very—it feels familiar because I've been in many rooms like this. I've taught in rooms like that and there had been student rooms like this. But I'm thinking by now I'm in high school. It's in a college. It's like really going to the scene of the crime in some way. [01:01:10] And now I'm an adult, an adult at a prep school. I'm thinking, "I relate to being the teacher but I relate to being the student." And I was really thinking about that, the idea of being a student. And not in a—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 001:01:41) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea—not in a weird, arresting (ph) sort of way but just really—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —feeling like it was so right there and the history of it. And I'm thinking, "Isn't it interesting." It's like one thing to be in a university, but to be in a place like that. I just think, "Like this is—this is where everyone is—like it's very similar and the same. [01:02:13] And people haven't become who they're going to become yet. And it's like, you think of the presidents who have gone—mostly think it's the time but I mean, in retrospect thinking, it's like this is sort of a launching point and yet at that point that's not the concern, right? It's like people are feeling who they are. It's not like they're on a track in a university. They're still kids and there's something—(pause) </p>

<p>I don't know. There was something very, very—(inaudible at 001:02:58) democratic but I guess (inaudible at 001:02:58) primary accurate. But the sense of like at that age we're all very similar. [01:03:05] In the sense that we have similar worries. And yet, then life kicks in at some point, right? And then we're on a track and family kicks in and expectations kick in if you're somebody who comes from something where there is that. The Bushes, right? So I mean, there is pedigree that kicks in. But at some point just thinking in life about the role of gratitude and nurturing and the idea of feeling open and yet being see yourself in somebody else and relate having empathy. It's like, yea. (pause) It's really important and maybe kids are more capable of—there's less distance. [01:04:02] Like they're frightened but they're aware that—I don't know. There's something about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then more defenses build up, and then—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —there's this sense of like, "I'm different this sort of person and that sort of person. You're (inaudible at 001:04:15) on math. OK, we don't get each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that stuff gets buried.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's reified in some way, and yea. And then there's a sense of like, "People are different. People are different. People are different." It's hard to sort of realize—(pause) so "Meat is Murder." Cows, chickens, people. It really made me feel like, "Wow, it's interesting that we really separate ourselves from certain things that are unpleasant." It's easy to think of, "Well, there are just those people." [01:05:02] I'm sure there's studies on this, right, where people's ability to cause harm to people is maybe a function of their separateness or there being of a different standing, right? How is it that Hitler can kill Jews? Well, Jews weren't well regarded. (pause) How is it that homeless people get beat up? Well, we would have sympathy. But some people don't and there's this distance. They're not like me. So there are these groups. Matt Cassel gets hurt. Ah, he's no person. He's such a horrible quarterback, move, move, move, move, move. Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer. He's been hurt. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the 47 percent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know the reference.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Romney, the whole speech about the 47 percent. [01:06:02] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Half. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Yes. (pause) I don't know. (pause) She left work early today. I got a text [informing me of this.] (ph) She never leaves work early. She's says—just texting me—she said she's going to bed. She walked home which is not a small walk. (pause) It's like I feel like she's exhausted, I'm exhausted. (pause) I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. [01:06:59] (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm afraid she's somehow in her mind going to sort of preclude something about me that I don't want her to do because I don't want to have to think about it. I don't want her to somehow—(pause) You never want this conversation. It's weird. It's like that (ph) talk. You don't like that. I don't want to talk about certain things. I want to talk about this job thing and yet it's I'm sure it under weighs everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, it might be the thing that makes her feel careful. (pause) [01:08:00] </p>

<p>CLIENT: So weird. For my morning class, I felt like I was—it's weird. It's like this performer comes out. I feel like you don't see it. Barbara doesn't see it. The only people who see it are people in my classes, right? But there's this sense of people feeling good and engaged. And I feel like just on show. And I teach and I'm dynamic and funny. And yet I'm the only person who knows that and people in my class, the people in my life who are never in my classes. So I feel like I'm always expressing to you, to my math teacher, or to Barbara this self-doubt or being equivocal or whatever. But when I'm on stage—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. [01:09:06] </p>

<p>CLIENT: —I'm funny and have the answers. And people look at me with great interest and they're intrigued. And I go and get in the car. And it's like, "Oh,"—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —and then I go home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. You lose that, you lose that. Yea, and I think going into that kind of conversation, it really gets lost. It really gets lost. (pause) All right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [I know we're running late.] (ph) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, yea. </p>

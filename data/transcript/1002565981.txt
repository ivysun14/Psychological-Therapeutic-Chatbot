<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm all right, how about you?  Hanging in there in the winter?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh we're all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are things at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're good at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What changed since two weeks ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're talking, I don't know, we let it go I guess, we talked about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What'd you say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I apologized.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I let her know that I had feelings too and that she couldn't disregard me and she apologized and we talked about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's been different since you apologized to each other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we're fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] tends to get worked up and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not the only one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know, I know, but I just say you let things eat at you and then they build up and you tend to get upset and we in a parental role try to console her sometimes—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's not always open to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't seem as depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm okay, I mean I've been hanging out with my friends, so I'm letting go of the other stuff with my other friends right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean the boyfriend or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my best friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you seeing her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm better not talking to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How come?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she doesn't do anything to bring me up, she just brings me down and lies to me and treats me like crap basically, so I'm better not dealing with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're a little bit isolated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I've made new friends at school, so I've been going out with them and watching movies and stuff at one of their houses.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'd say she's been more socially active in the last two weeks than she has in the last six months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My entire life basically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's changed then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I've very socially awkward I think but I met my friend [NAME OTHER] in class and she's very outgoing and just kind of friendly to everybody and she invited me to go over for movie night a couple weeks ago and then I made a bunch of friends there so we've just kind of become a little group of friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your depressed mood seems to be contingent upon whether you have connections or not to people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just different from high school, like the problems of being isolated and not going out and just staying home.  It's not that I necessarily have to be with friends or anything like that but if I'm just sitting at home watching TV or sitting on my computer all day then I'm not going to be happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So connecting to friends, connecting to your mom again—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seems to help lift your mood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm still having trouble concentrating though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You think it's more the connections than the medicine that's improving your mood?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it has a lot to do with the medicines because it's not necessarily the depression it's helping with but my anger.  I think it's more because my anger than my depression because my depression really depends on what's going on in my life more because that's a trigger for whatever is going to happen and something that would normally trigger my anger isn't really triggering it like it would, so I know the medicine is helping with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see a change in that, that she's less angry and less reactive?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's been in a better mood the last couple weeks and just got over the wedding issues quicker than I think she might have in the past.  She was mad about everybody about that because she talked to me about it a month before and asked about staying for most of the reception and I probably said yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not probably.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I, you know, my problem is you can ask me something a week ahead of time, the day of, you've got to remind me what I said.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I asked you a week ahead of time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and nobody tells me anything.  I was totally unaware.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have bad communications, it's pretty apparent by this point.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which, you know, she says she's awkward and socially shy but she has very good social skills.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I can let myself go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the family or the friends?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With family, friends, she seems to make friends and talk to aquaintances easily, you know, people have always told us our kids, even with they were little, they were easy to talk to with adults, you know, they could converse with people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get along with adults a lot better than I get along with people my own age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your mom feels that she's kind of left out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, me and my dad, we always communicate to each other and then we think that the other person is going to talk to her and it never happens, it's just [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is she excluded from that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like we're trying to exclude you, it's that, I always think he's going to tell her because he sees her more sometimes and then if I see her more, he thinks I'm going to tell her but it's not like it's on my mind all the time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I do usually [INAUDIBLE] tell her things that you talk to me about so that it's not on me so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you afraid to talk to her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you afraid of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We didn't get along for the majority of my life and it's the past couple of years that things have gotten really good but I'm still afraid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What made it better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, we just, we're a lot alike and we're hard headed and I wasn't doing well for a long time, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So she wouldn't accept your point of view, is that what you feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't just think it was that, I think it was just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We just didn't have a relationship.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She just didn't, she was afraid of her point of view being rejected maybe and [NAME OTHER] didn't, so she, yeah, she doesn't like controversy at all, you know, so if her mom or me didn't agree with her, she usually would not discuss anything, you know, that she thought might get a negative reaction out of [NAME OTHER] or myself and so she'd hold it in and at a lot of times, you know, the anticipation was way worse than the actual—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, event, you know, she'd let the anticipation drive her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but that fear of disapproval kind of fosters a negative self image.  If you feel that your mom or your dad wouldn't accept you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have the greatest felt confidence or self imagine in myself so that probably is an issue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well if it's a fear that if I share this I'll be rejected—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I keep it in and then I still am always afraid that if they know my real feelings, they would reject me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I fear that with everyone though, it's not just my parents, any person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would reject you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, like I even have that with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In those moments where we try to tell her that she's got great social skills, she's pretty, smart, intelligent, you know, she should not fear that but then so you're telling her what to feel and she doesn't like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't tell me how to feel, no.  You don't tell me it'll be okay, you don't ask me if I'm okay, you don't tell me how to feel, it's just not, not respective.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You [INAUDIBLE] have to talk to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's easier not to talk?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Seriously.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you afraid that whatever you say she'll interpret in a negative way?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She always, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She tends to do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Anything I say, she just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That shuts down any communication.  But you see, the problem is that you're locked in your own head and this negative image keeps, you know, growing and growing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The only way to change it is to take a risk and say this is how I feel and see if I can understand it.  I mean you told me when we started, you said your mom, you and she communicated, you shared and that it was not as negative as you thought it would be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that made you feel better and made her feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's not a usual thing that you do, you don't take those risks and say this is what I think, this is what I feel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well for [DEIDENTIFIED] of my life, I really couldn't do that with my mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How come?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We never got along.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I don't see it that way.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I thought it was a lot of her perception of rejection—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Lent to that belief because, you know, usually when we talk about things, it was much better than she thought—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] You know me and mom had issues for a long time.  I don't know why but you know you've had issues with your mom and you were angry for a long time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right and every time I would try to talk to you, you would shut down or yell at me and I probably, for me, it's like okay, it's easier just to not say anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For a long time, you weren't that nice to me when I would talk to you about stuff that was going on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well and I guess I grew up and I feel like you just buck up and you do it and I probably—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's not what I need.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know that now and I guess maybe—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was the problem when I was growing up is that it was always, you just need to not let people get to you, you need to just let it go but I'm bipolar, I can't just turn a switch off and be happy again, that's why I want them here, I want them to understand that when I'm not happy it's not because I choose to be unhappy.  I want to be happy but I can't just flip the switch and be perfectly fine again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But from our end, I don't think you understand that we realize that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then why do you always tell me to just let it go.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What else, what other advice could I give other than to not let it bother you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just need you to be there.  Mom always asks me if I'm okay and I say it's a bad day.  She'll say well is there anything I can do and I'll just, I have to say no, there's nothing you can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you want her to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just want them to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Understand and not take it personally if I'm having a bad day and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you have to understand that you can't treat us the way you treat us sometimes.  Everybody has bad days and I know you have bad days but you can't use it as an excuse to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think she projects her negative feeling into you, she tries to make you feel the same way she's feeling if she feels bad?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think that if we're trying to talk to her and she starts screaming and storms off and slams doors and tells us to shut up or whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember half of it when I do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have trouble with that, being disrespected and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't mean to do it when I do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're saying you have no control over your behavior?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not when I snap, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has that changed over the years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's changed since I got on Lamictal.  I can control myself a lot better but before when something would trigger it, I would get mad and I would yell and I would throw things and I know I was a nasty person but I don't remember the majority of what I say when I say it, it's like I black out when I do it.  I really can't just turn it off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see her being different now on Lamictal that you don't see the anger?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think she's better, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not as afraid that she'll explode.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I guess that's always going to be there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because of—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But we have to kind of watch what we say and how we say it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like here with you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you're always on guard with each other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it that way with you mom when you were a kid?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I don't remember it being like that.  We weren't close.  I just did my own thing and she did her own thing.  I have five sisters, I guess I had them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the issues were different that you had with your mom?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I think so.  I didn't, I don't blame my mom or have issues like that with my mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't you for anything.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You blame me for everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do I blame you for?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I always get the impression you think everything is my fault.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's an interesting miscommunication then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's part of our problem is we don't communicate so we miscommunication and what we don't say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom is saying she feels everything is her fault.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know why you feel like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's parental love.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I mean there's got to be something about the communication that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm sure it's when I get angry, I'm sure I say stuff that makes her feel like that and I really don't remember what I say.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well why do you think you don't remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You just fly into these rages and sometimes you don't even know what you're saying, you just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It just comes out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm more of a shut down, you know, just go—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're not brawlers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No I think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But neither am I, I don't like fighting, that's the thing, you said it yourself, I don't like controversy but when I snap, I snap, like I was never as bad as I got in like the last two years.  I would never throw things and I would never get as bad as I got but I hate fighting, I hate controversy, it gives me a panic attack.  I hate hearing two other, like two people yell at each other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you know that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You thought she likes—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not that she liked it but it seems to be the way she reacts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I don't get is I hate it but it's how I react to people when I get mad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well I think it's back to things kind of build before that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really because, you know, like six months ago I'd snap like every day, there was no time for it to build.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you were with [NAME OTHER] every day and I think that was a big strain on you and you were letting that relationship that was kind of overwhelming affect everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't realize it's happening though until it's too late.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I can see it coming, just the way you treated him and talked to him, you talked down to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but see like I never even saw that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You never saw that you were talking down to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never saw that, like for a long time I didn't see how nasty I was being.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Her aunt and we would try to tell her she was being mean and she would reject it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never saw it, for some reason I didn't see it but then I'll look back on it and I see it full well that I was a complete—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do see it now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I see it now but I didn't see it then.  And like there were times, like after I got on Lamictal, if I would snap and if I would explode, I would walk back into my room and I would go what did I just do, I never did that before.  Before it was their fault, solely their fault and I had it and I would just not really remember what happened.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's that she was insulting or anything like that, it was more of just a very curt, very short attitude.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Crying, yelling, stomping off, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's not a malicious person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's not a malicious person at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But angry, anger is a defense of emotion.  Anger is not really a core emotion, so anger is defending other feelings.  What other feelings occur before the anger breaks through?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's mostly just my depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sadness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I just feel really alone being bipolar, I guess, and like I don't talk about it, I don't try to use it as an excuse because I don't think it is an excuse to behave the way that I've behaved.  I know that it's not an excuse, I just, I do feel lonely when I think about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you push people away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, like, well not necessarily, it's that I don't think anyone really realizes how it feels.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How does it feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really bad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Going through junior high and high school, [PATIENT NAME] was always concerned about not having friends and it was real and it was painful, you know, for us, you know, but then she would kind of reject girls who kind of reached out to her at times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like [NAME OTHER] and different people but you always had reasons.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never rejected [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When she would call five, six times a week and you would never return phone calls and stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's because I would be sad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But people can only reach out so many times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know but—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which I think has been great that she's gotten these new friends and I'm hoping they're good people and good influences and not bad influences because her mood is definitely better when she's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	More social.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, but it's not just with friends, I think it's with you or her mom, you know, I think the more connected she feels, the happier she is but yet she has these moods and these moods push people away and if you keep getting attacked, you're going to want to pull away, you're not going to want to be exposed to it.  Is that part of what happened with your relationship?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know how to fix it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, how do we fix it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I don't know how to control myself and that's what I'm scared of is that it's going to come back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, one of the ways maybe is to take time outs when you experience those feelings instead of projecting it to the other person.  I mean your mom is saying that she feels that she's the fault of everything and you don't say you feel that but something is happening in the way you communicate with her that makes her feel that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So rather than communication in states like that, could you go to your room and take a time out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I can catch it quick enough, then yeah but part of the thing is when she wants to talk, when we want to talk and communicate, if I'm getting mad and I say mom I can't do it right now, you'll go why and then that'll, then I'll go off.  It's like don't ask me why, I try to avoid it the best that I can when I say mom I can't do it right now, I just can't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then she'll say why, like three times and that's what'll set me off.  I'll say I can't do it, I can't do it, it's because I don't want to [INAUDIBLE].  I don't want to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you feel like you can't talk to me without yelling at me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's when I can feel myself getting angry, when I can feel myself getting bad, I'll say I can't do it right now because I need to calm down for whatever reason, that's just how I, it's because I'm getting defensive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, seriously, I mean not necessarily in a negative way but the idea if she goes to her room, maybe she can regroup and then express to you what she's feeling rather than attack you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just, like when I start, it's like always something that could be trivial with us and I guess it's why I get defensive and when I start saying I can't talk about it right now, it's because I'm going to get mad and I don't really know why and I don't want to get mad at you, I don't want to yell at you and I don't want to be mean to you, I want to calm down and I want to talk through it like normal people do but I don't know how sometimes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And what does normal mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well there are degrees of normal but I think the intensity with this much tension between, you know, the three of you or the two of you in particular, I think that's not healthy so I think it's a matter of relaxing that tension and I think the way it can happen is when she starts feeling, if she's aware of it, take that time out, you know, let her go to her room for ten minutes, fifteen minutes and let her kind of think or process what am I feeling, what's under the anger and then after that come and talk to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, like it hasn't been happening that much just because I've been happy and like we've both been happy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well and I've not been saying anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The fact that I've asked you how many times to take stuff upstairs and after two weeks it's still there, you know, normally I would—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's the road we tread.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She would have thrown it away by now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I was going to do that yesterday, just throw it away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So things like that are bothering you but you're just keeping it in, you're not, so you're going to get upset over time too, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Except she doesn't see that on our end.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes it's pretty frustrating when we do ask her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I know that, I just don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's like I laid it right there so it's so easy—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I made it so easy to like deal with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't see it when I go upstairs is the thing and I don't retain what you say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, that's a good point, what if instead of telling her, write it down and put it on the refrigerator, reminders, this, that and the other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The refrigerator I would never see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or wherever.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	On your forehead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be best.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean you're going to get angry over time if that happens but what I'm saying is if you write it down and, you know, give her—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A chores list?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A chores list with, you know, certain expectations of what kind of time frame.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I tell her, you need to do this, it's like I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but she's saying tell her doesn't work, she doesn't really absorb it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do know but the thing in the past, the past month I know I've been really bad because I'm not retaining things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you taking, just the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Meridia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meridia for the weight, yeah, and Lamictal, how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	250.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See the problem with the Meridia; it kind of limits what else I can give you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But in terms of that memory issue, I don't know what could we do with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's part of my problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean there are drugs I can use for that but we've tried those and we didn't get success with them, right, Ritalin and Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, we haven't tried any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We never tried any of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean we could, how anxious are you though, because sometimes those drugs can make you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My anxiety is pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably the safest one of that, pardon?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We don't want to reverse that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we don't want, right, exactly, we don't want to interrupt that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What could I, what about Strattera, did we ever try, no.  Strattera is probably the least risky one of the drugs.  I could give you low doses and see if it does help you focus a little bit in combination.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you're stable, you know, with these moods and the time out, it will help, I mean it can't hurt.  You know, if she feels chemically she's in a better place now to handle it, maybe encourage her and then do things like lists so you don't start getting upset and write it down and give her a week to do it or five days or whatever or do a behavior problem, do a behavior points system, I don't know, do you have something like that, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We don't have anything, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, well first try it and see what kind of response we get by the writing down but if that doesn't work maybe we can implement some behavior program, you know, that if she doesn't do it in five days, she loses or I don't know what she would lose, I don't know, computer privilege or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I own my laptop.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's not much you can do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's true, that's true too, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Having to throw it away works too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, don't do that.  No, why don't we try—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] picking up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Without consequences, just see if she responds by writing it down instead of telling her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I've just been really bad in the past like month or two, I know that I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let's try it and I'll try a low dose of Strattera, I'll give you maybe 18 mg per week and then 25 mg or so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I have no Lamictal left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll write you a prescription.  And how about the Meridia?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I still have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right and do you want to do this again with your parents or do you want to just meet alone again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't care.  I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's up to you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's up to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that all right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's all right.</p>

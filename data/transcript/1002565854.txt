<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So yeah they [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's very impressive, like the menu's very good.  You feel like you're in a restaurant ordering off the menu.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think [INAUDIBLE] has the same thing too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, do they?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They call it interim dining.  You don't get like this little slip of a few choices, but the problem is is that when people are on special diets—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Diets.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That they'll call and they'll order all these things, then the dietician who's taking [INAUDIBLE] well, that has too much salt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right, because my friend, [NAME OTHER] was saying too, she said, well, do they, is he ordering the right thing?  He's not on any sort of restricted diet.  And what he is he knows like he can't have certain like shellfish or something, he has gout, but he, you know, he knows all that.  And other than that, there's no special restrictions, so the nurse said, "No, if he calls, they'll tell him he can't have it, you know, they'll know that he can't have that."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because people on a regular diet, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he'd had surgery.  I don't know how good the food was, but he'd had surgery, I guess he hadn't eaten all day, so like he ate that and I said, "Wow, it's a pretty menu, the whole thing."  So we got, I got to learn this system here in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The hospital went from, they used to have a lot more double rooms, now they're all basically single rooms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, single rooms, yeah, single rooms.  So he's doing, um, I think he's doing okay.  He had an abscess in his kidney from a kidney stone so he's running a 104 fever, so they put some kind of a stent or a shunt or whatever to clear the abscess.  So I guess he was feeling pretty bad the day before.  By the time I saw him when they brought him up after the surgery he was looking pretty chipper already.  That's how we spent the day.  So other than that we, we got my Weight Watchers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I reached my, I guess probably maybe just since I was here last I got to goal weight and then I got to waistline so I'm wearing my, and from here I go to my Weight Watchers meeting, so I'm wearing my lifetime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Friday's the day for all meetings through the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got my lifestyle [INAUDIBLE] and I got my little gold book, so it was a great accomplishment because for a long time I kept blaming, I was asking the [INAUDIBLE] are making me not be able to lose weight.  So I think it was me making me not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think for the most part, and Weight Watchers is a good program too, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I reached lifetime back in 2001, but and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I'll applaud for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But over eight years and I've gained some of it back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but at least you have your lifetime [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then you cut it off like you don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and you don't like them, but I think for all this time and it's not, well, now I think it's a nice amount of weight.  It wasn't that much that I ever had to lose, so I think that because I didn't have to lose a tremendous amount I fooled around too much and I think I also walked around with it in my head like, well, it's menopause and it's the Paxil and so my body is now resistant to losing weight.  So I stuck in my mind, well, it's not going to work anyway, because my body has changed and I take the medication I'm not going to lose weight.  So something had happened back in December, um, my friend [NAME OTHER] who's my Weight Watchers leader they had all new literature in December.  It was like a new, oh, we have company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  [NAME OTHER] had just said, well, [INAUDIBLE] wasn't talking to me but to the whole group like what if we just thought about starting new, so I thought, okay, I can start new because I was frustrated with what I'd been fooling around with.  So okay what if we were just starting new and just starting from scratch.  So I got really serious, I said, you know what, I'm really going to give it a shot and see, and it just so happens I had come in that day and seen a number at home that I had never, other than when I was pregnant and very heavy, I had never seen in the past 25 years and I got on the scale at Weight Watchers and it was kind of a round number that was, you know, something I really didn't like.  [INAUDIBLE] I really have to do something.  Now that was back in December and I was, then I finally got 2 pounds away from goal before the last cruise and then I went on the cruise and gained 3.5 pounds.  So now I was 5.5 pounds.  But I got serious and then in the meantime and my son came home and said he was getting engaged and getting married this summer, I thought, good, I got a head start because I started in December, I said, now, you know, I have to look for a dress and I'm highly motivated.  So and that's [INAUDIBLE].  But now I'm kind of got stuck at a point, but I lost about 15, or 16 pounds which is a lot for me because, and not back to, certainly even now I am, I'm about 20 pounds more than the first time I came to see you, but I was very, very thin.  I was like close to 90.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The thing you have to watch out for is just to make sure that now that you've reached goal that you are [INAUDIBLE] back in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and that you are, um, increasing, you know, so you aren't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like that when you're in the weight loss phase it's a certain approach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'd still like to lose, I reached my goal weight at Weight Watchers, which it was, you know, the high goal, she gave for me the highest goal she could so I could get to it.  So that was my highest goal.  I still for myself, um, and for my clothes, you know, 5 or 8 more maybe.  You know, if I can, I'm not sure it's going to come off now, but I could exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good that you want on a cruise and enjoyed yourself I assume.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  And we're going to, now I'm doing, I'm really focused on this.  And I, my mindset is there, I did very well, things that we do that I do badly with before, I put out of my mind.  So I can go eat at [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't know if there's a [DEIDENTIFIED], but they have yummy hot crusted bread with olive oil pesto sauce, which is a, that's like a difficult thing for me, so we can eat there now, I eat no bread.  I just eat no bread.  And we went to a buffet, a barbecue buffet on Memorial Day and I had a big salad and I had a piece of chicken and a piece of turkey and I didn't have the rolls that I like there, and they had dessert tables out, they have an ice cream sundae bar out, and I didn't touch it.  So I'm good with that now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But we're going on a cruise in July so I'll see what happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when's the wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The end of August.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	August, okay.  Well, yeah, I mean, if you went on the last cruise and gained three pounds and enjoyed yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and it was a little longer, this one, that was 11 days, this is 9, but they have really good cookies on this cruise, I know.  They're really, really good big cookies on this cruise, but because of the wedding too I really feel now I, like there's a certain accomplishment.  I said I'm going to wear my key, my lifetime key, see, I don't know what men do, actually my friend, [NAME OTHER] said most people don't wear it as jewelry.  But now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think I got a key ring.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh a key ring.  See—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] keys on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I said, what do men do with the charms, I don't know.  But I, so I'm still wearing it.  I think, I'm still very proud of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So as long as it's working and I'm staying in the mindset I really want to stay with it because I do, I feel better about, you know, I haven't gone yet to see if I'm physically better, because I always had great cholesterol and all this other stuff, and as I got heavier, not that I was tremendously overweight, but my cholesterol was higher, there was a question, the doctor said the next time I come back we'll see how it looks, that medication, and I really didn't want to start that if I didn't have to.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Another motivating factor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, you're good at when you get a goal in your mind that I think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I'm still, like maybe it's still this obsessive thinking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, but, you know, you, when you have obsessive thinking it can be a positive, it can channel it in a direction that leads to goals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and accomplishments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's like discipline or obsession, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think more, I always kind of joke that in medical school you have to kind of have an obsessive personality in a sense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To be able to study and memorize and get through the classes and da, da, da, da.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a lot of memorization so it's a lot of discipline and you have to know the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have to be a little bit obsessive [INAUDIBLE] unless you have like have a photographic memory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  But, you know, so it can be a quality that can channel into successes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, you know, the problem is is that if you get certain obsessive ideas in your mind that aren't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like, yeah, like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Constructive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like the room at home, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah, oh, I know there's a difference between going for a goal that's, you know, a worthwhile goal or doing something, right, about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it tells me that if you work on, like [INAUDIBLE], if you got it in your mind that this is what you need to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just like with Weight Watchers, you'll develop a style to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To apply that in a, yeah, a constructive sort of a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Because I really feel this is, um, yeah, I do, I feel it's an accomplishment because I messed around with it for so long and didn't do it, and now within the few months, and you know, to lose 15, well, my goal weight was only 10 pounds, my Weight Watcher goal weight, not my personal goal weight, so now I'm about to 15 pounds, so I have even a little cushion, you know, I know I can get weighted.  But I don't even want to mess up.  It's like the things that I thought were so tempting to me before, you know, like this buffet that we go to, um, it just, it just didn't exist.  I don't care, I walked past the cakes and the pies and the cookies and I don't care because I'm more, I'm more pleased with this outcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus the other thing too is if it's a place you've been, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's coming again, you know what, next week it'll get, this Sunday night it's going to be there again.  And last summer it was a downfall for me.  And almost you have a feeling of empowerment like I feel good.  I can go, and it's a very pleasant place, you sit outside on a porch, and have dinner, and I love to go to, Sunday I've already, we've already looked at the weather this morning, is it going to be a nice day Sunday because the experience is so pleasant to sit in this really pretty place.  It overlooks a golf course and it's a covered porch and it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, it's a whole lovely setting and then last year, last summer we were going and then I feel bad because at the end, I would get, well, I'll just get the little ice cream and I'll just get a little of this and then, well, the cookie goes with it, and the funny thing is that Sunday I had a really good feeling, last, it was Monday, it was Memorial Day this week, but I can come here and I can enjoy this lovely setting and beautiful scenery.  And I got a great big salad and a nice piece of chicken and then I without having any of the desserts and we left and I thought, well, I can come enjoy this, and I don't have to deprive myself while sitting out on this beautiful day and I don't have to mess it up with the food.  So maybe now I'm in the right Weight Watchers mindset.  Years ago somebody said to me, people who succeed on Weight Watchers are obsessive compulsive thinkers.  So I thought, well, I guess that's why I was doing.  I was down to 92 pounds.  I was doing really well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you do the points or did you do the?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, when I got serious in December, I decided I was going to count my points but eat more foods, but still count them.  So I cut out all the junk but I was still—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	My impression is that points work really well for obsessive compulsive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I had—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] it's funny, because what I do now when I decided to be serious I have my little books and my little journals and I write everything.  And again, you know, it's obsessive compulsive, if you eat out and you're not sure, then I add like a couple extra, I'm going to throw a couple extra in there because I'm not sure when I ate out, so I'm throwing a couple extra in.  But when I really got serious I ate core foods and counted the points on the core foods.  So what I've done is I've cut out a lot of things.  I don't know, but it's, it's working and the last few weeks it's really just staying the same.  And the truth is if I stayed at this weight I could be very happy at this weight even though it wasn't where I was before and, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  We're never where we were before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Well especially like after 50 I won't be where I was when I was 35, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Hopefully [INAUDIBLE] better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, but I kept like saying I couldn't do it because of the Paxil, so now you're off the hook because, you're off the, yeah, I know.  You'll sleep better tonight.  I can't blame that for this problems with my weight.  So that was my, on the other hand, what's not going so great is I more than my husband, but we're having something very unpleasant with our daughter.  And it's never been like this before.  And it all started out with my son's engagement.  And I don't know if it's her problem, it's her problem or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We talked the last visit about the ring.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, was it already started?  Okay, so the ring, now she's not even talking and I'm sure she's still harboring that, because she's an obsessive compulsive thing for her, and I'm sure she's going to harbor that the rest of her life and at one point it came, she was home and it came to a discussion, I said, look, if maybe I shouldn't have done it, and if, and maybe I said maybe it was a mistake.  I should have talked to you first, and I'll even admit that I made a mistake, but I kind of said to her, but it's done.  So, you know, I have another ring that was my mother's, I thought she'd prefer, that that can be hers and I'll give it to her and, you know, that other ring, it's done, I can't take it back now.  And if I made a mistake or she feels that I made a mistake that I'm sorry that I made a mistake, but it's done and we have to move on and get over it because after all it's a ring.  I mean, I don't think anyone else could have been more attached than I was and that had more meaning than it did to me, but I don't really know, I think that's part of it.  She sincerely thought it was meaningful to her.  But I think in a way and everyone who knows my daughter, and she's very bright and she's very successful and she has lots of good, good attributes, but a lot is all, everything's about her.  She's very, still self centered and about her, and it was just something that was taken away from her or something that she wasn't, it wasn't discussed with her.  I didn't run it by her first.  So this was before passover came and she wasn't really talking to me.  I left her messages on the phone and she didn't call back.  And but she came over passover because frankly I knew she would, she had nowhere else to go and it was a holiday, where else is she going to be, so I was kind of concerned I was like how unpleasant was she going to make this.  And even friends of mine who came for passover figured she's going to come home and be very miserable.  And I was very pleasantly surprised that she came home and it was a three day weekend for her, and, you know, she and I, we went shopping like we normally do and we had our holiday dinners, and, you know, things went very smoothly.  And I was very pleased and I thought maybe the problem had passed and we just got by it and I was pleasantly surprised.  And then she just, I can't remember if it was the last, yeah, three days went by really well, and then right before she was getting ready to leave, I said, gee, it worked, everything seems okay.  You know, we can never tell with her.  And you never know which one of her you're going to get, the good one or the evil one, and it was fine.  Then right before she was getting ready to leave I thought the whole weekend had gone really well, she came into my room to shower, to, we were taking her to Trenton, and she like blows up in this tirade, um, part of it is to do with not just the ring but the dress.  I don't know if I told you this.  She's asked to be a bridesmaid in the wedding, why would she be a bridesmaid, why would she want to be a bridesmaid?  She's not going to wear a dress like everybody else wears.  She should be something special.  She's, why should she do that with all the little bridesmaids who are in their 20s and she's sister and why should she be a bridesmaid?  I think a lot of grooms' sisters are bridesmaids.  And they just assume, that's a fine thing to be.  It's not that she was left out.  Well, she doesn't want to be told what dress to wear and she doesn't want a dress like everyone else.  And what, well, what does she want to be?  And I think my son had gotten this impression, and he'll usually yield because I guess a lot of times he yield to, a lot of times it could be me, I'm sure they've done it for me, the most difficult person in the family.  And the rest of the family kind of plays along or gives in.  And my son is usually very easygoing and is the peacemaker and, you know, he'll, he's the younger brother but he's the one who, he says too he fixes her.  He said I fixed her, don't break her.  I fixed her.  You know, and we have to fix her and then we're very careful we don't want to break her again.  So he got the idea from her, he knew this whole engagement thing was going to be a problem for her because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was marrying first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and it's not that she could be married, she's had her chances, it's not that she's so anxious to be married and it's going to be hard for her because her younger brother, it's not that, but it's like he's getting the attention or worse than that maybe it's almost like a childhood sibling rivalry because actually what she blurted out at me, it was this whole dress thing going on, and I said just wear the dress.  I said you're asked to be a bridesmaid, that's what grooms' sisters usually are.  In other words, it's not important enough for her.  She wants to be the best man.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The bride is the center of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's, and I think my daughter's not good with that.  So I'm telling her, in her case maybe what I'm telling her is yield to this, like she should be the one, be the bridesmaid, this is a very appropriate thing to be.  And I want her to be part of the wedding.  My son knew this was going to be a problem.  He said she's going to have a problem with this.  I mean, maybe she's like relegated—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how was she invited?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my son did do, he went and talked to her and told her because he knew this was going to be an issue for her because this is, we know her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think he might have told her first or were they together?  He told me, he said, [NAME OTHER] is going to ask [NAME OTHER] to be a bridesmaid.  And my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my son said, I know this is going to be a problem for her.  [INAUDIBLE].  Well, levels and that my daughter is very much like a tailored business suit kind of certain serious, she's not a frilly bridesmaid kind of girl.  And they're not, I knew that the, that might future daughter in law is not going to get some ridiculous silly poofy, I mean, this is not my daughter's style.  I know, my daughter's going to wear strapless little black dress  and that's my daughter's style.  Well, now it's pink and now it's a bridesmaid dress but it is a very tailored, but it was more than that, it's like, it's not important enough for her.  And she doesn't want to stand in a row with [NAME OTHER] girlfriends and little cousins in their 20s, and I'm older and I'm the sister and that's insulting.  Well, she wants to be, and she, my son said I wasn't ever going to go there.  He said I knew what she was telling him in a private discussion with my son and my daughter.  And I knew because she told me too, she wants to be the best man.  And in a lot of, I mean, the best like, so best person, best whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wants to be on his side of the stage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yes.  And she wants to pick her own dress to wear and be set aside in a special situation.  And she doesn't want to stand in a row with bridesmaids.  She wants to stand like where my husband and I and my son.  She wants to stand thee.  So we tried to go through all these scenarios.  My son said, "Well, wear the dress, but you'll stand, you know," he'll talk to [NAME OTHER], wear the bridesmaid dress and stand there.  Then this conversation happened with all of us at home over the holiday, over passover.  I said, "Well, suppose you wear your own dress?"  I don't want to wear that dress.  I'm not wearing a dress that somebody else picks for me to wear and stand in a line.  I said, "Well, suppose you just do that for the ceremony and then discuss with [NAME OTHER] and then you'll put on your own dress to wear to the party, so everyone will just know you're a team player and you wore it for that."  Well, then [NAME OTHER] thought, well, now he thinks maybe [NAME OTHER] going to be insulted or upset by that idea, that, you know, it'll look like his sister didn't like that dress enough so she took it off the second she could and put on something else.  But, you know, she's just being difficult.  I said, "Okay, well, let's see if [NAME OTHER] will say okay to wearing two dresses."  Meanwhile I guess she keeps thinking my son will give in because usually he'll yield to make peace in the family and say, "Okay, be my best man."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But now there's another person involved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wasn't a big—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not just, that's right, now we have somebody else.  So now my daughter's saying, "I'm taking her side against my daughter."  I said, "I'm just trying to do what I think is right."  I said, "Just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And now so now it became now it's the ring and now it's the dress, but we're not really sure it's any of those things.  It's just that, because what she came after me after a nice weekend of everything good and nice, everything, we went shopping, it was like, we're always like walk on eggshells around her, like not, my son said don't break her, don't break her.  Or then he'll say he talked to her in New York and he thinks she's like okay with the dress, don't break her.  I mean, I didn't even bring up, we don't want to break her.  And then I tried, when she did bring it up, you know, to say, well, maybe you can change your dress.  I don't know how to deal with this without making, I'm trying to save face for her.  I don't want her to start off on the wrong foot with her new sister in law.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like you've already had some positive interactions, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They do.  They went out to dinner, then a couple weeks ago I had my, um, we go a couple times a year on a fare trip to New York and my daughter meets us for lunch.  We go to restaurant row before the theater.  I called her, she already wasn't talking, well, what happened is it just all blew up that night.  I thought the whole weekend had gone well, and then she came in and said something about, um, you know, well, I should be on her side, I'm her daughter, and apparently, you know, or she's my daughter, and apparently she's not my daughter anymore, I'm choosing [NAME OTHER] over her.  Well, I have a new daughter and sometimes I felt like when she was a baby and I brought a new, when she was four and I brought my son home from the hospital, you know, she had a fit then too.  So, you know, I'm bringing, but now I have a new daughter.  And everything is great and everything's wonderful about [NAME OTHER], and [NAME OTHER] so wonderful, she goes, well fine, then you just have [NAME OTHER] and you don't need me for a daughter.  And then she goes and then I won't even tell you when I get married.  I just want her to get married.  She doesn't even have to tell me, I just want her to get married.  We like, there's a boy we really like, just get married.  Fine, fine.  And she goes and then you'll see, I'll get married, she goes, I won't even tell you when I get married now because she goes you can just be happy with [NAME OTHER], you have a new, and I thought where is this coming from?  The whole weekend, I mean, she's like harboring this, so whether it's the ring and whether it's the dress and whether she's not the center of attention and whether she has insecurities for whatever reasons, so a week or so later we had our New York trip where she always joins us for lunch, she hadn't spoken to me, she's not talking to me, and oh, and she came down for her shower and then my husband was down there and I was talking to my husband downstairs and then she yelled at him, don't talk to her, if you talk to her then you can't talk to me, like in other words, my husband has to choose between me and my daughter.  And my husband just kind of sat there like what the heck happened, what is going on?  I mean, the weekend went okay.  And then she went ballistic.  She went, she just flew off the deep end.  And I made dinner that night before we were taking her to Trenton and I set a place for her at dinner so is she hurting me?  She wouldn't come to the table, so I wrapped up the food and I put it away.  Then got, she was leaving, we got in the car to take her back to the train, she gets out of the car and she purposely says bye dad like she says goodbye and then, so after she got out of the car I said to my husband at least she's still talking to you, she didn't even say goodbye to me.  So he said, yeah, but did you notice, he said I didn't say goodbye to her.  He said how dare she, like she came and screamed at him and yelled at him and, you know, so he said I didn't, he said, I didn't answer her at all because he said I, he said I wasn't sure what I would say.  He said I couldn't believe she was talking to me that way and acting like this.  He said, I jus sat there and he said and said nothing, he said, because I was afraid if I said something it would be so horrible that I would never be able to take it back.  And he said I can't believe she made it that way, but I called her the next weekend and I said I'm coming to New York and if you'd like to join us for our lunch, you know, in New York, let me know.  No response, never called me back.  Wednesday morning we're leaving the theater, I called from home, and I said we're coming into New York and we're, we'll be having lunch around noon, I left a message for her, I left one at home on her home phone.  I left this early in the morning on her work phone so I knew when she came to work, I said, you know, [NAME OTHER] and I are coming in and we're, the girls we're all having lunch, do you want to come meet us for lunch, let us know.  Never heard from her.  I have not spoken to her in four weeks.  My husband has made little like he's making little excuses just to keep contact.  I really don't know what to do.  Should I cave in?  Do I cave and, I mean, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If she's there in the city with your son?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm assuming that they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're together.  My husband called him the other night he's watching the Flyers game a couple of weeks ago, and maybe he called my daughter, he was looking for little excuses like to call, just because we like want to leave the door open.  I mean, this is my child.  She's welcome anytime she says she wants to come home, the door is open.  I'm not shutting it.  She's shutting me out.  And I, and so my husband keeps trying.  We called her.  I told my husband, I said she won't answer me.  Last Friday I said call her because I know under normal circumstances she would have wanted to come home.  It was a beautiful weekend.  It was Memorial Day weekend and my son was home.  And his fiance wasn't there so she likes to come home and have time with him and they play tennis together and they play board games together and she and I go shopping, you know, you get the holiday weekend coupons from Bloomingdales.  And I knew she would, that's normally a time she would want to come home.  We didn't hear from her, so Friday night, look, I don't want to, I didn't throw her out of my life.  So I said to my husband she might respond to you, call her and say we hope she has nice plans for the weekend and he even says were you planning to come home like if she's planning to come home.  So her answer a couple days before [NAME OTHER] brought [NAME OTHER] home like Thursday and Friday she was at our house.  So my daughter calls my husband at work, well, she's not talking to me, and she says I don't want any strangers in my room.  So I wouldn't have though to say that to her, I would have had a some kind of a discussion with her about, you know, what does it matter, the sheets get washed, she's not going to touch anything, [NAME OTHER] been in there many times, now she calls my husband, I don't want anybody in my room.  So my husband's reaction because he's really annoyed, he's very upset with her, he said, it's my house.  He said are you coming home this weekend?  He said if you're coming home it's your room.  You get your, if you're coming home it's your room.  But he said it's my house.  So of course I made the sheets and all this and that and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Her room is in New York.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Her home is in New York.  But so this is what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, it seems to me that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is what our problem is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, although it's sounds like something that she needs to work out with [NAME OTHER] and herself.  That I think you and your husband are doing what you're doing and keeping the invitation open that really is something that they need to work out.  And your son's very good at [INAUDIBLE] working at issues with her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's with her.  The two of them in New York are fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I mean, I think in the end whatever [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] decide, you know, with your daughter it's going to be the way that they need to work that out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and that I'm sure that you and your husband will be happy with however they work it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, but it sounds like at this point it needs to be something that they do as an adult, as adults.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My concern is I want as badly as she's treating us, distantly as she's treating us I don't want her to mess things up for herself.  I'm concerned about her.  She is like, this is going to, I mean, she and my son have a very close relationship.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if she thinks like she's telling my husband, you know, if you talk to mom, you don't talk to me, well, she can't come between my husband and me, and she can't come, and if she thinks she can make a statement like that to my son, she's really going to be left out because this is going to be his wife and she's not going to be able to get in on that.  But they're including her.  They've never—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think and he is very good at being sensitive with her and [INAUDIBLE] so if she does end up feeling that way, that hopefully she'll realize that there's something going on inside of her and start working on it.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, a part of it is she never thinks it's her.  We all joke like she's perfect.  It's never her.  And she has no tolerance.  It's not just now with me or with my husband.  It's she's had friends in college and as soon as somebody does something to hurt her feelings or that she interprets as some sort of affront, they're out of her life.  There's no second chances with her.  You know, she is like this all or nothing, you know, as soon as somebody, there are people, she just dismissed people from her life, they're gone.  Like whatever happened, you know, what about [NAME OTHER], what about [NAME OTHER], what about [NAME OTHER], they're gone, you know, they're gone, they're out.  And I just don't want her for her own sake in life to not have her brother and a sister in law who's very nice and that particular night that she's so mad at me that she didn't come, and I knew she was missing that, she looks forward, she likes to come to that lunch, and, you know, it's a whole group, and she comes every time.  And actually in the fall before this all started with the engagement she actually couldn't come and we went in the fall to our show she couldn't, she had a business meeting that day and she was like, aww, she's going to miss the lunch.  She felt bad.  I said, look if you can't, you can't.  There'll be the next time.  Well, but now she chose not to.  And that night my son told me that Wednesday night that we were there, he goes, oh, she went out with [NAME OTHER], she and [NAME OTHER] went to dinner that night.  But I think she's smart enough it behooves her to be, she can be mean to me and I'm still going to say come home and that door's still open and I'll still reach out to her, maybe she knows if she does something miserable to her brother or his fiance it'll be hard for her to push her brother away because he's just too good and he cares about her.  And I think he does it because he cares about us.  And I said in a way I cannot ask him to cave on this best man thing.  I can't ask him to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, I think it may be something that he may not feel [INAUDIBLE] no matter how they compromise, hopefully it'll be compromised.  And they'll be able to work out the three of them, not just the two of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right now I'll be happy as long as things stay good with the three of them because she can always come back to me, she's my kid and I'm always going to take her back.  I didn't get rid of her, she got rid of me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And I think, you know, if you keep inviting her the next time you go for a theater weekend invite her again, keep doing it, even if she doesn't want, just keep inviting her throughout this whole time period.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My husband—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully she'll—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because we're trying to leave it open.  I mean, I realize she's upset or whatever is upsetting her, whether it's the ring and whether it's the, because my son said too, he said, it's not the ring, it's not the, like she's making it all about the dress, but my son is sensitive or intuitive enough to know too, you know, he said to me it's no the dress, it's not the ring, for some reason she's threatened by this whole thing and this, she's like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] not just he's getting married first, but he's getting married period and that he's found somebody he's able to, because, you know, in life even in a relationship or a marriage you're going to have ups and downs or she can't just dismiss a significant other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But here's her, you know, her brother getting married and working on developing one where she, her style might be to push people away when she's frustrated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's confronting, making her confront at some level that part of herself, you know, if she has the desire to be married or that that's something she's going to have to learn how to, um, keep in perspective.  So hopefully in the end it's a learning experience for her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She very much pushes people away.  But just what I, it's for her sake, in other words, if she, I want to save face for her in terms of at the wedding, I don't want everyone to think, and maybe I shouldn't care what everyone else thinks, but like why isn't his sister like, why isn't his sister in the wedding party, as if, you know, maybe it looks bad on her brother, that she wasn't, how come [NAME OTHER] not in the wedding party?  How come she's the groom's sister and she's not part of it?  I'll feel bad if she's not part of it.  Why on this day shouldn't my daughter be part of it?  I just think it, you know, I feel bad for her that it's a bad reflection and even if it was [NAME OTHER] family, they're very nice.  Her family's very nice.  And I think like they must be thinking oh look at this difficult, you know, sister in law.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some other type of thing where she's not in the bridal party but is able to offer a prayer or a something within the service.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said too can she walk down, like maybe she should just walk down the aisle with my brothers and sit down that way she'd wear her own dress.  I mean, I'm trying to come up with—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I mean the day should be [INAUDIBLE].  I think your son is going to help her save face.  You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So for you not to be the one because right now, I think the more you try to do, the more she's going to be reacting negatively.  You know what I mean?  So it's, you have a lot of good ideas, but I think you just have to have faith that they will work it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because they're bright.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and the three of them are okay together.  It's just when it comes to, you know, discussing the wedding stuff.  And I know it's just, I think what she, she's threatened in that it's not that they're getting married and she wants to be, because she's got someone who would marry her if she wanted to be married.  Um, but and we like him.  He's wonderful.  But and she's highly critical so she finds a lot of fault, you know, if you're going to criticize someone for the way they eat their popcorn and that he's too tall I can't help that he's too tall for her or the way he eats his popcorn and she doesn't like some of the television shows he watches.  I mean, she's a very, she's a very critical person and very judgmental.  And we manage to most things deal with it or smooth it over.  But this is like she's just not the center of attention here and it's not about her decisions.  We've all, you know, it's not all about her.  So what we should just do is keep believing these invitations out there.  My husband called her Friday and now he said he called her again, he figured we'll wait maybe the weekend he'll hear from her.  He didn't, so he calls her again Monday or Tuesday like how was your weekend, and he told her about his golf game and he was in a tournament, and this and that.  So now he's like counting the days, well, now it's five days I haven't heard from her, now it's this.  So in other words, we're just going to keep doing what we're doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would do that.  I mean, you're going to, you're definitely going to see her in August.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but there are things coming up even before.  Now I know, and everything she gets upset, I think [NAME OTHER] mother who's a very friendly person, my daughter was in the company of [NAME OTHER] mother, so her mother said, "Oh, I talked to your mom," of course she doesn't know it's the wrong thing to say, her mom, she goes, "Oh, I talk to your mom all the time and, you know, we're getting to know each other and all this and that," and my daughter's like, "Well, why do you have to talk to her?  Why do you have to," like she resents the fact that [NAME OTHER] mother is saying that she and I, that the two mothers are becoming friendly.  And then we were supposed to meet her parents one day in New York.  So now I don't know what to tell my daughter or not anymore.  So I'm like, I'm afraid to tell her we're meeting [NAME OTHER] parents in New York because then she gets upset, but then if we don't tell her, then she says you lied to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's going to be, [INAUDIBLE] she's going to be upset regardless.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  So just tell her the truth about everything and leave the door open.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and keep the door open and you know is right because you're not going to not talk to your new in laws.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're not going to try to make it good for your son in the sense you're not going to be, you're not going to not enjoy the wedding.  You're not going to do the things that [INAUDIBLE] right to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just because, I think no matter what you do it's a lose/lose in her mind right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So whatever she's going through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you keep the door open, you know, you do what you know is right for your son.  Keeping the door open which is right for your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And let them work out the details of what the wedding is going to look like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and however they decide, trust that your son is going to have some influence and that be proud however they handle it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.  I mean, because the three of them are getting along.  My husband and I are, but I think she's smart enough to know that she can treat us, my husband and I, this way, and we're still going to leave the door open and she can still walk back any time.  She might be smart enough to know that she shouldn't push away the new sister in law because that can come back to bite her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's going to be things that come up that you, like your husband not saying goodbye to her when he was upset and angry with the way she was treating you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there's going to be certain decisions that you're going to make that are still leaving the door open but are being true to your frustration with her too.  I mean, you're not going to necessarily just kowtow to her being rude.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's the point, at what point do we like just give in to her just for peace and give up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that we don't like her right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  A lot of times.  A lot of times.  I didn't want to push her out of my life.  She volunteered it.  She told me I have a new daughter and she goes, "Well, you don't need me anymore."  She goes, "You have a new daughter now.  And [NAME OTHER] so perfect you think [NAME OTHER]," you know, I'm going out as the mother in law, you know, as the son's mother, I'm really trying, you know, the old thing, you know, like I'm the mother in law, so I'm trying to be nice to this girl and whatever.  This week my son was home with her and they included me.  It's nice.  Said, mom, come with us, we're going to go, um, do the registering.  So they did some of it in New York and they were going here to do their registry.  So they included me to go with.  Well, you know, my daughter wouldn't like that.  And now I'm planning a bridal shower here.  She's going to freak out.  Why am I making her a bridal shower and why am I doing these?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're the future mother in law.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, which doesn't, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She has to kind of understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't even explain to her in a million years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mother and future mother in laws do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As much as I could love [NAME OTHER], she's still my daughter.  She's always going to be my daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  You can't change that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.  I didn't dismiss her.  She's dismissing us.  Oh, and then Mother's Day, I said I wonder what's going to happen.  I mean, let her just send me a generic card and just don't even sign love, just like this, so then nothing on Mother's Day, not a call, not a card, my daughter in law sent me a mother's day card that, and she wrote on it dear mom.  She sent me a Mother's Day card that she handwrote dear mom.  My daughter nothing.  So my husband was upset and he said to her afterwards, he goes, "You know, it was Mother's Day."  He said, "You could have sent your mother a Mother's Day card."  So she said, "We have nothing to say to each other."  That's what she told him.  So I mean I can't say I'm not upset, I'm upset.  I'm not crying every day, I mean, I'm living my life every day because I'm hoping either she'll come to her senses or, you know, the door is open.  I didn't send her out.  She dismissed, she took herself out of the picture.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Next visit, [DATE], would be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sounds great, okay.  Our cruise is in the beginning, oh, it'll be after the cruise.  The cruise is we're going away around the Fourth of July.  Canada and New England, so hopefully it won't be too unbearably hot in July.  All right.  We're going to keep on keeping on what we're doing, but she's, she's difficult.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you okay with the prescriptions too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, I think so.  My husband [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, enjoy the beginning of summer.  Enjoy the cruise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And good luck with all the planning and.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You too, you too.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, definitely.  Bye—bye now.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, now you cancelled for Friday. Let me just do that before I (pause) forget. So that would be no meeting on Friday the 13th. (pause) [00:00:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Let me just double check. (sighs, clicks tongue) (pause) 13th. Yeah, it is the 13th that I need cancelled. (pause) I'm not - feeling okay today. And also I think that I'm getting sick. [00:00:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just started feeling sick at four, which was very... (pause) So last night I went to see a friend of mine, Sydney Cudner, do a reading from a new book she wrote about sexuality. The book (pause) talked about how the idea, or the word "heterosexuals" was coined in the 1860s and there wasn't really a word for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's also no word for "homosexual" until around that time though, right? [00:00:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it was coined in response to anti-gay foundry laws and this whole thing. It's an amazing book, and she's going through the history of the concept of heterosexuality to have people apply different concepts of the idea of sexuality, and whether you'd be relevant if you preferred men but also married a woman and then had babies, and all these other things. It was really awesome.</p>

<p>And then somewhat in the end near questions, this person raises their hand and the question he wanted to ask is, "You had given..." Her whole book basically is destabilizing the idea that heterosexuality is normal, and she's like, "You can't... There's not a heterosexual gene, people haven't studied what a heterosexual brain looks like," this whole thing. It's really interesting. So this guy is like, "Well, if this is all true, then what's to keep me - what's the difference from me then marrying my dog?" [00:00:03]</p>

<p>The whole room just stared, and she was appalled. I mean, it was just so strange. She was like, "Well, your dog can't consent to marriage. Also, your dog is... a dog." She's like, "This is irrelevant," and she goes to go on, and he has a follow up, which is, "No, no, I mean, really... because you know, the dog, I mean, it's kind of sentient... a similar amount of intelligence, and what would you say if you... given its sentience, really... Dog marriage." He still goes back to it, he started moving on. And she said, "Laws aren't about sentience, they're about people. We write laws about people. And for real, I think we're sure a dog's not a person - because it's a dog." She told him she wasn't going to continue the discussion, she'd talked to a legal scholar, and skipped on. It's not like I haven't heard people do that a lot. [00:00:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it's a famous line by Rick Santorum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Man-dog sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in response to... something about homosexuality?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was in lists of some discussions of gay marriage, gay marriage leads to pedophilia and man-dog sex. Which led to "Sit Down Savage."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that what led to Dan Savage's...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Creating "santorum." Yeah. And he...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't realize it was that comment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was that... he basically did it sort of like, "Well, fuck him, we're gonna..." He ran a contest to decide what would be "santorum," and then he had the website. And I believe it still is the top hit on Google.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is the top hit, yeah, when you search for... [00:00:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was, it has been. It hasn't consistently until this year, and then Rick Santorum briefly managed to get them to bring it down and it got back. For whatever reason, people always bring up the idea, "Why can't I just marry my dog?" Like it's consistent. They just like to bring that up. And they also like to bring up, "Well, then, what's to stop me from fucking a horse?" Which, again, is really creepy. And it just... I don't know, okay, I had a really long day, and it just really upset me and pissed me off. A lot more than I was expecting. Because I told her later that's what he wants. It's not new, it's not interesting, you didn't, just... "Yes, yes. Man-dog sex. Man-dog." But I don't know people just... he came to this reading, which it's very clear what it's about. He sat through her talking for over an hour, and then busts out with, "Why can't I marry my dog?" [00:00:06]</p>

<p>I just, I don't know, I felt like why would you come... it's like you came into my house and set the drapes on fire or something. See what I mean? Why did you just do that? Why did you deliberately go to a talk where everyone's on this one...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, like it wasn't as though you were sitting in a debate about gay marriage with people on both sides and a lot of argument and people getting rowdy and then somebody breaking it up. [00:00:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's a book reading. At the University book store. (pause) And also, can't they just not... it's not even that controversial a topic, really. And I don't know, I was so mad about it. Even after I got home, I just was really... I couldn't fall asleep because I was really just upset and angry. My heart was kind of racing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In Fantasyland, what would you want to say to the guy? [00:00:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd just want him to leave. And a typical thought was, "Why did you ask that question? Why are you here, and why don't you leave?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I believe that you were really angry. That in itself doesn't sound that angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to be fair, the tone I was thinking was more yelling with, "What the fuck are you doing here? Go away." In my head. (pause) Because I just feel like it's in a big... (pause) I don't want to talk to him that way, that's a different - I won't argue with him. It's completely - [00:00:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm asking more... I'm not asking because I imagine you'd actually in reality want to say that. I'm asking because I have this idea that as a civic you're going to be uncomfortable with being angry - sometimes, anyway - and so I'm trying to pursue that. That's my agenda here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to me it wasn't so much that I wanted to... my anger was more in terms of - I wanted to yell at him. Mostly I wanted to... not like, "You suck." But I just really wanted to yell at him, like, "What the fuck are you doing?" [00:00:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess me too. I imagine you had a number of quite critical thoughts about him at some level.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I haven't... yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what it is, is that... the critical thoughts were not anything that I wanted to say to him, like even in a fantasy? What I was mostly thinking about is I just - it makes me so angry that I feel... Sometimes I feel like there's nowhere that queer people can go where there's not going to be some asshole who's going to show up, and do this.</p>

<p>And also, (pause) that, I think, is literally one of the most pointless, stupid, boring, uninteresting arguments to make about gay marriage. It's just completely fucking irrelevant and stupid. And whenever someone says that, they always think they're being so clever and brilliant. Like, "Oh, but I have found a logical fallacy because then I can just marry my dog." (pause) And I don't know, it's just one of those... A. it kind of burns me because it's always, "I want to marry my dog." Because why not, "I want to marry my cat"? Or a bunny. But... (pause) [00:00:11]</p>

<p>I don't know, (pause) it just would be nice to be able to go to a book reading (pause) you know, for someone I know, just read an author, and not have some asshole roll in with his allegedly brilliant thoughts, and try to make us take him seriously? It wasn't like he was standing outside the bookstore with a handmade "You're Going to Hell" sign. He was actually trying to, I think, engage? And I don't know, it's just really, it's crazy in many ways. And part of it is, if you've thought about this or read about this for more than four seconds, the argument would have already come up. And also there's a really obvious answer. A dog's a dog. Not a person. And I honestly never see - [00:00:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gender's not the same as species. Or genus, or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I just never see where they're going with that. Why would you lead to bestiality? Actually, the lead to pedophilia makes more sense to me - I mean, it's still horrible and wrong. But at least you're saying that it's still - it's still horrible and disgusting, but it's between two people, and not a dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's, in that sense, both dumber and more degrading in a way? Homosexuality? [00:00:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. do you really... I mean, it's degrading towards all kinds of things. I feel like it's degrading towards homosexuality, queer identity, transgender people, anyone who has (pause) who's in any way, has a non-traditional marriage, transgender parent, all these bazillion things... The single most boring, predictable secret fantasy straight guys have is they want to be fucked up the ass by their girlfriend. And it's just - that's not a secret. It's like, "Wow, I'm really bored." Because it comes up constantly. Guys are like, "Oh my God, I have this deep, dark secret." I'm like, "Is it being fucked up the ass?" "How did you know?!" God, it just comes up constantly. [00:00:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This guy who runs a small, independent porn company is famous for saying they always make money for straight things for straight guys to put up their ass so they feel comfortable in their heterosexuality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is such an offensive and boring and stupid and pointless thing to say. And if you're not trying to be incredibly offensive, if you were like, "No, I'm having an awesome little thought experience," why bestiality? You would actually be more awesome to say - it may sound stupid, but, "Why can't I marry my toaster?" Which is still a dumb argument. But if you're saying marriage can be between anything, then there's no need to go directly to animals. [00:00:16]</p>

<p>And also, why not primates? That would at least make sense. Or dolphins or pigs, which are both smart. I never thought what it was actually about. (pause) During the reading I was doing pretty good and I invited one of my friends, she's a trans and she's having a really rough day, and we had dinner and I'm like, "You should come to this reading." And when I went, I was like, "Oh, here are these two people I know sitting in front of me and my partner," and then, "Oh, there are those two people - a couple I knew." And then during the questions, I thought, "I think I recognize that person! This is nice!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like a community. [00:00:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's a limited number - there's not a limited number, but you see the same faces sometimes, it's really nice. And I had to help out Tuesday night at a benefit for - it's sort of like a service ministry that encourages LGBT people to write their own stories, and the person who's running it, he's a writing coach, a personal writing coach, and he also does charity or low-cost classes for LGBT people to tell their own stories. And he's helped several people write books. A friend of mine who - two people whose books were heavily influenced by his scrutiny were at the event. I was selling merchandise, I was running the merch table. It was really great, as people came in, I'm like, "Hey, everyone! It's great to see you!" And then there was people I didn't know. I thought, "Oh, this is even more amazing!" It's really nice to see old faces, it's nice to see new faces. That made it enjoyable and I felt the same way about the reading, like, "Yeah! People I know! Awesome!" [00:00:18]</p>

<p>And her bookstore person was talking about another author I know who's going to be reading in a couple of weeks, and this one person just kind of in a way ruined it (pause), and it's this callous indifference to how anyone might have felt in the room, either he tried to be deliberately offensive, or he thought his awesome thought experience was so awesome, and it made it that we all had to talk about it. And both of them are just really dehumanizing, dehumanizing in different ways, but they still suck. And I just really hate that it's so hard to - you have to go through serious effort to maintain space or hold space that some jackass is not going to walk into, and it's kind of almost impossible. [00:00:20]</p>

<p>Like anything that's public, or semi-public. Unless you individually ID every single person there, or some jackass can walk off the street. Or someone can surprise you with their jackass beliefs, and you're just like, "Oh, I had no idea that was going to happen. Holy shit." (pause) The other thing that's frustrating even if I go through it all the time is that I also hate that what's consider the best response is to just politely and firmly be like, "No." When really, if the person just has been like, "Are you kind of like, bestiality?" In theory, you could just respond with, "I don't know, when did you stop beating your wife?" or "How often do you fuck your dog?" And I totally don't understand why people don't. And I, in fact, am someone who usually responds in quite a measured fashion. But I really hate that there's just never - like we're always stuck with taking it on the chin. [00:00:21]</p>

<p>And there's always the majority culture, and they're going to be like, "Well, but you don't know if he really meant to be offensive by saying gay marriage is like bestiality." And I mean, why do you expect me to believe that shit. You should make that a teaching moment. Which is obnoxious. And if I'm going to teach someone, I would like to be compensated for teaching. And also it's a book signing, it's a book reading, it's not class, it's not - [00:00:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause) is there a way to kind of just (pause) say, it's demeaning to be asked to be the bigger person in a way, (pause) rather than thinking it's important to seem dignified and not be offended.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like you don't have the right to just be offended or be upset. Instead, you have to consider this person's feelings and how to say, like, someone punches you in the face, and you have to be like, "No, I'm sure that..." Somehow you can't respond to that act of aggression and but instead you should be like, "Why don't we hug it out?" [00:00:24]</p>

<p>And actually, I think I know the other reason why I was so upset. Which was why this whole class, another class was potentially offensive materials in libraries - particularly for young adult books, what do you do when a parent says, "This book is completely inappropriate. Why is it on the shelves? Why is my teen allowed to read it?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your class was yesterday before the reading?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right before the reading. And this one girl who I really can't stand because she's a severe know-it-all, first hand up, and she's like, "Well, you know, blah blah, so many problems." And she brought up two books, and I don't even remember one of them. And she's like, "People say that books like Tintin have these really racist aspects, but kids really want to read them. Kids always ask for them and want them, so should we really... why don't we carry them?" And my hand shot up immediately, and I was like, "What kids? I'm pretty sure that black kids are not clamoring for - and actually with Tintin, it's one book that's problematic. And it's really just the one book.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really? I have actually not read Tintin. [00:00:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I read a bunch of them when I was a kid. There's this one book where he goes to the Congo, and all the African characters are just these horribly racist stereotypes. And Tintin goes and basically tells them that they have to be grateful for being colonized by Belgium, because they can't run the country themselves or control themselves because they're hopeless savages.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really awful, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the whole book you're just like... I heard about it and was like, "How bad could it be? " And then I read it. It's just a couple of panels. And I thought, "I don't ever want to read this. This is horrible." You could buy the other 30 Tintin books, you don't need to buy this one particular one. And also for her to comment, "But kids love it!" Meaning, "I guess white kids love it, but really?" I don't think white kids would want this book either. It's a really horrible book. And actually it's not a kids book, it's a teen book. And seriously, I just was so mad that she was just glossing over racism with the idea that if kids like it, then... It's like this fantasy people have where, "Kids don't see race, and kids are color-blind, and kids are never racist." I'm like, "Yeah, they are. Kids grow up in a racist society, and that's what happens." [00:00:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She probably hasn't spent much time on a playground lately.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, she teaches at a private, all-girls school in the City.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really? All right, well, I guess I'm wrong about that! (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure that private, all-girls school is really, really white, and probably has a private playground. I'm like, "Sure, your kids might have one opinion, but they're all girls in a big City whose parents can afford to send them to private school." And she's also teaching right now at a private school in this city. Again. But yeah, I'm like, "Have you ever noticed kids?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear that from a lot of people - well, not a lot, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kids totally notice race, and they totally pick up on what their parents tell them. And by the time they're teenagers, they've noticed it. They really have. And I feel like having read a book like that myself, it would be a traumatic experience for an African-American teen to pick up that book and read it. They probably wouldn't because the cover is also horribly offensive, but I feel like if you - I'm not saying a library shouldn't carry this book, I don't think it should be shelved in YA, and also I'm like, that's a book where it would probably be really good if the parent knew? If the parent/guardian were aware that they've got this really offensive book. Or if the teen was like, "Hey, before you check this out, did you know it was really racist?"</p>

<p>Like it's one thing to read The Bell Curve or some other really racist book, like I know this is a racist book. It's another thing if you've been reading ten Tintin books and you were like, "Yay, lighthearted adventure!" And then you're like, "Blackface." And with this book, you know from the cover, actually, because the cover has blackface on it as well. But it's kind of a horrible thing to do to someone, I really is. And I totally don't think it's appropriate to have in YA, and I just really was so mad that she clearly didn't think of kids - like, kids were all white, and somehow all racially naive, and enjoyed racist literature. And she clearly had never thought, "Oh, what if my kids includes a Congalese immigrant? Or anything?" (pause) [00:00:30]</p>

<p>So it was Thursday afternoon, and I was really pissed about it, obviously. And my professor, who this happened one other time with another student, was like, "Yes, we must be careful with racially insensitive material. Blah, blah, blah, Little House on the Prairie books also." They're settler books, so there's just a whole bunch of displacing Native Americans, and then she's like, "Yes, that's a bad thing, let's go to another topic really fast." (chuckles) And I had mixed feelings, I'm just like, well, I don't really, really want to talk about this with Ms. Know-It-All, Body Experiment Girl. On the other hand, this class is all white. It's 22 white kids, me, and a Native American woman. So (pause) I'm kind of like, maybe we could talk about it? Maybe you could talk about it, and maybe we could do something about this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, what was the topic of this class again? [00:00:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The topic of the class - the entire class is Adult Literature. The topic of the class was controversial materials, and what to do if a parent makes a book challenge. The most common reasons for book challenges usually are sex and the occult. People do challenge Huck Finn regularly, and the challenge usually is that it shouldn't be in the children's section, it should be in the adult collection. The reading we'd done was basically about why and how to tackle difficult subjects, like rape and drug addiction, and forced prostitution. So none of our readings had to do with race, it was just about why most books are challenged, which is a right to parents. There's been a lot of controversy over YA literature having writings about suicide and depression and all of these other things. So that was kind of out of left field, like, "Why did you bring that up?" [00:00:33]</p>

<p>I guess why did she bring that up when she clearly had no idea what the fuck she was talking about? I am glad she didn't try to argue with me about it, because I feel that would have gone really poorly. We had a previous argument where she was trying to tell me that she (pause) sort of declared herself an expert on gay-lesbian-transgender books over the last twenty years. She said, "Well, gay and lesbian books didn't really show up until ten years ago." I was like, "Well, as a old queer person - old for this class, since everyone else is 23 - it existed. I was there, I was reading it." She's like, "No, no." At first I just kind of said, "Well, if you say." And she said, "No, it didn't exist." And then I just brought in, "I am queer and I was there, and I read it. So... (chuckling) please back off." And she clearly wasn't going to, and she was going to continue, and again our professor was just like, "Yes, let's just not..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's not go there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:00:35]</p>

<p>So I was already having this feeling of casual dehumanizing and casual... you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean you were already having that reaction with her, and you were already having that reaction that day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was having that reaction with her that day (pause) because this book is really, it's presenting African people as children and animals, basically. It's very clear, it's very dry. And it's horrible. And so to have her be really casual about this really dehumanizing, racist book, and then a couple hours later to have this other person be really casual about their homophobia, (pause) it's just too much. I also was not ready for it. It's not like the class topic was dealing with racist children's literature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you were caught off guard. In both cases, the person was kind of off-hand in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And also really ignorant, but didn't seem to think that mattered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Is it true that (pause) that's something they're only afforded by privilege? [00:00:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A kind of right in a way to think they know what they're talking about when they haven't really thought about it at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like, well (pause) this is a privilege that, A, your thoughts must be relevant to the conversation. And (pause) it's kind of privileged just to see that everyone wants to hear what you're saying, regardless of how little you've thought about it, (pause) and that whatever you're saying should be afforded the same respect as someone who's actually thought about it, (pause) and also that there's something wrong with - if you get challenged on it, the person who's challenging you is the person who's causing problems. Like in class, I very much felt like my professor was a little bit like, "Don't be so angry!" And I'm like, I would like to be. Also, do you notice, I want to make people angry. (pause) Yeah, like she clearly hasn't thought about this for more than a second. Because if she had, presumably, she would be like, "Let me look at this book, wow, it's really racist. Wow, I wonder how that might affect a variety of kids!" It's not rocket science, nor do I think maybe I shouldn't compare gay marriage to bestiality. [00:00:39]</p>

<p>(pause) It's also something that it's this weird - the student has this ability to sort of live in a world where - I'm close to this point where I'm like, "Have you really thought about black people - ever? Do you have black friends? Have you ever worked with black students?" Like, do you barely just sort of completely seclude yourself and surround yourself with only... yourself? (pause) Part of what happens...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop in a minute, I didn't mean to interrupt your thought, it's just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like black kids and black teens aren't people, they're just this kind of theoretical construct that you have in your head. So they therefore don't have feelings or dignity or anything else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, okay. So like, for her, the only concern would be that a white kid might see a book like that Tintin book and develop some racist ideas, and that might be bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not even that. Her point was that white kids wouldn't care about the book being racist, but librarians... librarians are saying the books are racist, but they're obviously not really racist because white kids really love them. And it had this weird, nostalgic idea that, "Well, but, if some white kids like them," it's like, "Yeah, it's not really racist." Yes, it is, it's horrible!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to stop for now, but we'll continue Monday.</p>

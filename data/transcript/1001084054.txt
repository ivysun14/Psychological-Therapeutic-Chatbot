<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me think, where are we?  Are you doing okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I 'm doing okay.  I stopped going to [INAUDIBLE] once a month just to keep in touch.  So I'm doing all right.  I've had some weird [INAUDIBLE] through my physician which is [INAUDIBLE] and I was out in [INAUDIBLE], had a really good time.  My daughter was thrilled with the improvement in my physical condition.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  You're not as draggy and tired and, uh - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have days, I have days but when I was out there, I was out there for a short period of time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're less inferable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.  Her, um, husband was away and she had been sick, in fact, she may still be sick, I'm not sure yet, um, and she actually asked me to go out there to help with the kids and I thought maybe that was a rouse because, you know, I slept late - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How old are the kids?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] my ticket.  Well, [NAME OTHER] is 12 and there's not much I can do with [NAME OTHER] because I don't drive in [INAUDIBLE], she doesn't trust me.  I don't</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why doesn't she trust you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that started 12 years ago when [NAME OTHER] was a baby - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had more confidence in my driving.  So I can't help her with shlepping because it's a lot of shlepping.  Um, I used to have a really good relationship with [NAME OTHER] but it's very hard for me to connect to [NAME OTHER] the 12 year old.  Uh, I don't know what role grandmothers play, they drop in and out of a 12 year old girl's life that's already filled to the gills with activities and all kinds of stuff.  She, uh, competes in, um, baton twirling on a very serious level and got a straight A progress report, and, um, lots of friends and continues to be [NAME OTHER], uh, but there's not really a whole lot of room in that for a grandma.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it just gets worse.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Once they hit that age, yeah, they're - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably, probably, so I don't know but I get cute emails.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Email, I mean you can set up, maybe as she gets a little older, she can come visit alone and you can - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah right, her parents are now thinking of sending her, for the last 2 years of high school, she just started junior high, to England.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's English and his mother lives in London and I guess there's a program they feel that it's a lot more arduous, which it is, and it would mean quitting the baton twirling but I think they ran it past her and she was excited.  She has a British passport, you know, I mean she has a British ancestry.  She has very famous, uh, English, uh, grandfathers over there who were both important painters and she has an uncle and it occurred to them that maybe they want to Britishize her a little bit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's the way to do it, those are 2 formative years.  I'd be surprised that she'd want to leave her friends and her life.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She left her friends, uh, 2 years ago.  She left the first set of friends.  She decided, they more or less put her in a lottery for a very highly, uh, regarded, uh, [INAUDIBLE]  program and she got, she won the lottery and her scores were high enough, so I guess you have to have scores high enough, then you go in the lottery, uh, so she more or less decided that she wanted to go to the other school and she went around saying goodbye to everybody, you know, she's leaving, she's going to another school next year, before her parents actually made the decision.  I saw the letter that [NAME OTHER] wrote to the school and [NAME OTHER] had already been going around telling everybody she's going to a different school next year, so I asked her, you know, why she wanted to leave her friends and so forth, and she said oh I'd just like to try out new schools.  So now she's in a school that's, they give her a lot of [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They give her a lot of leeway, as long as they check it out, the program out, she can make the decision.  This year, she started, uh, middle school and she, um,  chose a school that's much closer to home.  It was basically a Hispanic school and it was really floundering and somebody poured a lot of money into it and it still has basically Hispanic students in it but it has some really good programs and she's going to Europe in May or June or something like that.  [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] I guess are trying, mostly [NAME OTHER] but with [NAME OTHER]'s help, uh, they're trying to establish some kind of a, uh, scholarship fund so that bright kids who are poor and can't afford the trip will be able to go.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think, you know, [NAME OTHER] sees her parents doing that kind of thing and, um, I think that that's really good for her.  And she's happy in that school, she gets straight A's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you June 18th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, what is this, 6months?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Four months, 4 months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Four months.  You know, last month I missed it because about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, my cousin from Israel showed up at my door and I couldn't say, oh well I can't see you - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just showed up without calling.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he called me maybe 10 minutes before; hi it's your cousin [NAME OTHER] or whatever.  No, I don't know, I had an hour so I called you - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's all right.  Anyway, your mood was okay, you were not irritable, you were anxious about money, your appetite was fine, your sleep was not so good, you had some insomnia, moods were stable, no suicidality, not hopeless or helpless, self esteem was low, feeling incapable but we thought you were okay on the cocktail, Parnate, Lamictal, Depakote, Seroquel</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I dropped 1 of the Seroquel.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're on how much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're on 150 now -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What was I on?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were on 300.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So then I'm on 200.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> One of the 3, so you take 3 of the 100's, you were taking 3 of the 100's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they came in 3s.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why did you go down to 200?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I remember that Seroquel and some of the effects it had and I thought let's see what happens if I drop 1.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did anything change?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No difference, okay.  How's you mood been in these 4months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been okay.  I've had my ups and downs.  I gave up [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like to say we separated because we never had anything to separate from so I'd just be, but I gave him up.  I miss him terribly.  I'm very isolated.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Tell me the story, what happened?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, there were 2 things, I don't know if I can remember both of them now.  Oh, one of them was it was getting to be Yom Kippur again, this was the third Yom Kippur and I had to face all of the, um, things for the third time and I said well God - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So the guilt was getting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> God let me get away with it for 2 years.  I don't know that he'll let me get away with it for another year and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's mostly his sin not yours.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well it's his adultery but my lust and that's 1 of the things I need to talk to [NAME OTHER] about.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But I guess he's sinning against his wife.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you're not sinning, lust is not a sin is it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, lust is a sin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Since when?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's in the list, go home and look in a -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a Jewish sin, really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a Jewish sin?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lust?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  And you've been doing it all this time and you didn't know it was a sin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You mean for someone who's not your, uh, spouse, is that why it's a sin.  It can't be a sin if it's your spouse, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess within marriage it's not considered lust but it would be -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So sex drive - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sexual interest outside of a marital -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I assume that's, yeah, maybe -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What a shame that you buy into that as a sin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I also went through a period where I was afraid, I was very concerned about money and I didn't know too much about what would happen if I was named as a third person in a divorce suit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he seems to be just as relieved.  I think he was, it was really, it really scared him, you know, we did it for 2 and a half years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did it play itself out a little?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The second, no - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The relationship or it was still</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well maybe but the second thing that I was concerned about and I don't know what happened exactly, uh, but I had a kind of turn around and I thought about my life and seeing him essentially meant leaving a lot of time available in case he might be able to come over.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I decided that I didn't want to do that anymore and I wanted to step out and start, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It probably stopped you from exploring other potential relationships.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  I hadn't been to a play or a movie or whatever and, uh, he was a nice comfortable, I miss him, I do miss him a lot and I miss the, um, affection and the warmth and not even the sex as much, although it's nice to have sex, you know, that you know you have it in your life, you don't have to, uh, be out looking for a partner.  Um, I just had a turn around and I haven't done a whole lot about it but my days are full and my evenings are full.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When did this happen?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About a month ago.  We're staying in touch more or less.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, by email?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> By email, yeah, so I don't know, now that he knows - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What was the - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] again or what.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean you told him in person that this has to end, I mean - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I told him, he came over, it was 1 of his half hour drop overs or something and it had been bothering me, so I said listen, you know, I can't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Had it been discussed before?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I said I can't go on with this and he said, I don't know what he said but later on, in an email, he said you made the right decision and he's always said if you have any other opportunities, take them.  He's always said don't pass up anything because you're seeing me and that meant anything, anything with anybody, and that was very hard for me to do because I enjoyed his presence and I never knew when he might be available so I would leave blocks of time, you know, in case he came over and I decided that I really wanted to change my life and I really wanted to, I mean I'd be reading things about, you know, uh, AARP and other things about longevity and so forth and this is actually a longevity issue, you know, what way perhaps that, it's a contraindication to any ideas of suicide or cutting my life short or something.  U,  I, now I'm - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's forward [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's why I love hearing about affairs and, you know, whatever, I love it, for me as a depression doc, that's what I want to hear.  I want to hear that there's drive and relationship and whatever.  Hold on, let me stop you there and let me ask you some questions.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood is okay most of the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm lonely.  I'm feeling loneliness more than I've felt in a long long time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel sad?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I feel very anxious.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What percent of the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ten let's say.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Ten percent anxiety.  Is it panic, I mean do you get panic anxiety or just nerves?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I guess I'm feeling anxious; I don't have panic, no.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you irritable?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not great.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you lost weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you lost weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I wish, you know, I went a whole week without eating anything and nothing happened.  I finally lost 1 pound this week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's wrong with your sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I find myself either in pain, that's happened, or just tossing and turning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's fitful sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mostly it's pain, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, not right now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to concentrate okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Can you read?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I read magazines.  I'd really like to read a book.  I started to read the book of [NAME OTHER] which is very interesting but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you enjoy it, do you get pleasure normally, do you enjoy things?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, oh I enjoyed [NAME OTHER] so much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't been in the garden.  I could have given up on that.  I haven't started [NAME OTHER] quilt again but I'm looking forward to doing it.  I'm cleaning the house after months and months and months of not doing it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They thought you, your daughter and everyone thought you were in good shape out there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my daughter was really pleased.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Psychiatrically?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were in a good place?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  I related okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I was able to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No fighting?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We had 1 difficult moment but I was certainly able to relate to [NAME OTHER], I mean 100% from the time when I first got there and went with [NAME OTHER] to meet him at school and she's standing there, he spots her and she's standing there like this and then he noticed me, he says grandma, and he ran right passed her.  I thought, oh boy, that's a grandmother moment, that's what I come for, but she did need help with him because [NAME OTHER] was away so I basically - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long were you there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I only went for a week.  She asked me to. She paid for changing the, uh, the tickets from 2 weeks to 1 week.  She's still not feeling well.  I don't know what's going on now because I haven't heard from her but [NAME OTHER] and I had a ball.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he really, you know, I think with [NAME OTHER] too at that age.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did they have a nice place for you to stay there, I mean -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they have a - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A guest room.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A guest room, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it was comfortable for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, [NAME OTHER] knows that she doesn't have to take care of me much.  If she doesn't feel like cooking, she, you know, we ate a combination of, uh, leftovers and take out, you know, she did make chicken a few nights.  She doesn't allow me to cook in her kitchen but I keep running around.  I mean every time I cleaned the kitchen, turned around a half an hour later and there's a mess so I kept the kitchen clean and, um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I fed myself, you know, I didn't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that would encourage you to go again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I'm not pushing it.  I told her, you know, I'd like to go again in maybe May.  She's supposedly having her kitchen done but they're dragging their feet on it so it could be that - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does she work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She went back to work.  Um, she's working part time but she's flying, she's doing her thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of work does she do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's a pilot and 1 of the nights that I was there, she had to fly, she didn't have to go looking for a baby sitter.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Who does she work for, which airline?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a company that rents or leases planes to executives who don't want to own their own plane.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she can get called at all times of the day and night to, and she's a pilot, that's really excited her, before she was always the first mate.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The copilot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's the pilot.  I saw her in her uniform and she was less than 100 pounds, she lost 8 pounds with this ovarian cyst that she had.  It wasn't all gone when I left. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's less than 100 pounds.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's tiny.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's size 0.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But she's a pilot and the first time I saw her, first I made a mistake and called it her costume or something and she said, oh most people call it a uniform and I figured that out before she even said that but I saw her in her uniform and I said oh wow, I'm so proud.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you salute her?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she said, well that's a conversation stopper and I'm like - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What does that mean?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like how do you answer that, do you say thank you, do you say I'm glad you're so proud, you say - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's not a conversation stopper but she can be pretty nasty but, anyway, so she had to go out that night and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But how does she arrange, how does she arrange childcare.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why she fed them but she fed the kids, you know, I was on [NAME OTHER] duty several nights.  I bathed him and read his stories and, you know, got him ready for bed and all that and then they have a huge trampoline, like huge in the driveway out in back and he loves to go on that but, you know, she's in the kitchen doing something else, instead of just going out there and being there with him or she's convincing him that he can't go out but I could go out, you know, and watch him so she could do something else.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do they have a big place?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not huge, it's, uh, nice, certainly nicer than any place I've ever lived.  There's a lot of room but I don't know how big the lot is, I don't know whether it's an acre.  The house sits right in the middle of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you went back to [NAME OTHER] you said?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [NAME OTHER], the last thing about, first of all, she got really really upset, I told her that [NAME OTHER] had a sexual encounter with [NAME OTHER] when [NAME OTHER] was 17 or something like that and she, you know, she's a lot younger than me and she just couldn't get past the child abuse thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which it wasn't exactly, it was not nice and I did stay with [NAME OTHER] and I was,  I didn't think I should and I got hysterical and I screamed and yelled at him and he has never let go of the belief that [NAME OTHER] could have gotten up and walked out of the room and I asked [NAME OTHER] when I finally found out about it from [NAME OTHER] which is typical, um, whether he felt that he was pressured in any way and he said no, so, um - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But he was 17.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That was my main concern.  He was at least 17.  I mean he could have been 6 months away from being 18.  Uh, that was, apparently [NAME OTHER] had approached him in a way saying well, you know, let me show you something that guys do together sometimes or something like that and  [NAME OTHER] stayed.  He had been abused when he was younger.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so why he stayed, I don't know why -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And your therapist couldn't get over it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She couldn't get over that and the other -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's nothing for her to get over, you know, I mean -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  The other part, he's my best friend and she keeps telling me, you know, that he's a child molester or whatever and I didn't think that was necessary to keep going back to that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the other thing was, like the other woman therapist that I was seeing in New Jersey, they work full time which is fine, they have families to raise or whatever, they don't have to work full time, whatever, but they don't keep appointments and they'll call you up - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They cancel frequently?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, they cancel frequently and,and then the last time, she called me, she said I'm not going to be able to make Thursday because my family is going on a vacation, they decided to go on vacation or something, well look, take your vacation, let me know, tell me you're not going to be in for 2 weeks, I don't care, but don't call me the day before my appointment and say oh, my family decided to go on vacation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, that's very unprofessional.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, and  the other one that I had seen before her said, oh you'll appreciate this, I have grandmother duty next week so I can't see you and that's why I left her, so I don't know, you know, going up to [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And now you're back to [NAME OTHER] who you've been with forever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you were with him when I met you 10 years ago.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well I've been with him for 14 or 15 years but it takes a whole, like 3 hours to get up there and back, then he gives me extra time because of the long trip and blah, blah, blah, uh, so I would rather be with someone that I like and who is helpful nearby.  I like the, the behavioral approach that [NAME OTHER] had and, um, I hate to say I can't, I mean my therapist almost all my life, except for a period in Montclair were men.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let me go over - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, a man has more of a commitment to his practice than women who, at least women that I've seen -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's probably true though.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's probably true.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know but I don't mind if a woman is working part time -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are professional ways to handle it - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean they had appointments, schedules - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, listen, let me organize us.  You look as good as I've ever seen you, you really do - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Psychiatrically, you're fine, you're normal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're really -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [NAME OTHER] always talks about things, moving around, and he says you cleaned your house, you know, I gave up [NAME OTHER], I'm cleaning - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're in a good place.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm getting - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let's just run through the meds, Parnate 60.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal 200.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Depakote 500.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't we pull back on the Seroquel even more if you're concerned about - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can give it a try.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Go to 1, go to 1 of them, you know, or actually down to 100.  Do you take the Klonopin or just as needed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no, I take it every night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You take it every night.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having trouble getting to sleep, yeah.</p>

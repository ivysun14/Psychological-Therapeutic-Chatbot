<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi come on in, just gonna turn on the air a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. (pause) Can we just go over some issues financially? The every week is not going to work. I'm willing to do the hundred again, if we meet every other week. Is that something that's a possibility?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Obviously this is your treatment and your decision, I just want to make sure that you feel like your treatment needs will be met.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel no treatment will not help. I feel like I can stay on track till I can get a job full time and then I can go back to a weekly basis. The only thing that's scaring me is I don't want no treatment, I want some sort of treatment and financially I'm more comfortable with the every other week as opposed to the every week just because this month my student loans started kicking in and the finance piece is really starting to freak me out, I got a lot of anxiety with that because I'm only subbing once a week and I get paid every two weeks on that so that's a two-hundred dollars there and I'm still not getting paid at my internship. I feel once a week is beneficial to me but every other week, based on the finances, is better than nothing. And I don't want to terminate because I do feel like I'm making progress and I do feel that every other week as opposed to nothing will help me out. Just wondered if that was a possibility? [00:02:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Obviously I respect your logistical limitations so absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I agree with you it would be a shame for us not to meet and I would really want to make that possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's what happened to me before I thought I was done with treatment, mine was just because Julianne (sp?) moved, but now that I feel like I'm making effective progress I can't just not have anything because then I really feel like it'll turn for the worse. So if we could meet every other week instead, you know this week and then not the following week that's something I could work with. And like I said I'll pay you the hundred dollars a session because it's the least I can do because I'm more comfortable with doing that than meeting four times a month I just can't do that financially. [00:03:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok, I have a couple of thoughts one logistically and one more in terms of treatment. Logistically that's fine, usually there's only a few times a week that I'll do every other week because obviously I can't really use other week times, but this should be fine for now, I guess, my one request is that if things change let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's fine, if we have to do it on a different day that's perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this should be fine for now, it's just obviously if I reserve this for you every other week I bend those times for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No that's not a problem, if we need to change it to a later time that's perfectly fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, like I said, I think that this should be fine for now I just wanted to let you know that. So that's the logistical and then just in terms of your treatment this sort of idea of being in charge of your life and being responsible for yourself and the anxiety about being on your own it's a much larger issue. [00:04:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I know, and that's why I can't have anything. Something to me is a lot more efficient than nothing. And it's just something that I need to do, I'm hoping it's temporary because summertime is coming up, hopefully I can get a summer job where I have a little bit more income coming in. And this is the problem I've been having now is just school's over looking for a job and I'm just trying to make up for the income that I haven't had for the last (inaudible) and a half. . . so I just wanted (phone ringing 00:04:44) to let you know that that's where I'm coming from, I can do the every other week for now because I do feel it is beneficial to have some time than no time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry about the phone. [00:04:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's alright. But moving forward, there's kind of a setback with me and my girlfriend's relationship. She told me last night that she had her session with her lady, with her therapist, and she's really upset with me because this month has been just really tough, she feels like I've been attacking her, and I kinda have with the job. At the beginning of this month her boss was laid off and now her boss is my old boss and I guess I've just been really mean to her, just telling her how much I hate the guy and now how I really want her to leave her job. And she brought it up to me that I need to find a way to get over this because I do have a lot of hatred towards them. I do have a lot of negative vibes from that company and from the man that she is now working for. And to me I just feel like I'm at a crossroad because I don't know where to go. I still feel the fact that I think she's got upset because I have reached out to some people in other industries trying to help her network and she's resisted me in that, and she keeps telling me that she's gonna move when she's ready to move. And to me it's not an option anymore, like I'm really getting to the point where I'm ready to explode again and I guess that's why I've been snapping a little bit and throwing jabs at her to the point where I need her to make a choice. [00:06:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make a choice between?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Between me or her job. And I know that's very tough, I know that's very hurtful, I know it's not fair, but like I mentioned to her before I'm still very hurt from the fact that she witnessed everything that happened to me and she witnessed everything that they put me through. The man that put me through all this is now her boss and she works for him. She helps him make money. It just, it irritates me. And when I tell her this she does feel bad but she does look at it as it's her life, and I do understand that it's her source of income it's what she needs to do to survive. But here I am trying to bust my tail to change my career, take a leap of faith, and I'm almost there and she just won't even attempt to take a leap. She just sits back and she's very content with where she is. I understand she has low self-esteem, she doesn't believe that she is the best candidate out there for other jobs, she constantly puts herself down, says she's not better than what she really is and what I see. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>And for me personally I am getting frustrated with that, I am getting irritated with the whole thing with she keeps telling me that I'm on the edge and I'm on the fence when she's going through the same thing with her job search. She keeps telling me 'I'm gonna look, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that' and there's constant excuse after excuse after excuse not to do it. And my thing is I have trouble leaving my feelings towards the company I used to work with, towards the people I used to work with while she's still associated with them while she's still working with those people while she's still helping herself make money but also helping everybody in there make money. That bothers me, because there was such a negative attribute that they represented to me. All those people that she watched hurt me, she watched take advantage of me, she watched try to ruin my life, she's now helping benefit their lives? Helping make their lives better? It's just frustrating to me and it's to the point where I want to get a hold of it but I just have a lot of anger toward them. I want to see them not succeed, I want to see everybody in their office fail. I don't want to see her fail, or I want to see her move on I want to see get out of just that office. [00:09:39]</p>

<p>I think that will help me heal a little bit better, because as I mentioned previously, in previous sessions, is when people really hurt me, when people really lose my trust and I don't want anything to do with them I kinda isolate them from my lives. I don't speak to them, if I see you and you come up and talk to me I'll walk by you and pretend you're not there. I'll make it really clear that I have nothing to say to you, I don't want to talk to you and there's really nothing they can do to get over ???. And I don't know why I have that it's just, it's a personality trait that I'm working on changing but it's just so cemented in me that's how I feel. I do have a lot of negative thoughts toward people where I work. I say this all the time about my old boss, I said if he was homeless on the street starving with four kids and needed money or food I know I'd just walk right by him. I know I wouldn't even acknowledge that he was there even if he came up to me. Even if he was having a fundraiser for some sort of disease or whatever he needed help with it, you know, anything, God willing his children, himself, his mother, whatever I would not support him. I would just walk by. [00:11:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you feel that if your girlfriend stays with her job you'll break up with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've already tried to because of that. And that was a lot of reasoning behind why our break-up was in November (pause) was because of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because honestly it doesn't sound like she's leaving her job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think she is either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the question is are you going to break up with her over it?</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I want to? No. Because I do love her with all my heart, but it is hard for me to try and move on and get over this (pause) this job of hers when she keeps, you know, she goes to work every day. I get pissed off when she goes to work every day. I hate that company. I hate everyone in that company. You know? And like I said I've done a lot of things to hurt her, she's also done things without even knowing it that hurt me. And when I express how her staying at this job hurts me, it just doesn't register because she tells me it's not fair that I have to make her make a choice like that. [00:12:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your hope is that she will look for a new job and then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want her to look, she's not even looking! And that's what's pissing me off. And I get even more pissed off when I go out of my way with all my networks because I do know a lot of people, I know a lot of people in other industries, where I go out of my way to hook her up as a connection and she gets mad at me and tells me to mind my own business! That's the part that I get really angry with and I get really pissed off with and I think that's why I have been snapping a little bit, because she keeps telling me she's gonna do this and she's never gonna do it. I mean the one fear that I have is we'll get married and have kids, she'll go on maternity leave and then go back to work (pause). She says she wants to stay home and be a stay-at-home mom, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. (pause) You know because she is so independent, she's such an independent person where she feels like she needs to be working and doing all this nonsense. [00:13:34]</p>

<p>Granted I left the insurance industry to go into education. Yeah I'm not gonna be the making money that she potentially could make or what they could potentially make, but I'm also not gonna be working 24/7. I'm also going to have a social life. I'm also not gonna be travelling every other week (pause). You know? I mean her schedule at work just takes a toll on her. And I think that's part of the reason why too is because I was alone more than I was with her because she was constantly away for work. And for me that's bothersome, you complain you don't see me but yet you go away every week for your job. You know? Why don't you try to change that? You complain to me every week about your job, every week about the people you work with how they're incompetent and you hate working for them but yet you continually go back. [00:14:34]</p>

<p>You know I do feel bad because she can't talk about work with me because I don't want to hear it. You know? And it bothers me because I do want to support her I do want to be there but (pause, sigh) I'm at this crossroad where I don't even know where to begin. I don't even know how to start my process of healing and letting go of that company. I told her the other day if I could blow up the building without her in it I would (pause). That's just how much anger and how much hurt I have from that company. And every day she's still there it just eats at me. It just makes me more angry because she is on the dark side and she's with me and she's playing with me a little bit, that's what I'm thinking in my mind. I do know that she does love me, she loves me unconditionally, but does she really love me enough that every day she goes to work she hurts me more and more? And I understand it's not a fair assessment to her from me, but that's how I feel. [00:15:48]</p>

<p>And I'm at a point where I am, even right now I can feel the anxiety boiling up, my hands are tingling, I'm getting, the rage is starting. And it's just a topic where I'd rather get it out in here than on her and this is what's happening right now with her work situation where before it was the drinking which she's made 180 percent turnaround on that I can't praise her enough, but now it's this. I used to get enraged when she was drinking, now I'm getting enraged with her job because I do have a lot of anger towards them (pause) and I do have a lot of anger toward her new boss which is my old boss because she came home the other day and told me there was a job posting and he e-mailed one of the senior people and not her and this other girl. [00:16:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one thing I'm thinking is that she's doing so much of what you aspire to do, like support herself and live independently and you feel her being under the grip of her employers, but she still comes home every night to her own home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 17:07) She does and I am a little jealous of that because I don't have that stability to do that. I don't have that stability in my work yet where I can come home and say it's my home. I am a little envious of that, I am yes. I do want to be able to come home and say that this is my home, this is what I can pay for, this is what I can contribute towards, my home. Or someday towards our home. You know? I guess I can feel that as a little bit of jealousy in me because here I am just finishing graduate school I got all these loans and I'm struggling to make money and she sits at home and gets a lucky break and can make a substantial amount of money. That bothers me. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>That bothers me also to the fact how uneducated people that are in that industry can make three times the money that I can. What sacrifices do they have to make when they make seven times more money than I do? And they still think they can treat people like myself as if we're worthless, we're uneducated people. I guess that's kinda what I'm feeling, is I just see that I know a lot of people in there are uneducated people. Well not uneducated but not as educated as I am myself and they're the ones that are succeeding, they're the ones that are running corporations. But they're the reason why the economy's going down because they're just not making smart business decisions. [00:18:55]</p>

<p>And I just see how a bunch of the work that should be placed on other people is being placed on her and she's doing most of the work and not getting compensated as much as I think she should be, or at least I should have been when I was there. And it bothers me. I know how the system works, I worked in it for four years. And I guess that's what pisses me off about her job and about what's going on. Because I don't have anything stable in my life right now and that's what bothers me is I don't, I don't have a steady job, I don't have a steady living area because I'm constantly back from my parents' house to my girlfriend's house. I just feel like I'm constantly just running around in circles and that I can't get anywhere. I want to move forward but I can't (scoffs). And I'm already at the bottom and I'm trying to get up to the next level and I'm still trying to figure out a way to get up and I can't (pause). Excuse me. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>And it bothers me. It is a level of frustrations that's so bad that (scoffs) you know I try to just bite the bullet sometimes and I try to take deep breaths and control my emotions when I get like this. And for the most part it's been working but there's just times where the frustration just takes over so much because she's been talking about leaving her job for over a year and I still haven't seen anything. Anything to do (inaudible at 20:42). And that bothers me when I have someone who works as hard as she does, who puts everything into her job and is being the perfect employee telling me that she's not good enough for any jobs that's why she's not gonna apply. (inaudible at 21:00) tells me that maybe she's scared of change and that's why she doesn't wanna apply. [00:21:07]</p>

<p>All that is what I'm going through right now. I am scared of taking all these huge leaps. I am scared of doing all this. But you know something, you gotta jump sometimes. And I jumped, I made that jump. And now (chuckles) I gotta try and get back to the top. Because I was up here doing okay and I jumped back down to here and now I'm trying to build my way back up here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what her situation is but she may not have the safety nets you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't have the support that I have, not at home. She does not. She has it with her grandmother and with her aunt but I agree 100 percent she doesn't have the support of her mother, she doesn't have the support of her brother. So in a way she is at a shorthand because there is no net there to catch her. I do have a t least my parents there to catch me. [00:22:11]</p>

<p>And maybe that is why she's not doing it I don't know. She's someone who's like myself, she's constantly worried about money. And I ask her I don't know how you can worry about money when you still have a paycheck coming in every two weeks. I go try being like me where you have a paycheck coming in, one paycheck will come in one week and then I won't get paid for another four or five. I go try living like that. Try being in my shoes (pause). You know and that's what bothers me. I understand she does get to go home to her own home and pay her own bills and do all that stuff, and don't get me wrong that's something that I wanna do. I wanna be able to provide for her someday. Unfortunately I can't do it right now. Would I like to do it right now? Yes. I can't, it's gonna take a little bit. [00:23:10]</p>

<p>And then once it does happen I would eventually like her to be a stay-at-home mom. I'll work two, three jobs if I have to just as long as she doesn't have to work. Because that's what my dad did. My mom worked until she got married and had kids, then she stayed home. That's kinda how my culture is. And this is what's difficult about my culture is the men are supposed to provide for every, for the family. And I understand she's like don't worry about providing we are a team, and I understand we are a team but a masculinity thing for me and a cultural thing for me if I can't provide for my family I feel like a failure (pause). And I don't want to be that guy, I don't want to be that failure. Because I see my dad who's successful, who provides for his family, I see my uncles provide for their families (pause). I think that's the reason why me and my (inaudible at 24:21) marriage and all that we're not there yet because we're not comfortable because we can't provide for them. Would we like to? Yes. Can we at this point? No. [00:24:33]</p>

<p>And that's why I'm really hesitant about taking the next step (pause). There's tons of things that I would love to do tomorrow, but I can't because reality is what it is. I don't have those options to do that. I don't have the options to pay for stuff like she would want. Things like we're looking to book a vacation and I said I'll give you a couple hundred bucks if you'll take it, no because this is (inaudible at 25:19) and I go fine I'll make it up later on. I don't mind going on vacations but she gets upset because she knows how upset I am that I can't be the one paying for the vacation. That I can't be the one providing for the vacation. So she gets hesitant talking to me about this stuff. And I tell her it's fine I don't mind doing it, I wanna do it I wanna enjoy this special time with you that alone time. [00:25:50]</p>

<p>I can't have her feeling so defeated all the time when it's supposed to be a fun thing. I guess part of that's me putting that sense in her head that I feel that way, but I feel a little jealous of that because I can't pay for my own stuff. I was brought up if you can't afford it you can't buy it. And I'm trying to lost that mentality of I can't afford a vacation why would I go on it. But she can so I'm not gonna prevent her from going. I mean, we're gonna have to end up paying for things together someday. So the hardest part for me is accepting stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the plan is that you work in September is that right? [00:26:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully. I have an interview tomorrow with a school but I don't even know. My goal is to have a job by September yes, working in a school system. That's my goal. Jobs are posting now and I'm constantly applying to stuff, but I don't know. Who knows I may not be working in September as a guidance counselor I may be working as an aid or a paraprofessional or as a substitute teacher where I'm not making the money that I want to make and it's still gonna be a struggle. And my thing is I need to prepare her for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just to let her know that it might be tough again because she does have aspirations of getting married soon. She does, I do too. But on a financial basis I'm not ready to be married. Mentally I'm ready to be married, financially I'm not. Mentally I'm ready to start a family, financially I'm not. And that's the one thing preventing me from moving on. [00:28:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you didn't have your parents' house to live in and you weren't dating what would you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Honestly? I'd probably try to live with one of my aunts and my uncles.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you didn't have your family around you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably be living out of my car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't get a job doing something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I would. I wouldn't have gone to school. I'd probably have my own apartment I'd probably be living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you be doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ideally I'd like to be a hockey player. But if not I'd probably work in retail or in a restaurant. Or I would work in the day doing retail and at night at the restaurant. I probably would have no time off, I would be working 24/7 seven days a week (pause). And the only place I would need is just a place to sleep. [00:29:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean there are plenty of people who work not much above minimum wage who support themselves in some way with a little bit of free time, there's lots of people in the world like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I know but this goes back to me being the head of everything is I want stuff, I am a money fiend, I'm hungry for money. I want ways, I want money and I want a lot of it and I'll do whatever it takes to make it is what I'm trying to get at. Well put it this way, if I had nothing to fall back on and nobody to fall back on that was of my family I would probably go back to selling drugs again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be your option? [00:30:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be a good option for a quick fix because I know how much money I could make and I know that I'd be able to support myself (inaudible at 30:21) with that money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Well how do you feel about people who support themselves but have a hard time getting by, do you not respect them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I do respect them. I think they're the most unbelievable people out there. My students have that problem. (pause) But I do feel bad because my students' parents are also working two jobs, they have two incomes. Actually they have two parents working with potentially four incomes coming in because each parent works two jobs. And I do feel bad because the students are home alone by themselves for a period of time (pause). You know what I mean? And that's difficult because they have to grow up faster. They're more independent earlier as opposed to someone like myself who is trying to find his independence in the later parts of his life as opposed to finding it in the beginning. [00:31:27].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what ultimately might work for you, or actually think the other way wouldn't work for you, is you're hoping to get financial independence in order to get other independence. I don't think it's gonna happen that way. I think you're gonna have to make a commitment to creating financial independence before you get it. But you're right in September hopefully you'll get a guidance counselor job but public school jobs in general seem very hard to come by.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh they are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you could be in this position for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think it comes down to choices, I mean if you want the comfort of your parents' house in exchange for sacrificing a lot of other things like your adulthood and you made that choice, but it's a choice you're making.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I understand that and that's why I'm also trying to get into my dad's business. My dad's in the home inspection business, I'm actually going back to school for that. I'm working on getting my licensure for that because I know the guidance thing might not pan out. Well my thing is why not stay in school. But I agree with you is I gotta make a choice whether I wanna be with her and do all this stuff or do I wanna be at home with my parents and do all this stuff. Right now with my mental stage I know I wanna be with her, and I wanna move on and I wanna take that next step with her. And the best thing to do is to just do it. [00:33:04]</p>

<p>Because we had this conversation where she's waiting for me to get a job before she does anything. Because in a way she's kinda like me where she doesn't wanna leave her job and not have any income coming in. And I understand that, that's fine with me. But I also understand that you can still be looking for another job because even if you get another job we'll still have an income coming in. It's just what that is and I'm fully prepared to, I know I'm not gonna make millions of dollars in my life, I know I'm not gonna make a hundred thousand dollars the first year of being a guidance counselor. But I just want a steady flow of income.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess I'm saying to you the same thing that you're saying to her is that you have options right now</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can work right now if you wanted to. [00:34:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could. I can. But I'm also still doing it for my education. I'm substitute teaching, that's working. I'm doing my internship, that's three days that I get nothing for. Could I work after that? Yes. The problem is where would I find a job. I don't wanna work in the restaurant business anymore, that's something I can't do. Could I do retail? Probably. I could do retail. Have I thought about it? No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess if you're not gonna pay your living expenses all that money you've put aside you could pay for your half of the vacation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I understand that. I understand that. But my problem is, is when I had money I spent most of it. I paid off some loans, I bought a new car, I just did other things with the money that I could have been smarter with. And now, and this is what I tell her is, instead of dipping into the little savings that I have I'm still trying to build it up. No matter what every week I put aside twenty-five dollars and put it into my savings account. Is it what I want to put away? No, but I know it's something. I know that's twenty-five dollars that I'll need down the road and it's something that I have. [00:35:34]</p>

<p>For me, if I didn't hate my aunt and uncle so bad I would probably be working there and that's where my income would be coming in. But I just hate them so much right now that that's not an option. And working with my dad and seeing how successful my dad is, the more and more that seems like an excellent idea and I kick myself why I didn't get into it sooner. Because if everything works out in the guidance role there's my summer job, there's my winter job, there's my vacation job is doing what my dad does. Because then I'm self-employed, I'm my own boss with another company but also working for another company. And that will be the two incomes that we need because I'll be making two incomes, whatever I make during my business and whatever I make (inaudible at 36:39) and that's the ultimate goal. [00:36:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I feel like you're focusing so much on the future, right now is getting lost.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. I feel the same way. I feel the same way because I want stuff to happen like that (snaps fingers).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not making anything happen like that. I mean you could go to many places today and get a job and make some money</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: so I guess I don't know why you're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause, exhales) I'm not because I'm scared.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of being hurt again (pause). Of really being hurt again. Because I've had such bad experiences with the jobs that I have had I don't want to see that to happen again. And I guess I'm a little afraid to go all in like I was before where I was fearless. (inaudible at 37:35) And then I just see what goes on and I see the industries and I get turned off. I've pretty much done a lot of stuff. I've done landscaping and I've called landscapers and I've asked if they needed help and they go well when are you available. And I made a commitment to finish my internship up till the end of school which is June eighteenth. So there's three days a week I can't work and I'm like 'well I'm available Thursday, Friday, Saturday', 'well I need you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday too'. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I really don't. I mean people love people on the weekends, there's plenty of part time jobs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I understand that but also with my schedule too before with classes, when I had classes on the weekends that's when they need me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't, you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you haven't had them for a couple months.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I just finished the twelfth was my last class and then I was in a coaching conference all weekend last weekend. There's plenty of things that I could be doing, there's plenty of things that I wanna do, that I should be doing. But I guess I'm so focused on my guidance career now that I'm not thinking about those. [00:38:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess that's what I'm sort of challenging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I hear ya. I hear ya. But ultimately in order to get in a school system you need to be in a school system. I've never been in a school system so if I can substitute and do my internship and gain all that experience till the end of the year I'd much rather do that than (chuckles) find a way to make money. And does it bother me? Yes. But for some reason I'm here, I'm content with it. Because I know up here that experience is gonna help me down there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I just don't see that that's mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm in agreement with you. I'm in agreement with you because I'm a very self-motivating person. I can do a lot of things, I know if I wanted to I could get a job tomorrow working at an Ace Hardware, at a Home Depot, at a Costco, at a BJ's, at a supermarket. I know I could get a job like that. But, I don't know what's holding me back from it. I really don't know what's holding me back from it. I wish I could answer that question but I can't. [00:40:10]</p>

<p>There's just so much that I could do. And maybe it's the fear of now that I have a master's degree am I too good to work for a part time job, am I too good to work for minimum wage? Those are all the things that come into my head now. And I gotta get over that fear. It's okay for a person with a master's degree to work in a sub shop, to work in a supermarket, to work in retail, it's okay. Hell I tell my kids all the time it's okay to work and do all this stuff now because in the end when you get your education you'll be successful. Well here I am preaching that to my students and here I am with an education and I'm not successful. Yet. And I guess it's hard for me to believe it. It's hard for me to fully fully conceptualize that you have your education (chuckles). And I've done what people said, what I've been hearing since I was younger, you gotta go to college, I went to college. Now you need to get a master's, I've got a master's. Now what do I need? Now what do I need to succeed? I've done all this stuff and for me personally I don't have anything to show for it but a huge chunk of debt that I'm getting anxious over paying. Because I don't have anything you know, I don't have any steady income coming in. But I also don't want to give up opportunities in school systems when I can better myself in the field that I'm going in. [00:42:09]</p>

<p>And that's a choice that I made. I guess I did make that choice because I do have that safety net below me where no matter what I'll never hit the ground hard. I'll only hit it softly and eventually I'll bounce back up. But like you said earlier I need to move on where there is no safety net, where if I take a leap of faith that's it, you're on your own you gotta get yourself back outta there. I'm not gonna have mom and dad, my girlfriend, there holding my hand to pull me up. And that's just something I need to deal with, I need to move forward with. I need to accept the fact, like you said, (chuckles) why am I not doing what I can to earn money now? Why am I just sitting around waiting and doing all this other stuff? Why am I doing it? And I don't have an answer. I'd like to have an answer but I don't have an answer. [00:43:25]</p>

<p>And that bothers me. Because, and I agree with you, there are so many things I could be doing to earn money. Maybe it's the fact that when I used to work in the restaurant I used to work late nights. Maybe I don't want to work nights anymore. I don't know. And the fact that when I used to work weekends at the restaurant my girlfriend would tell me those are the only times I get to see you and you're always working. Maybe that's why I'm not working on weekends, it's to spend the time with her that I never get with her from previous times when I was working at the restaurant. I don't know (chuckles). And that's what bothers me because there's times when I feel like I can't win for losing. Because I do work in a different town than where my parents live. If I do that I'm most likely gonna find a job around there. And it comes back to well you never have time to see me because you're either at school or you're working. [00:44:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah but you need to earn a living, I mean you can't just sit at home so they can see their spouse or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I agree. I agree, but that's the dilemma that I get put in. 'Well you can't see me once a week?' Okay fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, we're gonna need to stop now, but I think one of the reasons you have so much trouble is that you come up with all these hypothetical reasons why, you sort of talk yourself out of it with all these hypotheticals and they may not match, they may match what you sort of encounter logistically but they may not. You kind of talk yourself out of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the problem is I've had that with my mom. There were stuff that I wanted to pursue and my mother puts this spin on it and that's why I have trouble making big decisions. Because I constantly have that negative person in my head telling me every negative thing about it which scares me. Because, like you just mentioned, I'm constantly thinking about stuff (chuckles). You know? And instead of thinking of it logically I'm thinking of it emotionally and that's what got me in trouble and I don't want that anymore I'm trying to move on from that. [00:45:52]</p>

<p>And again that's why I can't make a decision. To this day I still have trouble making big decisions, I still have trouble making little decisions. And then after I make the decision I question myself again. Why did I make that decision?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we need to stop for today, I'll see you in two weeks then. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much for everything good to see you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely take care, good to see you too.</p>

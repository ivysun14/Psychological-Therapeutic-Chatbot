<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: How's it going?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Blue shirt society today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Two times next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you do two? I can do two next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can do two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we'll do Wednesday and Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, how does six o'clock. Or we could try one at five and one at six.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me check. Wednesday at five you think is better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think its better, you just looked hesitant so I was trying to meet you half way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I could do Wednesday at five or six. Six is better, so let's just go ahead and do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like it's easier for you to get here at six. 0:01:27.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now we've got the business out of the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So we do. Well, I actually can't remember where we were, kind of last week. I had a, I remember the week before it was so clear and it was sort of this watershed last week. I sort of did a follow up, I worked so friggin' hard this weekend that my brain has sort of been wiped clean. And now I have some sort of memory loss. So I'm a bit of a...I don't really know where to go. 0:02:35.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there is no reason for-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Continuity?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For either of us to have to feel like we have to pick up exactly where we left off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I, think I remember sort of some sensibilities that have been developing, so I guess that's okay. I've been very surprised at how much what's been going on in here is actually been sort of allowed me to detect some similarities how the world. Difficult as it is to conceive these points. I find that it's been very, I don't know, I find it's important to stop and sort of confront things in a matter of fact sort of way. 0:04:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Confront things in a matter of fact sort of way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather than joke about them and kid and needle and dodge and be hopelessly alienated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the way that the joking kidding feels? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, what being hopelessly alienated?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And dodging and needling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it confrontational and passive aggressive and sometimes it, you know, downright... Sometimes it's aggressive. Sometimes its just plain old evasive and that I don't want to deal with this person in a conscious way. I think person is stupid or I think persons acting in bad faith or whatever, so I just, you know, sort of pull out the old bag of tricks. But, I don't know, it was [inaudible]. I am sorry that I don't have much more to say than that, but it has been sort of a nice, if it were a stock it was nice sort of 15 percent, you know, investment. You know, I invested in this one idea and it's just been chugging along at a nice good clip, maybe 12 percent. Just sort of paying off and I find myself just sort of being serious as seems now as potent device, tool as being completely elusive. So, um, so... 0:06:13.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem, you seem pretty serious today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I'm a little tired I guess. I'm always tired on Thursday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you notice how serious. I mean you are coming across as serious. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm wondering does it feel the same way to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it does. I mean I, well there is a certain freedom in it, I mean to just sort of instead of juggling all these balls. To just sort of come out and get things out on the table. And so it is actually very relaxing.  0:07:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you know I might say you seem relaxed but I wonder if you notice any kind of cautiousness perhaps. Because you seem to me to be a little careful today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know where this is going. Either in here or - I don't know it seems like were are on uncharted grounds now or uncharted waters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before it seemed like I had a pretty clear headed, clear take on what was going on in here and what I wanted and what I wasn't getting and now we are sort of 0:07:51.9-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is not clear what is going to come next.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we're not focusing on what we, you know, we don't have that clear ground work to start with what we talked about last week. So it is kind of nebulous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well right sort of like the epiphany is over. Those are some pretty hard fought for weeks, it took us what maybe a dozen sessions or something to pull that one, that one major insight out. 0:08:42.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has been about a dozen sessions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So now it's like, we have to oome up with the next one. As these things go. I'm laughing again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what was that joke about? Do you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope it's not twelve more sessions, that's all I've got to say. 0:09:01.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You hope its not twelve more session? Well I can understand that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That was a lot of sessions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm curious this is the first time you've like nosed over the joked.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What the hell is happening to this building?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you joking again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not, I was like what the hells is going, this room is creaking like... uh, well I don't know. 0:09:44.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if we hit on something uncomfortable somehow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. I know we ended up on this note sort of closeness and stuff like that last week. And I thought that was sort of creepy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what about here? What about what just happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you started joking again and I wondered, I wondered if we hit on something uncomfortable right there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're laughing again as I mention it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to ask because I don't know either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no doubt if I'm lost certainly- this really is unpleasant. 0:10:41.5 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yup. How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No the laughing. I mean it's almost like I've got a Geiger counter and you don't know what the radiation is or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you do it in spite of yourself, which is annoying. 0:11:02.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can't control it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is the first behavior that I've ever had that I can't control. At least that I know of. I do not want to go through twelve more sessions to have an insight. That was miserable. I hated it. That fucking tested every bit of patience I have and what's more is I feel like I give, I'm way to patient already. I'm like I feel like there are tire tracks all over me. 0:11:56.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like basically there is, there is a side of me which feels like I should dump Cynthia in a heartbeat and not think twice about it. Drop the program here because of the marginal utility of it. Some, it's just sort of, lots of work and very uneven in payoff. Until last week. And so, so that is all that I thought about like basically every week that I was from mid-January on. No, no mid February. I don't know I sort of suspended judgment for the first few sessions. But it was kind of weird, there was this weird parallel between being in here and dating Cynthia. It's like both of them seem like a lot of work, kind of interesting discussion, but basically both seem to be going no where. And I wasn't thinking about Cynthia at all when I was, we just had this interaction but I do. I don't want to go through twelve more of this just to have, you know, that's miserable. Or at least I don't want to go through eleven weeks of wondering what the hell is going on in here. 0:13:44.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then have the twelfth week, you know, and then hope to god that the week twelve is another, you know watershed insight. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I mean I guess that's I don't. I guess I have said it before and I don't mean to be mean. But it, but its funny I mean, I do this, this happens with Cynthia too. I just feel like I am always sort of on the edge of breaking up or saying, you know, - well anyway. 0:14:32.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, one might ask in here let's say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are talking about two things, you're talking about, you know, Cynthia and breaking up, having that in mind. But in here you are talking about dropping out of the program as you put it. Kind of put a parallel between what's been going on last few months in that way. So focusing on in here, because that is what we have the most access to, lets say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One might say regarding, you know, stopping this, if there is so much on your mind, what are you waiting for? 0:15:18.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great question. I said I would give it a try. You know, that was one thing. I guess I've sort of made this ruling inside my head which was that I always sort of feel better about terminating something when I've exhausted, when I am dead certain that it's going no where. I've exhausted all possibilities. It's sort of like - are you a med student or an [ist or an oft ph] a psychologist, psychiatrist. Are you an ologist [ph] or an iatrist [ph]? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm studying to be a psychologist. So not a med student. 0:16:46.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, anyway. Well its like a, like a code. Okay. You can't pronounce something dead until its like starting to get cold. You know. So. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, so your, so you, you're giving, you've decided. You've said that you are going to give a chance. I get the feeling as though you're though kind of constantly giving it a chance.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's actually a very unpleasant situation. I mean it's a very unpleasant feeling. To sort of walk around all the time constantly giving a chance. 0:17:32.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I imagine so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that wasn't obvious to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well now that we, now that you say it, I really imagine so. It seems to me like it would be like never knowing whether you are here or there. You know like you kind of feeling like, and constantly asking is this worth it, is this, am I getting out of this what I want? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I do that all the time. I guess that is what makes it so possible to do it in here. 0:18:03.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So possible, or impossible</p>

<p>PATIENT: no possible. Possible. I am an expert at this. I know how to have reservations all day long every day, day after day. Sort of a marathon reservations. I actually don't like it and I don't, and I feel like now that I am 44 going on 45 that I actually feel like phasing that out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being a reservationist. 0:18:47.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know, I mean, it sort of, you know, it sounds like something one would say, you know, maybe two years before you are building little wooden pipe bombs in log cabins but, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute. I'm sorry. What was that, building little wooden pipe bombs in log cabins? </p>

<p>PATIENT: What was that guys name.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unabomber.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The Unabomber.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The Unabomber reference. 0:19:16.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah its like fuck the world the world is crazy I'm fine sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel that crazy to say that? Because you have said that before essentially.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said I was smarter. I definitely knew more about power tools. Look at me I am making the jokes again. Wasting good money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You got quiet all of the sudden. 0:19:53.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm sorry I went away; I don't know where I went.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: went away, you're thinking went away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no I just, I'm sorry I just got lost somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know where I went. I mean this really is sort of the way that I live, so. Every sentence makes me think of what's going on. Well I was just wondering if Cynthia realizes how much. She must know how many reservations that I have all the time. Because I sort of, I mean there is no way that you can really hide that. 0:20:45.1 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I know that I feel like it when, um... I often feel like that you are not, that you are wondering whether or not, lets say commit fully or that you are always kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: right. Well, so where are we?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you are being very cautious today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like it's a bad thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eh. I don't think it's a bad ting, but it's a noticeable difference from usual. I mean you are always thoughtful, but - 0:21:41.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what do you think of my little fancy to end things. Because I- actually, actually I remember where we were, you said "is it that far from the truth?" Because I actually do think that I am a pretty level headed guy and I mean a lot of people around me aren't very thoughtful and so why shouldn't I act on what I know to be true. And you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure that I follow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we started off. Part of me is afraid of dropping out of these relationship because I'm afraid that it's kind of me withdrawing from the world in a way that I shouldn't and that there are still things that I should learn. And you know, maybe the problem is me. That maybe my expectations are too high and that kind of thing. And, but right now the burden of the proof is on me to sort of fully believe that for example, that my relationship with Cynthia is going nowhere. Whether this is going no where. And until I can prove it I won't back out of it till I have a defensible claim. So that is why I don't do it. It's just very rational. 0:23:50.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible] </p>



<p>PATIENT: Even though I mean, god knows I would love to have a life where I just, just sort of walked around said you know what, I don't like this situation, it sucks, it's this it's this it's this, no I'm tired of screwing with this. I am not going to screw with this for months, I am going to screw with this for maybe a week, you know, [inaudible]. I actually would like that. Or at least it is very appealing to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about the kind of life where you say "Hey I am trying this and its working okay, its not everything that I expected it to be, but it's not so bad and maybe I'll play it out, see how it goes". 0:24:33.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am sure that people do that. Now you are the one that is smiling. Why are you smiling?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was funny. I thought it was funny, I am sure that people do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like that's not the kind of thing I could ever do. Or that I imagine myself doing, that's not -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it not goal directed behavior, that is for sure. I mean - 0:25:09.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That pretty, that pretty sort of like, I mean isn't that like not to far away from some sort of Marin County whatever. You know, and so I got into this program, I thought I'd check it out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you tell me, you know, that you, you're - what were we calling it? Well forgetting for the moment what we were calling it. That you're verse of things was always giving it a try, is what we were talking about. 0:26:07.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh reservationism.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Reservationism, that what we were calling it. Right. And like basically the burden of proof is on you to prove that it's not worth it. That's what I understand, understood you as saying about your [inaudible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I get the feeling that what you are asking for is like can't you just view it as the glass is half full. Or something like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the reality is the glass is, in a way, neither half full or half empty. Just has this amount of water in it, right? That's the funny thing about the optimism/pessimism thing. You're saying I'm a reservationist right. Reservationism that seems to me that is in between two things. Either going with something or stopping it. And you're kind of not in either of those one way or the other. 0:27:15.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That has always gotten me into trouble. Going, well if you hold everything up to scrutiny you never get anywhere. I mean if because everything kind of falls short. Yet on the other hand if you relax your vigil you'll get burned period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yup.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you relaxed your vigil in here? In this process? 0:27:49.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worst case?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: worst case.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Worst Case I lose three thousand bucks and you screw with my head in a way that will last probably October, November, something like that. So basically I lose a happy year. Something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You seem to leave out an important part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Important part, insurance? 0:28:29.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well my guess is that you lose three thousand dollars, I screw with your head and you don't get anything out of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is implicit. I lose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Loose $3000, I screw with your head. That could be the good outcome depending on what else goes along with it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no I mean saying I loose a happy year, I mean, it's implicit. Or overt or I don't know, anyway it just seems very clear to me. But I've, you know - 0:28:59.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: so if you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can be the learning database management theory instead of coming here. And that might get me more a lot more, you know, job security which might generate sanity. Which might, you know. So is this -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that can be another way of coming about the same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. I mean you can give me all these forms and I'll fill them out after each class and database management theory. And, you know see how it goes. 0:29:33.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really a bastard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: another joke. But you know, maybe you're a bastard. Maybe it's not an accent that you are a bastard; give what we are talking about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't want to go around in circles, I really don't. We've sort of gone over this; I mean that is kind of what I was saying at the very beginning. Is I don't want to go through twelve more sessions. You know, I don't have that kind of, I don't feel like I have time for those kinds of ratios. You know, I mean. 0:30:38.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See now this is the time that I feel that your, this is when you push the envelope. This is when you say -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Envelope trick there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, moving it. No this is when you say, this is when you kind of say this is how far I'm going to go and without the payoff from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What are you talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With out the payoff from you, what? Finish your sentence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You basically are, well its threatening. 0:31:09.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] what do you want me to say? I mean we are talking about what I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. That's right and you, actually you are doing it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you told me to quit using discussions of theory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're doing it, right? I mean, you are doing something. Anyway, I feel like you're saying, you know, I feel like, this where I feel like he's basically saying give me this or else. 0:31:38.4 </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't [laughing]. I honestly didn't feel that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel from your perspective? </p>

<p>PATIENT: How does what feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say something like, "you know I really feel like I'm not, I can't go through twelve more sessions with this little" -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean, you started off by saying you might not feel this way by accident. And, I was sort of going back over, you know, the fact that that's sort of my predisposition is, I mean my life is filled with lots of blind alleys that this. And so when I stepped in here and smiled it was because part of me. I mean, not being threatening to you, I just, I just. There have been a lot of blind alleys that is all. 0:32:42.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: and so I mean to say it to you, yeah I don't want to say that to you. I mean nobody feels good about saying stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, but on the other hand, you know, I mean surely, you wouldn't want me in here if I wouldn't get anything out of it. I mean, Jesus, it's a waste of everybody's time at that point. I mean so. But in any event that what I was trying to get out was the fact that this is really kind of in the back of my mind, it feels like relationships whether they are employee/employer relationships, scholastic ones, or interpersonal ones. There have been a lot of fucking blind alleys and I am 44 I will be 45. I don't have tons of dough or tons of time. And so what little I have left of those things has to be spent very carefully. 0:34:01.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you make sacrifices to be in here. Yeah, I understand that but its interesting just to back up for a second that I, you know, I find it interesting that I felt that kind of threatened. Even though you didn't intend it that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I understand you and I believe you when you say that you didn't mean it to be threatening. 0:34:24.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I mean. I just did this with Cynthia last night too. Its like, let there be no mistake about, I would drop this in a heart beat if I came to the conclusion that it was going no where. I wouldn't feel very good about doing it, but I wouldn't waste time on it, I wouldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, and I always feel like that can conclusion could be somewhere just over the horizon.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is right. That is exactly where it is. 0:35:01.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean when you are 44 and it feels. Actually I don't know that to be true. But I do feel like this is a completely rational thing and that everybody who thinks differently. Who thinks that, you know, oh your 44 you've got plenty of time to have a family. You'll get your debts paid off, blah, blah. Its like, fuck you. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well see, I'm not going to tell you that oh, you're 44, you'll have plenty of time. That to me is basically irrelevant. Obviously you feel pressured to take care of some things in your life. You put pressure on your self to do so. When you come in here and you pressure yourself, I feel the pressure too. Because I feel like you are saying to me, help me out buddy or that's, you got you're on the clock too. Because I am on the clock. 0:36:04.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you think so basically, I mean by inference then the way like a healthier way or a more fun way would just be to just the relationship be whatever it is going to be around here and sort of disconnect it from the constant threat, this sort of cold war that is always going on inside my head. Stop letting the cold war in my head infect my relationships out here, just, you know, just try to enjoy the relationship, what they are. And then if, if I get a message from upstairs that I am wasting too much time then drop it like a bad habit. Is that sort of, I mean I know you are never being prescriptive and that's sweet of you not to, but. 0:36:57.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me ask you a question. I'm going to answer your question with a question. Back to our discussion</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jesus. Okay. Let get -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I were to tell you to do that, could you do it, would you do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me ask you a question now. I could consider it, yeah. If you told me to do it. Your opinion has weight. I mean what can I say I would try it. 0:37:31.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why does that surprise you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not that that surprises me. I was just thinking about your that. You're answer in the context of the question that you had asked earlier. I don't know. I'm sure what to make of the question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was your question, Jim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No the question that you asked earlier. Before I asked you the question. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh you mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it is interesting because I was talking about the kind of pressure that I am feeling and almost immediately you then you asked me the question, a big question. Like a sum up question. Like is this what I should be getting out of this, kind of question. 0:38:39.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I mean that's, this whole session, I mean you keep talking about it, feeling pressure from my, I mean you know that just across the horizon that that moment could be at any point and its like bumming you out. And you feel the pressure or the intensity or this or that. And it's just like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense to you. I mean I am wondering it because of the way that you are talking about it. Does, can you see how I would feel that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well of course I can see, that is the whole point. The whole point is informed consent. I mean its, I mean I'm not going to say that, I'm not going to sit around here and say that, I mean, my darling I love you and I am going to be here for all thirty sessions. That is baloney, why would I make that kind of a commitment. Or why would I lie, if I don't really, if I have reservations, I think that honesty says that I should be, I should be dead honest about this. I mean. 0:39:50.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I appreciate the honesty, don't get me wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean what else is there? I mean it's just, I mean its just like, and the same with Jim. I mean on the one hand I mean maybe I spend too much time focusing on every little reservation so that it is basically full disclosure. I know that like, okay look I told you in session three, I have [inaudible] troubles. I told you in session six, I was still having trouble. I told you in session 10. you know it's like you fucking didn't listen, I'm out of here, see you later. You know, it's sort of like, you know, I those, that has been a very, very important strategy for me as far being able to make sense of my relationship with other people. Is to say that I've been completely honest about - 0:40:39.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But here is the thing, it doesn't make any sense to me at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that is new. That's new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But -</p>

<p>PATIENT: What doesn't make sense about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being a reservationist, this reservationism, or whatever the heck you call it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sounds like you can't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, is that what we called it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what we called it. Like twenty minutes ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be honest I was worried that I would misspeak. I was. I feel like I am being watched for mistakes and I'm not. 0:41:15.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry. Well I was actually thinking that it was kind of a cute term because it sort of makes it sound like we don't have cities and we don't really have suburbs, we have reservations. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like a double entendre, right. Somewhere between a whole city and a suburb. Somewhere between a -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lots of migratory being can't lay their roots out in the prairie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know like a reservation, the reservationism that you practice is safe. 0:41:53.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is certainly safer than either committing or saying the hell with this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How, why. And this is the system you say doesn't make sense to you. Sounds like you have just made a case for instituting a program.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, its safe but it seems to me that the draw back is that you are wondering about leaving the reservation. You are always going am I happy here or is this good enough. And if I leave should I go to the north or should I go to the south.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tell me more about. When you said it doesn't make sense to you at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what you are saying. Is that how you would [inaudible] standing up. 0:42:55.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is one of those questions I don't have a problem answering. Yeah that is what I mean, yeah that's right. I mean that you talk about goal directed behavior, this isn't. That's bullshit. This isn't goal directed anything. You -</p>

<p>PATIENT: what is it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're managing not to go one way or the other. What is your goal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I see what you are saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is your goal to do thirty sessions or to stop? IS your goal to say with Cynthia or to break it off with Cynthia?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do you really feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was your joke about? 0:43:36.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] Oh you are laying it on the line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm laying it on the line. It does feel like. I am kind of laying it on the line. I am kind of laying it on the line. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well General Schwarzkopf. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it? That makes it sound like it feels really kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: retaliatory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: retaliatory? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was retaliatory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You might be right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure I am right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's talk about that for a second.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] why? If I am right. 0:44:10.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let's talk about that because -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I put you on the defensive. Hey put up or shut up. You're counseling is marginal, counselor. You know. Its like, "oh yeah, well what about your goals, buddy"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I came right back at you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it took you fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Were you waiting for that? You make it sound like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was surprised.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Took you by surprise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess I haven't often retaliated in that kind of way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. It was new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was new, yeah. How did it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] it was fun. 0:44:59.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was just going to ask, what was your reaction to it, when I -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well actually until, now that we are talking about it seems it diffused it. But when you first came out swinging it was, I was concerned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it felt like swinging too? Like I was swinging, like, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, like I was really, I mean that really. I mean that is a real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you were upset. It sounded like you were. At least as much as I have ever seen you. Well I don't know. The answer is I don't know if its goal directed or not. It sure felt like it was. I mean, basically the goal is, the goal is to. I have this sort of vague image of like a thoughtful bookish sort of quite wife/family. You know there is people who read and think and care about each other. 0:46:05.2</p>



<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like the image that you have of you as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I don't -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want somebody like me. I mean I want someone with similar values.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right there is nothing wrong with that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was funny though, when you started saying thoughtful, bookish. At first I thought you were literally talking about yourself. I did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Get a sex change and marry myself. Well no I mean that is kind of what I mean I was just. So but I mean, I haven't found any of these things floating around. I mean I'm basically I'm either dating party animals and trying to reform them. Or dating religious zealots - 0:46:49.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That are trying to reform you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or. [laughing]. Jesus. That's exactly. Well I mean there are some pretty thoughtful bookish figures in, you know, religious zealots.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you a question. It just, it occurred to me, you know, I just made a joke that you reacted to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was proud of you Jim. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were proud of me. Well that was, and you said Jesus when as soon as I made the joke. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Did I say -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well not that bad, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said Jesus Jim when you came out about like, like my goal directed behavior. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, you laughed and said Jesus you did. Well that aside what was your reaction to my 0:47:41.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: to your joke</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was a good joke. [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: thank you. Alright. I wonder if -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh well actually for, well for a split second it was he interrupted me and then I just thought, but I like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not only interrupted you. You were talking about something and maybe I took, maybe in a way it kind of a joke at your expense just on the basis of the fact that you were talking and here I was making a joke on a play on what you were saying. 0:48:23.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well like I said it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its, I guess the reason that I am harping on this. Is the fact to tell you the truth, I try in here not to react to your humor. As good as the jokes might be, I really I try not to laugh. And I try not to joke and here I am all of the sudden almost.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So are you feeling bad about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Against my. Well I don't know. I guess there is some kind of, I'm not sure what happened. I wondered if you had any ideas.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I had to explain it, I would say that you are still sort of must have gotten under your skin earlier in the session. 0:49:16.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its funny I wonder if I feel, if I'm feeling now, kind of like you feel most of the time with me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're like ready to dump me as a patient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I didn't mean quite like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you now often you, you joke.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh now you are using jokes to diffuse situations. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I joked right, more overtly then I used to. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I hope that it doesn't go that way because that is your strength is sort of one of the two of us has to stay sober. We need a designated counselor. 0:50:08.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: a designated counselor. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somebody who doesn't get you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's funny that you say that through because in a way there, we, there was like a role reversal for a second. I mean even more then a role reversal. Its like we almost changed place where you were talking about something serious and I, I was making a joke. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you'll have to fix that one yourself. I don't know what you did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is interesting though at the time because I kind of felt, I don't know. Maybe I was trying to make amends of having come out swinging earlier. I don't know. Maybe I was trying to lighten things up because I had. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that could be, actually it did seem like that was sort of a good natured comment. I mean it didn't. I think I was surprised more than anything else, because it really was sort of something that you don't do. 0:51:12.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it s funny, because I wondered at the time. I mean right after it happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: oh what have I done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I said what the hell have I done and then I said, you know I wonder if this is how Ted feels when he does -</p>

<p>PATIENT: jokes</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like I said, as I've said last time. The jokes, jokes cover a lot terrain, they cover a lot of terrain. I mean you can do them make up, to provoke, to hide it's a. I can't believe that we are talking about this much. On the other hand there might be an article in it. I mean. So </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, we have got to stop. Next Wednesday at 6:00 right? 0:52:02.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wednesday and Thursday at 6:00</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. More fun filed sessions. Okay Jim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright Ted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll see ya.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll see you next Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a good week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You too. 0:52:17.3</p>

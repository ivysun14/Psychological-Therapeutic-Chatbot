<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115 Interview #14, March 18, 1971.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This weather.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Got sent home at eleven and I figured why. This snow really can't amount to much. I've got a half day off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Down your neck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, shoulder. God. I put in 12 hours tonight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you have to go back tonight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They'll be calling me soon I imagine, I expect. I got a half day off because they expected this to last but I didn't so they'll call me. I have to be back at work at 7:30 and I'll work until 7:30 tomorrow morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The same thing I usually do. They'll have to have crews out on the road salting and grading all night long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, please make sure they do LaGuardia because I have to go to the airport tomorrow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That'll be the LaGuardia yard. I may just give them a call and tell them that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you very much. I knew you could help me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what Tye's going to be working in LaGuardia it looks like. Same job I've got so it's going to be a strange situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the same thing as Josh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Tye and Josh. He's been called Tye for so many years. A lot of people don't know his real name. Wow I was sure wasted last Tuesday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you sure sounded it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got a call at 9:00 (inaudible @ 0:01:37.9)I was just trudging down to go to bed. I go to bed at 8:30 real regular. Some girl that I haven't seen since the summer of '69 when I lived in Washington for about three months called me up from New York and said she was on her way back from Germany and she had a one hour layover at LaGuardia at 1:00 in the morning so I went down and managed to get to bed about 10:30, had my alarm set for midnight and Josh and I went out there. We sat around for an hour and a half, shot the bull and got royally stoned. Put her back on the airplane and came home. Got to bed finally about four. I was really wasted when I went to work the next morning so I took a cap of speed, well not a cap, it's a cap that I filled with crystal and I get to work and snort up a little and I'm making it okay and all of a sudden this guy comes in, I'm going to loan you a guy here today, you're going to go upstairs and redo everything. I haven't done that much heavy labor since I quit carrying hods at this iron factory. Just worked my butt off all day long, I was about to collapse, finally got my check, got the hell out of there and this dude that I come home with had to stop at three different places on the way home to mess around looking for a new fender for his car and I'm doing my best to stay, he's a good guy, I mean I'm not having any trouble with it but I'm very cautious to be on the good side because he's my only ride now. I don't have a car to drive to work anymore so we managed to stop somewhere or another, he comes up with a six pack of beer. I had a couple cans of beer and that really wasted me out. By the time I got home and crawled out of that car, I was ready to die. (0:03:29.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you still had to make it to the bank?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I hadn't eaten all day, I remember that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you sounded awfully harassed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really wasn't discouraged or anything else, just so beat I couldn't see. Got word the other day that all the concerts into the middle of April have been called off. They're all scheduled for the Coliseum (inaudible @ 0:04:01.6) whatever the hell the name of it is and they've decided the (inaudible @ 0:04:06.9) is not</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, the one on Times.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that blew the cookies out of everything and called Carmen and Steve and Steve decided he just couldn't afford to come up here just for nothing. Carmen will be up here a week from tomorrow just for the hell of it anyway. I don't know what we'll do now that there's no concerts to go to. Sure felt good to get a check. I threw $390 in the bank and figured up all of the accounts. Of course I wrote a bunch of checks on that right away and it's still about $100 in the red but I'll be able to squeak by now. God, I haven't gotten a haircut yet and it's driving me crazy. I ask everybody I know if they know of a sane legitimate barber around here. Not one of them does. Last time I got a haircut around here I got butchered so bad. I mean it was short hair and I don't mind that, but it was a bad haircut. My head was lopsided and out of shape and really pitiful. I figured I didn't want to go through that again. The only barber I know that I like is back in Boise so I may just put it off for another two months. What the hell. (0:05:42.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you sound like you've been very harried with, there's a good quality I'm catching or an up quality.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, without a doubt. I just feel so good to be doing something to the advantage again. Before just existing all I could do is go down. Everything I did was to a negative effect for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and it sounds like things are just, in some ways there still like a holding operation, like you have to do, there are certain things that you have do like I guess an example would be accrue a certain amount of money, but it also sounds like there is more, you feel like there is much more to your life right now than just sitting still and waiting, that (inaudible @ 0:06:52.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's really a, there's something I can do with it for a change except just bide my time. I suppose actually biding my time was as much as I could do then but I felt so useless that I just couldn't take it and be comfortable. Actually one paycheck brings me, it's a drop in the bucket it really isn't that much to be excited about except that it means so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something really good about that concrete piece of paper even if it's just going to be taken away from you immediately.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was a rather strange feeling to look at a $400 check and just mentally divide it three times and give it all away. Strangely enough, Kevin the guy at work who struck me as such a goon and I are becoming fairly good friends. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the one that you had some contact with last week that surprised you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he was such a goon but it surprised me that he should be friendly to anybody. Strange to find out that he is an extremely close knit momma's boy. Still lives at home and I don't think he's ever lived out of home and all that. Once the relationship got to a point where he wasn't boss and it was still so formal that we didn't know each other, he doesn't strike me as, he seems to relax a little and he doesn't strike me as quite such an idiot. (0:09.00.7) He's still awfully na�ve in most things we talk about but at least he doesn't, he's not so uptight that he makes, he almost trips over his own words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying so hard to maintain a fa�ade it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just really falls all over himself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's almost painful to watch somebody like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel so sorry for people like that I just don't know what to do. Some people are awfully good at it and it's interesting to just watch them build it right there in front of you but if they haven't got their rap down pat it's really a pain. Tye is a complete mystery still. He doesn't seem to be sensitive, like well we still get into that position but we see the situations coming now where one of us is going to get on the other one's nerve and then we just look at the other and say you really buck which is an old old saying of ours which used to be a compliment, it still is in many cases. Tye and Martin who is the kid in Europe that I almost went into service with and I used to always go to Josh's, go down into his room, get all stoned out on LSD. If we got tired of listening to our records or we wanted to hear a new record, we'd call the FM station and request it. It all kind of got to a point one night where Tye called up and the guy didn't know us from Adam but he called up and he says this is Tye again and the guy says yeah. Made a request, he says we're all stoned out on LSD, we'd like to hear this and the guy says sure, sure thing. Now he didn't quite believe it, he was kidding along so they rapped for a little bit and Tye kept, he was really getting off good and he kept getting tangled and confusing words and switching syllables and finally the guy says you are stoned, aren't you? Tye says yeah man that's what I told you and the guy goes well you're really fucked meaning you're really fucked up not that you're a bad egg or anything and Josh pulled the phone away from his head and looked at it and he was so confused and flabbergasted that he didn't know what to say, he puts it back and says thank you so, so are you. After that it just became the biggest compliment you could give a person. Confuse many people by walking up on the street, shaking hands and walking away. I don't know that the problem is really solved but the pressure is considerably alleviated. The misunderstanding may still be there. (0:11:37.1)He's out of work now and I don't think that he realizes that may be six weeks after he starts working, maybe even nine weeks after he starts working before he gets a check and he's already told me that he plans on borrowing money from me but I don't know if I can loan that much to him. It kind of bothers me. He's extremely free with my money and extremely tight with his. It's hard to get away with a pack of cigarettes from Josh but. He took the liberty of the day I left Boise I gave him a ticket and $5, the ticket was for a traffic ticket for $4. I had it reduced through a lawyer. I figured there was nobody that had more practice at paying tickets than Josh so I gave it to him and told him to just trip down and take care of it. I asked him three months later and he assured me he had. So when I got arrested and went back to Boise and found out there was another arrest waiting for me because he had just taken the ticket and thrown it away, never bothered to do anything with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like what you are saying is now there is kind of a standoff between you. Like you've been using that phrase, the way I heard it anyway is like a shorthand for when you come to an impasse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's kind of true. I still don't feel too comfortable about the idea of just having to actually sit down and face off. I don't know whether he would be willing to do it. He probably would get hacked off and of course that immediately would throw up a barrier that I don't think we can get around. It's as if when Jack Larkin had told me that there was a strong possibility that Josh felt still felt that I was his only connection around here and he was supersensitive because of that, if that were to be true why then the problem would be lessening because Josh is feeling more at home. I have a feeling that once he starts his job and once he starts getting his paychecks, if that is the problem, I think things will level out a great deal. (0:13:41.3) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like your saying he's so damn touchy, I don't see any, how are you going to </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just walking on eggs to be around him sometimes. He has he has such I wouldn't know how to say it, he has strange ideas but strange, like I'm used to people having strange ideas, but Josh's not dumb at all. I don't know how it happened to be but I remember getting into some school records one time and came across some of his records, his IQs and things like that, he's definitely not dumb. He's got some of the weirdest habits and beliefs. Like he's such a filthy slob. I've never run across anybody quite that dirty. He's super into the Catholic Church which doesn't amaze me it just surprises me that most people that I know seem to have more of their own ideas instead of accepting a doctrine like that. He won't eat vegetables. It's just weird little habits of his that just strike me as so, there's nothing behind them. If someone were to give you a rap of why they don't eat vegetables because you know even if they said it jokingly because they're knocking vegetarians or something like that it's just their camping, but Josh just doesn't like vegetables. I try to get him to go out and have a Japanese dinner and he goes, no I wouldn't like it, it would be a waste of money. He's never eaten it. He's like a little kid who hates spinach. He's never eaten it. He hates spinach. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's just like arbitrary quirks or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Absolutely. He is so dead set in it even though he even admits to himself that there is no real basis behind it except for his inclinations or. The thing that if Josh has never starved and there's been times when I've gone for many weeks just on nothing but a few potatoes. Anytime that I can eat I'll eat. There's nothing I'm afraid of as long as I can choke it down. (0:16:18.4) The idea of just refusing to even it's like he refuses to expand himself by trying out different things. I'm using food as an analogy but he's that way even about his ideas. He refuses to test out a different idea, to look at it closely. He immediately takes a position of being against it so that even if he were to look at it, it's from a position of how can he defend himself from it or keep it away from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like he makes up his mind beforehand and he holds onto that very tightly. I mean there's no room for new information to get in or no room for making choices about things. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything is colored from that point there on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you've been talking about him in the past couple I don't know times you've kind of gotten this it's been sort of like a quizzical stance on him and I'm wondering if like it also doesn't I mean if it doesn't like I don't know bother your or make you sad that it comes to this type of thing. It sounds like you haven't been at this kind of point with him before. You might have known those things about him but you haven't been in such conflict or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm a little disappointed in him. I mean a little disappointed that I found that he's got all these weird things about him but mostly what bothers me about all of it like with Matt. What bothered me so terribly with Matt not only was I kind of empathized with what it was that was bothering him but also I could see a lot of me in it and I kept wondering if that was where I was bound or at least realizing full well that I could be there if things had happened a little differently. I don't, with Tye it's not that I see myself in him at all, quite the contrary it's just I feel both sorry for him that he should screw himself up, that he should purposely cheat himself of so many things he could dig on. Also, it just pisses me off royally knowing that he's cheating himself like I get mad because he's my friend and he's cheating himself. It's a strange way of dividing him in two by my ideas. (0:18:54.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like, it sounds like, I mean it does sound funny. Like why should you be mad if he's not doing something for himself but there's something about oh I don't know if you could call it pigheadness but there's something that can be very enraging about somebody that just won't look at the other side of it you know. You'd like to just snatch them out of the wreck they get themselves into. Shake them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I greatly admire stubbornness and bullheadness in some people but not arbitrary, just blank wall ideas don't inspire me to consider anyone should have any faith to them. I've always been an activist I guess. Always if ever I get in a situation like a while back it drove me crazy not to be able to do something about what was going on and Tye strikes me as the person that he's not being active, he's not taking advantage of the things that he should and it's not hurting me, but it bothers me just because it could eventually because there's too many, apathy, if you're not part of the cure, you're part of the problem is true when apathy is part of the problem. I think that a lot of the things that are going down today are due to people just not giving a damn. Josh is terribly that way anyway. If somebody has a problem he has a position where well it's hard to say it just in generalization so I'll use an example again. The girl that is going to be coming up here, Carmen, went with this friend ex-friend of mine and Josh's by the name of Ben for a couple of years, about a year I guess. In fact, they introduced me to Jessica. They broke up and since then I have become pretty convinced that Ben is one of the craziest people I know. He lives in a fantasy constantly. Anytime should see him he will immediately start building these huge lies about he has an obsession with being a heavy dealer and it's pitiful. I know the guy is destitute. He's bumming off of people all the time. He's ripped off a couple of friends of mine for several hundred dollars when they were stupid enough to believe that he actually dealt dope and all he did was rip them off. (0:21:43.1) He's an absolute zero. He's forever talking about fantasies of how he's going to turnover several thousand dollars worth of dope. He's going to California, he's going to Washington, D.C. and he's going to go to college again. He's never finished again so she finally got sick of him, broke up with him but she was a little worried because all of us had met her with through Ben and it was always Ben and Carmen. Like as one. I never really knew Carmen as Carmen. In fact, I disliked her very much because she was just something that crawled all over Ben every time I saw them. It made me sick. She seemed to be the hollowest thing I'd ever seen. All she was was Ben's play thing. I just couldn't stand it. Now I've known her and I like her an awful lot. She felt that after breaking up with Ben many of the people that she met over at the bunker, the kind of commune we had going for a while, wouldn't accept her anymore because she was Carmen and she wasn't with Ben and Ben was always the one that put on the big front of being the one. I mentioned to Tye that it would be kind of cool that the next time he saw her he made a point to be friendly with her and explain why. She felt like she might be left out and he says well she's fucked if she feels that way. I guess he's really out of it. She's dumb, that's her problem. He's that way about anybody that's got problems. It's their problem and it's their trouble, there's nothing Tye can do for them. He doesn't want to bother. That's a little closer to what I was saying about his being that way about everything. If isn't Tye's viewpoint, it's their problem and it doesn't influence him. He doesn't seem to see the correlation that he's part of the world and not only does it affect him, but he affects it. He's just his own little unit and if anything stands out he can always just walk away from it and that's what he does. That's the easiest way. I don't know. It bothers me a lot. I hate to see people that are just, I don't know what you call it cold or cruel or what but at least that closed mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it really sounds like just someone that unaffected by in this case some body else's plight it's just like an unwillingness to be effective and it sounds also very different from the kind of view you hold about people and what's (inaudible @ 0:24:51.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid I'm I often well not in his case at all, at all, Jessup, Mosby whatever his nickname, was that way. I even gave him the nickname of the Johnny no mates once because he was always by himself. He would go with a girl and if they broke up he never looked back, it never bothered him, he was always with another girl in two weeks. There were a couple of people that were forever on the shit list, the kids that we ran around with because they were real assholes and if they had something Jessup could take advantage of, if one of them got a new motorcycle, he was a friend right away and he didn't make any beefs about it, he didn't excuse himself or anything else, that's just the way he was. He didn't do it in a cruel way, if someone had a problem Jessup was willing to listen to it or maybe do a little bit to help out but he never got himself involved. Now that I envied in Jessup. Now I don't like Tye's viewpoints at all but Jessup's aloofness although I don't think it would ever satisfy me because every time I see a problem I not only want to do something about it but I always seem to get myself involved in it. That's a hassle. It's a real pain in the a but it just seems to be the way I am. I don't think I would like it if I didn't feel a little bit like I had something at stake too. I often kind of envied that kind of aloofness in Jessup. I know that Jessup also although he never admitted it and Jessup was never open to anybody, very rarely, he wasn't completely happy with the way things with going with him either. He figured it would just change sooner or later. I haven't seen him for little over a year now so I really don't know what he's like anymore but he's fun. He's just one of the nicest guys I've ever known. (0:27:52.8) Huh, it just occurred to me. New thought. I'll just rap it instead of thinking it through. I was just thinking how lately I've had a feeling that I'm waiting for warm weather and I figure either between my motorcycle or just between just grunting around here in New York or between dope or something I'm going to have to meet some new people pretty soon. I got to thinking how I haven't there doesn't seem to be anybody outside of the frat or work and that really doesn't amount to much yet that I know. At first I started to tell myself that yeah it's been that way ever since I've been here except it isn't true. I realize that when I worked on the road with the Dept Personnel I knew people in all the little towns. I would go in and check into my hotel and go off whomever I knew in that town. I would go out and have some fun at night. When that job ended is when the hassles started with the trials and the court scene so I started a new job and I was really too involved with other things to notice that all I did was sit at work and then I just kind of forgot about the whole situation. It never occurred to me you know by the time the court scenes were over three months alter, it never occurred to me that those people I did know I didn't see anymore because it had just been kind of a continuum of hassles or not even hassles but just things that were heavy on my head so I don't know. That's strange I hadn't considered how it had affected me that way before. That's what I get for rapping it out. I'm at a dead-end I really don't have any conclusions to draw from it. It's ugly out there. (0:30:07.6) I just knew this would happen. I took my boots to the shop. Had a half sole come loose. It's gaping open and it's scraping up some stones and snow so I decided I better do something about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there some sense of wondering how you are going to get back to knowing people or? I mean it sounded like you sort of felt like that was an observation that didn't have much life to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I just know that it will happen. I have no idea how it will happen and I don't think I'll have to make a conscious effort to go out and meet people. That's actually what I did when I was working on the road. I would throw my stuff in my motel room and put on some old jeans and an old shirt and drive around until I saw somebody with long hair and freaking around somewhere and then I would go hide my state insignia car and come waltzing along and just introduce myself which always put them uptight at first but then we got along okay and then they would see the car and get uptight again and then we would get over that. We'd be pretty good friends from then on. I just have a feeling that if everything stays on a level continuum of where it is now why then I'll be doing enough things in the future that I'm bound to run into people with similar interests. I know they got to exist. Jesus Christ. When I found that the concerts had been called off, I made a tentative arrangements or just made the suggestion to Josh that he and I go to my parent's house the weekend of the 26th because it will cost us maybe $25 worth of gas round trip and we could get some good homemade free meals out of it. My old man's got a pool table. I'd like to see my little brother and sister. It would just be a rather relaxing weekend for a change instead of the hectic cramming time that seems well that's a stupid way to put it because last time I sat home and I was so bored all weekend long that I purposely tried to sleep all day long every day so I wouldn't have to wake up and stare at the wall. There either seems to be stoned out, strung out and then recuperate here or nothing so I'd like to change the scene for a little while and he seemed to kind of dig on the idea. And then Carmen decided she would like to come up anyway and I'm considering the three of us just tripping back to see my parents which I know will blow their minds. Bring a 16 year old home with me. Hi she's from Idaho staying with me for a while. I'm a little bit afraid that my folks are going to clamp down awful tight on my younger brother and sister because of we older three especially David and I have just blown their cookie again and again and again and freaked them out all together. I think that Carmen I'm just proud to death to even know her. She is one of the most together people I know. I think it would really do a good thing if they could see that people can trip out and be trusted for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wasn't sure you mean. Were you saying you had some reticence about going because of the possible effect on your younger brother and sister</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all. The effect would be I don't know whether they would decide that it's irregardless of the fact that Carmen isn't sleeping with me etc. They decide well that's just a terrible thing to have happen or whether they would be open enough to realize that since there is nothing going on, that it's actually a pretty good thing. Carmen gets a vacation out of it which she could sure use and I get to see a good friend from Boise which I really enjoy and it's advantageous all the way around. They've been terribly open anyway. I'm equally proud of them. There's many times that most folks would have just thrown me out of the house all together and not bother to ever let the door open again and they seem to have taken it all in stride and eventually we'll get it hashed out or if we reach an impasse, leave it at that.(0:35:51.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I heard some kind of respect or admiration for them in there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you bet. My old man is although in an entirely different world and realm and set of ideals and such, it isn't what I would want to do but the determination and the way that he's made something of himself, I just stand in complete admiration. I don't really think that they planned on me being born. I was the third and Dad was so broke when I was born he had to sell a car. He was a new engineer, he had gotten out of the service, married at 19, well he was married at 19, went into the service, David was born, my oldest, he was probably in Europe when I was born they were completely destitute. Christ they lived in a little shack. I've seen pictures of it. He had to sell a car what there was of it when I was born to feed me. I got sick with pneumonia at three weeks. They didn't expect me to live. He had to sell his slip stick just for food and medicine. I mean Christ he's damn well off now. I just hope to hell that in my own way I can do as well as he has. Even though we're going there from entirely different angles, he looks at this cabin and this place down on the Peak as his piece in life. That's what he worked for all this time. He's going to go down there and retire. I can't think of anything, no matter how I get there I can't think of anything I'd rather do than just have my place somewhere, my own land away from people I can go by myself and do my thing and just dig it. I'd like to do that tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like you two share something on a very deep level even though it looks very, the two of you probably look extremely differently on the outside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think we do too. I think that's what kept us on an even plane with each other no matter how much we argue about what we're doing it all seems to lead to a similar point. I'm sure it freaked him out when he found that I used drugs. He took it really evenly. In fact, I think after talking to him all the time, it seems that every time we're together we spend at least a good deal of the time talking about drugs and I'm sure that as soon as it's legal, he'll turn on. I'm sure it also caused him a great deal of hassle right now because he knows I do. He has top secret clearance with the government. He works with Boeing on military weapons and probably gives him a good deal of hassle to know what is happening with me. I'd never considered that before but I met a friend, or know of a guy here in New York, whose father is a nuclear physicist that I believe he still does. He's the head man at what is it Palo Alto whatever that is the testing grounds in New Mexico and he's a freak and nine tenths but he's also aware of the fact that he's being very closely watched day and night because it's not unreasonable at all that he should get kidnapped. (0:40:00.2) I don't think I'm in that kind of position. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:40:13.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, looking at each other's viewpoints, being open to them as we are is so interesting because a lot of it is useful. There are a lot of cases where I take a straight view that freaks out people. They don't expect it from me. They don't object to it because I'm usually am able to substantiate it. They wonder where I came up with that idea and vise versa. Dad loves the way that I and my friends just freak out and laugh about things sometimes. Have a gas. We're going we're flying home from Boise one time and we both. I come to New York, he has to come to New York and layover and go to Dayton but that's the only way you can get there. So we're both on the same flight home and it was about the time they were hijacking everything that got off the ground. We're getting on the plane. He's carrying a suit bag and a briefcase. They look through his suit bag. I wasn't carrying anything so they just let me through and I was standing right on the other side of the gate waiting on him. They went to open the briefcase and he wasn't too sure whether he should let them because he had a lot of top secret shit in there but he finally opened it up and let them see that it was nothing but paper and closed it and he started to walk on through and I said see I told you they wouldn't find it. The cops immediately freaked out, comes over and frisks me, lifts up my bell bottoms and reaches down in my boots to make sure I have nothing there. I just laughed and laughed. We got on the plane and he was sitting there. His face was so red he had tears in the corners of his eyes trying to keep from laughing but he really digs that kind of crazy thing. I think he's envious because he can't quite pull it off himself and get away with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's nice to know that you're just not, or you're not just sort of tolerated but it sounds like he really actively appreciates something about you and the people that you know. It's something that he might like to be able to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, at one point when I was in high school there wasn't anybody I knew or maybe two people whose family wasn't really put in the strange situation about either alcohol or somebody being nuts. Jessup's mother is crazy. Everybody has deserted her. She lives in the house alone now with her ten year old son that they've deserted to her and she's nuts. God she beats on people. She'll cry on you one minute. Cuddling the kids as crazy as she is anymore, she's just really banging. She'll beat him the next minute. She'll lock him in closets. She'll smash holes right through walls. They once had to completely redo that house she went on a rampage and knocked the walls out. The old man's moved away. Amanda, Jessup's younger sister, has left home. She got out of the hospital one day, came home after a tonsillectomy at 19, that's damn near a major operation. I had mine out at 19. She couldn't talk very well. Doctor told her to stay in bed. She came home early so to save money. Her mother got pissed off that she wouldn't get up to wash dishes and Amanda tried to say something explain and her mother said what's the matter can't you speak up, don't you mutter to me, and started beating her. Tore her throat open. The girl just left and never went home again. I don't know. Everybody seemed to have either an alcoholic parent or somebody like that. I didn't realize up until maybe a year out of high school or something like that that I considered myself to be a super lucky son of a bitch to come from the family that I did. Well it's worth $100 but it looks I'll be up, it looks like I'll be up all night. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guess we better stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

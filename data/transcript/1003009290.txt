<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, [PATIENT NAME], uh, just looking back here you, you, last were in the office here, uh, back in April.  So it's been about two months since you were here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that actually the first time that you and I had met.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So just give me, uh, a feel for how things have, uh, been going for you in the last couple months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I got a little fortunate that, um, I've been able to go a little bit out to the store, and I've been out in the yard a little bit.  And [NAME OTHER], my, um, counselor, I think that's what I'm going to say here at, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], we've been working on, uh, relaxation.  Um, and so, uh, I came up with the color blue, so someone went and got me a, a light blue blanket.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You find that a, to be a relaxing kind of a color -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I try to foc -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To try to think of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Focus on it, because my biggest la, not my biggest, but one of my most terrifying things is, was the mind racing.  Just drives you nuts after a while.  You just don't feel like, when you wake up in the morning, you feel like you've, would have been off not to sleep.  And you start your day off already feeling like a truck ran you over.  And, um, violence and all, listening to somebody and listening to TV and talking on the phone and the mind jumping to forward and ev, you know, it just was driving me crazy over a lot years.  So, uh, I just come to a time where I, I'm trying to do, get a support team, the doctors and the counselors, and anything that I can bring up a level, I'm going to be grateful for, and if I can't bring it up, at least I can bring it to the best that I can possibly be.  And, and, and, and, uh, be a little more educated.  And the advantage I had since my Lexapro is a lot of times I can get that count to 10 thing first.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before I respond.  After a couple weeks of taking that, um, my conversations are more, uh, staying in more focused, you know, when I do, if somebody sits down and has a conversation, instead of me jumping 150 places, I might only jump 20 or 30, you know.  So it's easier to follow, uh, what's going on.  So, I, I'm kind of grateful for the Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, you brought this in, um, the Seroquel, uh, at least it's from a box of Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How did that get started?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] for three days.  And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And why were you in, what was that on account of?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'm hoping the actual result would be, um, to go through the story quick, would be to, um, [INAUDIBLE] have a hard reaction around people, you know.  I'd like to get to the point where I, like I say, could go to the store, maybe go out in the yard, I'm sick of being in the house, maybe visit my family.  So we've been working on that.  So, um, it's a lot of things that led to [DEIDENTIFIED], but the most, the most important thing was, um, could I get into the reaction in a controlled environment for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have situation where you had overreacted to something, or were you having a hard time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it was minimal.  Um, I was blessed that for whatever reason I haven't been so, um, uh, uh, uh paranoid or whatever.  But I sat up front with the instructor, like the instructor would be at the head of the table where I sat close to them in every meeting.  We tried to focus on just blocking some of the people that were sitting there, you know.  I know they're sitting there, but I was just trying to, uh, keep it between me and him and see.  So I did good, um, most sessions.  One session I had to get up and leave, but we were already done.  They were getting their paperwork signed, and they all just bum-rushed the guy.  Everybody just started coming up to get their paper signed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is, is this at [DEIDENTIFIED] or be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  At [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I kind of said I had to go, and left my paper there and they came and got me later.  But they said that it went good.  Uh, I don't think I could have did it, there's times when I can't leave the house.  So I'm glad that it wasn't in that, I can't predict this stuff.  I wish I could.  I wish I could sit here and predict it, but I can't.  But it just so happened that [DEIDENTIFIED] came at a time where, um, I could get out for a while.  Had it came with some of them months when I can't, I would have never went.  So I, I, I'm grateful for the opportunity.  I wasn't totally comfortable with it, but I wasn't totally uncomfortable, either.  It was a new experience.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And why did they give you this Seroquel prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I talked to a doctor there, I don't remember his name, and they felt after the classes and reviewing some other things that, um, talking to some counselors there and some people, uh, they said that they felt in the daytime maybe I needed something to kind of equal, even me out a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you weren't feeling calm or steady through the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  They, uh, so I pace a lot, you know.  And that makes you feel nervous when you start pacing.  I don't mean to make them nervous.  I even told them when I went there, "Please don't take that as a sign of aggression or a sign of, uh, stressed out.  It's just the way I think.  When I pace I can think better."  So I, I, I did let them know that ahead of time.  But the doctor felt that being that I was on the Lexapro, he felt that that was prescribed to me and really good, he felt that this was, uh, nonaddictive and this would go in, right along with the Lexapro.  And he said to try it, and then to see my doctor, which came out good.  I ran out last night, and I'm seeing my doctor today, so that came out real good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much different have you felt being on this Seroquel now for the past couple weeks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it doing what you're expecting for it to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At first I had a hard time between the Lexapro and this, because I had to search for, [INAUDIBLE] different box.  You know, I felt kind of lonely, you know, because I've had all this mind racing going on, and all of a sudden it wasn't, uh, wasn't as strong, didn't have as much power as it had.  So it was kind of strange to me at first.  But I'm sleeping better.  I'm not, uh, too argumentative.  But I have experienced a few flare ups.  But I think it's because I'm pushing myself around people a lot.  You know, I mean as far as, uh, react, you know, mingling, going to the store, going to up to, we got a little post office, so I go up and get the mail sometimes.  Things like that.  Some, I think that that's got, uh, got me freaked, I'm always scared that, uh, I won't get that count to 10, and something might happen.  You know what I mean?  It's, it, it's subconscious, still back in my mind.  So I think that's keeping me a little frustrated.  But, um, now that it's been a couple weeks on this.  I'm getting more control of my daily movement, you know.  At first it was just like, "Ah, oh well.  If it's sunny, it's sunny."  But then, okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it wasn't a strong dosage, and I told the doctor -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  This is the very lowest dose that there is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He said to start, to try to, I told him, I said, "I don't want a bunch of different medicines.  I only want medicines that are going to apply to what really applies to me.  Because I want to do this with as much as me as I can."  I realize I've got have some of that medicine, because the mind racing just was defeating my purposes.  Every time I, you know what I mean?  Every time I start to do a session with [NAME OTHER], or try to do my homework that she gives me at home, but that mind races, you know what I mean?  I get the [INAUDIBLE] next thing you know, I'm off and going to something else.  So I'm actually more focused.  Um, I'm nervous, but I'm not, I'm not nervous as in nerves.  I'm just nervous because I'm so used to this, all this going on up here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you're not used to calm up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I'm not used to this -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a whole different way of feeling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  So it's, uh, it's a whole odd situation for me.  But there are days when I'm covered of smiles, go look in the mirror.  You know, it's, uh, [LAUGHING], "Hi.  How are you?"  Kind of like, I get a giggle some days.  So, um, for the most part I think maybe, uh, with you, and [NAME OTHER] and the other doctor, and, um, things that I've had done, that maybe I've got a better program right now.  And, and also I think with my more serious efforts, I think that the program is becoming stronger for me.  So, I'm glad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you had any kind of trouble with mood swings in the last couple months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I, uh, since I've been on both these medicines, it seems to not be drastic.  Okay, they're still there, but it doesn't seem to be like someone opened a window and boom there he is.  It, like, my illustration used to be going down the road at 70 mile an hour and throwing it down to first gear.  You know, sometimes, and then other times creeping along, and next thing you know I'm flying on a carpet.  So they're not so fast now.  But I think that, uh, in all fairness a lot of people have mood swings anyway without the, uh, problems I have.  So I have to take that into account that some of them could be just I'm mad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Today is Monday.  Nobody likes Monday, so we all in our minds -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  We're trying to get some big, extremes out of the way.  Because like you said, everybody is going to have ups and downs as they go through life.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We just want to kind of keep it in a range of what's normal.  A little up, a little down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Depending on the day, but not getting out of hand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  That, it's important to me, because if I don't get to that point that we, that you just illustrated for me, if I don't get to that point, I know that I don't get to any of the other points.  Because if the mood swings jump too quick, and I'm in the middle of something, we've got the repetitive cycle over and over again, and people, even though they're trying, you know, other people, or some people don't know, but some people do, it's still, you know, it's hard for them to follow you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I, by following me, and by slowing down more like I am and not jumping into a different gear so fast, I'm having, uh, more rewarding conversations.  You know, they  make sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you lose people, and you lose supports when, when you jump too far, too fast -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And go to into those extremes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Especially, that's because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we need all the supports we can get.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And, uh, the biggest thing I've gone through [DEIDENTIFIED] and, uh, and [DEIDENTIFIED], and [DEIDENTIFIED] now is, uh, I believe for the most I get to that count to 10, and that's, that makes a difference in my day.  It makes a diff, you know, people say one, one minute can change the whole course of something or your life.  Well, it is true.  It can.  So now I don't blurt back.  Sometimes I would just blurt something out without thinking, or overreact.  It would be a molehill and I had mountain going within seconds.  You know, and people was like, uh, and, uh, I think they are wrong.  They can't convince me at the time.  I think I'm right at the time.  But sometimes when we talk later, and so many different people say the same story, I have to sit back and give them the benefit of the doubt that there was a problem that needs to be addressed there.  They can't be all against me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.  Good.  I think most people are trying to help, and they're on your side, really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I know they are.  That, that's what helps with a support team, when you trust the people you're with, because you can take a chance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the thing with blurting things out, like you say, once a word comes out of your mouth, you can't put it back in there.  They, they already heard it, it's too late.  If you hurt someone's feelings, and you said something that was wrong, you can say I'm sorry, and that's the best you can do.  But you can't put those words back inside.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] And, even through the years, sometimes things heal, but they never, I mean they may smooth over, but they don't never heal in a person's minds, you know.  And they don't know if they want to be around you, or some people want to be around you because they think you're off the hook, you know.  And I don't want that.  I just want for today, if I can find the best alternative, because I, I'm, I think I'm going, maybe I may never a, the solution, because obviously I do have some problems, but I know that, I thought I found good alternatives, and I'm finding out that there's better alternatives.  So until I get the best alternative, I like, I like the fact that I'm still searching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got the right attitude.  You're going to go places with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, just be patient, because it doesn't happen overnight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  The, the biggest thing that scares me, though, is being around, you know, like at the store I'm liable to, sometimes I just get up and leave the buggy and everything, you know, so, but, uh, I went to the store since I seen you, three times.  I went in by myself.  Twice [NAME OTHER] was in the car, my, uh, case manager.  I got everything I needed, so, once we, my friend, she took me to see what I could, you know, what would happened?  But then there was a few attempts that didn't make it.  One time that, I, I was at Walmart and they had, this guy had to bring me out.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He sat me down, and then [NAME OTHER] came over and took over.  I don't know what I, sometimes I see blood everywhere, you know, and it just freaks me out.  I was in that riot, you know, I get nervous when I see blood all over walls or stuff.  But I'm noticing, back to the counting to 10 again, even if I can get the five seconds in when that happens, my, my best defense is to retreat now.  Just retreat.  If I could come back later and resolve it, good.  If I can't ever resolve it, just let, at least it only got as far as it got.  Instead of making it a situation where everybody is [INAUDIBLE].  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Things are going to come around gradually.  And like you said, you go do something and it works out well one time, and the next time maybe it doesn't.  But hey, that's 50%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a lot more -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that, that's better than what it was.  And over time, those percents are going to get better and better and better.  You're not going to get 100% the first, the first minute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  This is going to be a long journey, but, uh, it's just good to know that, there, along this journey it's not as fearful as it used to be.  It doesn't have so many dark spots.  There's a lot of greys, but [INAUDIBLE] you know, but it's not all just dark.  It's much better.  At least I believe it is.  You know, today I've had a doctor's appointment, a human services appointment, now you and then I've got [NAME OTHER].  I could never do that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a lot packed into a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could never, I wouldn't have did that before.  I never would have.  Some, sometimes I meet [NAME OTHER] outside when he comes.  I try, we tried it.  I got, like, probably from here to that building over there.  A walkway, I live in a trailer in the back.  And there's trailers in the front.  So we've been trying to see if I can walk out there, and he'll pick me up.  We've been doing pretty good about it.  I got a good, [NAME OTHER] is a good case manager.  He actually went to the board, and is staying on longer for me.  So that I can keep doing what, going to my meeting, you know, whatever I need, you, [NAME OTHER], the doctors, the dentists whatever.  So, uh, I'm getting somewhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you doing in terms of insurance right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So did he give you samples when he gave you that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what he gave me.  These boxes.  And then, and I ripped this off so you could see that on there.  But the  last one I took last night.  I don't know how many he gave me.  He gave me  of them little boxes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I know I gave you samples of the, uh, Lexapro last time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they went, and the nurse out here, called that company, and they gave me a 90 day supply.  When I come in, she just counts them out and puts them in the bottle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So that worked out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now I'm going to see if we have samples on this.  Um, are we, are we working at all on getting you hooked up with insurance?</p>

NR: 
It's already applied for.
<p><b>DR:</b> We got the application in and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Waiting back to hear?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they're talking like, nine months, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.  The government doesn't move real fast sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  The biggest problem now is, um, so many people with the job [INAUDIBLE] and stuff, and they're uh, they're um, uh, 200% over what they were last year at this time, with clients and stuff.  I called Social Security because I have a pending case, and, uh, to see if I can get some help, but they said there's no, they don't ev, that, uh, there's something, I forget what it was now, anyway they said that there's no money in that fund.  So patient gets, get the medicines, sometimes, and some, I got three prescriptions in my pocket now, I know I'm not going to be able to get.  Doctor gave me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From another doctor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm not going to be able to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what are those prescriptions for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I've got some kind of allergic reaction, so he gave me a shot today and two medicines for it.  But one of them is for, he says my, um, one is for prednisone, and this one here, I think is for the, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Cholesterol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cholesterol, yeah.  He said it's up, and so is my potassium.  I have to have surgery [DATE].  But I've been, I'm on nitro, daily nitro now for my heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me take a look at that real quick.  See, you've got, let's see, three of them.  I just want to make sure.  We got prednisone, we got -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can see my hand sluff all this red.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, this one?  Hydroxyzine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't help you with samples or anything, but this is one you can get for $4 if you go to Walmart or Giant Eagle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That one you can.  This one you might, this cholesterol one, you may be, I'm not sure.  They've got a couple of them.  That might be one of them, but I'm not sure.  So there's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's been pretty conscious.  And he's got this little thing.  And he goes like this.  He's been trying to keep my medicines on the Giant Eagle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  So you might be able to get -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is else, I was taking this isosorb -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 30 mg, it's a daily nitro.  And he said, uh, this was on our $4 list.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I, I don't know about the prednisone, but I think there's a good chance that the other ones are fairly cheaper than might be on that list.  Now this one, the Seroquel.  [INAUDIBLE] that you got started on.  That's about $8 or $10 a pill.  That's an expensive one.  So the on, only we're going to do that is if I can get you some samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I can't say for sure if we got them, but there's a, there's a decent chance that we might.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm, I'm going to have the nurse check on that for us.  And, and I'd like to keep you on that for the time being.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would like it, too, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm thinking that we stick with what we've got.  I don't think you need anything more -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, sir.  I don't, I think it's working good.  Actually, well the proof is in the pudding.  And here it is.  This is my third appointment today, and I've kept it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't missed any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, this, today.  This is the third appointment I've had today with doctors and stuff and professionals.  So I've been out since noon.  Out of the house.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they actually just got the Seroquel approved a few months ago for bipolar depression, so it's right up your alley.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, I was impressed.  I said, "Here we go again.  I'm going to get the bones coming out of my skin."  I was already for it, and it didn't happen.  Uh, we was at, at home so happy.  The, there was jokes, though, because I was real calm for a couple of days, you know what I mean?  And so [NAME OTHER] would go, "Well, if I didn't it was you on the medicine, that wouldn't have been that funny," and then we'd laugh.  I told her, "Star," that's my dog, "The dog is laying down, I'm laying down, don't you feel like you want you want to lay down?"  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she, she got, she was, well just wide awake.  So she laughed.  So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, um, do you think you need any of the Lexapro?  Because I'm thinking three months before we meet again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm going to be done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You about to run out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got one more.  Yeah.  Than that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got one more bottle of 30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to come here.  The nurse would know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got one the day I saw you.  I came and got another one, and I got, like maybe 10 in it.  And then I got one more she's got back there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So she's got what you need.  We'll keep you up on that one, because we got it going.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we'll see if we can get you some samples today on, on this Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the alternative would be, there, there's the central pharmacy, if we have to go through them.  That takes a few days, but if we have to do that, we will.  But, I'm guessing we have some samples, and we'll just check with her and make sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going to stick with one of these in the morning and one of these at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I take the Lexapro at night because I'm not able to stay in bed now.  After a while, [INAUDIBLE] my system instead of getting up at 15 minutes or two hours or an hour and 50 minutes and start pacing, I'm able to sleep a little longer, plus if I wake up, I'm able to just lay there for a while and go back to sleep.  So that is a major victory.  Because I'm not pacing up and down the hall.  Before if I went to bed at 11:00 and I woke up at 1:45 AM, I, that's my day started.  Oh, so, it's, it's terrible.  But, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you've can do other things a lot better when you're sleeping more than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When your day starts out when you've had rest, it doesn't start out a mountain right off the bat.  It, it really does.  And you, I can do my assignments plus the little things I do around the house.  They don't seem irritating any, you know, I haven't had the walls con, the, the trailer hasn't came in for over three weeks, it hasn't, nothing has came in on me.  So that alone, because I was thinking, "Oh, man."  Because there was the opposite side, if I get panicky, then I've got to run outside, then everybody has got to find me.  Because I'm gone.  I haven't had none, none at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  I, I like what I hear from you.  And I like the way things are today.  You've been through a lot today, and here you are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And things are still looking up.  So stick with your program.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everything you're doing is right.  You've got a good attitude, a good approach to things.  And hopefully we've got some medication that can help you here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what I want you to do is set something up for about three months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll, I'll just have the nurse get you some samples here, hopefully.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, I think [DATE] is my Tuesday when -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm supposed to be back here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll see you then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Have a good day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you for helping me help myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You give yourself the credit you deserve, though.  We, we're just standing by you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure is nice to know that you can just, other people can give you, because you can't count on doing it all yourself.  You have to rely, you have to start trusting people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got that right.  Take care.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thank you.</p>

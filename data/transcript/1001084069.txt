<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not terrific.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any new developments in your life or status quo?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing new huh?  Any plans for the holidays?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Going to stay home?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] may be coming home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.  Will she stay with you, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Who knows, that always winds up into a fiasco, she's [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is she still in school?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and, you know, she's in a fast young world and she don't want to sit around and watch TV with the old folks so it's kind of hard to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, she wants to be out with her friends, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well, have you decorated for Christmas?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, do you plan to, do you know, or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll probably put up a tree at the last minute.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's not doing much but okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I hate it, I wish it wasn't even, you know, a part of my -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, do you have any family coming or does [NAME OTHER] have any family coming or anything?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just want to be a non participant.  I don't want, I don't like it, I hate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The whole holiday season.  Well, [PATIENT NAME] more and more people that I know are finding other ways to do the holidays because it's just gotten to be so stressful or unhappy memories associated with it, there are so many reasons.  Have you ever thought about doing something completely different, I mean, I'm thinking I know people that, you know, go away on vacation during the holidays, just go to Mexico or somewhere or something completely different.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's, she likes to get into the Christmas stuff.  She's got family here and so we've got to go over and see them, spend the day with them, I just dread it, I just hate it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd rather just stay home and she can go by herself. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is that an option do you think or would she be upset?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She'd be upset.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The pain is just terrific.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, now what's happening with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?  I know he'd been trying to cut back some of your pain medicines so your breathing would be better at night, is that stable now, are you still cutting back?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just leveled off for now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're back to 150, you know, to 275 patches.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The Duragesic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so 150 mg total and how often do you change those patches, is it every other day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Every day I put a new one on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you alternate them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I switch it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then I cut out the Lyrica altogether.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I found that, you know, when I was taking the dose, I would notice that I would have difficult breathing, that's not a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You said with the Lyrica you were having trouble breathing?  During the day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Day and night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, was it like you'd just have trouble getting your breath or was it like you'd stop breathing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was if you'd just like hold your breath until you can't breathe anymore, until you know, you just can't absolutely hold it, just that burning, you know, like you have to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, so has that gotten better since you stopped the Lyrica?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It seems to, it seems to be getting better, yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I went and saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] again and I told him I can't do the mask, I just can't do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're just too claustrophobic?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just, I panic and I just, I just can't do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did he have any other suggestions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I told him that I had done my own research on Lyrica and had found out that one of the bad, you know, it's a rare side effect I guess is the breathlessness, a feeling that you can't breathe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not getting enough air and he said I get a lot of referrals for people with apnea, you know, to do a study, a sleep study, and then find out that they've been on Lyrica.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Really, so the Lyrica can cause it a lot of times.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he says that I stop them on the Lyrica and it clear up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that might solve the problem, that'd be terrific, yeah.  How long have you been off of it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A couple of weeks now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now I guess, how would you know it's helping because you're asleep at night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] says that she's noticed that I'm breathing better at night, I'm not doing that gasping.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He wants me to, even wear oxygen just when I'm sitting around the house, when I'm not doing anything, you know, like in a resting state where I could doze off.  He says even if you think you might take a nap in the afternoon, he says I want you to put your oxygen on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that just to see if you do fall asleep that they can keep your oxygen level higher, is that what he's trying to do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's just if you're dozing, not if you're awake?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you think you might doze, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so it's nighttime when I sleep and if I'm going to doze in the daytime or whatever, he wants me to wear the oxygen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So have you had a chance to try it during the day yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you noticed any difference in the way you feel?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I seem to be not needing to take as many morning naps after I get up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and are you just using it by the nasal prongs, okay.  So your energy level is a little bit better then?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or your not taking as many naps maybe.  When you're awake, do you feel more energetic or do you just find you're taking fewer naps?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just taking fewer naps.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just having, I'm having such a struggle, you know, now I don't have the Lyrica to cover the nerve pain.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was doing something, evidently it was doing a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, when do you see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] again?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just saw him last week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did he have any other suggestions for the pain?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said what about Neurontin.  I remembered Neurontin from years ago and I don't remember if it did anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So were you going to try it next or you're not sure yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, he wants, he wants me to think about putting in the pump.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Morphine pump?  Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was some kind of pump.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want any more operations.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't blame you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want anybody touching me anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you've been through an awful lot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he understands that, I'm not going to push it, he says, but that would be the other reliable alternative, you wouldn't have to worry about, you know, the liver problems or the drugs going into your blood stream effecting your thinking and all that.  He says it's, you know, pinpointed right in on your nerves.  I just have such a hard time with the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well but then there are the risks which means with RSD, you know, the surgery could flare up your RSD.  With implanted devices, there's infections, there are always trade offs to weigh, so if you decide not to do it, I certainly understand. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He said, you know, nowadays, he says, you know, when I had them done years ago that was, you know, it was on the cutting edge technology.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He says they're so far advanced now, you know, they do it in outpatient surgery, like you know anesthesiologists do it all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't, unless somebody really knows what they're doing, I not going to have them mess with me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't blame you, again, it's a risk with any surgery and it's just a matter, is it worth it or not.  If can manage without it, you know, there are fewer risks it seems like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just I'm in so much pain, I just, I can't remember the last time I was in so much pain all the time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So right now you're just using the Duragesic patches?  Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Duragesic and Naproxen sodium, that's it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How often do you use those?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Twice a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do they help when you use them?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They used to, it's just, you know, we talked about it, the body gets used to it and just needs it to exist.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So whatever benefits, they're long gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just can't take all this depression, just being depressed and just feeling like I just don't want to participate anymore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't, I just wish it would just end, I just want to check out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is it, are you having like passive thoughts, like if you'd get hit by a truck it would be a blessing or are you having thoughts of taking your life?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, taking my life.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you think about how you'd take your life if you're going to or do you not go that far?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of thoughts do you get?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Carbon monoxide poisoning and just go to sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and how do you manage those thoughts, you don't act on them, what do you do?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I change what I'm doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and what do you mean?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do something different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you just get involved in something to get your mind off of it, okay.  Okay, what are you doing to pass time these days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got something going on in my foot now, some kind of a heel spur.  I can't stand, I can't walk.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's another thing, you know, it feels like RSV pain again, you know, and it's God, don't tell me this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, which heel is it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My left.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so standing hurts, walking hurts?  Do you have any kind of padding or orthotics or anything that'll help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been wearing them.  I went to the doctor who took x-rays and he said there's a spur somewhere in there and wear those gel inserts and they don't help, rest it, that doesn't help, it's just like all day long it's constant.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you see if there's anything else they can do to help?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to go tomorrow to a podiatrist </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Hopefully, they can find you some better treatment that will be more effective.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you've got the RSV pain, you've got the foot pain on top of it.  Anything else going on?  That's plenty.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] needs another operation in her mouth.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really, what's that for?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This summer she had that tumor removed from her jaw.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I guess taking it out, it must have popped the nerve so she has no feeling and there's only a limited amount of time to go in and fix it so they sent us to [DEIDENTIFIED] to a plastic surgeon who does microsurgery.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're going to try to stitch the nerve together.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so is she going to have the surgery?  Do you know when yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It could be next week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They're just waiting for approval.  He says we've got to move on this quick.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you've got that going on, on top of everything else.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then the cars are breaking down.  I mean I made the last payment on my car in November.  Last week, the four by four thing goes out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, it's like, what does it get programmed in so that it works like that.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so do you know how much it's going to cost to fix that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's going to be about six hundred dollars.  I got under there and found that it was a computer module.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a relatively easy thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, are you sleeping okay at night do you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I get to sleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you using the Ambien?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ambien and 2 mg of Valium.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you're taking one 2 mg tablet of Valium, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I start out, you know, with taking a half of one, try to get by with it but lately I can't do it, I'll pop the other half. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you take a half or a whole Ambien?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A whole one.  Half of the Valium.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, okay, and how's your energy during the day, just pretty wiped out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lately it's just been, I mean during the summertime I was doing all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then winter came on and it was like wow, drugged out on Duragesic, I stopped the Lyrica and life just went to hell.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just feel like I can't, I try, I get dressed, I put on my work clothes, I go down in the shop, I try to do something for an hour, you know, forty five minutes after I'm down there, you know, I'm standing on one foot because I can't stand on the other one.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your appetite, are you keeping your nutrition up.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's pretty steady.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your weight is pretty stable.  About how much are you weighing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About 164, 165.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and how tall are you [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Five, nine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about focus or concentration, are you able to focus okay if you're watching TV or reading or is it difficult?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Difficult at times.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm having a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Issues, you know, if something doesn't go right the first time, I lose it, you know, I get so caught up in tunnel vision that it's not working that I can't get things under control.  I'm having problems with my body temperature, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Feeling hot or cold?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hot and sweating.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Profuse sweating on my back and then it turns cold and then I can't get warm and I get bad chills and then it makes the RSD feel worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  I'm wondering what that's from, do you think it's from the RSD or do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's one of the problems with RSD or it could be the opiates.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Cymbalta rarely can cause something like that but it's not very common. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's like every day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I get it, you know, around the same time, about eleven o'clock, between eleven and 1, I go through this sweating, it almost feels like withdrawal.  I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about it and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He didn't think it was withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I tried wearing, after you switch that one patch, try wearing it, keep wearing the other one for a couple more hours but then as soon as I take the old one off, you know, an hour later I'm going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, huh, so oh boy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I upped the Cymbalta to the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To the 90.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To the 90 and I started getting ringing back in the ears again and I said oh I'm not going to do this, so I went back down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That went away and then I really got depressed and really got down down where I just couldn't, I couldn't stand to get out of bed, so I upped it again.  Is there something that we could do for just the holidays, just a supplemental type thing, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There are some things we can try.  How long has it been that you went back up to the 90 about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I only stopped it for a few days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You went down to 60 for a few days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You went back to 90.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A couple.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's been close to a month, okay.  We met [DATE] last time, yeah, so around a month, okay.  And when you went back up on the dose, did the ringing get worse?  Okay, because I was going to say if it wasn't for that, if you didn't have side effects, we could go up on the Cymbalta to 120 but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's the problem that I had that one time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'm afraid it would be there again.  Our next strategy might be to begin to add in something to boost the effectiveness of it without having to put you on more of it and the things that are often used are things like thyroid hormone, Lithium, even a stimulant.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lithium, I'm not doing Lithium.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Have you ever been on it before or you just heard about it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've seen [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah, with Lithium, it's main use is in a condition called bipolar disorder, manic depression where people usually take like 1200 to1800 mg a day, not that I'm trying to push this on you but just so you know.  When we use it to boost antidepressants, usually like 300 to 600, it's like a much lower lower dose.  It doesn't usually cause side effects.  It works about fifty percent of the time.  Adding a thyroid hormone can work fifty to sixty or seventy percent off the time, that's real safe because you're taking something that's already in your body anyway, you're just taking a little bit more of it and for some reason, for some people, that'll boost them and get them going.  That's a milder, gentler approach.  A stronger approach is to use a stimulant like Adderall or Ritalin or Dexedrine, something like that, which is like an immediate kick start to kind of get you up and get you going.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's that, that I was on?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I was just looking back.  Recently?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Provigil?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, which is a non stimulant.  It also works for some people.  Do you feel like it helped when you were using it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because we could go back to try it again.  It's also relatively safe.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We were trying that -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's for the sleep, low energy associated with sleep apnea or excessive sleepiness associated with sleep apnea.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I was still sleeping as I was taking it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, which his amazing.  They did just put out some new warnings about Provigil too, you know, rare rash, some things like that but real rare side effects but I don't think we've ever tried you on stimulants have we, like Adderall?  Let me tell you a little bit more about that option.  We've known for years that some people's depression will do better with a stimulant and what these medicines do is release a lot of different chemicals in the brain and they give people sort of instant energy, usually within thirty minutes or so, people feel increased energy and improvement in mood.  They get increased blood circulation and they either work or they don't and you know very quickly.  If they don't work, maybe because the dosage is low, you may need to go on a little higher dose.  Possible side effects, generally they're very well tolerated, most people don't get side effects.  The kinds of things that can cause, for some people, are a little bit of decrease in appetite during the day, when the medicine wears off your appetite usually returns so you don't, most people don't lose weight on them.  If you take them too late in the day, they could interfere with sleep so you want to take them in the morning.  They're usually short acting and they're way out of your system by evening.  Occasionally, they can increase anxiety a little, although that's not usually a big problem.  You don't have any history of heart problems that I remember, do you?  You never had a heart attack?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or any irregular heartbeat or anything like that.  Yeah, for people that have preexisting heart problems, it can increase those problems.  It can increase your heart rate a little bit or your blood pressure a little bit but it's usually not enough to cause problems.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My blood pressure, I just had it taken the other day, and they said it was good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was 128/80.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's very good, yeah.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My heart rate is a little higher.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that could be from the pain.  So if you want to try something like this, probably a good one to try would be one like, it's called Adderall, it's a very safe medicine, it's well tolerated, it's available generically so it's not real expensive.  It usually lasts in the ballpark of six hours, some people longer, some people less.  If it doesn't last long enough, you can take a second dose midday around noonish, you just don't want to take it too late in the afternoon because, then again, it may keep you up at night.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just don't want anything that's going to, may even do my breathing or -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, this does not normally effect breathing at all one way or the other, it doesn't affect breathing, that's not one of the things it does.  It's good for depression, good for fatigue, and good for focus.  It's used to treat people that have narcolepsy when they fall asleep or people that have ADD or ADHD where they can't focus well and then, like I said, it's very helpful for depression for a lot of people too.  It is potentially a medicine that your body could get used to over time.   It doesn't happen very often, in fact, I don't think I've ever had a patient or very rarely with Adderall does that ever happen where you get tolerance over time but if you were to take it every day for years, months or years, you could notice some decrease in the benefits of the medicine.   If that happens, we just take you off for a medication holiday.  If you take it every day for a long period of time, meaning months, years, and stop it cold turkey, there is a little bit of withdrawal people have described to me as kind of like the flu but can happen, be a little achy, a little restless.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I feel that every day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I don't think it's any worse, as bad as what you're going through already and then we really don't have to go through that.  If people have been on it a long time and they want to get off, we just taper it off and there's no withdrawal so it's a pretty easy medicine to use.  Do you want to try it and see if it'll give you a boost?  I think it's worth a shot.  Yeah, I think we've got to try it.  We've got to get you feeling better.  What I can do is start you on a very low dose and you can increase it to a dose that works for you. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you load them too high, it can cause side effects.  One other thing I want to mention about it, if it does work well for you, it's a controlled substance where you have to get a written prescription each time, I can't write refills or call it in, so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just so I have enough to get through the holidays.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I was thinking, do you have a pill splitter at home?  Oh you don't even need one, a knife would even work.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A razor blade or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just a sharp knife would work.  What I was thinking I could do is write for the very lowest strength usually I start people on is 10 mg, it's pretty low, I'm guessing for you it probably wouldn't do much.  I was going to start you on the 20's and if that is too much, you could always cut them in half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 20 mg, in fact, what I think I'll write on here is anywhere from one half to two tablets each morning, I'll write for 60.  And what I would do [NAME OTHER] is I'd probably try one the first time and see.  If it's a little too strong, which I doubt, cut it in half.  If it's not strong enough, you can double up and try two.  Two is not the maximum.  You said you weigh 165ish, that's about 75 kg, so we could even go up to 75 mg if we needed to of this.  I'm starting you on 20 so even if you go to the two a day, it's still only about half the maximum dose, so let's just start low and work our way up until we find a dose that works.  If you have any questions when you try it, you can call me, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that should be enough to get you through the holidays and then some, hopefully.  Let me write this down.  If you like this and it seems to be working well but it doesn't last long enough, it does also come in an extended release form but let's try this form first because it gives you more flexibility in the dosing. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I wanted to ask you, what about that Ambien controlled release. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it seems to be not quite as good at getting people to sleep.  It may be a little better at helping people sleep for another hour or so.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, once I get to sleep, I'm usually all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's kind of, you don't get as much up front so it's not quite as good for that.  Let's leave the Valium and the Ambien alone and Cymbalta then since we're making this change, okay.  Any questions about that at all?  Okay, then again, you should notice a change, excuse me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Bless you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Thank you.  Soon, I mean it's not one that has to build up in your system for a week or two so -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When I take it, I'll notice or not notice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Usually within thirty to sixty minutes you'll notice improvement and if you don't, it means the dose is probably too low and the next day try a little more and if you have any questions call me, okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, anything else then before I set another appointment.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, why don't we check back maybe after the first and see how it's working, does that sound okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Before [INAUDIBLE] I'm controlled now just [INAUDIBLE] let me calm down type thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, the things that might be good, if you can, just get some space, I mean just try to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Decrease the stimulation, all the input, you know, if there's TV on, if there's people talking or phones ringing or music.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's what I wind up doing is just getting away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that's a good thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just going somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good thing.  Sometimes just going for a walk may help if you can, if the weather is decent but yeah, just try to get away from too much sensory input is a good idea.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's causing that?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It may be overload, I mean you're hurting already and on top of that, if you're feeling pressure, stress, or just too much sensory input, it might just put your system on overload so you may just have to tune out some of that.  I don't know if the Adderall will help with that or not, let me know will you.  It's not typically considered an antianxiety medicine but if you're starting to feel better, you may find that it's not so easy to feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think you gave me something for anxiety just not too long ago.  I had to call you and you gave it to me over the phone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not seeing anything, I'm not sure what that was.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If there's any kind of problems.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or I'm just getting over, like you said, overloaded.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll look when I get home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, if this isn't helping and you're still feeling that way, call me.  There are some things we can use.  I prefer not to start two medicines at the same time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I understand.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, do you know if there's a day in January when you're going to be down?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't have anything on the books yet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, let me give you some options then.  Let's see, mid mornings usually work best for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I've got nine thirty on Monday the [DATE] is an option.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or I've got some afternoon times the week before that if you'd rather.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I like mornings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, would nine thirty on the [DATE] work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Would you like a card also?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Please.  This has nothing to do with the price of rice in China or anything but somebody locked a stall in the men's room.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, thanks for letting me know.  Kids sometimes will crawl in and out.  They'll crawl underneath and unlock it.  Thanks for letting me know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I figured happened.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you can't do it unless it's a kid, every once in a while some kid will do that.  All right, then so again, if you feel any worse, will you call me?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, also to let you know, we're going to be out of town that week of Christmas and the first few days of January.  I'll leave the name and number of the on call doctor on my message if you need anything, okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right man</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right doc.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Hang in there okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We'll get you feeling better.  We'll find something that works.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, you bet.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Have a nice holiday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks, you too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, see you later.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, bye.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Bye bye.</p>

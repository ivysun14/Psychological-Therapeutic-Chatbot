<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:01:33) and I talked and fixed the fight a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I tried to bring up. I don't know how to deal with him when he's acting like that. And I think it went well (inaudible at 00:02:02). It started where he brought it up and then he started discussing that I really have a hard time bringing things up, which I do. And he (inaudible at 00:02:15) I think that he's — like, as long as he's happy I'm happy. And if he never had any conflict and that I'd never have any conflict either. I guess which is true and then I started thinking about why it's so hard for me to bring topics up. Because once I'm talking about them, I'm, like, okay talking about my feelings, but it can't (inaudible at 00:02:41) really hard for me to initiate those tough conversations. But it basically (inaudible at 00:02:50) that he thinks that, you know, my happiness is obviously based on someone else's mood. I feel that it can be true. I don't want to fight and maybe it's just, like, you know, once there's a conflict you're almost, like, fine never speaking of it again, and that (inaudible at 00:03:11) brought this up, we probably wouldn't have talked about it. [00:03:14]</p>

<p>And I was thinking how I wanted to talk about it, but, like, I can just never initiate it. And I feel like it ends up coming up and (inaudible at 00:03:26) something else happens, then I get twice as mad, then I'll come out with in an aggressive way, then get full doses of my annoyance. But I feel like it was a pretty good we decided that we're just going to stop and take a break. And then he was like, "I give you permission to just cut me right off," which when he's in that infantile mood, I don't know how that's going to work. But I feel like it was at least a chunk of it. But then I still kept thinking why things are so hard for me to bring up all the time. I don't know if it's because I think I'm getting better with feeling like my choice is, you know, this or this. So, like (inaudible at 00:04:15) my parents, like, I have a horrible relationship or don't talk to me. And I think — and a lot of times I don't want to discuss anything, so I feel like those are my only two choices and neither one is (inaudible at 00:04:24). I don't want to deal with it, but I think I'm starting to feel a little bit better. Like, I don't know, I think about the choices (inaudible at 00:04:35) the choice that I'm going to make and I don't know. [00:04:39]</p>

<p>Even, like, I feel like he and I have some conversations about our relationship and where it's going. And I feel like, before I've been, like, kind of leery to say what I want. Because I'm like, if he doesn't want it then we come to a road, like, do we continue or do we not? But I feel like now it's easier for me to just verbalize how I want things to be, and I'm more comfortable with, like (inaudible at 00:05:00) this is what I want. And if it's not going to match up it really stinks, but I can't not say what I want because that's just not right, so I feel like slowly it's improving. But it's just initiating those conversations that are really hard. And then it's like, when I'm in it I'm fine and I know what I want to say and then I'm fine talking about the feeling, but can't just be like, you upset me today when xyz. And a whole lot of times (inaudible at 00:05:36) hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think about how — is it something that's on your mind, did you think about that you're upset; you just don't know how to say it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think about it and I just don't know how to say it. Like, and I know the type of conversation that I want to have. It's, like, literally, I just can't initiate it. Yeah, and I feel like before, like, it was a little bit of like, I don't know if I want to say this or — but, like, he and I are comfortable talking. But once we talk (inaudible at 00:06:05) I feel like I'm really (inaudible at 00:06:06) or I can trust more and just that initial — I don't know if it's maybe I don't know how it's going to be received, and I'm still kind of like, pull back a little bit. But yeah, it's literally just the — I want to talk, opening phrase that I can't. I have such a hard time (inaudible at 00:06:29). I feel like it's getting better, but — or, like, he'll bring things up and I'll be, like, damn (inaudible at 00:06:41) to talk about it. Not that I (inaudible at 00:06:44) beat me to it. But I feel like he's getting frustrated because sometimes he thinks that I don't even think of those things or I don't care. And (inaudible at 00:06:50) I do care and I'm thinking about it and, like, trying to find the right way for it to come out. [00:06:55]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:06:57) frustrating to me, I'm sure it's frustrating to him because he's upset maybe I don't care he's initiating every conversation. And then I got more — and we kind of like joked about how he is in one of those — I didn't use the word "infantile," but I just said one of those moods where, you know, there was no winning. And then I kind of, like, mentioned to him, like, I feel like I try to reason with you when you act like this, and it's not really productive and we don't get anywhere, and we both end up getting upset and then we're nasty to each other. And that's when we decided that we need to (inaudible at 00:07:40) in that moment, cool down and reconvene. (inaudible at 00:07:45) he was in Boston this weekend. When we had the conversation about it Friday night it was fine, but Friday morning when I came here, like, I was really upset about the conversation from Thursday night, so (inaudible at 00:08:03) too well with people in those repressed states. I don't know why I have such — I feel such an intolerance for (inaudible at 00:08:18).</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:08:20) that it's hard for me to be like an empathetic person, so I don't know if that's, like, I can't just — I feel like when I take like a stance, like, I really have to, like, be like firmly planted in the ground in my viewpoint. And (inaudible at 00:08:36) like I can't pull myself out of that and fathom how he may be feeling at the moment or —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I wonder if part of it scares you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:08:48).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:51) it's like you feel like an adult this moment, and you don't feel like you have another adult to talk to. [00:08:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, I feel more just like defeated, like, I feel like I take things, like, personally, but at that moment they're probably like just things that are coming out of your mouth, or that he's (inaudible at 00:09:13) in. I feel like I'm like, I'm answering all your questions and you're still not making any sense. And so, you know (inaudible at 00:09:24) scary or still annoyance there, I don't know if I dig deeper that there's maybe a scared part, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, your initial reaction was you're pissed off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, then I don't know if hurt is the word, but kind of like what — like, I've done the research; I can answer all your questions. How come you're not listening? Why aren't my answers good enough or — I don't know (inaudible at 00:09:55). I feel like he can be, like, a know-it-all sometimes and kind of like, why do you think you know it all? Like, I have information too here, like hello, and then I feel like (inaudible at 00:10:06). And the stupid computer is really just (inaudible at 00:10:11) and everything and I'm like, answering questions and he's challenging things that I have an answer (inaudible at 00:10:16). But I don't know if it's scary, maybe. (inaudible at 00:10:32) difficult conversation (inaudible at 00:10:34) think about because I can't talk to him or (inaudible at 00:10:38) and I don't really talk in that type of way much. But (inaudible at 00:10:45) him and I, it's important for me to be able to initiate if something's bothering me. (inaudible at 00:10:55) I feel like I just clam up. [00:10:58]</p>

<p>It's just like trial and error to keep on, like, pushing through just so make it easier each time. I think as far as the conversations go it has become easier, so it's just a matter of time we feel more comfortable in those environments. And then I feel bad that I didn't initiate it because I feel like he's thinking that I don't care, or about a little tiff we had that it didn't matter to me. And I'm really, like, thinking about it and concerned about it, but just not enough to say it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like he (inaudible at 00:11:49) you enough to know that it's not that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think — yeah, I think he does, but I feel like he doesn't give me that benefit of a doubt. Because, like, we have had conversations, like, you do know me; do you really think that it was like this? And he said (inaudible at 00:12:14) no, but it can feel like that sometimes, and then I feel bad that he feels like that because I feel like my intention is not to come across that way. But (inaudible 00:12:30) like, paralyzed with, like, fear sometimes, so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what are you afraid of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think not having a response that I would want to hear. (inaudible at 00:12:59) or one that I don't know how to deal with at the moment, and then being upset and me feeling like have to make an answer or make a decision. I don't like not knowing because we (inaudible at 00:13:18). So I feel like be in that position, feeling like I need to make a decision (inaudible at 00:13:23) what to do and then there's a lot of the discomfort that comes with it. (inaudible at 00:13:30) usually, or then sometimes, like, with he and I, like a fight comes out of it and then this happens a lot. So, like, I want to talk about stuff when he's here in person because it's much easier to talk face to face. But then I'm like, worried about conversations are going to go badly or if we're going to have a fight out of it, so that I don't bring it up because I don't want to ruin our weekend. And then I'll kind of bring it up, like, after the visit's over. I know that he finds that pretty frustrating. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys can't have a fight if you're not fighting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It takes two people to fight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. My reaction is until I resist, like, the fighting type. Maybe I guess I'm — I understand that I guess I'm just sort of responding to, like, you feel like a fight is inevitable. And I guess what I'm saying is not only is a fight not inevitable, but you actually have control over whether you're actually fighting. And I don't know why I feel so strongly, like, about that, like, with him because I feel like he's very nice and, like, when you do talk with him, like, about a serious thing he's — like, we joke about it and we say, like, mean things to each other that can be kind of funny sometimes. But in a serious environment, like, he's very nice and understanding, but I don't know. (inaudible at 00:14:56) it's just like bad interactions that I've had with my parents that have just done a number on me to initiate (inaudible at 00:15:05) I don't know. [00:15:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you go with that thought about doing a number on you, what would you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just think — I don't know, like, well, not so much — my mom just doesn't speak, but, like, with my dad, it's just never — like, everything gets turned around on you and then you end up being selfish or ungrateful. And then, I don't know, you tend to leave the conversation feeling like, you know, what just happened? I was having, like, a conversation here, he turned it around to be something about me that's way down there, and then just it not being worth it, and then it stirs up, like, other types of feelings that I have. And I guess not worth it is kind of the best word to use. And so I don't, you know — I feel like I'm just very different from that, but still not close, like hesitations. And then I get frustrated with myself because I'm, like, you know that he's a different person. You know how he reacts and that, like, you two can converse, so why can't you just do it? [00:16:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's you being intolerant of your irrational side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. You know (inaudible at 00:16:36) I'm tolerant of (inaudible at 00:16:38). I feel like I just (inaudible at 00:16:46) and then I get more — I feel like sad and, like, upset with myself when I become intolerant with myself because then I'm just really annoyed that I can't — like, it's not easy, but yeah, that I just can't make myself do it or like me knowing — well, not from experience but conversations with (inaudible at 00:17:10) usually go well and still, I just can't do it. Kind of like you said, like, doesn't he know me well enough to, you know, know that it is on my mind that I care. Like, I know him well enough to know that he, you know, has conversations and is respectful and not nasty, but again, I still can't push through. So I end up feeling like just stuck. [00:17:46]</p>

<p>And then I feel sad that, like, he has to bring everything up because (inaudible at 00:17:55) thinking on his side, like, that just must really kind of stink if you have to, like, bring every, you know, conversation about something that's halfway serious up and initiate it all the time. And then I feel even more annoyed (inaudible at 00:18:13). So I feel like it's just this big, vicious cycle. And then when I feel bad, I feel like that, like, stops me from moving forward too because it's spends time feeling bad. And then that reminds me of my dad, and then that really frustrates me because I feel like he constantly (inaudible at 00:18:29) himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, one of the sources of frustration is feeling like you want or need something and not being able to make it happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm, right. And then I don't think I know what to do with that when I feel like that. So, you know, I'm not sure what to do with that feeling (inaudible at 00:19:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a terrible feeling because it's one of helplessness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. And I know, like, I can't make everything happen because I'm not in control of everything, but I think it's I'm so fixated on what that their response could be, that if it's not to my liking or what I want to have happen, then I just don't know how to, like, deal with those emotions to proceed from there. And then I think I just don't like being in that position so much that I really (inaudible at 00:20:00) myself with it or try not to. [00:20:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, who wants to feel helpless?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So — but I feel like I — obviously, I can't do that forever, especially, like, I need to do something about it and then I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you can do — I mean, it's sort of what comes first, the chicken or the egg? You can do something about it when you feel less helpless. I mean, if you feel like it's going to be a futile endeavor and why try? And it sounds like that's one of the things that holds you back from initiating conversation with (inaudible at 00:20:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your go to point is that you're going to hear an answer that you don't like. There's nothing to do about it and so you don't engage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. But I feel like that's not good [laughter].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My response to this is a little — it's clearly not the whole story, but I think who cares if it's good or not? It's how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I don't like being like that. Like, because I feel that I can converse with him. Like, with my parents I completely feel that that scenario that you just kind of said is true, but with him, I feel like I can talk to him. And I don't think that, you know, when I say something that it's going to be this futile conversation, and yeah, and, like, I don't like not being able to feel that I can bring something up. But I know that that's all me, but I feel kind of (inaudible at 00:21:54) I feel like (inaudible at 00:21:55) right now (inaudible at 00:21:56) a little bit. But —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just going to turn this off (inaudible at 00:22:02).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just don't know why I can't — I don't know (inaudible at 00:22:10).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes you do, we just talked about it. [00:22:17]</p>

<p>[laughter]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I feel like when I'm thinking about it now, and I'm thinking, like, like I don't really have those bad conversations with (inaudible at 00:22:24). I mean, we bicker over the flights [giggles] whenever. But I feel like when I have, like, major emotions at stake and we're talking about them usually it is okay. But yet, I still can't talk about it. And this is where I start to feel annoyed too because I feel like I want to have, like, an action plan. So no action plans. (inaudible at 00:23:02) and then I don't know if I feel — I don't like it because I feel, like, helpless. Like, okay if I kind of identify the problem, but I don't know what to do about it. That can be a little frustrating to me. (inaudible at 00:23:15) have a problem I kind of identify the why around it, but I don't know how to proceed and move forward. Or if — like, if I do bring it up, the rare occasions I do, it comes off, like, snarky. So it's like I'm (inaudible at 00:23:42) out of it, but kind of being a little, like, sarcastic, and then that's not very good either. But I think I have a habit of, like, if I'm upset, like, I will just (inaudible at 00:24:01) shed light on the topic instead of kind of dealing with it. (inaudible at 00:24:10) I'm not sure what to do about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you have to do anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want to. I think I (inaudible at 00:24:26) I want to be in a place where I can converse with my partner and not, I don't know, hesitate or I don't know. Because there are things I want to say and I'm just not saying it until — I feel like I'm waiting for, like, someone to give me, like, the green light to speak, or maybe that's not the (inaudible at 00:24:51). Because I don't feel like I can't talk. I feel like it's all me just not being able to talk. It's not like once I talk that I feel like it's (inaudible at 00:24:59). But, yeah, okay, I feel like the conversation has to be brought up by someone else. And then there's situations, so, like, this was like a common thing where (inaudible at 00:25:15) both kind of upset, so he was probably going to bring it up. And then if there are things that, like, he may not be upset about that I want to talk about, I'm not going to start bringing them up where they come up, like, of them either. (inaudible at 00:25:33) that's good either. And I think that causes grounds for, like, some sort of a fight because I — and I feel like I've always acted like this. Like, I never want to bring something up because it's little, and I probably should, but so then it's like, okay, this little thing upset me. It's not that big of a deal even though it upset me a little bit so I won't say anything. And then the next time comes around and the same thing, and then by, like, the tenth time it comes around, like, I just attack. And I feel like, had I said something the first tense (inaudible at 00:26:17) or maybe the first two small times, the rest of them, you know, have happened or — and so I think — and then — yeah, that people may not even know I'm upset. [00:26:29]</p>

<p>And I feel like I'm, like, not keeping a tally of it, but, like, in my head it's like each — like (inaudible at 00:26:37) you got upset and there's, like, a little bit of disappointment and off the top. And then it's like each time — and then not say anything about it, but then it's just like, more, more, more and then finally, I have my breaking point, like, then they'll hear about it. (inaudible at 00:26:54) but I'm trying really hard to be better about that. And I feel like I don't have conflict. (inaudible at 00:27:04) have a conflict with my parents and then (inaudible at 00:27:07). And if a conflict with (inaudible at 00:27:08) is like, conflict that we're always, like, trying to work on and it's not what I would consider kind of horrible. And then I think my parents is like that too, but then it's hard because I'm, like, pushing myself to speak to (inaudible at 00:27:23). And then I'm learning how to not speak or say certain things to my parents because I feel like those conversations just — nothing happens out of them, so it's, like, I feel like I practice some of the things I want to use on (inaudible at 00:27:40) to my parents. And then once I get their backlash, he gets my silence, and so that can be — and I feel like I really have to make a serious, conscious effort (inaudible at 00:27:52) these situations to feel like it's not good, can speak to him (inaudible at 00:27:57) don't worry about it.</p>

<p>And that — I don't know if confusing is a good word, but I feel like I tried really hard to, like, talk about my feelings more and all of those things, and then, yeah, when I practice with him then I try to practice with parents and that doesn't go well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think that that happens, that you practice with him and then want to go back to your parents? [00:28:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he's had, like a — he and I had a lot of conversations about conversations. And I think he had really helped me, like, (inaudible at 00:28:29) be honest (inaudible at 00:28:40) a decent conversation (inaudible at 00:28:41) talking. I know I have a problem initiating, so then I end up feeling like — I think part of it — well, I think my parents act a certain way. But then I think part of the reason why they have issues is that I don't say anything. So then, I'm, like, okay, well, now I'm ready to kind of, like, talk about things that upset me and, you know, all of these things that are kind of working with us. So, you know, maybe part of the reason with my parents is that, like, I never said anything, or when I did, like, it came out kind of nasty, but never like a — you know, it really bothers me or hurts my feelings when you do things like this. And so, and then I had some sort of hope that that, like, me changing my technique would be different. But it's not (inaudible at 00:29:35) my mom just doesn't speak much, but it's not with my dad. [00:29:38]</p>

<p>So yeah, I feel like I'm, like, traumatized from, like, some of their responses that I just don't — or it takes me a while to, like, recover and then kind of recognize again, like, he's (inaudible at 00:29:58) talk to you, we have good conversations most of the time. And then, you know, with your father you don't really — there's not really much hope when you're talking about that stuff, so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are traumatized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:30:16) well, like, that's a strong word, but yeah, so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels too strong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean — yeah, I feel, like, traumatized to me means, like, I don't know, completely — I don't know. I definitely think it's something that, like, sticks with me and has, like, really, like — if I'm in any sort of, like, vulnerable position, like, I'll think of, like, those conversations with, like, the negative reactions. Then I definitely think, like, kind of like, ooh (inaudible at 00:30:53) you know, back off a little bit, or do you really want to have this conversation now? Because if you are, like, upset, like — because I feel like when I leave conversations with my dad, I'm really, really upset. And I know I'm upset about or am upset about whatever we're having the conversation, but then I'm upset of how he, like, handled the conversation, or he made me feel about initiating the conversation, every other kind of low blow I guess that you threw in. So it's just too much and not worth it. [00:31:30]</p>

<p>Then I have to be, like, okay, well, you haven't had an experience like that with (inaudible at 00:31:36) so don't let that, you know, hinder you, but it still does, yeah. And I'm assuming that I am traumatized, but I don't know, felt like a very strong word. But I feel like, I don't know, I've been trying to, like, separate my parents from (inaudible at 00:32:12). I try really hard to think and, like, I feel like I've just put them out on that little island in the way we communicate, and (inaudible at 00:32:20) before, I kind of in my head felt that, like, everyone communicates with, like, them. And I feel like I've tried really hard to think that that's not the normal way to communicate, and that I need to start communicating the way — like (inaudible at 00:32:40) are thinking about, like, that's put the default type of communication should be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I'm not sure that you give the impact that your parents had on you sort of its due space, due importance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, I don't know, sometimes I do. Well, maybe this is, like, the helplessness feeling. Sometimes I do and then I'll just end up feeling like really bad, and I don't know, then (inaudible at 00:33:18) I'm sure other people have it much worse, and I probably shouldn't compare myself to other people because my issues are, like, my own thing. And then, I don't know, like sometimes I'm kind of like, this is, like, the end all be all or the whole reason why I act a certain way, and maybe it is. But then when I think about I'm, like, well, that can't be it and I feel like it's almost, like, too much credit, but I don't know if I'm — like, it upsets me that much that I feel that impacted by it, that my response is just, like, no, it can't be that. I don't know. [00:33:58]</p>

<p>But yeah, I just feel like you can't — but then I'm thinking about, no, I'm just, like, well, yeah (inaudible at 00:34:06) to, like, mid twenties, like if you constantly have conversations like that with people, you (inaudible at 00:34:15) want to think about. Or conversations where, like, emotions are at stake. One would think that that's kind of the normal way to converse or —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I even think more generally that each of your parents are really self-absorbed. They don't really think about how what they're doing has an impact on anyone, let alone their children. Then I imagine that growing up with that is upsetting, lonely, sad, infuriating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I feel like I wasn't really able to identify it that much until probably the divorce. Like, I knew that my mom was always, like, very quiet, but I don't feel like when they were together everything was status quo and so it wasn't really noticeable. And then I think — so my father will blame the divorce all the time for, like, the demise of everything, and I don't think it was the divorce that made all of these bad characteristics of them. But I think that is what made them show, and so, I don't think that I was really able to identify all of that until, like, I don't know, I was 24 or 25. And, like, I've known, like or felt in bits and pieces like my dad was kind of very self-absorbed, and, like, (inaudible at 00:35:43) like a workaholic and kind of just didn't follow through with, like, family commitments. And (inaudible at 00:35:50) it all became, like, very apparent once they got divorced, there was, like, that kind of, like, realization is very shocking. So and I feel like that's when I felt, like, lonely, but just (inaudible at 00:36:08). I feel like I just looked at them in a different light and, yeah. I feel like that's when their infantile moments really came out, so — but I forgot how we got to this part of the conversation. [00:36:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I talked about sort of giving their impact on you its due.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, so I think growing up, like, I think what I found most upsetting is, like, thinking that it was (inaudible at 00:36:45) like, I don't know. I feel like most people, like, have a happy childhood and they'll look back on it, and it's always a little bit different than you imagine. But I don't know, I just feel like I saw them in this light, and then I started to see them in, like, (inaudible at 00:36:59) that light as a kid, and I don't really know how to explain it. But I feel like the divorce bringing out all of these bad things is, like, when I start to find it upsetting, so — yeah, so I don't know what that has to do with me giving them enough credit for what they did. But (inaudible at 00:37:30) so I end up feeling really bad I guess about, like, the — with that realization and, like, how I view them going forward. Then I feel bad for feeling that, I don't know, strong feeling of disappointment or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you feel bad about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Umm, I'm not really sure. I feel like I shouldn't feel bad and then, I don't know, I feel like, I don't know, kind of like the way they communicate and everything kind of just sucks, so then I feel a little bad that I'm in that situation. And then I guess I feel helpless and that's why I get really upset. Yeah, I guess I feel more — I feel bad that they aren't able to, like, identify how their feelings impact people. And then it's like, I feel bad for me because I'm the end, like, receiving that, but then I also really feel bad because I feel like there are so many (inaudible at 00:38:56) that they can't pull their head out of their ass for lack of a better term. And I don't know, just — I don't know, and then I feel like they're both kind of like — or I can be like them in the sense where, like, if you don't hear anything everything may be fine, or like, as long as I, like, seem happy that, you know, I'm happy and they don't have to deal with any problems that may have happened in the past. [00:39:25]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:39:26) that's, you know, something, you know, to a certain degree that I have that I don't really like. I don't know if that's why I could feel so, I don't know, fixated on fixing it or, like, really working on it. Because I feel like my mom, like, went through her whole life just — I don't know. Well, she went through just never ever saying anything when anything upset her. And then I feel like my dad just can't read people at all, and, like, as long as you don't say something to him about being upset he thinks everything is fine. And when you do say something then can't talk about (inaudible at 00:40:05) yeah. And I don't know if I'm, like, when you said, like, not giving it, like, enough credit. Or if it makes me feel, like, so helpless that I just don't give it enough credit, I don't know. But I also don't like feeling like (inaudible at 00:40:30). I don't like feeling like their communication was so shitty that it just traumatized me. (inaudible at 00:40:37) I feel (inaudible at 00:40:39) I guess really helpless when I say that, so, but yeah.</p>

<p>And then I just feel, you know, bad that they didn't — I don't know, I feel like (inaudible at 00:41:00) know that I want them to raise me how I would raise a kid if I had it. But I just think, like, I don't know, why didn't you talk to your kids more? Why did you — I don't know, like my dad, like, view work as so, so important, like, beyond to make ends meet that you missed out on a lot of things for kids. Or I (inaudible at 00:41:29) I start thinking of all these things then I get really annoyed with myself for thinking about them (inaudible at 00:41:36). It doesn't really matter now and then, I don't know, but I just feel like I'm, I don't know, picking on them. I guess I feel like they did the best they could, and for me, it doesn't really feel good enough and that makes me feel a little sad. [00:41:58]</p>

<p>And then, yeah, I just have the feeling, like, I don't know, why couldn't you identify certain things? And then I end up feeling like the bad person for thinking that. So or, like, I don't know, I don't want to, like, harp on stupid things, but I don't know, just like my dad, like, constantly throws it in my face that he, like, helped me pay for school a little bit. But, like, I paid for most of my school, which fine, most people do that. But I feel like you don't have the right to, like, throw it in my face because a lot of parents help their kids with school and I don't know. And then I start to get, like (inaudible at 00:42:50) well, why is driving the nicest car ever more important to you than, like, helping your kid go to school? And it's, like, stupid stuff like that that I think of all the time, but that I find, like, annoying. And I feel like, I don't really feel annoyed with it until you start to throw it in my face because I feel like you don't really have a right to. I don't know, like, it's just like a certain aspect of that type of personality or something that just doesn't really sit well with me. And I don't like — it's, like, you can tell them that you may feel bad about something, and he comes back with, like, well, you should be grateful for xyz. And then I think in my head, like, okay, well, why weren't you less selfish and I don't know, it really turns to finger pointing, but I (inaudible at 00:43:51).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very painful realization to feel that — to see that people do the best they can but it wasn't good enough because then there's no blame. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it's one of the things, there's no blame. You're not to blame, but you're not to blame, no one's to blame.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They couldn't do any better, but you can't — it doesn't change what you need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, and then — yeah, I just feel really bad because yeah, I guess my needs weren't met and I don't know. And then I feel like I shouldn't have the right to be upset with them because they did the best they could. But I feel like, like with my dad, like, he's not humble about it and maybe that's the best way to explain it. He doesn't — I don't know. Like, any — like, we had, like, a huge falling out on my birthday, like, I think it was my 26<sup>th</sup> birthday. And basically, I ended up telling him what I needed and then he just got real angry and somehow it was turned around on me. And then it was just basically, don't ever tell me or talk to me when you're upset again because I don't want to hear about it. So that was very upsetting and then (inaudible at 00:45:32) know where I was going with this, but there's just like this, like, so I know that he did the best that he could, but I feel like things — like, we're both two adults now. We should be able to converse and if I — I don't know, he just doesn't care what anyone else feels and that bothers me. [00:45:50]</p>

<p>And I feel like I kind of relate those two things and maybe that's not good thinking about it now. Like, so I tend to relate his, like, jerk like tendencies to, like, him being a better parent in ways that I, now that I think about it, really don't think that he could have done growing up. So I feel like him doing the best that he could as a parent, growing up, like, maybe he didn't know any better. But I feel like now that we should be able to talk about what we need or how someone feels that he is just — he will — not only will he just not talk about it, but he'll be nasty to you too. So I think that's where the problem comes in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean to interrupt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we are going to need to stop for today. [00:46:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:46:57).</p>

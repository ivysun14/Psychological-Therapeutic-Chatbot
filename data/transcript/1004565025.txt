<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm very glad that I have this appointment today because I'm just going to be crying the whole time, so I hope we're [going to ] (inaudible at 00:00:24) I went to this graduation. I'm just going to get ready. It hurts and everything so I'm just trying to calm down for a second. We had both our parents in town and I'd been planning this party for months. We take out a certain amount of money for our budget each week and I've been putting $20 away a week for three months or something like that because I knew it was going to be a big expense. I didn't want to tell Chris that but I told him [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:16) weeks ago for some reason. I spent all Friday running errands for it and then I spent all day Saturday cooking all day. We had stayed up til four in the morning. I woke up at eight and was getting stuff ready, cooking all day. The day before on Friday he texts me, "I'm so stressed." I was saying, "About what?" He was like, "Oh, it's so stressful having everybody here." I said ["You, Chris, are stressed out.] (inaudible at 00:02:01) Everyone's here to celebrate you. People know that you're being pulled in . . . " His best friend is also in town from Phoenix. We through the whole party and it's fine. I thought it went great, actually. Everyone had a great time and I gave a little toast that I couldn't get out all the way. Cried a little bit. Chris gave a toast where he thanked everybody, and then we had graduation yesterday. His parents and my parents came and then we brought his parents to the train. We took [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:41) and I was just asking, "What did you think of the party?" "It was fine. It was better towards the end." I was like, "What do you mean?" "Well, you know, in the beginning I was really stressed and it was really stressful for me," and I know it's a valid thing. It was stressful for him, but all I wanted was for him to say "thank you". I know he's not a guy who does big parties and a lot of this was for me and his parents, but all I wanted was "thank you". [00:03:26] So it was a lot of that. And it was like, "Oh, my God. This week has just been so stressful." Complaint after complaint. As soon as graduation was over and we're all eating there were snacks in our kitchen area after graduation. It was like a complaint as soon as he got done it was like "Oh, my God. That was terrible." It was like this was such a big day we should be so happy. I know that it's his graduation and I know it's his accomplishment. We go home, just the two of us, we're hanging out and it's nice and we go to meet up with Emma and Jay and Rory his friend from LA, and we have some drinks and we're at a bar having drinks with everybody. We're trying to decide what the next move is and everyone says for cost's sake we should either go back to our house or their hose and just order some pizzas. I was saying I've got three open bottles of wine at my house we're not going to get through, so everybody came over to my house. It would help me and save us money because we wouldn't have to buy any beer or wine or anything to have it at my house. Emma and I were talking it over and she said, "Well, if you come to my house, I can just drive you home." I was saying, "You're not going to want to do that. This has happened before. What's going to happen is it's going to get too late, you're going to be tired, you're going to have been drinking, and I don't want you driving me home when you've been drinking. It's just not going to happen. I going to end up sleeping on your couch and I don't want to do that." [00:05:14] She was like, "Okay, I get that." Basically we both just want to go to our own houses right now. She's like, "Yeah, totally," and so Chris, who was just sitting in the long line, Chris was next to me and turns to me and says, "So, what do you guys want to do?" and we kind of go over the same thing and he says, "Well, I think it makes more sense to go to Jay and Emma's," and I said, "That's fine if that happens, and I'm just going to go home." He turns down the line and he's like, "Ughh," and rolls his eyes and he's like, "Jen's saying if we go to Jay and Emma's, she's going to go home." I was so embarrassed that he would say that to his friends in that way, just because [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:00) just not putting myself into situations that don't work for me. I'm saying to you right now that I have to get up in the morning for work. I don't know why it's just that big of a deal. Why can't I just go home if I want to go home? I don't know why that's a problem. I'm not saying everyone has to come to my house. I'm not dictating for the group. I'm just saying that for me, this is what I need. I was so embarrassed that I started crying at the bar and I had to excuse myself and go to the bathroom and compose myself for a minute. I come back out and Chris is still pissed at me and everyone is awkward. Emma's gotten up and she's talking to Jay and she's like, "Oh, what kind of pizza would you want?" They know I'm upset and I just feel so awkward and it's like I have to leave now because my mood is affecting the group and that's not fair. [00:06:58] Everybody gets up to leave and I hug Emma and I'm like, "I'm just going to go, guys. I'll see everybody later." I walk away and mostly just said goodbye to Emma. I walk away and he, Chris, gets super pissed and just follows me and starts yelling at me in the street. I was so mortified and I said, "Why are you following me right now?" and he starts yelling at me like, "You're making such a big deal about this." I was like, "This is so embarrassing. I'm so embarrassed right now my skin is crawling. I can't handle this. You have to go away from me. You have to go away. This is so embarrassing." He keeps following me and following me and it's just escalating. At this point we're just screaming at each other in the street and I called him a f**king psycho and told him to leave me alone and he follows me all the way from the middle of the street to the Center, which is a long time when you're in an argument with somebody. [00:07:57] And all I'm saying is, "You need to go away. You need to go away. You need to leave me alone," because in those situations I feel so attacked. I feel like a caged animal. I can't escape the situation and it makes me panic. All I do is lose my mind. I can't handle it. It makes me want to start screaming at the top of my lungs. I told him I was going to. I was like, "You have to leave right now because I'm going to start screaming bloody murder if you do not leave." He was like, "Do it. Go ahead. Just go ahead and do it." And I was like, "No, because what's going to happen is the cops are going to get called and that's going to look awesome for you going in right now and trying to pass the bar because this is going to be a domestic situation. This is not what either of us need, so you need to go away because I could die right now. This is too much for me." And he's calling me a loser and an idiot and he's just calling me all these names and I was just balling and crying on the street, so embarrassed. [00:09:04] That's what he does. He won't leave me alone. Sometimes I just need to be left alone and I don't know how to make him do it. He kept saying, "No, there's no point. I don't even know where they are anymore." I said, "Yes, you do. They went to Dunkin Donuts. Just go there. Just go there." I just kept saying it over and over. "They're at Dunkin Donuts. Just go. You have to go," and he just won't. I just quickly changed directions that I was going and he would be there right behind me. I don't know what that is. It feels abusive. I feel like I'm being tortured. [00:10:06] Now I feel wrong. I feel like I did something. It was so embarrassing in front of all of our friends and made a fool of myself. I cried at a bar. I'm just so embarrassed. I got home at 7:30 and I was like, "I can't even be awake right now. I'm just going to sit here and think about what a fool I was," so I went to bed at 7:30 which I don't think I've gone to bed at 7:30 ever in my life. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel like his behavior reflected on you? 00:10:59</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well â€” reflected on me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah - the idea that he's sort of out of control and you feel embarrassed. I'm just trying to understand the connection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was really embarrassed to be in a fight in public. That is totally unacceptable to me. That makes me feel so embarrassed that behavior gets that far out of control and I can't handle that. I don't like it and so for me, if I ever feel out of control in my behavior, I just remove myself from the situation. When he doesn't let me do that, I literally shut down. There are not even thoughts going on in my head anymore. It's just like, "Go. Go. Go. Go," is all that I hear in my head. I was embarrassed in front of our friends. I felt like I was kind of throwing a temper tantrum. I felt like that's what it was being portrayed as, like, "Oh, if Jen doesn't get her way she's just going to go home and pout." That's not what I was trying to say at all, but he just steamrolls me. What he was saying was, "They asked me what you said and so I just told them what you said." [00:12:33] I was like, "No, that's not exactly what you did. What you did was you mocked me. You made it sound like I was . . I don't know." So now I feel like I was wrong and I feel like I just need to . . I don't know. I was in a bad mood. I was trying to be in a good mood, like I had been crying all morning. It's graduation. I was really emotional. For me, I'm really sentimental over those things and so I get really worked up. I was just very emotional that morning and then I felt really disappointed that he didn't seem very happy with his party and very happy with his â€” this is so stupid â€” but I kind of like expected him to say something with his friends, because I brought out an ice cream cake for him. It was another surprise at the graduation party, and so we sang (chuckling) "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow." It was really dorky, and then his friends said "Speech. Speech," and he started to give a little speech. I expected at some point for him to say like, "And to Jen who . . . " just something to me, but there wasn't. 00:13:37</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You supported him throughout all of law school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something like that. Or even like a card at some point. I know that's stupid and that was him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If we could go back to "I know that was stupid."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's his accomplishment. We are all here . . . (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is his accomplishment, but it's like yours, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum. (pause) It just felt like I really, really wanted this weekend to be perfect and I want everybody to be celebrating him and all he did because I think it's amazing. I feel a little bit silly asking for him to recognize me, but I do want it and it hurts my feelings when it's like, "This was so stressful." It's like, "All right, I'm sorry." Not only am I not getting any thanks, I kind of feel like why did you even do this? You just stressed him out. What he would say is like, "I didn't even want that party. You want me to thank you for something that I didn't want?" and it's true. 00:16:14</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I missed the timeline. Was this last night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The party was Saturday and yesterday was graduation and going then out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this was just last night that this happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He stayed out over at our friend's house. It's like I wanted to go hang out with everybody. It's not fun for me. I don't want to go home by myself while you guys all go have fun. Of course I'd rather go hang out with everybody and have a great time. I would love to do that, but I have work in the morning. So for me, this makes the most sense. [00:16:56] I just feel like such an idiot. I made a fool of myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I still don't quite understand that piece.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was emotional and it's embarrassing. I'm sure it looks like I just threw a temper tantrum and left, you know? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like it looked like the two of you were fighting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but that's really embarrassing, too. 00:17:56</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perhaps, but it's different than the idea that everyone's fine but you're throwing a temper tantrum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because then he goes back and he spends the whole night hanging out with everybody and he's in a great mood and he's fine, and then I go home by myself. (pause) I'm just so upset and I'm so mad. (pause) I'm so mad about the way he behaved when we were out. Afterwards when I was trying to go to the train, that is so unacceptable to me and I don't know . . . that's happened before. He's done that before. It's so not okay on so many levels to me. I don't ever feel okay with that. I don't think that . . like if we were just dating, I would break up with him immediately. (pause) I just feel sick to my stomach. Emma called this morning because I texted her. She has a crock pot at my house and I said, "Do you want me to leave the door unlocked because you need to come get your crock pot?" She called me back and she said, "Oh, my God. We stayed up until 4:30 in the morning having so much fun," and going on. It just felt like . . "That's great for you." It was this complaint like, "Oh, my God. I'm driving to work now. I'm already an hour late. Oh, my God. This is so terrible." I'm so glad you all stayed up until 4:30 in the morning having so much fun together and I went home and went to bed at 7:30. (pause) [00:21:03] (sighs) I just don't want to see him. I don't want to go home tonight and have this conversation. I don't want to deal with this. But at the same time all I want to do - I have these two hugely conflicting â€” all I want to do is talk to him but I also don't want to see him at all. It's like I don't know if I'm stronger. I just feel steamrolled in these situations. It's like everything I say is stupid. He has this way of saying it to me like whatever I'm saying is small. "I just said to them . . they asked me what you said so I told them what you said." "Well, that sounds fine â€” the way you're saying it right now â€” but that's not what happened and that's not what I feel like happened, and even if I feel like you said it in a different way, you should say you're sorry to me because I'm so upset right now. Just say sorry because it hurt my feelings." Is that ridiculous? Is that a totally ridiculous thing to say? 00:23:01</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is that ridiculous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's saying, "I'm sorry that you're upset about that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he think that screaming â€” you know you can talk to him, but it sounds like this has happened in the past â€” does he justify this behavior or does he feel there is something wrong with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, he'll apologize to me today about doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he feel like he needs help because it's a problem that his temper gets out of control? 00:23:38</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. He better. If he doesn't think that, then that's an even bigger problem. He knows he has a temper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not telling you something that you don't already know, but screaming at you in the street and calling you names and being out of control is not okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's absolutely not okay. I didn't ever think that I would be in a marriage like that. I never thought that I would be in a marriage where somebody would chase me down the street screaming at me, and I yelled in part, "You're acting like a f**king psycho." I never thought that I would do that. Ever. And then to be called an idiot and a loser. That's really sweet, honey. Thank you. Thank you so much. Those are two things I've really (chuckles) so much bound to my self-esteem â€” those two issues. (pause) It's like if he could have just said he was sorry at the bar then I could have just gone on. I didn't say goodbye to [Rory], (sp?) our friend who is in from Phoenix, who we are going to go stay with in a couple months when we're visiting him. I didn't say goodbye to my friends. You could have just said you were sorry. If I could have just not cried about it at the bar like a loser.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel there is truth in what he said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum. (pause) It makes me so sick. He's never called me names like that before. (pause) I know that if he just didn't follow me, if he just went with everybody I would have something to apologize for today because I would have been the one who stormed off. That's fine. I would [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:20) but like now it's like this huge thing that happened and now, to me, his graduating law school is ruined. It's tainted with this mark of ugliness. That really upsets me, too. (long pause) I just don't know what I'm to even say to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you like to say to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That that is just totally unacceptable behavior to me and it just can't happen. I don't know why he thinks it's okay. [00:29:04] And that he really hurt my feelings. My feelings are just hurt. I feel like that was borderline abuse. (pause) I don't know why me leaving is so upsetting. I don't get that. I don't get it at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean your leaving when you wanted to? You didn't want to stay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't want to stay. Well, I didn't want to go to Emma and Jay's to order a pizza and have beer because I knew I would end up having to spend the night on their couch. I didn't want to do that. I don't know why that's not okay, first of all. And then I don't know why it's not okay for me to leave when I'm upset and feeling emotional. I don't know why that's not okay either. 00:30:54</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are good questions. There was a long setup about why you didn't feel like staying, or the justification for you not staying, as if you needed that, or "I'm tired. I want to go."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's how it works. You have to have all your points in line. (sighs) Got to build your case. I mean, maybe I was being a brat. Maybe I was like, "Well, everyone just needs to come to my house." Maybe I was being a brat about it, and I'm not remembering clearly. Maybe they saw it differently than I saw it. I just don't know what to say to him right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I get that, but I also hear that you have a clear image of what you want to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but â€” this is I guess what we talked about last week â€” now what? Now what, moving forward? I don't want him to just say, "I'm sorry." I want him to say, "I'm sorry. I'm going to change that. That's not going to happen again." That's what I want him to say. And I want to see him make attempts to change that. 00:33:30</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel that's reasonable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like what's he going to do â€” buy a self-help book?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go to therapy himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That got me into enough trouble [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:51)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that always gets brought up and it's like something I made him do and ughh. It came up on the bar application and it was a whole big thing when it came up on the bar application and people are going to know his business and blah, blah, blah. I know that you shouldn't want to change solely because of another person, but he was a big factor in why I started coming here, because I didn't feel like it was fair to be the person who needed to do a lot of work on themselves and to try hard and be better. It's like, well, this isn't fair to him, and I don't necessarily need it. I do. I want him to do that for me. I want him to say, "This affects our marriage. This affects our relationship and so I need to work on this and I need to</p>

<p>change it, not only for myself, but for us." That's what I want him to do. 00:35:13</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can certainly communicate how serious this is for you. I mean I thought it was striking when you said, "If we were dating, this would have been forget it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it would have been over. Over. Because all I see is . . any second he's going to grab me and I know he's never touched me ever - and I don't think he will - but it's how I feel in the moment. Like I feel . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel unsafe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel absolutely unsafe. Honestly, the thought of him hitting me isn't that scary. It's the thought of the person that would make him. This is really stupid. I just feel kind of numb sometimes to physical stuff like that. It would just mean that he is this person, and that would be worse than anything else. Again, he's never touched me and I don't believe that he would, in those moments he feels like that disgusting person and I don't want to be married to a person like that. (pause) I can't even believe I'm having a conversation about my marriage that involves me feeling like - this is even being talked about. 00:37:26</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What can't you believe about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like â€” it's disgusting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's disgusting about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of it. Like I'm disgusted with him. I'm disgusted with myself. I feel like if I could just handle this better, if I could have just stopped walking and calmly . . if I could have just explained myself like I'm explaining myself to you right now . . if I could have just stopped and said, "I just want to go home. Why is that a problem?" then it wouldn't have needed to escalate in that way. I feel like a cheesy stereotype. I feel like I'm almost saying these things because I'm wrong. And if - would I feel that way if I didn't have an abusive dad? None of this would have happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean "none of it?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I wouldn't get panicked like that, first of all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I disagree with you. I think if you didn't have an abusive dad you'd be less tolerant. 00:38:53</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like if I didn't have an abusive dad I'd be like him hitting me would even come into my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think that's true, actually. I think anyone next to someone very out of control and someone who is stronger than you, I think it if we did that, absolutely. I do believe that actually the opposite of what you think would be true. I think you'd be less tolerant â€” not more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is also like "blech".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that sound like to you? Where does that go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I try to think of my friends and I try to put them into the position I was in. I try to think how would that happen with them? Because I think, like, they don't have fights like that with their husbands. There must be something they do differently. I react that escalates the situation. I start to feel like â€” I can hear how stupid that sounds, trust me. I'm aware of how stupid that sounds, but I just feel like there's something in our dynamic that makes that awful, and that if he was with somebody else it wouldn't be like that. 00:40:49</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You described him as getting into bar fights before, and somehow you have this fantasy that you just . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the other two friends that we were with last night were right alongside him. The crime that he was charged with, his buddy was actually the one who did it, and they never have fights with their girlfriends or wives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I can come up with a lot of counter-arguments, but I guess the main point is that you feel that somehow you're eliciting this â€” that this is somehow your fault.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet I'm fully aware that's what women who have husbands who beat them say, which is why I sound so corny when I say it. (pause) [00:42:04] I just don't even want to deal with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I certainly understand why you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't want to be told that I'm wrong, either. I don't want to get home tonight and have this conversation and have him tell me how wrong I am. I don't want to have another fight. I don't want to scream at each other. I don't want to do any of this. I don't want to do any of it. I don't want to go home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel a [lot of doubt inside]? (inaudible at 00:42:57) Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we're still mad at each other, at least I'm really mad. When I'm really mad, I start to yell or start crying. Then he is like, "Oh, here she goes again." I know that everything I say he'll have a response back for. I know how that will make me feel and I just don't want to deal with it. To me this is bigger than just what happened yesterday. For me this is the whole weekend. For me, my feelings are hurt from when we were at the party. My feelings are hurt because I don't feel like I was acknowledged at all this weekend. My feelings were hurt because you kind of made fun of me to your friends at the bar when I said I wanted to go home. I don't know what's wrong with that. To me, I have a list of things and I'm sure he's got a list of things. I'm sure he's got a list of things like, "I thanked you. I thanked you a ton of times. I told you that you did great." And he'll say, "I didn't even want the party," and he'll have a whole list of things. About making fun of me in front of our friends he'll say, "Ah, it's what you said. I just told them what you said." 00:44:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most of these are not convincing arguments. It's very similar, actually, like being at a dinner party and saying to your spouse, "I kind of want to go," and the spouse says, "Well, she wants to go." Those things are private. They're not public discussions. If they were public you would have said it to the table. There are boundaries there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's what it was. That was a private remark just for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A private remark. He doesn't tell his friends everything you tell him and vice versa. There's privacy there. We need to stop. Feel free to call me if you need to. Next Monday I'm not in the office. Do you want to just meet next Wednesday. Do you want to see about a different time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we can leave it as Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me know. Let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'll see you Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Bye bye.</p>

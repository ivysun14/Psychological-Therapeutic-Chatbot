<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the only person that I did say that was famous - and I don't know if you watch Highjacked [when they] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you watch from the beginning though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it was on the first season.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, I think the first season was the only one that I really did watch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It might (inaudible at 00:14). He's...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...got a lot of makeup on. Blond hair, like, short. I guess long for a guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is he skinny? All right (inaudible at 00:24.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so, uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was up here for it. I don't know why. (Laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's the makeup version, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...for clothes that are cute.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess I can ask you, how did it feel walking in with all these people here, with that? Is that never something that gets you anxious? Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was fine. Actually at first I was just, like - I was not sure if I was going to be able to walk past them. But then I saw people coming. But it was fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean physic - like they would not let you in or something? Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was, like, "Oh, God. I'm going to have to ask them, like, if I can walk past." Like, I don't know. I was going to go around, like on the other side of the street. And I saw, like, other people walking through. I don't know if they were a part of them. But I was, like, "That worked - going through." But...[0:01:09.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. And what if you had to ask somebody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it would have been fine, yeah. Because I was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...more concerned with being late. So I was just, like, going right there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's interesting. When you really are aware of your goal—which is to get into therapy...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your uncomfortableness is - comes second.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel, like, depend - but I feel like it's now - because I am - sometimes I am aware of where I have to be, and I allow it, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever had that happen before, that you have made yourself wait because of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...or - you know what I mean, just something important because you were uncomfortable and didn't want to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it's happened many times at school. But it's more where I start to feel the anxiety. So that I, like, will be in my apartment and I'll, like, stop getting ready or something. And then, like - you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's kind of - in your attempt to control your anxiety, and you take a little break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's okay, because you still...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...get somewhere in the end, right? [0:02:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But - I think it's all - like, I don't know. Since I was already coming here I was walking. I was, like, speed walking, so it was just like, "All right, let's go. Let's go. The door is right there."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it seems - I mean, especially when we were doing the same (ph) effects on the street, it seems like when you know you can just get it over with you will go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But when there is the idea of a prolonged uncomfortable feeling, that - that's when it kind of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...more of a block.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I guess I can't really - not escape, because I guess I have already been through. But, like, yeah, I can't get away; I can't avoid it. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know that you can, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There are always...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I always - like, I have done it so many times before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's - I think it's about not wanting to let other people down...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...or be judged by others because you are escaping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a teacher, if you needed to leave a class.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel more, like, bad of what they are going to say than really what - how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay. [0:03:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can deal with that. But I guess one situation where you would have to stay a long time would be - but we don't have to. But it would be ideal if there would be a date.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how to back out on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Relaxed (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...very - we didn't - no. We didn't - I was all - well - plans got switched. And my roommate's boyfriend - so we all started talking. And a bunch of us were gonna go out—pretty much me and them too and their friends, their guy friends that live in Woodside. We were going to go to a bar. So maybe, like, 45 minutes before, my roommate's boyfriend calls me and tells me nobody has the money. Like, I don't know if you have seen why; because we always say, like, "Oh, I don't want to go out. I don't want to spend money on drinks." Like, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Since it's expensive. So he's, like, "Oh, we are gonna go to Brendan's cousin, who just got an apartment."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "His apartment's - Brendan said you are more than welcome to come." And I just - I guess I did. I kind of - I decided to go to my brother's instead of that. [0:04:01.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To watch the game?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to watch the game. And I kind of at that point wanted - like, I was all ready to go to the bar. And I guess it was fine, because my roommate's boyfriend was going to be there and not one - and other people that I knew, so I wasn't really as nervous as if it was just us two. I mean not wicked (ph), but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it didn't end up happening. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well why - what happened that you didn't want to? Is sitting in an apartment more anxiety provoking than being in a bar?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I guess it was kind of - I didn't feel comfort - not - I guess I had hung out with his cousin before. But, like, his cousin and his friends I don't really know very well. So I was just kind of, like, "Oh, I'll go to my brother's."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there any other girls with you there, or it would just be you, pretty much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It would just be me. And that's - too, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I mean I can understand that a little bit. Had it just been you and—what's his name, Brendan...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Brendan.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...at the bar, would you have been able to go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - because it kind, like, all changed into all of us. So I didn't really get the chance to - I don't know...[0:05:06.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not - that's your homework, to not chicken out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...think about that. Yeah. Because I was getting ready, and I was fine. And I was like, "Oh, okay, Like, tell Christy I went out, but with everyone." (Laughs) And then it - that didn't even happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that didn't happen. So some of the things don't pan out. Did you manage to get out at all? I guess you saw your brother that night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it just you and your brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We just hung out at his apartment and watched the game. The next night we watched the game again—me, my roommate, her boyfriend—and then we were supposed to go out and then sat down and watched the game and it was on until, like, after 12.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then we ended up going out and meeting up with a few - two of our guy friends who - it was late by then now, so they were leaving. So we went a different place with them for, like, an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. In Joliet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Chicago, actually. We came all the way into the city and - to to meet up with my roommate's coworkers, too. So it was, like...[0:06:01.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, with all the Desert Sun (ph) girls.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it ended up being, like, one girl. And then they have guys working there. So there was one of the guys, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was he cute?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't know. I don't even think I was, like, near him, so - [I don't know] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean you weren't near him? Didn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I don't remember, like, what he looked like. Or - I think I was talking to my friends, probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So how do you feel about working towards going out with Brendan, though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't know. Like, I don't want to, like, plan, like, a date or anything. I just kind of, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the - what would be so bad on planning a date?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because then I'd feel like - I don't know. I guess [I'd owe you] (ph) - about a lot of snow if we really do like each other. And I don't want things to be weird, I guess? Like - I mean weird?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean if it didn't work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like, afterwards. Because we - oh, it's always us four—like me and my roommate and him and my roommate's boyfriend. And, like, it's weird already. Because, like, we know that he likes me, so...[0:07:10.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does everyone know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's kind of weird already.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why would it make anything weirder if that - you know what I mean? Like, would that really affect anything? Everybody already knows.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't - I guess - yeah. Because - I guess it wouldn't too much. Because I mean it's not like either one of us would hate the other one or anything. But I don't know. I don't know how that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you wouldn't have to call it a date, but it just could be a time that you guys get to hang out really on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And talk and see...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's been, like, two years or something, and it's never happened. So I feel like I don't know how that would start or what he...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like he has some social anxiety. Because it sounds like he probably would have asked you out if he...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, he has hinted to things. My roommate has hinted to things. But, like, he is so much, like - he will not, like - I know he won't ask me. And so my roommate is always, like, "You know you have to be the one to, like, you know, ask him," or whatever. But...[0:08:03.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the problem with that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well why can't he ask me? No. I don't - I just - I guess I sit and wait for men to, even though I kind of know he's not. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think there is something wrong with a girl who asks a guy out or anything like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever done it, or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. But I don't think - I mean there's nothing wrong with it. I don't care. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would be wrong with you doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I would say or what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean now, with text messaging, you could be totally avoidant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or e-mail. You know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what to - like, what I'd really tell you what I'd do, what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I mean there's more Cubs and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's still a few more Cubs games.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And then you could always do something - I mean I think it would be a good exercise for you to actually - you don't have to be, like, "Do you want to go out, just me and you?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you just wanted to say, "Do you want to go watch the baseball game with me on this day?" You could even say, "Come over and watch the baseball game." [0:09:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. That's a little easier.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it could - it probably would be just a little easier if your roommate's always at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if he brings somebody, he brings somebody. And if he doesn't, he doesn't. But at least you didn't [need to stop and tell him] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Reach out to him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that's a good idea to kind of break the ice. Like, "Do you want to come watch the game?" instead of - because we really don't - never - hung out, like, just us two, I feel like the past year. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well what would prevent you from doing that? When it comes down to just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I started feeling nervous, I guess. I guess I would be thinking of the actual day; that would prevent me of actually asking—just thinking of being - hanging out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when's the next game?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think - well, look it up. And I think - okay, wait. So I see you on Friday, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So by Friday, your homework is to have text him and asked him...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [0:10:02.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...to come over on a day when there's a game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'm, like - I'm trying to think of when the next game is. It's probably, like, so soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's probably, like Saturday - Friday or Saturday, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um - oh actually I'm leaving Saturday. I guess I'll be here Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm leaving Saturday...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, to go to Joliet. But I don't know if I am going to anymore because I have something to do for school. So I may not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So to go home. You were gonna...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to go visit because my dad is going away. So he's going to go spend the weekend with my mom. But I don't think I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So no excuses there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there should be at least a game Friday, Saturday or Sunday—right?—that you can do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm thinking if there is one sooner—I mean tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there one? Would you want to do it tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I don't think I'd be able to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you can be relaxed because it would be a weekday. It would be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be if it was tomorrow. It might be during a night of class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm not sure. Today I have an AFE exam. [0:11:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that? What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's proficiency exam to make sure everyone is at a certain level before you get past a certain amount of credits.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they can transfer students from everywhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, from other universities. Are you nervous for it? Or do you think it's going to be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is it really just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really just - because I had an ethology exam, one of two exams all semester; that's her only thing she gives us to grade us on. I had that yesterday. I was kind of nervous for that one. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it went well, I guess. I'm just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does your anxiety affect your schoolwork anymore? You said not really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I - actually I have - I'm a lot better at not letting it. I think I used to allow it to. I'm more - like, now I'm - like, I don't know. I feel like back then I used to be, like, "Oh, well. If I don't take this exam - or if I don't, you know, take this class this semester, that's fine," or something. Like, I used to kind of rationalize it in my head and be, like, "You can avoid this." And now it's more like - I guess I put school as, like, something, like, I try not to allow myself to ever—even if I have anxiety—like, back out. And that's helped, because I don't really have anxiety. [0:12:12.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And aren't relationships just as important as...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel, like, more important actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's - the personal (ph) agents. Yeah. They are...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They are more important than that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I - but they are...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you tell yourself that they are not as important. You are saying it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess - because school it's, like, your grade is on paper. This is your - I guess it's, like, a record and, like, you have a - like, a certain time period I guess. I feel like I want to get it done in - at this age because otherwise I don't think I will. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Relationships, I'm, like, I have...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well some people could do the same thing, you know. Like, that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that you should have a boyfriend—or at least a serious boyfriend—that, you know, throughout college or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I don't know that that's necessarily true. And some people don't have that, you know, and they are fine. But...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it's a good time to experiment and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...see what you like and, you know, figure out - before you get older, when you are actually going to be looking for marriage or - you know. [0:13:04.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's funny, because my parents are - like, they push me and my two older brothers. Like, "Just date someone. Here! Here's someone." Because none of us are real - well my oldest brother, he had serious relationships. But he just got out of a five-year. And he's, like, 29. So he's - was very destroyed. But since he's been better they are always, like, "None of you..." My other brother, never in a relationship. You know, like, "None of you ever have relationships." So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think what's interesting about you and your anxiety that you feel is, if you were - I think any person who is - how do you think any person would feel just texting a guy that they like to go out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess nervous. Like, I was talking about it in my Psych class yesterday. I just have - about dating. It's the same at any age and whatnot. And, like, you just get that nervous feeling. And it was, like, "Well I guess that's what I feel, like the same exact thing." [0:14:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet you feel it and attribute it to the ultra-anxiety...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that you have. And I think that's the problem, is that everybody experiences a certain level of discomfort.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I wouldn't want to call it "anxiety." But, you know, that feeling of butterflies on top of, "Well that's..." - of, like, "Crap, like, do I really want to do this?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And everybody feels that. But when you feel it, you take it as a trigger that something is going wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And other people have said, "Oh, I must be really excited," or, "This is going to be really fun. I feel excited." But you mean it as, "Shit, am I [ever wrong] (ph)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't think it's always that level of anxiety that you are feeling. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I - yeah. Because I think sometimes - and it seemed like the same situation, and I can be fine. And then sometimes I'll have anxiety, because I just don't - because it is somehow...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's how you think of - it's how you think about your anxiety. And you let yourself think, "Oh my God, it's getting out of control. I'm going to throw up. I can't handle this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in school you have been able to master it in a way, say, "This is anxiety - like, this is a little bit of nerves." [0:15:01.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Everybody feels that before a test. I know I can get through it. I've gone through it a thousand times. This is just what I feel before a test. It's normal."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just completely switched around in school, because I used to - like how I have social anxiety, I used to have that with school. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what can you do - what can you think to change it around for, you know, dating and - I mean this is just sending a text message. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, this isn't even the hard part. And you know him very well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess because of when I think of sending the text message, then I'm, like, "I have to go." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I have to. And then I'm, like - because for me it's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is that with a test. When you are studying for a test, you know, you have to take the test.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it - I don't feel as much pressure until the big day of the test. I guess that's the difference. I feel like when I - like, if I texted him, until that day I would feel like - I would be thinking about, like, whenever we are going to hang out. Like, I would be nervous, like, "Oh, no." Like - going to see him. Gonna...[0:16:01.0]</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what can you tell yourself to turn that into just a healthy level of normal nervousness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to think of what, like, you know, with school. But I - you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, what I would do with it - huh. What do you - but what do you do for school? What do you say? Do you put it, like, "I don't - I'm not going to worry about that until later." Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind - I don't know. I feel like I am just, like, "Get over it," like, to myself. Like, literally I just, "Oh, that's anxiety," and think, "Okay, like..." And I don't know how it got to that point where I was able to, "Oh it's anxiety, but I have to go to school." Like, whenever I am just going to school. Because, like, school, you see, is such a problem. So I don't know when the switch honestly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well what are you thinking? You're thinking in school, like, get over it? It doesn't have to...</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I go there every day like I have been going. And also if I don't go today then I know what'll happen down the line. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are thinking - so there is a couple of thoughts. It's, like, at school you have done it a thousand times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's also something like, "I can do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:17:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "I know I can do it. Get over it." Correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's pretty much. Get over it. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you know can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel strong - like, self efficacy, like that you can actually get this done. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and then there is - so maybe it's two things. It's, like, "Just over it." You know you can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is good, because it's - you know, it's like the little train. You know, like, "I think I can. I think I can." Because...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...that's really what controls it - you know, our thoughts if we think we can do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Except - unless, you know, like - you know, like, thing's are going to [masterpiece] (ph). Like, "Oh, well you couldn't do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and then the second one is that, um, "It's worth it to do so. I've really got to get this done to get - achieve my goals."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's two major thoughts. How can you apply those to, you know, a date?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I guess, like, "It's worth it." Obviously that holds meaning, too, because it can be worth it. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you not want to meet somebody special?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. Like, it's, you know, lonely. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're okay with being lonely if you can - you'd rather just be lonely than uncomfortable? [0:18:02.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I guess. I guess that's what I have chosen so far.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when you think about it, is that what you would like to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You would rather be lonely than uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd rather be with someone. But at the same time—for me—I feel like that would be a burden. I'm not - like, for me and for him. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I could - because I feel like I fight anxiety pretty much on a daily basis—sometimes that - like others. So I feel like I'd always have to be thinking over my anxiety and then be thinking of the other person. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think you'd maybe be a burden in a relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, okay. So anxiety is one portion of you. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the whole thing, is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's, like - I feel like I have anxiety so often. So even my friends deal with it, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's a part of your personality. Right? What other things do you have in your personality?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I'm nice. (Laughs) [0:19:05.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice. Would that be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well finally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Finally.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, like, you are overwhelmingly agreeable, because you don't want to rock the boat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? So you are agreeable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like the anxiety, in a way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're a snappy dresser.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) I feel that the anxiety would, like, drive someone - like, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think, then, you would drive someone away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that - but you don't think it's going to get in the way in the beginning. You think it's going to be, like, more long term, like, once you are together for awhile?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I think that it prevents me from actually getting close to a guy. I guess with friends—like female friends—it's much easier. Even male friends—because I am usually - like, I have a lot of close guy friends. But I feel like with someone that I am attracted to - I don't know. I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you see the anxiety as the whole you. I mean - let's be frank. What do guys generally look for when they are - for - in a girlfriend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess just...[0:20:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone who is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just how they - looks. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone who is pretty and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And funny. And I think that's, like, the triumvirate. You know, that's, like, the three big things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good looking, nice and funny.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't be myself because of my anxiety. Like, I feel like I am never really - like, with someone I like. Because with - I guess with other people, like, it's fine. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how is it with Brendan?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, see, it's weird. Because sometimes, like, it's completely fine, normal, and I don't feel, like, nervous around him at all. But then, like - I don't know. Other times when - like, my roommate will sometimes be, like, "Oh, you and Brendan," like, whatever. She make a comment, like, anything. And I feel, like, bad. I'll be, like, "Oh." Like, for a little while I'll be thinking, like - oh, I'll remember that he likes me. I'll remember, like - I don't know. I'll think, like - to watch how I act, or something. And yet I feel like when I'm too conscious of how I am being, like, I don't let myself be myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, Catherine, we talk about anxiety and that. If - the more exposure you have, like, the more people you talk to, the less it bothered you to do it and more stories you can run into. [0:21:05.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean - yeah. I don't think you did that homework, or you would be telling me about it. But the more stories you go into and do that, the less uncomfortable it feels. So if you want to feel comfortable with Brendan or any guy, you will be. You just have to do it and say, "Catherine, get over it. You can do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel like - the anxiety, obviously he would - he probably - I think he already knows whatever some - whatever he knows already about it. But it's obvious. So it would - I'd obviously - like, I don't know. I'd obviously have to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he already knows.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he has, obviously, his own issues.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know if he knows, like, to [me it's panic] (ph), right. Then I have to explain and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Catherine, there are people with far more severe psychological problems who marry...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and have children. And - you know, I mean everything can be a - you know, just because someone is disabled, does that mean no one is going to marry them? [0:22:04.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's got to be a huge burden on somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. And I see things like that all the time. I mean I am - I watch the news, TV. And I watch Oprah. She is, like, she's always having, like, these, you know, wonderful stories. And I'm, like, "Okay." Like, you know. Why do I feel like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you let yourself feel like this is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...there is something wrong with me when they love their life. And, like, they might have a disability or something that's worse than anxiety. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think you allow yourself to see yourself - just one component instead of having all these other things that make up you. And you say, "I am Catherine. I have anxiety."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's, like, the only thing about you that people need to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. I don't really - I guess I...</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like your day revolves around anxiety. Sometimes it happens, maybe for...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I feel like it doesn't even affect me as much. Like, as - I'll say, like, every day. Like, I feel like that's not even the case anymore. Like, that used to be maybe the case. [0:23:03.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not even every day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like I don't wake up with the feeling like I used to. Like, I am not always thinking every day of anxiety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this isn't even an everyday thing. And yet you think you would be such a burden on someone's life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like I am a burden on my own - like - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people are willing - let someone take that on if they want. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I'm afraid of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being rejected?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess that ties into the anxiety and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you never know. I think that, you know, being with someone means, obviously - ideally what I would like to see happen is you date a bunch of people and get used to doing that and get more comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because people do recover from, you know, social anxiety. People feel like, "Oh you are worried about it? So much better in school."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Always bothered how I might...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Homework.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. How people just go on dates and, like - and I'm, like, I feel like I - I mean I know it's not that I physically can't do that. But I feel like I can't do that. [0:23:57.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well that - I think - and there is two major issues, again. It's that actually going out and doing it and what's preventing you, you know, from doing that. And then the long-term emotional issue of that someone is not going to want to be with me in the future. And those are two very big issues, and we can work on them both.</p>

<p>But I think going out and doing your behavior stuff is gonna help that feeling, because you are going to see that you can change your feeling. You are going to see that you can feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That it's not going to be awful. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I just always rely on the perfect conditions, perfect night out. And if it's just not, like, the perfect night or if I am not feeling perfect, then it's a - then it's, like, if I feel any anxiety I allow it to take over and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And say, "I am such a piece of shit. I can't believe I did this again. I am so terrible."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, I just - I don't know. I feed into it, I feel, like, myself. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You let it bring you down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I - like, I feel like I realize that with school - and, like, I was able to turn it around because I was getting so angry I knew I can go to school. Like, I was in, like, honors courses in high school. And I was all of a sudden - and in my first year of college. And then all of a sudden I was like, "Really." And so...[0:25:13.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's the worst thing that could happen if you go out on a date with Brendan, just him and you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's that - it's a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess - yeah, uncomfortable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you just...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't really see anything else. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe the worst thing that could happen with him, for him to say - like after an hour, really, "Hey, I want to go."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess. Yeah. That would be very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is it the worst thing that could happen to you? Have you had worse things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah. I mean I don't know offhand. But I am sure I have had, in my life, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Worse things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you could stand it. It wouldn't be ideal. And what are the good things that are going to happen - could happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If we got along, I guess, that would be good. And I would be more comfortable in that's - kind of situation with other people. I guess...[0:26:01.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It could be you - even if you didn't, you know, have a lifelong relationship, you know, it could make you feel more comfortable in meeting other people and hanging out with other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And being more confident in yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's really important that when you feel this anxiety, you know, to just say, "Okay, I feel a little nervous."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't make an attribution about it. I think that's the problem. Say you're a little nervous. "Oh shit, I must be having, like, anxiety, and now I..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "...can't do what I was going to do because I'm going to feel sick. And now I have to think about it [all week] (ph)." Say, "I am feeling a little nervous," and push it away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I don't need to think about this. I'll think about it when the time comes."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and not obsess over it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you sent him a text? Something like, "Do you know when the next Cubs game is?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll text him later and ask him out. "I thought it would be fun."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I want to text him during the day, like, early. I'll text him later. [0:27:02.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, Catherine. This is what we need to do. Because he could have plans. And I think you would be pretty bummed if he started, like, all of a sudden dating somebody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs). Yeah, but I would be bummed because I didn't know if, like, anything could - it wouldn't have been, like, "I really like you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. But it's, like, you never knew - you know, you didn't put any effort that you could have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would be so wrong now just saying, "Oh hi. Do you know when the next game is? Do you want to watch it together?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'd rather just text him later or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, but are you going to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah? I'll show up!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll show you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll show me the text sometime?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to think of - I can delete all of my other ones just because my inbox gets full in, like, a second. (Laughs). I will show you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I would try to - like, I don't know about - I'm try...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I feel like whenever you say you want to delay it and you kind of rationalize it yourself—"Oh, it's because I'm going to do it later."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you really think that you are going to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't think that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want to tell you I don't want you doing it the day of. I want you doing it, like, today. [0:28:00.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I think I will do, like, when I get out of my exam or something. But I'm more nervous, still, about just hang - like, asking him, "Oh, do you want to come see a game?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well he might ask you. I mean, you are kind putting out the girly signals. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That - sure. I guess if I text him he will be, like, "Wow!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean and even if he doesn't now, you know what to do because you know that he is pretty shy and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...socially inept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh I don't - I probably shouldn't feel, like, shy around him because he feels the same way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You are the competent one in this situation. Can that give you confidence?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could pretend, maybe, that it will give me confidence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think half of confidence is acting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are playing a role.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And eventually that role will become you, you know, if you want it to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. You know, I think most people act...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think if you ask...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...out their confidence more than naturally, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Most people, I think, will walk into a room and say, "Crap, everybody here looks really nice. Did I dress as nice as...?" Okay. "Hi everyone. Hi," you know. [0:29:02.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they put on their brave face and do it. Can you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, yeah. I always feel - like, I'm always, like, "Why can't I do that?" like, when I see, like, you know, people like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just - you have to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm holding myself. Oh yeah, just stopping myself I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I always see people like that. Not that I idolize them. But, like, people who are - just walk in a room, and they don't care. Like, even nasty people who everyone knows they are nasty, but they don't care. And I'm, like, "How do you do that? Not that I want to be nasty like you. But, you know, like - I don't know. Like, no one likes you and you still do your thing, and you still are you." Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's something that you can work towards. But you gotta say, "Okay, I feel a little nervous."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hum.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that's your key to put on your acting—on your mean girl acting brief (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I should try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just think of acting, like, try and flip the switch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you feel that nervousness say, "All right. It doesn't matter." Go ahead and remember that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am gonna try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead and remember that. Yeah? [0:29:59.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's a good idea. It - just to, like, make - like, have fun with it, kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you could even go into a store and pretend that, you know - I mean act - say acting like your roommate. I bet she's kind of a person that does...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, talk a mile a minute.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then take the nervousness as a cue to become that actress.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And acting like the person that you want to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. That's different. I like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So by Friday - we're seeing each other at 5:00?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 5:00, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So by Friday I want you to show me that text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay? All right. I have to walk you out. [0:30:37.5]</p>

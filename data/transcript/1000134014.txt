<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this isn't anything like the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the...</p>

<p>PATIENT: This doesn't have anything to do with my...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see. Okay. But I think we'd better hear about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>This is January 3 or — quiet. This is the 17th session, would you believe. After weeks and weeks of (inaudible at 0:20)</p>

<p>Okay. And you were just saying that you think you - this might be a good place to terminate since we have been away from each other for so long that it's going to take something (ph) to get back into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I want to ask you as well if I can just go three more sessions to get it all...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This - this will be four, including tonight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But - and the other thing, that was part of the... You know, it was like an obligation that I had. So this is kind of a vacation right now. When do I take the final examination for it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As soon as - soon after that last session. We'll schedule it for the next day if you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We can do that as well as...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well if you - whenever you feel like it. But I wasn't aware that it was quite that rigid. But that's so much like... [0:01:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well look. You know, you also could break the deal if you really want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, I wouldn't want...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, since your important session gets enough, I was thinking as I was coming out here that there might be like two or three or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this is kind of silly to involved without being, you know, for - for - I really don't know what the answer is. (inaudible at 01:22)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think it's true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But maybe at this point it'd be worthwhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Um, another question that I have is, um, how would you feel about - I don't know how I feel about it, but I'll bring it up. How would you feel about doing the last - about coming twice a week and finishing up in the next two weeks, or just... You know, like you get more for your money if you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'll be all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...spread it out.</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I would want to talk about it. But that's all right. Yeah. That's a good idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like to do it that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so. Um, I wouldn't want to do it that way this week, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want to do it that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Next week. Next week would be fine, if you like — if you like. That would be better. Because it's too damned cold to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be tracking down here. [0:02:03.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's - it's - it is getting a little... So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That - that might be good for me, too, to finish. If - well - okay. The next - well if we...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, we're finishing! Is that — uh, you know. I - well, that shouldn't really be of that much value, because I think that... Well mostly what I'm hearing in my - my mind is just, "Finishing," you know. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Enough they'll say that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it would be of that much value.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I kind of think of it, and especially like the - well like the last two or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you did put that energy... But maybe it would be better if you didn't walk away. Because that's the pattern that we've set.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they get more proof this way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well we can talk about that next time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes we can. We can - we can do it that way...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not going to be an (inaudible at 2:45)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll just arrange to leave a slot for you. You know, it would be next Thursday night. Oh - we - I'll - definitely 7 o'clock next Thursday. And next Thursday would be the other time. Or Saturday, God help us. [0:03:04.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Saturday is in my jeans as far as I'm concerned. Really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saturday is awful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Is Thursday...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I assume it would a big hassle. Um - well I - yeah. I think we should try [as we can] (ph). But we ought to decide...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well I will decide for sure: next Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess we are talking in terms of about one session then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Just as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How am I? Well I don't - I'm - I'm - I'm in reasonably good shape. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm vacillating all day, a pleasant - pleasant holiday. And — I've come across a new bird. And, uh, it appears to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A female?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, uh, she seems to be satisfactory. She's... I don't how approximately - you know, develop. But she's a very quiet type. I met her at a dinner party... [0:04:04.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...some time ago. It was arranged. And I've taken her out on a couple of occasions. And she'll be around, anyway, for some social events that may come up. And I think she'll be - you know, it might be interesting.</p>

<p>Um - so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she acts interested.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're a little bit interested.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, she seems to be a nice girl. I expect, you know - I mean big deal. She doesn't matter to me.</p>

<p>And, uh, yeah. You know. We had a nice time and a couple of ego-boosting experiences of... I had a special note of, you know, we were - left sort of a pleasant aftertaste, you know, after the - after the ... You know, she was a holiday, as - as I thought about if afterwards. So I mean it's in pretty good - pretty good shape, all things considered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 4:55)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I ran into a couple of situations, you know, where, uh, my - I got the distinct impression that my presence was - was actively enjoyed and so on and so forth — [the little lady triumphs] (ph) ... (Laughs) [0:05:15.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well anyway...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. Whether they...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like a nice place to quit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "And they lived happily ever after."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Two lived happily after. [Really like a fluke] (ph). Really, I might as well start to survive. This is... I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is - this book is a - is the... (laughs). Yeah, [that'd be cool on acid] (ph). I just thought of where it said two of them. Have you read that? By Tom Wolfe?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely terrific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tom Moll (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tom Wolfe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wolfe. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It about Ken Kesey. It's just terrific. In paperback. You ought to pick it up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's about Ken Kesey?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, uh, Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. It's terrific. I just think, you know, they said two of �em.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ken Kesey is the guy who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? [0:06:03.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And several other...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...several other books...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you go...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that were promising books, supposedly. I haven't read any of those. But I read an interview...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...with him in the [Real Estates] (ph). And he - he - I really kind of dig him because he's... The part that I reads (sic) he got corp - sort of (inaudible at 6:16) the fact that he had an abortion that, you know, or a (inaudible at 6:21) [or a kid] (ph). And I kind of dig that because as much as I, um, you know, agree in many respects with - with - that abortion shouldn't be disallowed by the Church and so on and so forth, there is still something really strong in the argument that grabs me. And it's, uh - I appreciate seeing somebody else, you know, grab -identify with that. That seems to be a... It's been a little bit fashionable these days in certain - certain - certain circles.</p>

<p>So when I have the time I'm going to pick up the book and bring to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do appreciate that. It was nice to see somebody on that, [by the fence] (ph) with passion, for a change. [0:06:58.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. You know. And, uh, you know, one of the things about it is, is that a lot of... This is - this probably sounds like a ridiculous theorizing, but mature and to the point. You know, they say that - that - that if you - if you remove the results of the act of tabulation from the act itself — that is to say you're not making babies — you really sort of degrade the thing in - in a certain way. Um, you make it about as significant as blowing your nose in some respects, you know? It's just - or - or, you know, like going to the bathroom or something. It just sort of degrades it.</p>

<p>And also there's the idea that it's a little bit debauched, you know, maybe if you enjoy yourself that much — you know, just for the pleasure of enjoying yourself — that this should be tied into some other grand plan to make your life more meaningful.</p>

<p>And I think that... You know, objectively there's a certain validity. I really do. You know, I realize not everyone's against it [The mother] (ph), that's she's in difficulty or something like that.</p>

<p>But just for a little light... You know. I meet you in high school and we are going around popping pills and - and, you know. You know. The important thing is not either. These are both extreme arguments given the... So I think that it has some - that's what interested me in here - in here - in here, you know. [0:08:14.7]</p>

<p>But - hm. I don't know if that's very much here or there, except I got, you know, a big bang out of reading this book because the Merry Pranksters, their whole mission in life... They take a bus, and they freak out the bus. They paint it all kinds of weird colors. And they get tape recording equipment and they crisscross the country. And they just freak everybody out. You know, they are all totally up on acid. And they get their... They are all decked out in weirdo things.</p>

<p>And I got a big chuckle out of, you know, the rendition that Wolfe makes, which is very good other than freaking out people and their enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's a rebellion against the discipline of everyday living and all that. They are vicariously speaking like crazy, you know. Although there are some bad scenes about �em, too. [0:09:02.6]</p>

<p>So, um, you know. Well that's what, uh - that's what I was enjoying, I think, uh, recently, were those two things: my little ego - ego triumphs of - of - of a sort and this book essentially last night of Kesey's.</p>

<p>But... I have something in my mind, but I'm trying to figure out a way to check into it. And so - so forgive me if I, uh, ramble for a few minutes while I find my - my bearings. Well. And these one-sided conversations are very difficult. I'm out of practice, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're out of practice and I'm being more one sided than usual.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) [0:10:00.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm letting you have the whole floor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm. Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just wanted to see what you do without me sometimes or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's just drive around? (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I - maybe I need - going in a new direction. What you are saying exactly... You know, once you are going to talk about one, it does need to drift or get back to - you know.</p>

<p>You are doing very well on your own, so...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - well I don't know if I'm making any progress.</p>

<p>I think - the trouble is, I think, you know, um... Hm. Well let me - let me state it as straightforwardly as I can. The trouble is I have had these nice episodes and incidences recently, so I am in a reasonably good mood. But, you know, in the undercurrent I still - you know, still very much notice... And I don't want to especially just go into it and say, "Well yes, but..." And then, you know. [0:11:00.6]</p>

<p>And so I'm trying to - I guess what I'm trying to do is to find some way to work into a - a balanced, you know, present discussion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I'm glad that you told me that that was your consideration. Because, um, I - I would love to hear about what your successes have been, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know you would. I know you would. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You also need language.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, what's - what's really troubling me is not, you know, my successes so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, uh, so that, you know... And then at the same time I - I am — I am, uh, very jittery about, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About getting into that rough space?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well there are things about Kesey's - about this thing, about Kesey — I could just use this as a text to promote (ph) it is that... That - you know, the great thing about the pranksters, the Merry Pranksters' trip was theoretically that they were just going to go — as Wolfe says, and he writes sort of - I think at the end of it, that we both understand what he is saying — was to "go with the flow." You know, that everybody was going to do their own thing. And no one was going to reject anyone else for what they did. [0:12:13.8]</p>

<p>He said - and he gives a little lecture before they go on — according to Wolfe, anyway. He gives a little lecture before they start out on the trip. He said - he said exactly that. He said, "We are going to go with the flow. And the major - one of the major things we are going to do on this trip is not reject anybody else for what they are. If you happen to be an ass kicker, you can say, �I'm sorry I kicked your ass,' but not �I'm sorry I'm an ass kicker.'' You know? Which somehow makes some kind of oblique sense in a certain way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, um, so this is - was the point of that. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that caused me, I think — uh, it put some reverberations in my head about our conversations, about - or - or your exhortations to me, anyway about, you know, just being who you are and sort of, you know, accepting and saying, "Well that's not what I did. Is that right, or something?" Or, "That's what I did. It's not good." But, you know, I mean I'm still... [0:13:09.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Focused?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know. Yeah, something. You know. Yeah. So that's one of the reasons why - why I was - why I was interested in it. And - and it comes back to this matter that there is... I had the feeling about myself that there - that it's core. There is a strong element of something that I don't like about myself, see? And so this caused some reverberations, too — what I don't like being that the - the - the aspect of being, the passivity, the, uh, uh - in a certain way, the sort of self-reinforcing that self image of business, you know.</p>

<p>And those are the - those are the - the — the — that, you know, the murkier things that — that, uh, that are disturbing to me, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The passivity - your passivity...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:14:00.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then some.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. And how those, you know. And as we've spoken of internally, I suppose, how those, you know, one reinforces the other. And there's a sort of reaching and then there is that.</p>

<p>And another thing I enjoyed about the - the - the Kesey approach — which I had to enjoy — is, if you can pull it off, which they did and did not do... Well as I was feeling it it's just, you know, going with it like that. They had one terribly erratic fellow they called Sandy. And I don't know whether Sandy is going to come out of that or not; I haven't finished this section of the book yet. But they keep trying - well they don't keep trying, because Sandy is very paranoic. And he doesn't feel like he's...</p>

<p>It - this is really marvelous. There is - it's the micro path on the bus. And there's - there's - even despite their good feeling or - there are definite power functions and channels going on. Sandy is extremely alive to them. And he constantly feels like he is being left out. So I am starting to identify with Sandy a little bit now because I - I'm better at sort of understanding that it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The paranoia.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...some paranoia coming after me. And — see, because I have felt that way in my social relationships with people. [0:15:03.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And one of Sandy's observations is — and I have noticed this myself, one of - one of - what Wolfe had Sandy observe anyway — is that, uh... Sandy says something about - or says something to himself about Matt being in on the - Matt being in with the power that - that they also actually had. And he's somehow being left out. Sandy might make a remark or do something that was a little awkward or goofy. And like he wasn't - you know, they didn't, you know, shoot raspberries at him or something or say he's a big jerk. He always has that feeling of being a little cut off from them — and especially in an enforced group there when they are all traveling, you know, barreling along a highway. This grows in him and grows in him and grows in him because of claustrophobia. And the situation...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels more and more like a cell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I agree. It exacerbates his condition. And so he is going towards them and coming back. And he is very - kind of like - like Kesey. You know, like Kesey smiles upon him. He, you know, just sort of bursts into - you know, Kesey understands. He understands. You know, like Kesey never - never has to say a word or two, and the guy is sort of, [Well what's up, exactly?"] (ph) And - and then he opens up. [0:16:13.6]</p>

<p>Even though I don't quite - they have a... Which is - which again struck some reverberation in me. They have that little game that Kesey devises. And that is - some - [extremely violates him] (ph). He has a... Anyway, they are playing the game as it... At some point in the game you win. And like a result of winning the little dart contest or whatever is that you get to have everybody do what you want. And, uh, and there is a group of eight of them or so.</p>

<p>Uh, that's all. Oh. And he has a - and he picks out a little slip of paper and says that somebody wrote to him and that he was going to do what they wanted him to do. And he has to do at least what he's told. And besides, he does it very badly, whatever it is. I can't remember the detail in there. But anyway he does it very badly, and he feels that he's done it very badly. [0:17:05.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And everybody says - it's a little awkward. It's an awkward moment. And he's - he's in misery. And the rest of them are - are - are quite apart from him.</p>

<p>And finally he breaks down and he confesses that - the fact that his problem is that when feels about this thing. And they see him for what he is, then — so, you know, insecure he is. And they are beginning to reinforce him very much and pulling very strong for him.</p>

<p>Uh, but there is one girl in the - and they... And he does what he is supposed to do, and he does it badly. And there is a rating, 1 to 5. And it starts out they gave him a 1, 5 being the top. And then they - he confesses what - what the difficulty is, and they say - and Kesey says, "What score shall we give him?" And they all say, "Five, five, five, five." And he, you know, he's happy again.</p>

<p>And then one - one girl blows the whole thing in there by saying — and it's beautifully delayed, Wolfe does it. She says, �"Three,' Gretchen said." And boom, end of chapter and into the next you know. And the whole point being that - that - that's enough just to break this guy's whole... You know. He's taking any flow of love for himself, you know, inflation [of feelings] (ph). [0:18:10.0]</p>

<p>So I identify with this guy — a lot of that, like crazy, you know. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I - I'll be anxious to see - see how that goes. I hope he comes out well. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you are forecasting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good at it - a little bit better if you can figure...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe. But then - but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and continue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I know, you... But - and that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Continue.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's - that's the - that's the kind of a - of a, you know, quandary that I get involved in, you know? And I noted before, uh, for whatever it's worth — it's worth a lot to me in, uh, in situations when - certain situations like when I had a little plan [to rely on (ph) or something, you know, that we could - that - that they can just become really strong for me, you know, [during that cutoff] (ph). You know. I know that there's others, it doesn't seem to - it doesn't seem to happen that way. And it really becomes so strong.</p>

<p>So, um, those are the... And - and - and - you - you don't really get at what - why it is that Sandy feels this way. Or at least you can't at this point. It's just a very good presentation of a - of a particular way of feeling about the world, you know? In that respect. So I am not nearly as [at the end] (ph) as he is, and it probably isn't under the same circumstance. [0:19:12.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those are the kinds of - it's a kind of an area that I'm - I think I am involved in a lot. This, uh, my relations with people. I am very much aware of the power functions that are going on and I can't stop sort of (inaudible at 19:26)</p>

<p>I'm right here to judge myself in those things. And this is the story of me.</p>

<p>So, um... So those - you know. And I - you know, that also I don't know who can explain those things in any kind of a rational way or even resort to - to analyzing one's emotions, finally. It might just come from a - a, you know, it's just a given. It's just the way - the way certain people are. There is not much they can do about it, you know. Like - you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wait a second. I - I... [0:20:00.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of describing, kind of in the ball park by - by my saying, you know, a certain emotional set. Well that just isn't so, you know. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I missed a couple of lines somewhere. And I found myself nodding at things that I don't agree with, where you said that's just the way it is and there is nothing you can do about it? And then you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Right. Yeah, yeah. That's... See, that's the problem I have with, you know, with this kind of a thing. I still have that nagging feeling...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That there is nothing you can do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in a certain way, yeah. I mean in a certain way my reactions are sort of given, you know. Uh, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I have - I know that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are just fooling yourself with a deal, maybe. But in a certain given way there is - you are going to respond to that in a certain sense of a [drive of] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I think people change a lot, and I think you are changing a lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, and I hope so. That - that'd be great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But, you know, but they have such an air of disbelief about them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. Like I said, they have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [0:21:04.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I mean it's - you know, I just don't know. I just think that that's a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way you're - you are not in a position... In your business you don't see people changing that much. People don't show you they are, you know. I mean you see the professional front — the salesman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All that. And it looks very, very similar a lot of the time. Well I am in a business where I see people changing up and down, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every day of the week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I - I - and it is apparent why I would, you know, think that people change more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I see people changing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. And that people - the average guy on the street probably isn't as changing as much as I see a guy in therapy changing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, uh...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you - you - you are saying you have seen it happen so often that it's really just... I mean you have either seen it happen so much that you are convinced that it's the case, you know. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I was understanding why. You know, you haven't seen it. And you - you are seeing a very different kind of thing. And I think that, uh, some of the real estate people that I've met, I mean the - the suave salesman, wherever he is, and he's that polished. [0:22:08.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I think that you don't get a sense of what is changing or what's him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I - I actually - yeah. I think that's the case. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or that's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I am not sure where I - where I can go after this, you know, dissertation that - and my feeling about - about that - or what that - you have been reading that - that... But you have said so often to me... I just have to say that I, you know, I feel that that's somewhere in the ball park of where - where my old emotional reactions lie, too.</p>

<p>So — I mean obviously I remember a little bit more - more control in this case. Also I am doped out most of the time, too. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you reacting about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - well just the fact that - that he was, you know. It's humorous in the book, the way he had to go through that thing. [0:22:58.7]</p>

<p>So - but I can feel reasonably positive about the thing. Of course it's important to me, again, that I try and - to maintain that and — or develop, I should say — a relationship with, you know, a female like this one I am going out with although she is... You know, I think I am really - really taking her out because she's pretty much on her own and is not likely to - to, you know, feel like she's been rejecting very - without giving it some thought or without somebody else being, you know, around. So that it's not a situation that I am certainly challenged by and have to worry about too much, you know?</p>

<p>But I can see how it could be. And she's a very kind of, you know, sort of honest straightforward girl — very sweet and very simple — and - and, uh, doesn't really have much to say.</p>

<p>And it's like, you know, that movie, TR. She lives - it's just like [TR bashing] (ph). She came up from a little town and - going to be married. Did you see that movie? [0:24:02.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not really. But I read...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's a wrenching movie. But I - if I don't see it in New York, then my sister will [brief me] (ph).</p>

<p>And she kind of - but you say you know the story, you know, of (inaudible at 24:17). Well this girl is the same way. And she's got her own little brave little apartment there. And it - it looks terribly depressing.</p>

<p>But - but she's not, you know. She's - I think she's probably pretty strong. She's a pretty strong chick (ph), by the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you like her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh - I don't know if I like her or not. I'd like to like her. Uh, we had - we had a couple of good moments, uh, with her. But it's - you know, it's kind of work in front because she doesn't know anybody that I know. And - or just this one couple that we - which is how we met. And they pretty well, you know, flagged (ph) after that, at this point.</p>

<p>[TAPE SKIP/STATIC 0:24:59.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you should.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being with them.</p>

<p>[BUMPING AND THUMPING]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fortunately it helped with us. But we have reached a- kind of miss them.</p>

<p>Not that - well I got to because, uh, and they are sort of - sort of now in this case it's a little unfashionable now somehow, you know? He's from UCLA and he's into potting and pottery and everything. And she's got kind of a responsible job, and she sort of runs the household. Except he might be the strong silent type of - somebody who explored all this, you know, in great detail. And he's kind of initially a little (inaudible at 25:32)</p>

<p>But it's - but whether I like her or not I really don't - I really don't know. I certainly like her a lot better than the - than that last - that last — freaked scene that I had. It was really strange. That girl was really - I went - made it down to a party at her house, in her apartment, just to stop by. There were a whole bunch of other people there. And it was really - she was really in a strange kind of scene for this. [0:26:01.8]</p>

<p>But that - I mean it [started out with] (ph)... There were really sort of stray dog types, two or three of them, up there. And the rest of us were all there, and she completely ignored the rest of the people at the party and talked to them. And a guy was playing the flute. Except he wasn't - I don't know. It just looked like he was sort [off the street] (ph) somewhere. Well... But, uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have been exploring your - [exploring your doubts] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I really am, you know. And again it's like, you know - you know, maybe you could change her, too, or something. But it isn't worth - it isn't worth it.</p>

<p>I can why, you know. I mean I've sort of been on both sides of the fence. So I can why certain people - that they see a difference in someone. I could not understand it before, the seriousness and absoluteness with certain people who reject other people. And it always sort of surprised me, because I - I don't think I've ever - I don't think I'm really that way. In fact I have to labor to be that way just a little bit, you know, polluting myself. And I - I do think that's - that's the case. [0:27:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, uh... But you talk to - to certain people — most people in a certain set — and where their opinion is utterly, finally, very serious, you know? I mean they just - you know, I mean a person is sort of shut off. And they are not willing to explore what might be on the other side. And I know they all have seen it — until I had this little run-in with Jane, you know. I thought, "Well that is just really, you know, a scene that is..." And she was finally — it was my final - final, you know, view on it. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It gives you a much better sense of what? Clunk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I remember that person."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really don't think I would unless I was just casually - wildly, you know, insanely, desperately hard up. So, you know, like I... I know the guy who (inaudible at 0:27:59.2). I know...</p>

<p>But anyway I don't think I've every seen that happen before, where people would do it. And then I finally had an occurring (ph) I have sort of done it myself, although I went over to her house. But that was, you know, a different scene, a lot of people. And it was just a large party.</p>

<p>But there I was and it was surprising, because I had always enjoyed really — [and I had asked her to] (ph) people. And her story is probably much too tragic (ph) or much too thoroughly, you know, on a casual acquaintance basis a lot. And it's - uh, in a way it's not so swell because it's certainly a sort of inspecting them like you would, you know, your little duct (ph) of - you know, see what kind of a thing is in there. And - like a biologist would, you know? So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You say being that, um...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want to take a little snooze here, and I'll just kind of go on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, no. I don't believe that you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: are just doing... Do you have any...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't mean that. Um, and I'll sit here with this thing.</p>

<p>(Laugher)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And tell me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'll try it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a story of... [0:29:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'll... I'll talk about Ken Kesey's novel. And I'll talk terrific stuff. And in fact your presence really isn't...</p>

<p>But I've got it in here. Don't go out there. So you come in. What are you going to do, take a No Doz?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I'm going to find some gum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can go on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't - I don't know where I'm going. I don't know - I have no notion of what I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe that's why...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe because I was lost...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you started to fall asleep, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so it's a pretty good sign that... So I think...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt, myself, that my mouth was going too much, actually.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And - well what do you want to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want to do with the next half an hour, 25 minutes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to go eat my dinner.</p>


<p>COUNSELOR: You want to go eat your dinner? Well, um - well that's very interesting. It all appears you're in - overdue. [0:30:01.0]</p>

<p>Um - uh - you're - you're not into this tonight, is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't know what to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I swooped down on it very gracefully a moment ago. But then I was just saying that I met... I guess I met Jane. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you swooped down very gracefully to say, um, you had met... You mean that thing...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I did. Well that was - you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kesey?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing about - the thing about that Sandy character is really, you know. It is a lot of what, you know, what ails me. You know? But, um, I'm not sure where - you know, where to go with all of the...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well... Well it's hard for me to respond to that because I felt like you were kind of blocking, saying, "Don't deal with me tonight. Here's this Sandy character." And, um, you know, I - I have made that mistake with clients before. And I end up making reflections to and therapeutic comments about their husband and wife. Well, you know, that just isn't the way to do therapy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. [0:31:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would just... I - because I feel like we can be a lot more specific, um, and immediate with you rather than surmising what it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Well, you know, I mean all that you have to do for - in large measure is to take the name "Sandy" out and put in - put in my name. I mean that pretty much - that pretty much, uh - pretty much does it. It does, is why I am touching on it. I - you know, because, uh, you know, that - that's what people write books for a lot. You know, to have - all of a sudden you recognize that if you change the name there, well in many respects you're the person. And then it allowed me to - to, you know, see my own reaction, putting it on another — in another character.</p>

<p>And, uh, that - that's really what - what interests me. But I'm not sure what - you know. It not - not only happened to Sandy. I'm not sure what — what's going to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is going to happen to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel that's going to happen to me. [0:32:00.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that's what I was a little bit bored about, too. Because it - it - this sounds like you are waiting to find out what happened to Sandy just enough to know what's going to happen to you or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gee, that bugs me. Because you have got a lot on the ball. And you can do a lot of changing about you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...without waiting to see whether Sandy comes out of the can.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well... I don't know. I - you know, I don't think everybody is serious about that, uh, in terms of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...what I was getting at, you know, that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I know. I know you... I know you are not really, but in a way you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, and I can also understand... It - it's funny, because you talking about that novel. It's the first time in a long time that a novel has really been a Why for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I used to be a - a book drunk with my father-in-law.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I read voraciously. But then I haven't done that for years and years and years. [0:33:01.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the first time I've used a [rule — rule] like that I've got...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good. That's a great thought. I - I dig that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...such a response about a book.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm - I'm a communicator.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except you were bored, I thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, um, I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You [have to look first] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know at one point I really looked up - was what the book meant to you and that is really meant something. And that when you sat down and read that, you weren't just "ho hum," a way to fill - fill a dull evening. It was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am blushing, I am so pleased. (Chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. I really am. I am very pleased.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh [my client] (ph). I'm glad. �Cause I - I really had a sense of - that when you were reading that book you were going somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah. No, it - it was touching all sorts of "Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz." It was terrific.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what - what in particular did it touch?</p>

<p>Oh! Yeah. I know one line that really hit me was this thing about the - the... One of the first things that you said about, um, that Kesey says that we are going to accept everybody? You can say, "Excuse me for kicking your ass." [0:34:04.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not, "Excuse me because I'm an ass kicker."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that... You know, that's fantastic in the context of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah it is. It's very appropriate in a certain way. And, uh, that's his phrase, you know. Not mine. And, uh, it is very appropriate. I - that's - well that's - that's the interest of the thing. It really is, and - and to see what happens to him. And, uh, you know.</p>

<p>You know, one of the difficulties of that is - and it's - is that one of the people that is on the trip goes - is saying about Houston — from San Francisco, and to get to Houston of is strong. And this guy Sandy, you know, makes it back to California again; but it doesn't look like he is going to last too much longer. And he is sort of going with... Well he is not going with the flow, really; that's his whole problem in this thing. He is not - he doesn't - he feels no participation... [0:35:05.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in things, you know? Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if - well how about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I - you know, I think it'd be a great idea to go with the flow. I'm, you know, sort of... A good part of my life has been spent fooling around and then, you know, either - either being coy with, you know, finding some situation like that and being too coy for it and not getting involved it — or you know, making a stand and then not cutting it. I mean that's really been a good part of the story of my - of my life. Uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So say it one more time. I lost...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know why, but I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not communicating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what happened. I am - I started this. And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: A good part - a good part of the - of the - of my life has been - has been this - this guy Sandy's problem. You know, his - as I said his problem is not going with the flow or whatever and then being - doing his thing or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how has he...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have been the same way because I haven't been able to find, you know... [0:36:03.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...the flow, or I then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have trouble to find the flow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, as it were. Right. Well terrific, Judy. That's exactly the point.</p>

<p>You know, because I'm not really sure. And then I'm primarily sort of confused. What is the flow, you know? Uh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's deal with that.</p>

<p>Well that's just it. That's the long way to go about it, is to go around looking for the flow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you have got the flow. The flow is in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am the flow. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I am the flow." Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The flow is me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you are having the flow right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you give me that answer that, you know, "Right, lady."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just cut. And you just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that certainly - it elicited a response. That's sort of - you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What - why did you say, "I don't believe you?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eh...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, say something that I couldn't consider that's, "Yeah, right." It shouldn't — then I just feel like, "Well if he doesn't care..." [0:37:03.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think that I... You know, I do care. And I - I think that what you are saying is, you know, like out of a schoolbook, "True. Yeah, sure. Right." That's right. Supposing - and that sounds like great, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Just so I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it adds up, and I can subtract two from it and get zero, and add two to it and get two — and fool around a little bit, and great. We can all make sense. But it's - it's totally abstracted from...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. How are we going to get any closer to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really have no idea. I - I don't have any idea. I mean even though it's - that's why I'm spending it — whatever it is. [That's really] (ph)...</p>

<p>And as I said, you know, a good part of it... You know, okay, if the flow doesn't mean... Maybe that's the point. Maybe I have been, uh, you know, playing coy with myself a lot of [the time] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I - I feel that you keep looking out there and find cues for what you are supposed to do and what you should do and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:38:02.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...whether it would be best if you did. And - and in that sense you are paranoid, and looking at [static, you know, on there] (ph). Because, you know, it's the same kind of ...</p>

<p>(Crosstalking with voice on radio)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know, you are so busy batting against the big boards (ph). And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Yeah. But in a certain way, the - the trouble about... (Laughs) Certainly the trouble is that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you laughing about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your - your - your gesture there. I don't know if that was - it's hard to guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hard to guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no. This part, I mean that was the feeling I got of, "Oh my God. The overhead is killing me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But you know, the trouble - the trouble with that is - is that let's say... Well. Uh... Let's say - let's say that the real... Let's say that the real me, possibly, is a raging, flaming, queen faggot. What if that's the case? [0:39:01.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if - tell me. What if it is the case?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then there is going to be a - both migraine, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who is going to get one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me. You know, that - right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't let yourself do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. No way. No way. Classic queen, maybe. But I don't think (chuckles)... You know. And that's - that's - that's part of the - this - the distinct, you know, or... And I can recognize even that, you know, as being again abstractedly a mistaken kind of an attitude. But I can't recognize it as being a mistaken kind of attitude towards, uh... I mean that's the attitude I have. You know.</p>

<p>So just to defuse that a little bit, that - you know, let's just say, "as if that were the case," you know, with — we'll abstract from it, just for awhile.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. John, you see that's one of your problems. It's that you keep the abstractions in the form of meanings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:40:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get too abstracted. Then it doesn't mean anything to you anymore. And it's damned hard to do therapy...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with you — with anybody — when it doesn't mean anything to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About... Okay. That's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because what we are dealing with are your meanings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you are here for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Um hm. Okay.</p>

<p>All right. So well — you know. That's that for an abstract.</p>

<p>I - I just feel - now, look.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel this way. But let me - let me complete this point, though, so I get this plan. I feel that... Uh, I am 28 years old. And I have yet to conclude any kind of successful sexual encounter with a female or any - anybody as far as that's concerned — barring myself. And that's got to tell me something right there. Okay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's - what...</p>

<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. The other thing is that I think that within the... And it has - it has to tell me that, you know, uh... It's... Well I don't want to tell you... [0:41:07.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...what it is, what they are telling me it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now the other thing that - that - that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not? Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not deal with that? And then - okay. I - I'm going to deal with it if you won't.</p>

<p>Okay. Let's do a bit of Ken Kesey therapy with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um, it sounds like... Um, okay, getting back to his ass kicker moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, uh, you can feel, um, sexually impotent or whatever you feel is the problem, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's you. And it's... Um, you are saying - you say - you are going around giving yourself the line, telling yourself, "I am sexually impotent. I am sexually impotent. I'm — sexually inadequate."</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just - it's been - it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I'm sexually whatever."</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's been demonstrated scientifically. (Chuckles) In a variety of situations. [0:42:00.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well that may be true, that that has happened in experience, and that you have had no other kind of experience. But that doesn't mean no other kind of experience is possible.</p>

<p>Um, uh, that you were - say that you were on Ken Kesey's bus. And, uh, you had a sexual encounter with someone on that bus. And, uh, you were painfully aware that, uh...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you weren't able to fulfill that person's expectation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So they wouldn't let you apologize or say, "Hey, I'm sorry I'm sexually inadequate."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then, you know, say, "Hey, I'm sorry I was sexually inadequate with you."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. "I," or, "I wasn't able to have an orgasm."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I wasn't as able to complete this sexual adventure with you."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not, "I am sexually inadequate." That's a whole different ball game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And - and that's the kind of ball game that we are talking about. You know, deal with one experience at a time. Don't sum it up and say... [0:43:00.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm. Well... And that's - you know. You - you could... I think - I think my response to that is - is that, you know, in a situation like we are talking about, this Kesey thing, that's all right. Because, you know, again they are - they are really not demanding any... No one in the world at large — or their microcosm of the world — is that demanding and permanent, you know. And they are not making judgments. You know, it's obvious about this person's nonresponse (ph) situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like a healthy...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...place to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does. But unfortunately the world at large isn't - isn't that way, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you going to bed with the world at large?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. The world at large is making judgments of - of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of the - the world at large is making judgments every time you go to bed? [0:44:00.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. I think that the world... I don't know. I think that - that, you know. The world at large and society in general and my own particular society of people that I — that I run around with, uh - are and - are and do, you know, make judgments.</p>

<p>Because - see - you see the problem with this thing, it matches. It's just not merely the fact that as though it were a malfunction. And this is what we have talked about before, and that's [all right] (ph) to say that malfunction of some plumbing or something and so we are impotent for that reason.</p>

<p>But the real - you know, the thing goes much further and permeates the - a personality. And it's probably one of the reasons why I have never been able to — as I was saying earlier — connect with the flow. [0:45:01.4]</p>

<p>I don't know which is the cause and effect and so on and so forth. But it's just that I am that kind of a person, uh, that doesn't. And, uh... I don't know; it's difficult for me to express. But sometimes you are saying this. It's so, uh, you know, just for that - for that reason alone that, uh, that they'd make judgments or - or make it their demand expecta - or, you know, expectations. I mean... But, you know, this fact is part and parcel of all the rest of it too, of my emotional life.</p>

<p>But the thing is - is that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Somebody on - on - on — uh, Ken Kesey's bus could say the same thing since they, um - this guy Theo? — Sandy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know somebody named Theo, I think, and then Sandy. That's why I mixed them up. [0:46:00.6]</p>

<p>Um - um, he could get somebody and - and apologize for being an ass kicker. And Kesey says, "No. No. We don't allow apologies for that." And he couldn't. "Yes, but it could make my whole personality." I mean Kesey...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you see - you see, the point is - the point is, is that... See, I am - I am... Really, I want to respond to that as directly as I can, because part of this is that - is that he is failing Kesey in that aspect because he is doing this, I suppose. You know?</p>

<p>I am - when I react in this way, that is to say, have a bad self image of myself as a result of this or as part of it or whatever, uh, that tells the society culture, you know, to try to inculcate exactly that kind of a of feeling in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was not [really me] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. A feeling of inadequacy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A generalized sort of, you know, inadequacy — or lack of self confidence and so on. Um, and not without reason. I mean you are - you know. You are missing, uh, you know, a major part — or a major part of, uh, of human experience. [0:47:13.6]</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that - is that, uh, is that - I guess that guy Sandy in essence would be - would be failing them, would be failing Kesey because of his, you know, his system's kind of effect that he is - that it pervades his whole personality.</p>

<p>But if you substitute - if you are going to - you are making an analogy of that sort and you substitute for Kesey — you know, me versus the world — and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you are making a mistake. It isn't you versus the world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You versus the person in your encounter. It's not - it's not the whole world. It's not your whole group of friends that are aware of every time you are going to bed...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. I don't... No. [0:48:01.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...to track you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that. I don't have that - I don't have that kind of an attitude toward - towards them. I don't. That's not what I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Well I was getting that picture of your attitude today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounded like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I am trying to say is, is that it's - is it may be — maybe - maybe it's this. Maybe it's just that I think that that's such an important thing that I conclude that the rest of me must also be, uh, equally as bad — equally as much a failure. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty bad to kick somebody in the ass, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Okay. So you are saying that that's not so, that it's - it's - it's fine.</p>

<p>All that I am doing is explaining what - what might possibly be my, you know — what is, probably, my emotional reaction to it. It's just that if you - if you feel, uh, that that's strong point then you are likely...</p>

<p>And it's a - it's a kind of personal observation. My sister felt that way when she was divorced. And she told me. She said, "I felt like I was really a failure." Well now you could say to her, "Yes. Yes, and your marriage failed. You didn't necessarily fail as a person." And she didn't. Because she's, you know, got her children and she is doing reasonably well. [0:49:13.5]</p>

<p>But nevertheless, at that point in time and under that stress, you know, and crisis and shortly thereafter, she distinctly felt that way...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...until she finally rallied herself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And that's true. And that's that thing that I am not dealing with adequately with you, is that you feel like a total failure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That - in - in - in my respect. And I, you know, I really, uh, you know, sort of run about kicking my own ass as a result of that. Yeah.</p>

<p>And, uh, you know, I just had that - that... That - that's of the undercurrent that - that, you know, that puts the - that gives the bad spin to most of the other things which could be perceived of as a success. And, uh, it - you know, it just would be nice to relax some of the time. I mean, um... [0:50:05.7]</p>

<p>So, you know, that's - so that's the - that's the feeling I have about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, and I got a better look tonight at one of the reasons you are afraid that - or there is more inadequate... And I didn't realize how strong and how awful that fear of being homosexual...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that pretty - that's the cause of it. And if we, you know, it's like we really get into it, uh, you know, I may not want to find that out about myself. I may - may much rather just assume the role of a - of a jolly bachelor and enjoying the CAA (sp?) and, uh - and, uh, let it go at that. You know?</p>

<p>At the same time I can recognize that in a certain objective sense that that in some ways is going to - that that's - maybe it's foolish. Because maybe there's nothing there, number one. But maybe there is something there. It's an enormously risk - risky - risky proposition. And as a consequence of - of that kind of a consideration, I have really bottled myself up pretty - pretty thoroughly. [0:51:16.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to the point where it's, uh, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, to the point where it's truly a bummer, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't - I don't see you willing to look - to look into that anymore for fear that the answer may be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know. I - I - I don't know. I think that... Well right. I just can't come to terms even with the possibilities of - of really investigating that very thoroughly, much less with any possibility, ever, of coming to terms with, you know, some - with that being the case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Live a homosexual life? [0:52:01.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I really dance around it. But yeah, that sort - that sort of thing. And, uh, I don't know. And that - so that's a real... That's - that's really difficult. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you get... Do you get turned on by the female anatomy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you get turned on by male anatomy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Not really. Well I have - I, you know, I'd be in a certain situation that I would probably feel so uptight about it that I'd be... You know, almost it is as though if I were to I would sort of shut if off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be - be a problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I'd - completely frozen. Um, and I'm not afraid of the point that there might be certain aspects of my personality involved with that. I think that - that, you know, I read somewhere — and I think it's probably true — that, uh, there's a certain bisexuality in all of - in everyone to a certain degree, that a lot of relationships you can have with - with friends of yours, uh, to have a certain sexuality to it be they male or female. [0:53:10.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, there is - there is probably a little something of that in - in - in most close relationships we have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm really sorry that we are going to have to cut this off, but I've got another client. And I think hear him out there.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is to make sure that that's him and make sure that he's in. And then I'll come back and we'll talk for a few more minutes, I think. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. [0:53:32.8]</p>

<p>(Pause, 50 seconds)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's not here yet. So I will continue. So... Okay.</p>

<p>It's too bad, so much stuff that had to come right up, uh, right at the end.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, have you ever - have you ever looked at this side of the door? What if you thoroughly investigated this? And chances are at least 50-50, um...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well and I already just [told you] (ph)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you are heterosexual and that you investigated it and were able to have successful heterosexual relationships? I mean you don't seem to be very successful at this point. It seems... [0:55:07.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there would be a lot to gain, I'm sure. Yes. I — yeah. I don't know. It's, uh, you know, in terms of - in a certain way and in a particular mood and the particular terms in which I think about it. You know, uh... I could - I could persuade myself, I suppose, to - to... You know, I have thought about it myself many times. But I - I - I think I could persuade myself to think about it as it will allow, and talk about it, uh, with some as the - if I could get it, sort of a handle on it. I - and I don't know - and I don't how to make myself clear. Sure.</p>

<p>But I would have to try to adopt some - fix myself up in some particular attitude that I am going to take towards myself, you know, as I'm talking and... Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel that you have to have to have that ahead of time... [0:56:00.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I - see, I have to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... a lot of time once your attitude towards yourself is going to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm not planning ahead of time. I just want to feel com - I just want to feel comfortable and - and - and strike a particular attitude and just try and hold towards that. That's, you know, why I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think when anybody... When you do - you've got to... When - when things mean that much to you... You know, it's - it reverses what you said. It can't mean that much — to me, anyway. I always like to put a distance on it and put a little spin on it, you know, so that it - so that I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that the bomb can explode and I can sort of watch it. You know what I mean? And then kind of - and then kind of let it all sink in later, as it were...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: rather than - rather than going through an enormous, you know, trauma to - to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what the other side of that corollary is? That you are going... If you distance yourself, you distance yourself so long and so completely from your experience of letting it - it exploding in the corner that [I bet you] (ph) that that (inaudible at 0:56:56.9) damned hard to get yourself back into that experience and feel the bomb go off. [0:57:04.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. And like... And you have to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, one thing it's not, it - it can - and sometimes it's a freedom to have the distance from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's - you have also become a victim of that freedom.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's become a trap. You can't get back into it. It's fine if you have the freedom to go - to come and go. But you've got yourself - uh, crawl outside of it and with not knowing how to get back - get back into the experience and feel it in the here and now, when you are handling it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is - is that what - is that what happens when you start to have some kind of sexual encounter with somebody?</p>


<p>(Crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well by this time that's become - it's be - you know, it's totally repressive because under certain...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's just - it's just that... [0:58:02.1]</p>

<p>You know, it's really bad because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just like it's a horror story [for - in other words] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And there we go, you know. Here we go again. And I'm thinking - so I know what's going to... And - but it's going to be a bum scene. And how am I going to extricate myself from this - this scene with any degree of grace?</p>

<p>So that - you know. So really since - since - since a couple of years ago when I had - when I had a particularly sort of a raw experience and that kind of, uh... That's the reason that I just sort of tailed off going out with girls at all, because it was just - it really got to be a bad, uh... Or it just got to be bad and it was - it - "I just can't go through with this," you know. She was carrying on. So...</p>

<p>Yeah. Well I don't know. I - you know, I am - I am- I am obviously thoroughly, uh, confused about, uh, where am I going. I'm really anxious. You know. Our hour and, uh - might be it. [0:59:01.1]</p>

<p>I think I am also having difficulties - is that I would also like to - to, you know, come up with - have you talk about things like this that are so important, to go right to the nature of, you know, really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...who you are and what you are and how you react to things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There would be a strong temptation on my part just to invent a series of plausible, you know, theories, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About why you are that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of. Well yeah, you know. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I didn't really want to come in here and have you say, "Well listen. And the next time we'll actually, you know, talk about this one." You know, like try it again and (inaudible at 0:59:34.8). Which has the advantage, again, of - of - just sort of, uh, uh, detached kind of scientific, you know, little game that we play. And then you would say, "Well no, that problem..." You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know, and that's just why I don't want to do it, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The nice detached game that you'll forget where you live.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you know, that said, it's - and to tell you the truth, I want to hear where I — where I'm living in today, like you said. [1:00:00.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well that's - that's a good thing to think about. I mean I've had you think about that between sessions before. And I think that is something to think about again.</p>

<p>And use your senses; they are strong enough. So you are not going to get into areas that you don't want to get into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are in control of your senses. And you going to — [lots and lots] (ph), nice and strong. So you won't have to go into an area that's too painful that you can't handle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah. I'm good, and I have pretty good - pretty good defensive mechanisms today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh... [1:00:34.8]</p>

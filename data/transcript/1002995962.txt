<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right, so what are we working on today? How (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good, good. Last time we talked a lot about kind of the acceptance of, you know, like when I'm feeling bad like, "If that's frightening (ph), it's going to happen," and that kind of thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �Just kind of empowering myself by researching more so I felt less like vulnerable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. 0:01:02.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then, and then also kind of not being like overly assertive but just more speaking to my doctor (ph) being verbal with my concerns and stuff like that, and it's been really good. I really had—it took for me because some days I come in here and I feel like I'm being (inaudible at 0:01:25.1) well I leave here feeling like, "Oh my God, you're really a petulant child." Like you know what mean. Like I know like I have this (inaudible at 0:01:32.7) like, "No I can't do this, this is hard," you know, like not kind of like sure. And then I come in here, even if I'm like a little bit resistant like, "Oh it's not that easy. You just can say it and it'll happen." I end up leaving here and be like, "I think about it and there really isn't anything stopping (ph) me." And so when I'm able to like grasp that, it works, it works wonders. It's really, it's really happening. Like in the past week just with the whole acceptance thing it's like it's going to happen...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �and life doesn't suck because of it. I'm like, "I'd rather not be there but you know there're so many other good things going, it's not—it's doable," and I, I think that really helps me a lot. And my stomach hasn't gotten better�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �but, but my attitude towards it has made it a little bit easier�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �to kind of deal with�</p>

<p>PATIENT: �to kind of deal with, yes—I mean you have to, you have to deal with it so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, because whether you like it or not it's there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that sounds good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now when you're getting those moments of feeling frustrated, like what's going on, like what's the difference between that and this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I'm able to make some serious progress, especially when things are going pretty well. And then like four or five things go wrong I'm like, "Oh God, I can't deal with all of this," you know what I mean� and that's kind of when actually I'm doing like, "Oh this is hopeless, oh."</p>

<p>I had one moment like that this week. I walked out of the house—it was one of those days when it was pouring— I was soaking wet, waiting for (inaudible at 0:03:19.2) appointment. It takes like two times longer—usually there. And I go home open a beer and pour it and I get beer all over my clothes (inaudible at 0:03:27.8) and now I'm like, oh. And I had one of those kind of like down moments. But it takes something like crazy bad stuff like that to get me to that point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And even then like I could take in stride for a few minutes, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). So you don't get to a point where you're going off the going off sort of an the edge but?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and it's awesome. And like one thing I've really noticed is I don't have—like sometimes I'll be sad or kind of distraught, but never angry. Like that used to be—it was a consequence of whatever emotion I was feeling, I got to be angry at somebody or something or myself and none of the anger is there. Like I haven't yelled at anybody—all right I used to yell at (inaudible) all the time. And I've only yelled at him in like weeks and weeks and weeks and its like so great to have that part of it gone. I feel it's still teamwork but (inaudible at 0:04:20.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm like, you know, cursing God or the world. (inaudible) I have all these (inaudible at 0:04:26.9) little things happen it's just like, "Oh man this sucks," and then being able to like move on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now what happen that you don't get angry anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it was honestly, a huge part of it, that whole life switch thing and it really, it completely revolutionized like the whole way I think because for a while, I was totally resistant about like coming to do something like this and worry about thinking rationally and all this kind of stuff because I was like, "Oh my emotions are the core of life, it's what makes everything worth living," and, you know, you have to just feel the emotions to their full effect and stuff like that. You know I'm learning that emotions are great and wonderful, you have them and you should them, but they also need to be accompanied by some thought, like probably a rational thought. And just like me growing to accept that rational thoughts or like I was willing to live by and with them, I mean they just complement emotion and they just kind of give some grounding to emotion�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �which I thought would, like, devalue the emotion before. And so now that I've accepted that, I feel like that's kind of where the anger's gone, it's no longer like just a surge of emotion that I have no tools to control it. But like I have these thoughts like, I can just sort of channel the emotion or turn things on and off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right and that's the (inaudible at 0:05:58.5) of the model.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because emotions are strong, you feel emotion�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �and that's all great. You have to kind of control the thinking. And it's very interesting because when you first came in, you thought you couldn't do it. You really thought you couldn't do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really didn't think I could. But (inaudible) to realize I need to have control over these emotions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. And you do have control of your thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I do. And that's (inaudible at 0:06:23.8) huge.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like grasping that. And grasping that like—rational thinking is good. Like I honestly was one of those like hippy idealist people who were, like, "Yeah emotion that's all that really gives meaning to life," but now I'm understanding this whole other side of the world. Like it's so crazy, you know what I mean, doors are kind of opening. 0:06:46.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And how has this benefited you? I mean you've mentioned a lot of situations, right? 0:06:49.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean honestly it's, it is (inaudible). I feel so much more in control over myself and what I'm feeling and how I'm acting. And then it's made me much more able to accept how things are, not like being complacent, but accepting things as they are and then working strategy to deal with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. 0:07:12.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like this one thing that's been really good has been like all the different scenarios we have. So you know you and I talk pretty okay: how are we going to handle dreams, how I'm going to handle when I'm going off the cliff, how am I going to handle everyday life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I feel really well equipped to deal to a lot of different situations. So I mean that's, that's fantastic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great. Does your fianc�e notice the difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh God. It so great like he just keeps smiling and (inaudible) it's so good to have you back. And like I feel this (inaudible). I feel like me, like even I'm very much more self aware of me than I ever was before because I had these (inaudible at 0:07:52.4) thoughts that I never questioned before; now I have so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's also a growing experience too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh it completely is. And I, I mean, I can't tell you enough about it because—I talking to my mom the other day just telling her about all of these things she was just like flabbergasted like how much I've learned in such a short period.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) and you're working very hard at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. But I want to, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're working hard, you're really thinking about, so that's why you're able to express progress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. So now everything's (inaudible at 0:08:23.8), which is great. But I was not always like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you're going to fall again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the way you've been thinking, the way you've been kind of like dealing with things�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �has been the way you've been for how many years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:08:36.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just got to be aware of thinking and it's great, it's (inaudible at 0:08:40.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) and you might (inaudible) and that's natural. People do that all the time. 0:08:44.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's important to not get down on yourself� remember like what you've learned, remember what processing will work�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �instead of going back to where you started, is always helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree. Yes. And I'm (inaudible) trying to do is like really integrate them into the way I live and way I think so that it's more second nature to come back to that in the hard times. Just like you, I mean, you've been recognizing the whole time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's because you're working very hard at it that's why you're getting, you're seeing where the changes (inaudible at 0:09:11.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's great it's really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And now last week you mentioned that you felt like you were stretched thin. Last week�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �your focus was not at work, (inaudible at 0:09:21.0) relationship�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �(inaudible at 0:09:23.8) that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I am stretched thin but I feel that I, but I try to make myself focus on more things, you know like (inaudible) just because when I try to devote so much energy I do let, to all these different things, I do feel a little bit weaker. I mean I am expanding more energy when I do that. So I've been trying to just like think about one thing at a time and like (inaudible) my (inaudible) a little bit because before, you know, I have had people e-mailing me about (inaudible) when I was at work and I'd be like stressed out at work, the wedding and then I would be really, really tired (inaudible) and then now I'm just like, okay, this—I won't let myself be involved (inaudible at 0:10:08.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're working (inaudible). That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you're thinking more logically, rationally (inaudible at 0:10:22.6) working so that when don't allow your emotions to get in the way, that's when it works for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right. Exactly. Exactly. I mean I still do have times, obviously, with the emotions are like really strong, but I haven't had anything that I haven't been able to tackle yet. I haven't had any emotions or just maybe forget everything (inaudible at 0:10:42.5). Even if I have a little bit of emotion (inaudible at 0:10:48.5) at least I can remember if I should be doing this even if I can't at this moment, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think that I am getting there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm starting to get there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's all just (inaudible) interesting fact that you (inaudible) you feel things much more strongly. 0:10:58.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are people think (inaudible) don't feel that much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you got to get a balance (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) think more (inaudible) could feel more. So for you, you feel more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So feeling is great, right? It's a high of a high being the ultimate goals of a low. Yes, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a good (inaudible) also a good balance of the two.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes (inaudible). 0:11:17.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Other people might not really feel much, they might think more. And that might make people a little bit mechanical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So for those people (inaudible) feel more (overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) can you do that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes I mean you could�</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean do you have like techniques and stuff to help those people who are more thinkers? 0:11:32.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I mean you help them to kind of think about (inaudible) it's more like�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �see how other people feel kind of thing you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's (inaudible) more scenarios right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's that kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do understand that because I've been noticing now a lot more my fianc�e is very much that way. And so like that's also been a really eye-opening experience it's like learning to kind of see the world through how he sees it, which is so different. And I know he's gotten a crash course.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I understand like for somebody who's really a motive like by living with me and�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I can totally understand the distinction you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's amazing how differently two people can see the same exact (inaudible). 0:12:16.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he talk to you, does he sees it that way or is it with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It used to be infer orating to be (inaudible at 0:12:23.4) I'm like, "How can you not see this?" like you know, "It's right there," and he would be doing the same thing like, "Why are seeing that, that doesn't exist." But now that I'm a little bit more in control of things and I feel like the kind of strategies and thoughts that we've developed make me more able to understand what he's talking about. And so I can still, so I am learning to see more, why he sees what he sees. In the same way, I've learned to see how he possibly could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. And that's good. And the other thing is there are some gender differences.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And (inaudible) I think more but I deal more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They got sort of a guy expectation on their (inaudible) so there is definitely a gender difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But yes. And that's another (inaudible at 0:13:09.9) I think is great is just being able to understand another segment of the population so much better than I did before because I was so, I won't say blah, egocentric basically and not like, you know, like emotion is right, feeling as deeply is the best thing to achieve and like it's been so (inaudible noise).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now let me ask you (inaudible) strong emotion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what about (inaudible) black and white or you have streak of gray in middle. (inaudible). 0:13:44.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Like it was very much like absolute�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: � you know what I mean like my idea of the absolute (inaudible) that we talked about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: � or like or (inaudible) check and so I'd be happy and it's like giddy with happiness, you know what I mean? Just—and then I would have a low with it with just, you know, like down slope despair type of low.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't want to say it's like, I mean (inaudible) manic depressive like but the highs and lows were just really extreme.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have a hard time kind of staying in the middle, like in a moderate place, but I can move up and down like really quickly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:14:32.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's exactly how I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you got your high and very low�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �but there's not no shades of gray in the middle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now (inaudible). (inaudible) absolute when things are not absolute, things in the world are not absolute.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So when things are great it's great, but when things are bad they go really, really bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now to regulate your emotions better so you can feel somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now does that look like in your life?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's like putting parameters on the low. Like recognizing like, okay this is bad, but it's not like world (ph), I mean, kind of bad, it's not something like you know like that I love being part of kind of bad. Like (inaudible) I stomped my toe or something like that. And so it's just kind of that emotional but not—it's like that rational check on the emotion. And then I mean I don't know if this is faulty but (inaudible) I hesitate to put it—a cap on the (inaudible) one, is that healthy, is that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No that's great, that's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As long as you, as long as you say it or as long as you're not compartmentalizing and saying, "If I'm not this happy, then I'm not happy at all." 0:15:52.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As long as you're not saying that, (overlapping) great feeling right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping) there's a cross negative but for you to get out of despair and like (inaudible 0:16:01.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if it's negative, I then kind of check (inaudible) the rational check, I mean that's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So recognizing that they're not like (inaudible) joy�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People are not like so happy all the time (overlapping 0:16:17.8) in the middle all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's one of the things I may not have—that is one thing that's going to be harder for me, because it always has taken that low (inaudible). That's when I—a lot of times I will say I'm happy or then I'm like, "Oh but I'm not," you know happy (overlapping).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I think that's one thing I'm going to have to work at. 0:16:39.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think (inaudible) really, really low (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Noise) feeling happiness all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) are like that. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean that's when a lot of like (inaudible) like (inaudible) that kind of mentality where like I have be at this level high, I have to do these things to get me where I need to be to be�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: � (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most of the time you can't have that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you're kind of going down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Down (inaudible), yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think it (inaudible) your relationship too because you mentioned that was a switch. You're not going to have this perfect, pure relationship all the time. You're not. And over time you (inaudible at 0:17:31.7) that either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you work at it, you have to constantly try, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I think as long as you're not thinking absolute, you'll be in a much better place emotionally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely do too. And I (inaudible at 0:17:47.9) myself. That is one thing I always tended towards that. And so I think that's going to be something I'm going, I going to have a struggle with a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But can you identify some situations where you find yourself saying, "I need to be a little more happier. I want a little happy?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes like sometimes like I will be perfect, like I will be contented, you know, like middle of the road happy. 0:18:15.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I like have to jolt myself although this isn't, you know, not doing something that makes me really, really happy. And so then I'll destruct my happiness and then when I, my contentedness to like strive for different acts of happiness like I stay on the couch reading a good book really enjoying that and having a nice time. I'm like, if I was really, really happy when I go out and go dancing. So I go out and go dancing and if it's happy but it's not like, "Oh my God this much, like, this is so working off the couch for me." I'm like, "Oh gosh (inaudible)."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are very good examples. So what can you do differently now with that example? 0:18:53.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean I can be like okay so (inaudible). I'm having a good time. I can do that. I can go dancing later if, you know, if the mood strikes me or I really want to go dancing—go dancing but don't have any expectations about where it's going get me or don't make any like comparisons like I would have been happier if I had stayed on the couch or�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �but it was worth it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And also I think it sounds like you kind of just, (inaudible at 0:19:16.4) your happiness at the moment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you do that, you remind yourself (inaudible) this is good, this is fine, and leave it at that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you don't need to achieve or agree on happiness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You know people find happiness in little things right�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �or being more content with things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. 0:19:39.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what about, if we're now talking about happiness and joy, what about boredom, do you get bored?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what do you do if you're bored?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when I get bored I've learned to do some of the things that were like when we were talking about like getting myself (inaudible at 0:19:56.9) distracted. But sometimes I get bored. I mean I think everybody does, but then I start feeling like crappy because I'm bored and I'm like, (inaudible at 0:20:10.1) bored until I feel bad about myself and then I don't do anything. Do you know what I mean (overlapping) dig yourself into that rut and then you're like, "Oh but I'm so unhappy that I am in this rut, but I just have to stay in this rut," kind of thing. I do that (inaudible at 0:20:20.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now boredom is that like if you're (inaudible) compliment, do you think it's absolute?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like really bad for you or is it kind of, can we bring the boredom in somewhere in the middle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean yes. I think it can be brought somewhere like into the middle. Like I'm not doing like torturous work year after year after year, like that would be painful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like just not having something to do for a couple of hours or just not doing something hugely like productive for few hours. 0:20:49.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's boredom.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That boredom but that's, that's livable, like that's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right, part of life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Yes� so characterized boredom is somewhere in the middle?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, yeah. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing that you just mentioned everyone sort of goes through that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Overlapping) like normal everyday boredom (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:21:11.0) about all the emotions that you're able to feel is in the middle range. 0:21:14.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there other emotion� maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible). Like I think there's a neutral like, you know what I mean? Like there's just a, not particularly having a great time, nothing horrible has happen I'm just�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you more okay moments, how often do you have that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really let myself have okay moments.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because okay moments I either have to fix them and make them supper happy moments or I fell like I (inaudible) having an okay moment and then (inaudible). 0:22:00.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Now I think we should increase more okay ones, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So okay moments are okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how can you get yourself into okay moments?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like am I striving to get into an okay moment (Overlapping)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're already in one, you're already in one and then it's just that you're not looking come out of it sort of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So I would imagine it would be something like how we do it like or how I thought about stomach—it's happening—okay this isn't bad. Like just saying like, okay, if this happens this is finalized this isn't horrible. 0:22:38.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean just kind of like the acceptance (inaudible) like a (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's exactly what it is. It's a (inaudible) thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're not fighting it. As long as you're acknowledging that it happened�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �okay (inaudible at 0:22:44.4) okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not, you know (overlapping) so when you're doing that and you hold to the absolute again�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �then you want to increase more of the okay moments.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So what puts you into okay moments or what kind of—you know, it could be situation or it could be thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot, a lot (inaudible) it's just like, okay, not particularly investing in what I'm doing and I find (ph) that particularly stimulating. It's not horrible. It's not like I'm stuck. So I'm just kind of like (inaudible at 0:23:29.5), and then outside of work, if I don't have anything going on, and I'm kind of tired to the point where like I will actually initiate something like with reading a book or something if I was just like sitting there, that's okay, that's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are excellent examples. Okay. Now you're at work, and it's not horrible, it's not (inaudible), it's okay, just kind of getting by�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �then what happens to you normally? (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Normally. So normally I plan�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �so like I plan (inaudible at 0:24:10.8) so I kind of escape the okay and I go like, all right so when we get work I going to do this and this and this, and then it'll be happy and then—so I just kind of think about that and just like shut off. So those are like my ways, I guess, of dealing with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now what would you like to do differently about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't know if it's like important that I should like really experience the okay moment or whether it's okay to just (inaudible at 0:24:41.8). I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). What's going on when you shut off your?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I just—it becomes (inaudible) like I might (inaudible) thing like (inaudible) I'm not invested in it. I just want to like actively in the moment like that is one time when my emotions are not going in every direction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So it's all like in this case you allowed yourself to have an okay moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) allow yourself (inaudible) okay moment. 0:25:12.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you—I think it's good that kind of planning all what's going to happen (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is all fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's great it sounds good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But since you are allowing yourself a couple okay moments�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �in that situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it works because it's (inaudible) I think I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And although you're not feeling those�</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �you're not feeling those up and downers, why should you, because you're allowing yourself to feel okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think yes because I have to, but I know like when I'm outside of work, I could be doing something that would make me happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. (Overlapping). So let's go to that outside of work, it's not like you're doing the okay thing at work. 0:25:43.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now outside of work you (inaudible) going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just like nothing (inaudible). What can you do (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think like I can't just time myself. It's okay to just hang out. This isn't hurting anybody, this isn't hurting me; I'm fine. I'll have happier moments in the future; this is cool for now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I'm fine, I'm comfortable, this is good. I mean I am purely happy all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And even if I strive for it, something will happen (overlapping). So it happens, I'll just enjoy the moment now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll be content.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you to increase (inaudible) moments a little bit more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I could, yes. I (inaudible) be really good. Yes. I like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping). Let's kind of summarize. Well for you this week, we're going to increase okay moments outside of work, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not striving for complete happiness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Anything else (inaudible at 0:27:09.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really like that one. And I also like sort of the, not strive for complete happiness but for setting perimeters on the bottom. 0:27:20.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, in which you've been doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Set perimeters on the negative switch, I'm going to say (inaudible) negative emotions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right. Because I can, I can have negative emotions that are thought based.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You need to have like a middle of the road, a bottom and top and in the middle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like it does�</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: �it makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. If something sad happens...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes sense for you to be sad. 0:27:47.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd be weird if you weren't sad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's not your sole (inaudible 0:27:53.5)�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �that becomes a little problematic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's true that we could feel full range of emotions and that's very healthy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when you're also feeling absolute emotion, then you get yourself in kind of a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right. I can totally see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I see that (inaudible) you can bring up examples from your life of (inaudible). 0:28:13.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how are things going with you in terms of work? I know you had bad thoughts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's so crazy. Now she's so herself and I know it isn't me. I keep doing that, you know, like it's not, it's not you it's just the way she acting right now. And like it's nice because it is kind of absurd, like some of it's just absurd. So I'm kind of like seeing (inaudible) stories when they're older, you'll like to tell your kids about your (inaudible). You know what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's just kind of like (inaudible). 0:29:01.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. So I mean it's (inaudible) but again I am like accepting it because I have to and that's (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great. So are you dealing with your supervisor leaving? Did she leave yet or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she's still looking to get out. So that's probably going to happen by this summer come. But I've started, I've also started making plans for what I'm going to do maybe in the future so, or at least start thinking more seriously about it, so it kind gives me an out. You know I don't feel like this (inaudible) be all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible at 0:29:38.0) pretty good plan to have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are your plans like when you're?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've always wanted to go back to school. I really, I really do want to go back to school and I'm starting to look into some different things but I am interested in and I'll learn more about and so I'm looking at different like classes here and stuff like that, getting involved in some more like volunteer programs and stuff that's kind of are in line with my interests.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what are your interests.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really, I always really (inaudible), I really like people. I'm very much like a people person I think goes along with my whole emotion. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) connect very well with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. And so I—my mom is a special education teacher and so I was always around (inaudible) so like I'm in this program called (inaudible) where they pair you up with an emotionally challenged or physically civil person and you just like (inaudible at 0:30:39.0) and hang out with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I'm doing that online and then I'm going to do that also, like you know, one-on-one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was involved in (inaudible) so I really like that. And then I actually like this whole experience. I've also been kind of drawn to social work. And so my—but I've been kind of thinking about career—oh no, no, no—career paths and just believe that I can (inaudible) and learn like what talents and gifts they have could be best used.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So something like that, I think, would be good, a little bit dangerous because I know how emotionally like sapping that can be, like that kind of profession. And I'm a little bit worried about my, my tendency to go with my emotion, how that could (inaudible). But something like that would be interesting. And then to be perfectly honest, like, what I'm learning here could help me so profoundly that I'd be really interested in like learning more about like this kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, that's a great idea. So it's (inaudible) it's just sort of written in the same kind (inaudible) line.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). Because I did a lot of groups and kind of do different things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think so too. I've been so long—like I've planning on going back to school and (inaudible) and I've been putting it off like for real like my job and stuff. It's not (inaudible) so that's not why I should be investing like so much time. So I can accept that part of my life through my acceptance being at work and outside with others.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's good that you experience (inaudible)�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �because you don't learn things (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you need to have the experience (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly and I think that's so the way it was in my case and like just thinking about the future like in dealing with people, I think I'll be able to be so much more empathic knowing what it's like (inaudible at 0:32:43.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And also I think that you know, I think it's just (inaudible) that you should like, like you have boss who's very (inaudible) I think�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �but what it teaches you like�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �or to like to deal with people like that too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everyone's going to be loving and great to you, people are going to be tough on you. It's a harsh world out there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It certainly is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just saying that we (inaudible) match the world. (inaudible) go along with that or (inaudible). Just like live life in a better (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and I'm really loving being bold to like start to connect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, I mean, I don't want to sound like some crazy fanatic about you guys, you know you really have helped me with changing my thought, how I (inaudible) different things. 0:33:28.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) feels like (inaudible) it's because you were going away and you weren't thinking things rationally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you got the tools, you're able to think very rationally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) call an eye-opening kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. (inaudible) the first thing I thought before the (inaudible) make (inaudible) problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. We come in, everyone come in with (inaudible) (overlapping). (Laughter). Yes, that's the society we live and you can't help that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you choose to believe it, you have a choice (inaudible). It's just (inaudible) you have a choice. You choose to believe it, then you got to deal that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then, you know, it's like (inaudible) with teaching other people and you don't (inaudible) yourself at how you teaches other people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we actually (inaudible) ourselves�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �and talk about our rational beliefs and how (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping) rational belief or than any other (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yes. It sounds really great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I let you (inaudible)�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �and like (inaudible) situation, but you my fault basically, You might take a step back, (inaudible at 0:34:35.5) it could be yourself, it could be, you know, it could be anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. I think some triggers are like, if I fall a little bit for some reason, I think I'll get really—I still have that tendency, I think, where I come down really hard on myself and I feel really bad about it. So I just need to be weary of keeping that in check.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I'm not doing the whole slippery slope thing like (inaudible) one little thing, which I've been doing a lot better at but I mean like I know it has been like a problem (inaudible) because I start making like real, real, casual progress, and I know it's hard sometimes when I fall a little bit. And like I recognize that. So it's when those things start to happen being able to like use what I've learned enough to cut it off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. And also if you don't fall, you're not going (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. 0:35:38.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you need to fall a couple of times to get stronger to just get better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you never fail, like how you get better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So if you do (inaudible), you've got to do better next time�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: �kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I like that way of thinking. And I know there are like trigger thing is I need to learn to disassociate things from (inaudible), like one bad thing happening and like another one, you know, three things that are bad happening in the span of hour. I'm like, "Oh my God the world's against me." I still going to have that tendency, I know, to just have (inaudible) like into one (inaudible) very huge issue of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like (inaudible) too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is. It is completely, because now you're looking for bad days. You're looking for evidence (inaudible). Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can be good at finding evidence but (Overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what can you do in those situations?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I need to just like, like take the moment, I really like the whole like (inaudible) and I said to here like stop when think about and be like I just felt, okay so I just felt that was it, unrelated to the fact that, you know, I'm going to trip again in two minutes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like something like that. Yes and just like (inaudible) like this obviously has there's no (inaudible) relationship. 0:37:19.2</p>

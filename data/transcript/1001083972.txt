<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how have you been?  I haven't seen you in how long?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, about four months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three months?  Four month.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That went fast, three months.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You sweet thing.  Um, I have had serious thoughts of suicide lately, really, really bad. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, is something happening or what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I took my son to his [AGE] birthday lunch and, um, we got into a big fight.  He thought I should pay for lunch.  I told him the person with the money pays for lunch.  It was only a ten dollar lunch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, Jesus, you fought over that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  He already owes me seventeen thousand dollars, so he yelled at me all the way home and talked to me the same way that my parents talk to me.  Nobody ever owes me anything, you know, and all my tough luck and I need to do something about it and so he drove me home and I had made a bunch of, um, do you want me to sit over there? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sit where?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, by the window.  So, uh, he was going to dump me off at home and I was trying to pick up the copies of Boston Legal I had made for him and, um, so then I decided, I said, you're not going away like this, you come inside and I want you to think of me like you do a client, yknow, with some compassion and looking to see what you can do to help me, yknow, instead of getting all over my case like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I said I had no idea you hated me so much.  So he changed his tone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did he apologize?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he just turned back into my son instead of a lawyer.  I told you ever time, since he graduated from law school he turned into a lawyer and he's just no fun to be with anymore and I think he feels guilty about not repaying me that money because he kept saying you're not going to make me feel guilty, yknow, and I hadn't mentioned anything about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, I hadn't said anything about it except that the person with the money pays for lunch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He obviously makes more than you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he should pay me for the [AGE], yknow, years ago, the fifteen hours of labor and the life I gave him and then he told me what a crappy mother I'd been all his life and putting up with that and it was just, it was awful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it sounds like it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, um, anyway, but then I had my little daughter coming over and visiting and her boyfriend's out of town for ten days so she's coming over to visit and so I cooked for her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so that's all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's all real good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, but I've been in a lot of pain the last few days, the last week or so, um, and some of it I thought was from the weather, but even on the good days - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have not been feeling good.  Now I didn't take my Zoloft for two or three nights, every other night, about a week ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You should have made it up, you didn't.  You know, if you realized you'd forgotten it -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I did it on purpose.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I thought that was what was making me fat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, that's not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You lie, you lie, but anyway - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That may have contributed to this though - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, um, well anyway, I was just kind of testing it, yknow, um, anyway I noticed that I was in more pain so I went back, you know, back on them.  So they are doing me good, I think, for pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think we should increase it, that's not a big dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to increase it, remember I cut it in half, I don't know why I cut it in half, but I am not being able to sleep without the Seroquel.  Um, the Seroquel, I had to cut it to really tiny pieces, it dries my mouth out so much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What size are you on?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It keeps waking me up.  25, I think, and I cut it in half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's as small as they make.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know and I cut it in half, um, because it dries my mouth out so much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's unusual, but it must be doing it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's one of the, what's unusual?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The dry -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The dry mouth?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's the first I've heard that complaint but, yknow - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's always been really awful, in fact, that's why I cut it down, yknow, I kept cutting it down, but I found that it worked and it does give me a good night's sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's worth it then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Xanax I just use during the day to kind of keep me kind of from bouncing off the walls but, um, oh, so anyway, one good thing that came out of that visit with my son was, um, yknow, to do something and I said yeah well my doctor has been telling me, my psychiatrist has been telling me to do that for ages and he said well that's the first good thing he ever told you.  I said you don't know anything about what he's told me.  You never talk to me, you don't know what's going on in my life and you don't care, yknow, I said, but he had been telling me to do that so I think I'm going to go to the [DEIDENTIFIED], but I'm afraid of it because I always cry when I see those, you know, pictures of the soldiers when they give them - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's a few like that, but it's not - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some of them are in there for, um, so anyway, I did apply the next day on line</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, they didn't call me back so I followed up and followed up and so I put make up on today, maybe I'll go over there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get out a little.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've got to sign up and then they get you to the general medical doctor and then - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, you get a lot of free healthcare.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm hoping that they'll let me do some physical therapy, that turning upside down thing that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] wants me to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know about that.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I used to have a pool, I would wrap a noodle around my neck and get in the deep end.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing gave me relief like that.  I could have spent, I could live like that.  Um, it's the only thing that really relieves all of this, but she said something about something that could turn, yknow, one of those tables that you - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I never heard that had that, but they might.  Don't get your hopes up because they ain't got everything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right, but if I'm in the middle of physical therapy for all those other guys, there may be something that they could do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They have a pool, I know that for sure.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That would be great, that would be great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is there a heated pool you could get to?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> None of my friends have heated pools and, yknow, my pool was so nice, it was so small and in the sun I could get in it about nine months out of the year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And God that was great, that floating like that, because it just let everything go and I have done a little bit of exercise, but it always, yknow, the next day I have a lot of cramps.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, and it's just because I'm not moving around probably enough, but I try and get outside everyday for a bit of sun and do something in the yard, that's what all these scars are from.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Those aren't from him? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cutting back the, huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your son didn't do that to you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, no, he wouldn't raise his hand to me, but boy he can sure, um, hurt my feelings.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he's a lawyer, he can just do it with words.  There's no use getting in an argument with a lawyer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Well, yknow, when he first started acting like that with me, I said listen, I'm still your mother, don't, turn off that lawyer crap with me.  You know, I don't want to hear that shit, I'm your mother.  But it was the most, he said the most hurtful things.  He said I'm so angry with you, I want to eviscerate you right now.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Jesus.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He has anger problems. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He has anger problems.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He probably is with other people, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no, he blames the divorce and everything on me and I have taken responsibility for it, which when I think back, it really wasn't all my fault.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, it takes two people to make a divorce.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Same as it takes two to make a good marriage.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but, yknow, he listened to my siblings who are, yknow - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that don't help you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, exactly.  And my mother at age [AGE] just put new windows all over her house and told me there wasn't going to be a distribution out of the trust because there was so much expense this year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, for windows.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For her windows at [AGE] and he's [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, maybe they want to be safe.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it was just stupid because I told her this house is going to be a tear down.   They're in [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow, they're going to tear that house.  Well, it's a well built house.   No, no, no - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That doesn't matter.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know.  So anyway. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How old is your daughter?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's [AGE] and way precious.  Um, she's got a really great heart.  Oh my, um, endocrinologist took these blood tests.  It looks like everything's okay.  They also did a bone density, but they wouldn't tell me the answer until next week.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sugar's good.  Thyroid's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hadn't eaten anything, but coffee and sugar that day, plus that's only two hours after I took my thyroid medicine and look how low normal it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, thyroid, uh, is like a slow motion thing, that wouldn't matter for this.  This is TSH anyway.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right and this doctor really believes the TSH.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That number is the number she wants to know.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have it suppressed, I don't know how low she wants it but - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I always thought my thyroid should be as high normal as possible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but this is, you don't understand, the other test, the T3, T4.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's how much is floating around in your blood.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now that much goes up to the center of your brain and tells it how much TSH to put out because the TSH goes to your thyroid and tells it how much to put in your blood, so you see, this is not a blood thyroid thing, this has got to do with the brain connection to the thyroid.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The thyroid stimulating hormone, right? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In your case, you want that low.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right and that's why she's so happy and I told her well when I took higher doses, I was thinner, but I wasn't eating ice cream.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, you've got to sacrifice to lose weight.  I mean, I'm telling you that from personal experience.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you need prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I need for Xanax and, um, I don't know if I need the Zoloft or not because I cut them all in half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think I've got refills on that unless they expire.  I won't go any lower and I'm not even stopping it because it actually, I think, is helping me with the pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well that's good to hear.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh and they finally came out with an ad on TV that if you commute more than ninety minutes a day that you're going to get the pain in the ass just like I have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You mean, total during the day, like, because I go forty five minutes each way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That counts?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so because I was driving, mine was, uh, it was twenty five miles each way and then even though traffic would be bad but, you see, you're not sitting all day behind a computer pushing a computer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You get up and walk around so they said sit up straight while you're driving the car, don't slouch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And have a car with a real good seat.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's true.  Yeah, mine is a little sports car and this seat is hard so I probably should have had something else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you'll probably need the Zoloft.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you think I ought to go back up to the dose you prescribed?  I don't know why I cut it in half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you've been doing that for a while.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's been for quite a while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But there's no harm in it, if you're going to like change it, like try the whole pill - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you've got to give that about two weeks to see what it's doing.  You can't just do a day or two.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Does that give dry mouth, too?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Usually not but, you know, maybe you get that easily or something.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The only thing that really gives it to me is the Seroquel.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But gosh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing that - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's wonderful for sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have no alternative for that. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Seroquel, have you got enough of that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, oh yeah, you gave me some last time, but they're 100 mg so I'm going to have to mash them and lick my finger, because I'm going to run out of Medicare benefits in July.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That window you mean?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  During Christmas I was so, I was like frozen in time, I couldn't move for two weeks during Christmas, it was awful and I was invited to actually four parties, I didn't go to any of them and that was the time that was my last chance to call in, so I finally called in on Monday and said, yknow, I don't know why y'all told me I was okay, we started in June last time and I ran out in December.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got a whole year this time.  I said don't you cut anybody a break for being sick.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the rules.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh gosh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The rules.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, so now the Zoloft, I can just go ahead and take the 100 mg.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, try it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Start that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'll have plenty to do that so - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right, okay, very good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I hope your son got it off his chest for the next ten years or whatever.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so too and actually he did call today, um, and asked me where was my pain and I told him it's the sciatic nerve.  He must have learned something because he's a personal injury.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's a lawyer.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, no, he's a personal injury so they learn a lot about medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And plus that add just came out about the - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the driving. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, so I think he's finally believing me rather than my brother who's a personal injury attorney who decided that I wasn't really sick.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I see.</p>

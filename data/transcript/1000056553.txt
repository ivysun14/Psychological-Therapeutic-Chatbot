<p>COUNSELOR: Hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just trying to (inaudible 0:00:44.0). How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, a little spaced out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Also, some funny things to me happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. What has been happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, lots of stuff. Uhm, one thing, I tell my parents about the shoplifting thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, my mom really freaked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which like completely surprised me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because in some way I really put it away like I felt like dead end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like a whole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't really put it away, but it's not like terrifying to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In any way. But she just like started crying, and, you know, just doing all sorts of really weird shit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:02:02.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, it's really distressing to realize that she was that crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun, uh-hun. It almost it made you angry, too, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it did, it did because she didn't I mean I feel like I learned a whole lot from it. And I would almost do it again yeah I would do it again. At least after I learned from it, from just being able to handle something by myself. Uhm, and that's what pisses me because she can she is really good at everybody else's problems right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, she is really the person to talk to and, you know, all my friends, junkies or, you know, unhappy people or whatever can only talk to her right and she is super understanding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if something happens to me, you know, and, and also she just makes like she's a, you know, Miss Mimm as she is she's still into making good and bad the economy, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are either a good person or an evil person. And she really doesn't do that to other people she is very sliding morality with other people right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But with me she has got this funny way of really puritanical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She is she didn't like scold me morally that much </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although she would have liked too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Her social working has stopped her from doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But uhm, it's not she is just like super overprotective, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like she said oh I just think of you in prison. Every time she like said that six or seven times would burst into hysterical tears.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I really felt like she was crying about something else not quite that. You know, like it had to do with me somewhat. It had to do with me that she was crying but I wasn't sure what it was she was really crying about. And then she called up the next day when I wasn't home and told my, told Carmen, my roommate, something, something I can't even put the words the message was that I love you again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like, you know, she had taken it away. (0:04:05.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I told her about it and then she's calling back and </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That she really did love me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's just like what kind of shit, you know. My dad, of course, is really good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He is very good when it comes to the heavy stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's not very good day to day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he is good whenever it comes to some big something. But I had to tell them because ah a check was going to come to them because I gave the police their address.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was just a little bit weird like I haven't wanted to call them back up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And talk to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then all the like weird stuff that is going on. Uhm, I guess I'm like (inaudible 0:05:04.7) to talk about it but I have been thinking about it for so long. And I have been doing weird stuff, you know. I must feel guilty because of not being able to say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It would be a shame.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and confused I'm not yeah. Like I'm a Capricorn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my tarot card, do you know anything about the tarot?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the tarot card that corresponds to Capricorn is the devil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's his picture uhm of this kind of hairy beast kind of evil powerful but something a little bit pathetic. (0:06:11.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay about this like it was this great big beast with hairy arms and just kind of repulsive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And underneath him, have I ever told you about this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The lovers.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right and it's those people with chains around their necks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right they are like lovers but it's all icky right it's like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sexual perversion of sex or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyway, and that's and I started getting that card a whole bunch of (inaudible 0:06:41.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's (inaudible 0:06:42.9). Uhm, uhm actually going to steel balls or something to roll.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something to play with, do you have a slinky or uhm Play-Dough? Anything uhm I'll play with my ring, good. Uhm, and when I started getting that a whole, I started getting that a whole bunch in my tarot. Whenever I would throw it when I, when I stopped, when I decided to stop and see a few people. So it really felt like I had gotten into this thing of just sleeping with whoever wanted to sleep with me, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I had any kind of attraction to them. Uhm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse, excuse me you throw your tarot when you're deciding to, you did when you decided to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no I've been I've, you know, got into it a whole bunch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been more or less, you know, I might read about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and throw them and talk to people who knew about tarot and a lot this summer too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But uhm but I, you know, I was like in the process of deciding.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I was in the process of like sleeping with too many people and I continually got this same card. (0:08:03.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which started to like be real obvious to me what was going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, and then I and then I apparently I threw my tarot (inaudible 0:08:18.3), well no I have I threw it all during the summer. But uhm it hasn't, you know, like the card hasn't been the important card it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just like this afternoon I wasn't feeling good I hadn't got enough sleep so I went home and went to sleep after my morning class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Went to bed and when I woke up I couldn't remember my dream but the only image I had was the image of that card.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was kind a carrying it in my head until I got here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I just have this feeling like I'm really worried that I'm going I'm going do that same thing because I was really stupid and I slept with Dexter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the guy you told me about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And all the while and it was really crazy because all the while I was like telling I was telling him all this mixed up messages, right? All the time I was saying uhm stuff like well, you know, you can't think of me as your woman and you can't depend on me in a sexual way because I really, you know, I want to be more your friend then your lover but, you know, I slept with him. Right, and, and I was like making sure because I really like him and I was making sure that he knew that I, I liked him but that I was that I couldn't be depended on to be his girlfriend right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to be in that kind of roll, but as a precaution I slept with him right but I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, you know, I'm not quite sure what that whole thing was. And it was pretty crazy. Uhm and I mean it was I mean I don't know. (0:10:03.4). It's strange to because he is so incredible feminine and he's so really beautiful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Scary and both appreciated him for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and also kind of that a little bit that I couldn't seem to (inaudible 0:10:23.4) sleeping with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Expect which is really a feminine man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, at, at some point even while I was fucking being aware that, that it would really be nice if you would be in bed with Cathy then it would be, be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I really, really, really, really love Cathy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas as I, I really care about him he seems like a real fine person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't have this strong friendship with him that I have with Cathy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just like, you know, and that was Cathy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then and then, you know, the reason I stopped sleeping with guys kind was because they wouldn't ever be as attractive to me again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In an emotional way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, somehow and that's kind of I've been trying to make it not happen I'm trying but I know that in some way, you know, I knew I looked forward to seeing him a whole bunch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I would see him every time before I'm now like, you know, I want to be friends with him because he's really good and I think he really needs friends and stuff he's super lonely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I am there anticipation isn't there it's almost a little bit more like an obligation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just feel like I</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Starting to do that same fucking people over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I didn't even stop there right? Like I went to a lascivious costume ball and was kind of, you know, I left it for awhile because it was slightly repulsive and that it was very (inaudible 0:11:50.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had this feeling like (inaudible 0:11:54.3) and everybody is super perversed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In this icky way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, uhm and it's and then later in the evening I came back to it all once my friends were there. And, Carmen I told you about her she's not (inaudible 0:12:11.4) not my roommate but Holly's roommate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I were like walking around and we were joking because we're like all sorts of people that we have never seen before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we both noticed this one boy, this one long haired obviously (inaudible 0:12:27.8) just go hippy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it never of us had seen before and we were both like caught each other looking at him and</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Smiling </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And kind of teased each other for part of the evening with it right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then saw him later and we both were very aware of him. Uhm and then I, you know, then, you know, disappeared into the rest of the evening or had gone about it. And then as, as I was leaving uhm I turned around in the crowd there was a crowd milling around in the lobby at all times and I was trying to get a ride from a friend. And turned around and he was like walking up behind me and he smiled at me and I smiled at him say can I do you have a place to crash, do you know where I can crash. So I said sure because my roommate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Isn't home and there's this (inaudible 0:13:12.5) you could have. I was like about to say ah no gee I really don't know and I realized, right, well there's room in my apartment. And then like the whole thing went through my mind right? Was is it all going to be mean so I said well okay yeah. And we came home and he was real nice and we talked to like 6 in the morning and he's just very beautiful looking. And he has come to New York to, to make and sell water beds and he's from the State of Oregon and nice stuff and I told him I wouldn't sleep with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, but he could sleep beside me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he is nice, big cuddly but I really didn't want to fuck, so we played that all that night, right? (0:14:01.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And early morning got some sleep in and when I woke up later ah in the morning we ah we slept together. And it was real nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Much to my absolute surprise right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, but I still have like a funny like I still don't know if it's okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For myself. The gals that I have to work because he's like then went to the north side and I don't know if I will ever see him again. It doesn't quite matter if I do or if I don't, you know, I don't have very much feeling one way or the other. I don't feel as icky because it's not quite as personal. But I just have a feeling like oh no, you know, what am I doing and can I only relate to man sexually and how come nobody wants to just be my no men just wants to be my friend. And then to conglomerate things even more I spent most of yesterday with this guy Jeremy Kitzland, he's a really good friend of my old apartment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he is real nice and I was working late yesterday and he was (inaudible 0:15:00.0) he comes, you know, it was completely unsexual tension.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Basically because I would just never think of him in those terms because he is like a friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except that he's not a very good friend he's just kind of a person that I knew a friend of all my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And spent a lot of the day with him. And he lots of times comes over and sleeps in our living room. It's like, you know, he and Ken Dempsey, do that, you know, a couple of times every month. And so he came over after finished work with me so (inaudible 0:15:35.8). And had a nice time. Stayed up until about 3 in the morning when Carmen went to sleep. And I started to go started to walk off to my bedroom and he like took my arm and asked me if he could stay with me. At which point I just really popped right? I just this feeling of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, three men in three days, you know, and I just told him no I couldn't handle it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (0:16:01.9) </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and but also the same thing of really being drawn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really feeling it's like</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like real strong sexual thing inside of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then wanting to sleep with him but knowing that I that's like I can't do it and sometimes day and sometimes mounting and I'm almost like Ross Vineman in people. He's like I enjoy being with him more than I enjoy being with any of the other people. He's like the one I didn't sleep with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and it's just like but also like how come everything I don't know it's like very mixed up to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just not clear of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And something confusing about it and </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've like consulted for so long and then swash, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All at the same time I just like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feel really I really wonder what I'm sending out, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it can't be, you know, it can't be totally that all of a sudden, you know, it must like I'm sending out something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I also then feel almost helpless to it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm now aware of sending it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. So kind of confused in a sense where you don't quite know what you're doing and what's happening and you're use to understanding your head and then you don't quite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And also just that's all, you know, it's all, all like bound up around sex so it's just really confusing to me anyway and I try to deal with it by not dealing with it for a whole.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For a really long time, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I thought okay I figured it all out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I start (inaudible 0:17:37.6) to somebody about a month ago right or just like wanting to be around a guy in that way and then all of a sudden it, you know, it's back in the same old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Icky pattern.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's that </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sexually exploiting people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And being exploited and feeling, you know. But it's not all completely bad either because like sleeping with, with Ken. (0:18:05.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, was just super nice, you know, it was like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. So it's just like it's just real confusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well you see it's confusing like partly it's confusing it's just a lot to, to take in emotionally. Like it would be sort of enough just sort of grasp that you slept with Dexter. Just that would be, you know, it's almost like it would take you a week to get that straight in your head. And if I but, but already, you know, a few more things piling in on top of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And I know, it just seems like no matter what I do I can't get like any kind of understanding about my sexual self at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Because every single of this, you know, I know that there has been that I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I know that I know that I'm really attracted and I know that it's really hard to say no. And I wonder why it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It hurts to say no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I wonder, I wonder why there is such a big question and somewhere in my head I know that, that emotionally I'm not going to be able to handle it, I'm going to fuck it up in my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:20:00.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that sleeping with Dexter in summer wasn't a good thing to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I knew it all the time before, during, after.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, just and I still or I didn't say no because my body was saying yes, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, is like one operating without the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It only operates fine to get me into, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but couldn't have an orgasm with Dexter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anywhere near it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was too much saying no by that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and that's just that's like almost like mad at my body, like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How the hell do you get me into this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And at least, you know, and I feel relieved that at least I enjoyed it a whole bunch with Ken.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least did with me. Because then it would have then I would really feel fucked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I almost like okay that's the kind of things happen, he was nice and then I don't feel, you know, I don't feel like I hurt him or he hurt me or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just nice and let it go at that. I'm a little suspicious of, of that kind of philosophy but I really did dismiss it that way kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. So what happens when somebody is asking you and you're turned on I have a moment of should I or shouldn't I, right? What's like at that point?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Lots of times I just go blank.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And lots of times like with Strauss last night I know it was I know some kind of like there's a bit of pure sexual ego stuff in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:22:05.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, like Strauss is really, Strauss is really lonely and Strauss' mom just died at the beginning of the year and he's like, he's in graduate school here and he is just real bright and just super funny but there is something very sad about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, ah that I just got I just once in awhile have glimpses into.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and I know he hasn't had a woman for a really long time in any kind of way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and I know that he really likes me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there is like this moment of, you know, like there's something in him that was like really visibly aching right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was at one an attraction because you could see because I could see them at another time another way kind of a repulsion because that's all I would be doing it didn't really matter who I was or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just going to be taking away his soothing his tensions. Uhm, and there's a little bit of this sexual ego thing in it like, it's hard to say it. Uhm, something about knowing I don't know something really icky like knowing that guys like to sleep with me (inaudible 0:23:51.3) and something about being a good fuck or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, there is some kind of ego thing in it like I could make him feel good but it's, I don't know what it is, you know. (0:24:04.6) And some of it</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Proud of being a good fuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But you could, also by the way I say it, you can tell that I don't uhm in other way like ashamed of the whole concept, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because good fucker are such ugly words, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just the way they are said like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, also I'm always really conscious of the morning. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm always conscious of knowing that I'm not going to wake up, I'm not going to wake up in the morning happy, right? And it always runs through my head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just when I getting, just when I turned on right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That, don't do this because in the morning you're not going to like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and it's like a little voice that like says that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, and I play little games with myself like telling Ken that won't sleep with him, right? But playing with him all night but not quite fucking, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, uhm. And then in the morning when I'm really drowsy and I'm not, you know, completely awake I kind of like let it all happen, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And get into it. Just like I'm playing, you know. I just had these flashes of this Loretta Young movie, did you ever see this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, great, it's just this really it's like the dumbest moving I have even seen (0:26:04.6), but I saw it a couple of weeks ago and it was about Loretta Young and two sides of, you know, one she is portraying this like really totally split personality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One super straight laced, tight assed woman, and the other a nurse or something and the other and she's also a sleep walker and she falls asleep and changes into a completely different person that is very lascivious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, totally voluptuous, sexy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Woman, right? And it was like a really dumb movie but it, you know, and it's not blatant like that. But it just has the feeling like there's a, but just feeling of split feels the same a little bit like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean like when I get turned on I feel like there's this like other thing happening that I'm not really in control of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I don't know it's, it's really hard even to like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This other thing like sort of adventurous and romantic, evil in sort of an interesting way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's not quite evil. Uhm, I guess just like falling into being, something to do with acting and feeling very sexy or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm. (0:28:01.1) I don't know. Like something kind of abandoned about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that's, that is a really big part of it. It's just like what the heck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, the moment is the only thing that I can (inaudible 0:28:22.7, due to noise).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because all there is is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This moment and you can't, you know, how can you be saying no to the things that you want to do at the moment, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doing things for a past is no way to live in, you know, worrying about the future is no way to live. And that, and that argument is the one that always wins or, you know, has been winning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And I don't know who I respect more right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I don't know who to follow. I don't know because I kind of can live that way. I mean, you know, my temptation is to leave school and just to travel right? And not know exactly where I'm going the next quarter. But just like, you know, day by day go different places.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's the same kind of spirit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, but this other  - - there's another part that I really respect and is why I was celibate. You know, not celibate, it's such a strong word. That's why I didn't sleep with anybody for so long. Uhm, because I really wanted to be true to something else that I knew that was inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Which has to do with really wanting to be honest with myself and people, and I also really respect that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. (0:30:08.8) I don't know. But somewhere just the idea of having slept with a whole lot of people, it's repulsive to me. Somewhere of the idea like, you know, not being able to remember the names of people I have slept with, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just totally abhors me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just, you know. Yuck. I like had to come in here and figure it out before it went any further, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because tomorrow </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tomorrow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I also like tomorrow like, right, you know, it has been one a day like I feel like I'm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, due for a fuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know, I can't possibly imagine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What it could be but it's just like. I'm also somehow I guess what wanting a feeling, telling which one is right and which one is wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit it's like that, you know, if only I could know which one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's the right thing to do, then it wouldn't be quite so hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A part of the problem now is because both of them, you know, theoretically can make sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, do what you want to do when you want to do, and then don't worry about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Regretting stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (0:32:03.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like from the (inaudible 0:32:04.6) it really isn't clear. If, if you really knew what was good, you could do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess that's one thing I'm worried about, that, you know, I fool myself enough so that even if I did know it was good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't, I wouldn't necessarily do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, with Dexter or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's kind of not quite being able to depend on myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also wanting to like pretend I know that wanting to pretend it didn't happen, is like a really big thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the way of like my avoiding stuff, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, like I slept with Dexter, but I made him go away late that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I didn't want to wake up in the bed the next morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And feel shitty and dislike him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and that's crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is utterly crazy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But somehow if he wasn't there then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it didn't happen or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It didn't quite happen, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's not feeling like you may well do some icky thing next, but I think with some sort of flimsy but plausible sounding thought about it but really it's just fooling yourself. (0:34:02.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that somewhere in here there is this thing of proving your sexual identity or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, maybe not so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I just those words occurred to me and I'm not really sure what I meant by that. But also this - somewhere there is this feeling that I want to be, some part of me wants to be clean in this way of that whatever I do it's okay. Ah, whatever I do I could be able I could tell my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, but I know, like you're the only person I've told this too, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't want to tell anybody else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't even and Holly who will love me no matter what or Emma who will.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't want to tell either of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hun, uh-hun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it's not clean, it feels dirty to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's dirty well I guess dirty and icky have always have an element of weak for you. (0:36:00.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's the biggest part of it. Like that's really how, that's really true, I'm glad to know that. Uhm, yeah it's completely hard. I see it better in my, not strong enough to keep to what I have decided to do. But that has weakened wanting somebody to be able to give me some kind of reassurance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I can get free inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of me. The other thing is I just, guess it's confusing because I can't really get down to the basis of what I really feel about it. Like there is so much, like there is so much I feel (inaudible 0:37:03.0) wondering about, why should I be concerned about, you know, that I can't really figure I can't stick to I can't be consistent, you know. I can't really get down to exactly what it is that I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of, I don't think I understand exactly what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, well like uhm, just some feeling like if I was sure that I wanted to not slept with somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Until, until right? Until I find whoever it is that I'm looking for, until, UNTIL. (0:38:06.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With a capital, you know. If I was sure that was what I wanted then maybe I could just like stick to that. But then my body, which is a pretty basic thing, right? Goes and says at some point gee lets sleep with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, uhm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your body says oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, you know. It's like really confusing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like which do I want? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's more important for me to do and I, you know, whenever the decision comes I really am clear about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have a feeling like, like I was really - I didn't know all the time Strauss was asking me yesterday, we went through a scene for a little while. It wasn't really icky because Strauss is too nice to make it terribly icky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it, you know, that scene is never comfortable either, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, uhm, and I didn't know any of that time what I was going to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just have no idea if I was going to sleep with him or not, you know. And then I just heard myself saying no and I didn't really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was almost quite as if you had done it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was almost like I had flipped a coin right? And it, you know, I didn't, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just like it wasn't really me who was studying, it wasn't like a decision I just like kind of ended up saying something, right? You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he ended up okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Actually, too bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But only. It wasn't as if I knew what I was doing and I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was saying no because I was in touch with something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And either didn't want to do it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just kind of like I ended up, you know, it just.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost out of weariness with not knowing stuff. (0:40:06.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. So some how it feels like I'm not being straight inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I don't know how to get down to the point where I am straight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not even know if I have ever been straight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't remember being sure of something. I just like how friends of mine decide like that they just want to leave school for sure, they just know that they want to leave school, and they don't want to be in school any more. You know, can't like make a decision like that either like I, you know, I just feel like I kind a end up saying yes or no then, right? You know, I just say, you know, do what I have said, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it doesn't look like it has been a decision that I know where the decision comes from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just feels like I kind a drifted back into going to sch... to school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: From year to quarter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, I mean beginning of the fall. And then I might drift out of school, but I don't feel like it's because I've been in touch with any of the real sure feeling. Like my father, my father quit I mean it like really amazes me I think about it a lot, how other people seem to have really distinct feelings. And I don't think I have I don't remember those kind of distinct feelings about. And when my father decided he was really going to quit his job, he was a business man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And at 26 years of doing it and then he just decided no he can't do that any more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum, uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. And he quit business. It was a gigantic thing he was really in debt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:42:00.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really respect him for doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't remember ever having had that kind of feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Knowing something and following it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sharp and definite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. And I just feel so, you know, amorphous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Everything is real soft edged.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean no edges at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just mushy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And sometimes the mushy drifts over here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing that I'm mushy on like these attractions, you know, like, like Marco and Georgia and John, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My feelings about them aren't mushy. I mean </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are really strong and sharp and, and true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You can trust them and hold onto them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You know, I know that I really feel them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In all </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't have that thing about any kind of feelings that I can think of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, I've never really realized this. I never like said it out loud like that. I think it's really true. But I don't know where that, you know, I don't know what that does. Do you feel things really, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sharply.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Powerfully and sharply?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you would for so reason. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I, I have a lot of trouble making up my mind and like I see</p>

<p>people fuzzy things a lot and can't make up my mind but I don't think it's the same. I think I definitely see both sides of it. Yeah. (0:44:11.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's a whole bunch of the same I mean I. I wrote this thing a kind of paper to myself about that once because I didn't know what to do in politics because I could see both sides of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, just completely impossible for me to make a decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I couldn't convince myself of one (inaudible 0:44:46.8) because the other might would make too much sense and I would hear it as soon as I convinced myself of the other one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jesus, did I hate it. Just like just totally confusing. And that's what happened with Strauss to decide whether to go back to John or not to leave school and go back to John and I could not decide. I list a reams of pages of things that would literally make a column of all the pros and the cons. But I don't mean that quite now. (Inaudible 0:45:25.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. This is, you know, a thought way, way out in left field but do you think part of what throws you for a loop is being attracted to girls a little? Because that sort of, I don't know throw something out for grabs or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm sure that has something to do though I don't know where it fits though, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I've never had I guess I've never been in the kind of situation where I would literally get turned on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum. (0:46:07.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: To a girl. It never been and, you know, I keep touch girls I hug them and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's like a regular sensual part of my life, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It isn't specifically sexual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhm, I'm sure it has something to do with it, you know, especially since because this is okay much more thinking about it now then just ever, ever before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially since that thing with Dexter when I was even consciously aware. I'm not sure if I was aware then or if I just think I was but I think I was aware then that something flashed in my head about Cathy. Because I had seen Cathy that night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Talked to her really briefly. She looked real beautiful. Uhm, and that kind of freaked me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit. But it's still enough in the realm of thought, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It hasn't, but I don't know I'm sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not at all the same kind of confession as actually sleeping with a guy which is something you've done and sometime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But I'm sure it has something to do with it especially since, since, especially with Dexter because Dexter is just so obviously beautiful girl's face.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

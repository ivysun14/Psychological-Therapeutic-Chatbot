<center><p><b>REALITY THERAPY<br>
with<br>
Robert E. Wubbolding, EdD</b></p></center>

<center><p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<p>Robert Wubbolding, EdD is Professor of Counseling at Xavier University, Director of the Center for Reality Therapy in Cincinnati and Senior Faculty at the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles. He has published 125 articles and book chapters, ten books and seven videos on reality therapy, and has taught reality therapy and choice theory all over the world.</p>

<p>Wubbolding believes that as human beings we have much more control over our lives than we think, and that the challenge is to learn how to be more responsible in our drives for belonging, power, enjoyment, freedom and survival. In this session, Wubbolding works with a graduate student who lacks focus in his efforts to complete his master's thesis and make pivotal life decisions. This challenging client is initially difficult to pin down, speaking in tangents and diverting Wubbolding's questions throughout the session. However, Wubbolding is able to reel him in during key moments, leading the client to realize that it is his motivation, not external factors that prevent him from moving forward with his thesis and other life decisions. Before the session, Jon Carlson and Diane Kjos talk with Wubbolding about his approach and, after viewing a tape of the session, they also facilitated a group discussion on the approach.</p>

<center><p><b>Wubbolding's Approach</b></p></center>

<p>Dr. Jon Carlson: What do you know about reality therapy?</p>

<p>Dr. Diane Kjos: Well, I know it was developed by a psychiatrist, William Glasser, and it's based on this concept called Control Theory, but it's a humanistic, existential kind of background in it. And I think he developed it when he was working with adolescent offenders; I know it's used a lot in school settings.</p>

<p>Carlson: It's my understanding that it's also a very active, a very practical approach, one that's more thinking, more focused on cognitive. And if I understand the ideas that Glasser was talking about, he said it's based upon a belief that people are responsible for their own behavior, and that one's identity and one's self&mdash;worth are really related to one's own behavior. And when people have problems, it's because they are irresponsible.</p>

<p>Or they just don't take responsibility for their own behavior. I'm wondering how this whole theory relates to other theories.</p>

<p>Kjos: I think it's seen as being a, as you said, a directive type of a therapy approach, which is similar, for instance, to behavior or cognitive behavior, but it also then has this other piece to it, the humanistic phenomenological, which is similar to person&mdash;centered or existential, so I see it kind of bridging between the two extremes or the two poles in terms of types of theory.</p>

<p>Carlson: Sounds like we know a little bit about this generally. Why don't we bring in our guest, Dr. Robert Wubbolding, and have him give us some more information about reality therapy.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Wubbolding: Hello, John.</p>

<p>Carlson: Hello, Bob. Come on right in. Have a seat.</p>

<p>Kjos: Bob.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Hello, Diane. Nice to be here.</p>

<p>Carlson: Diane and I have been having a discussion about reality therapy, and we're just not sure what reality therapy is. Can you help us understand?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yes, reality therapy is the method that, as you said before, that William Glasser developed, and it is based on the idea that we have inner control and a lot more control than we think we have. And it's based on the idea that when we work with somebody, we help them identify what they want, how they perceive the world around them, how hard they want to work at improving their lives. Then we get them to examine how it's going, what are they doing, what are they thinking, what are they feeling mostly what are they doing. And then we have them evaluate what's going on, and that's a very detailed process, and then we encourage them to make some plans. This used to be formulated as eight steps but about 1986, we abandoned the eight steps and reformulated it into two major components called environment and procedures.</p>

<p>And what I have done is to try to take the&mdash;or the procedures and formulate them in a way that people can remember using a formulation called WDEP&mdash;wants, doing, evaluation and planning&mdash;which is a very, very brief summary of the overall procedures.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you talk about each of those four steps?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. Now, first of all, they're not really steps because it's more of a system and you would take out of the system what's useful at a given moment. I know of one reality therapist, for example, somebody walks in and sits down. He says, "Hi, I'm Bob. What's your plan?" That's not my style, but it sounds a little bit hurried to me, but, but the point illustrates that this is a system, not steps.</p>

<p>But maybe I should explain a little background as to where or how these fit into a theory, which would help me elaborate on each point.</p>

<p>Reality therapy is based, as you said, on Control Theory or Control System Theory, which is a cybernetic theory. And Glasser has taken it and made it a clinical model and an educational model, and it's based on the idea that we are not driven to do whatever we do by past history nor by external stimuli that we get from the world around us. So what motivates us is our five needs: our need for belonging, our need for power, our need for fun or enjoyment, our need for freedom or independence or perhaps what Piaget called autonomy, and then our need for survival, which is our need for life. Sexuality is connected with that, also. So those are the five drives and needs that everybody has, we say. Not that anybody has researched this with four billion people, but what we say is that this is a way of looking at human nature and that these are the forces that drive us.</p>

<p>We say they're multicultural. People have them everywhere. And it's certainly something that unites human beings.</p>

<p>What is the next motivator is our specific wants, and these of course, are unique to every individual. And our behavior is an attempt to get those, and what we really want is perceptions. We want the perception from the world around us. So our behavior is designed to get us the perception we want. In fact, we want the perception so much that we will actually sometimes deny ourselves information from the world around us so, to maintain a perception.</p>

<p>Carlson: I'm not sure what that means. Can you give us an example of that, Bob?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I can give you a good example of that. I like to ask people this question: How many people in a group of, say, 25 people would want to know everything that happens in an autopsy? How many people want to know everything that happens in the kitchen of a restaurant?</p>

<p>Carlson: I see.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: In other words, sometimes we will deny it. I'm not recommending this. I'm just saying we will actually deny ourselves information to maintain a certain perception. We want the perception of being an adequate person, being a competent person, being capable, being a good parent, being a good teacher, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Kjos: So this is an internal perception, rather than our concern about how others see us?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, that's part of what we want, many... You would want people to see us in a certain way. That would be part of what we want.</p>

<p>Kjos: So we, we would even deny how other people see us if it's necessary.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sometimes. Appropriately or inappropriately, sure.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you go back to this WDEP?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. It's a formulation of the procedures based on the Control System Theory, and what we would do with that is try to establish an atmosphere, a climate, and then the procedures are the interventions that we actually make.</p>

<p>The W standing for the exploration of the person's quality world or mental picture album. This is a little bit of the jargon we use. There's not a lot of jargon in the system, but there is just a little bit of technical language, and that is the quality world being everything in our head that we have found over the years to be need satisfying. We might have a specific idea or a general idea of what a need&mdash;satisfying person is in a relationship or a job or a career or something that we enjoy doing.</p>

<p>Carlson: So you take these general wants people have and then get them to get more specific?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: More specific, right.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that they can actually be clear what the goals are?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's right. And some people have rather generalized pictures of what they want.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's not too helpful, then.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, it may be the best they can do, but we try to get them to clarify it. It's like, you know, you want to eat dinner tonight, but you don't know exactly what you want.</p>

<p>So the want for dinner is there, but the clarification of it takes some time and dialogue back and forth and eventually the person clarifies it.</p>

<p>Carlson: I think I understand the W part. What's the next? D?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: The D is the exploration of what's, of the behavior, the total behavior, the action/thinking/feeling and even physiology. And you know, "what are you doing? How are you spending your time? What did you do yesterday? What did you do overall? Was there ever a time when you did something that was problem&mdash;free?" And we would explore that at, in great detail.</p>

<p>And then some thoughts: what are you telling yourself as far as control? What are you telling yourself as far as where your control is? And, for example, perhaps a very hostile, difficult person, there's a lot of self talk that that person chooses which would be like, "Nobody's going to tell me what to do.</p>

<p>Everybody's against me. I can't do anything about this." And so we might explore that to some extent.</p>

<p>And then the feelings. The feelings, the emotions are like the red lights on the dashboard of a car. When they go on, you know something's wrong. When a person gets depressed, we say the depression's not the problem; the depression's the symptom of the problem, and so we would really help that person examine his or her total life as to how the individual's living and then get them to do something different about it.</p>

<p>Kjos: And the E - You had W,D, E</p>

<p>Wubbolding: The E is the heart and soul, it's the cornerstone, it's the keystone in the arch, it supports everything else, because without that, nothing happens. The self&mdash;evaluation. It's like looking in the mirror and saying, "What am I doing? How am I living my life? And is it really the way I want to live it?" And I would say this, that as human beings, we have what I sometimes refer to as this relentless undying belief in something that doesn't work.</p>

<p>Like looking for the car keys in the same place 25 times. You know, figuring that they will miraculously appear the 26th time. And sometimes, we do things not knowing that it's not working, and so we, we need to have that client really self&mdash;evaluate. Many clients don't know how to self&mdash;evaluate. For example, if you're raised in a family where there is a lot of turmoil, a lot, perhaps chemical dependency, perhaps inconsistency, the person grows up not knowing what helps, what works, what doesn't work. And I think we need to be fairly clear about our interventions and teach the individual that this helps and this doesn't help.</p>

<p>Carlson: What about defense mechanisms, I would think would be really a problem when people are trying to evaluate themselves. How does a reality therapist</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It certainly is, and defense mechanisms are behaviors that we generalize, that we generate.</p>

<p>Denying, minimizing, rationalizing, putting blame on other people: this would be, these are behaviors we generate to get our needs met. And so the way we would deal with them is by having the person describe exactly what's going on in his or her life, or in some cases, what other people say is going on. Like a person who's chemically dependent might say, "Well, I don't, you know, I really don't drink that much. I don't really, I don't really do drugs or whatever." Well, the intervention would be made as, as is very common in that particular field, based on what other people say.</p>

<p>Kjos: What about a person who sees themselves as constrained by outer forces, such as racial or gender?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sure. Sure. There's a, I mean, you know, a limitation in our choice is clear in our society, and many people don't have as many choices as other people have because of race, because of sex, because of age, because of disability, 1001 things.</p>

<p>What we would do in this system is really try to help them focus on the possible, and I think, I think counseling, like politics, is the art of the possible. It's what you can do. And we would really have them evaluate what is realistically doable and attainable. And really help them, one thing we would help them do is evaluate whether that perception of being a total victim is really helping them, and we would try to have them evaluate it. We wouldn't say you are or aren't. That would not be, I don't think, a reality therapist's position to do that, but help them evaluate and really focus on what they can control and work on it. And, of course, lots of systemic changes which we could help to facilitate, but that would not be unique to reality therapy. That part would not be unique at all.</p>

<p>Carlson: And so then the P part, is that the action part of this?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: The P stands for planning. A realistic, doable, measurable plan: "What will you do today to make things different?" So that's really the culmination. It's the part that's easily remembered, and certainly not unique to reality therapy, but it is something people associate with this system.</p>

<p>Carlson: We were trying to talk and look at how reality therapy compares to the other theories. And as you talked, you talk about the thinking part and the feeling part and the doing part.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I would put it in the general category of a cognitive behavioral theory.</p>

<p>Carlson: The thinking/doing.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah, I would just put it in that school of thought. But it has, as you said earlier, the other elements, too.</p>

<p>Kjos: My sense is that you would put it "doing" first. Or would you put</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, this is a very good point. We emphasize the doing but there's a lot of thinking, as you'll see in the video there's a lot of thinking that goes into it, helping the person evaluate. And sometimes, the plan you just make, the action plan is made very quickly. So there's a lot of cognition that we emphasize in the system.</p>

<p>But your question how does it compare specifically with other theories, I think, is important. I think we probably don't emphasize the family constellation as much as Adlerian. We would see the need for significance as very important, probably in the area of power, and we would, we would - But the idea of inner responsibility and inner ability to control would be, I think, I think a theme that runs throughout most of the very current and popular theories.</p>

<p>Many people suggest there are similarities with Albert Ellis's rational emotive behavioral therapy, and there would be as far as technique goes, but the theory is very different. We stress the idea of those needs as being motivators and innate, whereas his particular school stresses that those are not needs. It's nice, he says, to have them but you don't really need them. We see, we see thinking as a behavior, not as the source of a problem. It's something you generate along with action and feelings and physiology.</p>

<p>Carlson: One of the confusing parts for me, I think I'm beginning to understand this a little bit more, but then we get into this biological part. You just made a reference to that, and I've read some of these, the neurobiology that Dr. Glasser talks about. I'm not sure I, how that fits into this. It almost sounds like</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Your biological behaviors are just that: they are behaviors. And there may be some chemical imbalance with some people, but how do you know? I mean, as counselors, we don't treat people as physicians, but we would ask them about it. We'd ask how is your life direction impacting your physiology? And have them kind of look at that and, of course, have them get medical opinions about it. But we really, never really know how much is determined biologically.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's the part I couldn't figure out. When I look at things biologically, psychologically and socially and Glasser has quite a bit that he does talk about, the biological, and it, yet I don't see that used very much in the treatment protocol.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think because most people who do this are not physicians, and probably very cautious about even getting close to it.</p>

<p>Carlson: Would Glasser himself?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: He might. He might. Sure.</p>

<p>But we don't, he has a statement in one of his books, a book called What Are You Doing?, where he makes the statement of, that medication is helpful but he certainly does not agree with large doses for long periods of time and thinking that that's the cure.</p>

<p>Carlson: In a few minutes, we're going to watch you in a demonstration. What were your goals as a reality therapist in this demonstration?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: My goals were primarily, I guess you'd call them process goals, is to help this client, about whom I knew almost nothing beforehand, a few facts, but had to help him identify, and to clarify what he wanted, what we call his quality world. An analogy that explains it a little bit more is something that I've been using just for about a month now, and that is, his inner house, his mental house.</p>

<p>And my goal was to try to get into his mental house, to become somebody that he could relate to and connect with to some extent. And then to get him to identify what he wanted. And so we take, we take seriously what people say they wanted and work with that and work with what they present to us. So that was my goal, would be to start at that point and, and then to get him to talk a little about, you know, what's going on in his life, especially what he's doing. Especially what he's doing. More than what he's feeling and more than what he's thinking. Not that we ignore those. As a matter of fact, that's one of the misconceptions about reality therapy is that we don't talk about or deal with emotions or feelings. I think that's an erroneous point. But we emphasize the action part, so I would, my goal is to get him to talk about that and then to evaluate it.</p>

<p>Carlson: So more in the doing and getting him to accept responsibility for his actions?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: Is that something we should look for when we look?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I would say look for focusing on what he can control.</p>

<p>Kjos: What are some of the other things we might look for in terms of what you're doing in the session?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, people tell me that when I work with people, they say, they observe my body language, which I am not very much aware of at the time, but how, how I kind of perhaps engage him with, with my, moving toward him when he's talking about something that he can control and how I sort of withdraw when he's not talking about something he can control, which I'm not aware of. But that might be something to look and listen for.</p>

<p>Also, listen for the atmosphere. Not only the words but the music, the, was it a friendly atmosphere? Was it safe, the usual things that I think apply to any counseling.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you talk a little more about that? That's one of the hallmarks of reality therapy, is setting up that environment, or that, I think you call it a psychological atmosphere?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah, it's, perhaps Carl Rogers said it, you know, the climate, the atmosphere, the almost unspoken ability to connect with this person. I mean, is there empathy and regard? I mean, these are parts of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Carlson: So it's good, healthy?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Those are very, very much applicable to reality therapy. And so I don't want to imply that this is anything, in any way a harsh method. I think harshness is the person doing it. If we're harsh, we're going to be a harsh reality therapist.</p>

<p>Carlson: So we'd see those good healthy, helping skills that you see in like person&mdash;centered therapy?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sure. But I would say look also for what is perhaps central to reality therapy, which is identifying what he wants and focusing on what he can get, and you'll see how he eventually does formulate some very specific plans.</p>

<p>Also look for any kind of movement, any kind of change in his, in his communication as far as, perhaps, does he get any kind of insight and I think he indicates that in perhaps the way he, his expression.</p>

<p><b>Session Transcript</b></p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay, well, hello, Juan. My name is Bob and you're here for a counseling session. And what do you think about shaking hands before we start?</p>

<p>Juan: Sure. Okay. Hi.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So I'm just wondering what thoughts did you have as you came for counseling today?</p>

<p>Juan: Something interesting, I &mdash; Let's see. Sort of like, you know, you wake up and you say to yourself, you know, there was a song out like that, wasn't there? How did I get here? Where do I go from here? But I recently ran into one of my high school counselors, and that was the year I dropped out of high school and I was 16, and it was really interesting to bump into him again. He &mdash; You know, it was just odd. It was odd. I wonder what he had in his mind, with the picture of me then still seems unchanged as to what he sees in me now.</p>

<p>But I remember at the time him saying, you know, "Your problems are rooted in the fact that you're not as Americanized as your brother," which didn't mean a damn thing to me. And still doesn't. It's a weird, it's an odd statement. I don't understand what that means. But it's maybe a sense of dislocation for one reason or another from someone who pretends to be perceptive. Or just on a daily basis. I don't know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, was this something that happened recently or</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I just saw this guy, gee whiz, just saw him again last week, I think. Nice man, but just kind of out of touch, I think.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I'm not sure how that, you know, what that does to you, I mean, when you, when somebody says that to you.</p>

<p>Juan: I think what, because at the time, I think I was more frustrated with a lot of things. I think the things that still frustrate me but are more pronounced now or seem more pronounced now.</p>

<p>I don't know. It had something to do with dropping out, with getting somewhere and then dropping out again in college later and then again at another school. And I can't seem to finish my Master's thesis, which I am putting off endlessly right now. But I want to pinpoint the frustration but, damn it, I know it's not because, you know, of not being Americanized or whatever the heck that is supposed to mean. So I think that was probably the last time I tried approaching anything. You know what I mean? In this, in this manner. So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What would you like to have happen here today as we talk?</p>

<p>Juan: Let's see. Get a career plan. Go home and start writing my, the outline to my thesis. I guess decide whether or not to go on for some kind of PhD program or terminal degree or something else. I don't know. And to believe that that is there for me, that I can participate in that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Does any of that have to do with being more Americanized or something? Less Americanized?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, not to me. I mean, heck, you know, I mean, I, what the hell. You know, I- I think it might mean that to people around me but not a whole bunch. I mean, it's not like everyone- The walls don't have eyes, you know what I'm saying? But it seems that everywhere you go, you run into people now and then who will project that upon you, and for the life of you, you're sort of like pawing at a window pane and you can't wipe that window pane clean, and they're looking through that, and it's odd. It's an odd feeling sometimes. And it seems to happen with I shouldn't trouble me as much. I guess it shouldn't trouble me as much, but it seems to happen with people who are in authority, who are, teachers or this counselor, you know. It's odd. You just want to rap on the window.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: We can accomplish a limited amount in the time that we have. Which of those do you think would be easiest to work on?</p>

<p>Juan: Which of?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, career, finishing the dissertation.</p>

<p>Juan: Probably, career, I guess then, yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Think that's easier?</p>

<p>Juan: You know why? Because yeah, you know why, because I think that you're supposed to, you, the efficacy of education, I mean, right, you're supposed to gain insight and integrity and you're supposed to have that stand up inside you, and I don't know if that makes me quaint, but I believe that. And when I encounter people who, you know, Dr. So and So or Professor So and So and they don't behave that way, I think to myself, you know, "What, where's the value?" It doesn't have to be an absolute value, but you know what I mean. Where's the integrity? Where did it go? What's the point? And then that's probably why I drop out again.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Again.</p>

<p>Juan: Well, I mean, you know, there's no guarantees. I mean, why do it?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, what if you did drop out? So what?</p>

<p>Juan: What if I did again? Yeah, at this point, it's so what, I think. I regret not being done already, you know. I would like to be a professor now.</p>

<p>I don't know. I think I did a lot of things that were very good. In a way, I think that dropping out was the best thing I did, really. At least the first two times. I don't know about the last two times, but</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I take it that this career or finishing whatever it may be, school et cetera, you know, finishing projects major or minor, would do something inside for you, would satisfy some longing or some drive inside of you. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I, I, You know, I think I can do it about as well as the next person if not better, especially if I sit and concentrate and put my mind to it. But I guess I keep selling myself short and, you know, how this hen pecking I think it's the dictatorship of the mundane, the dictatorship of mediocrity of the 20th century. The problem is noise. People talk too damn much, and they have nothing to say.</p>

<p>But darn it, they'll assert their right to say it, you know. And you just want to tell them, "Shhhh." You know, or rap on the window and, you know, "Go pick up a book. Go enjoy it," you know. I don't know. There doesn't seem to be any, anyI don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's all industry now. Maybe it's all, the universities are just businesses now. I don't know.</p>

<p>But I always thought, I was always brought up to think, you know, you're a teacher. You're a doctor. You're a priest. You know, my parents, that's, they were, you know, campesinos, you know, they were migrant workers. They were field workers. They didn't go to school like me, you know. And you know, I don't know if, I guess I'm sort of pushed into that, too. I happen to be good at it, but I'm still not sure if it's, that's the spaces that I want to find myself in. So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think we need, I need to ask you about a sense of direction, and I need to ask you about what's in your head as far as what you want for yourself.</p>

<p>But let me ask you another question first. If you were to be doing this afternoon, today, what you really, what would really satisfy something inside of you, what would it be?</p>

<p>Juan: Probably climbing the Alps. Or</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay, what's the second thing? Something that's doable.</p>

<p>Juan: That's doable? Ideally or</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No. Just like, this afternoon.</p>

<p>Juan: If I were to do something this afternoon?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Within your, within your world. What would it be?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know. I'd like to have more money, because if I had more money I could entertain myself in certain ways that you need, you know. I would kill the afternoon shopping, I think, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You'd be shopping.</p>

<p>Juan: Why not? You know, I need, I need the clothes and</p>

<p>Wubbolding: How would that fit in with a kind of a life goal?</p>

<p>Juan: It probably wouldn't, but it's what I'd do this afternoon.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: But it'd be fun.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, sure. Definitely. You know. I need a new winter coat, winter's coming up, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, that would be fairly easy to accomplish in a counseling session, I think.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. There you go. Go get the Spiegel catalogue or whatever they use.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So what would it be? Would there be something that you'd be doing that would be within the, you know, the line of your overall hope for yourself?</p>

<p>Juan: I'd like to go back and</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I'm not minimizing shopping, you understand. I'm not minimizing it.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. No. I'd, if it were something in line, what I would need to do is work on my thesis and beyond that, I think I'd like to go back to my writing. I used to want, I still want. I always say "used to," I think, as a way of, the fact that I dropped from that thing also, but I would like to do that again. I would like to do it as seriously as I once did.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Do more writing?</p>

<p>Juan: Yes.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: When was the last time you did that?</p>

<p>Juan: Oh, I guess last trimester here.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: How many months ago was that?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know. What are we in? October.</p>

<p>November first, rather.</p>

<p>No, I think it would have to be April or May, at least, the last time I participated in anything here.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Is that the last time you did anything on your own, too?</p>

<p>Juan: No. You mean writing&mdash;wise?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: As far as writing, yeah.</p>

<p>Juan: No. I, it had to be a couple months ago, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: But I get the idea you're kind of a little frustrated in that you haven't done more of that.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. That's right. You know, sometimes it seems too easy. It seems too easy. I think a lot of that is, they say urine. You know, you look out there. I have a lot of because it's terrible. It's terrible writing, and it's not life affirming. It's fragmentated, fragmented.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's long range pay off sort of thing.</p>

<p>Juan: It's goofy, you know. And if you look at certain things, like I was at a coffee shop recently. They had a section on, like, Hispanic writers, you know, and they had a couple of books of poetry and these guys are from LA or what not, and they were singing their praises and they were terrible, to a man. Every single one of them was a hellatious terrible.</p>

<p>And I'm thinking, you know, that's again problems with windows, rapping on windows and perceptions. And also, I think it's a real dearth or is it, are we that, is it, are people searching, is that the industry? People are searching - I don't want to be fitted into that, you know what I mean. I don't want to be fitted into that. And someone would say, "Well, you"</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's what you don't want, but you want, do you want to write?</p>

<p>Juan: I sure do, but I think that people are going to say, "Well, you know, here's another Hispanic writer." You know, be I better than or less accomplished than these other guys, you know what I mean? I just would rather not be compartmentalized that way. I don't think other people are asking to be compartmentalized that way, and maybe we shouldn't do that in the canon of literature.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, that's what they say. What do you say?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, I think some of them are culture specific, whatever that means, but I think most of my things are, you know, pretty darn Midwestern suburban and occasional leaps into universal.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: When you do it, do you get a sense of pride?</p>

<p>Juan: Sometimes. Sometimes, sometimes I do it, I know it's good. Sometimes I do it and it's fantastic.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Let me ask you this. If you were, and we're kind of just really focusing on one little thing here for a moment.</p>

<p>Juan: Okay.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: If you were, if you were to write, or when you write, what percentage of the time would you say that you feel, "Now, this is really something I like." What percentage of the time?</p>

<p>Juan: When I do it? The whole time. The whole time. People are silly are when they say, "I hate writing, but I love having seen what I've written."</p>

<p>Wubbolding: One hundred percent of the time? You feel pride and</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, well, unless it's for a class. You know, term papers don't count.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. But we're talking about the kind of writing you really want to do.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Yeah. Even if it's terrible, I still enjoy the act. When something's done, it's just, you throw it out.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You accomplish something.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It satisfies something in here.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. But you can't make money on that. It's really not respectable. It's really</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Not yet.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Not yet. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I should have done that, too. So. I don't know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: If you were to spend the next day or two working on some kind of a project like that, what would that do for you? Based on what you just told me.</p>

<p>Juan: Oh, I'd get, I'd feel better. Then I'd feel like something, you know, substantive. You look and, you put it in the portfolio, right, but it's something that's complete.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You feel a little sense of control? In your life, I mean. You know, you feel, "I did this. It's accomplished."</p>

<p>Juan: Well, I don't know if &mdash; Yeah. I would feel a sense of accomplishment. I don't know if it's control.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I mean inner control.</p>

<p>Juan: Even that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Satisfaction.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I would feel satisfied. I would, yeah. I've just become such a slouch, I think. So, I don't know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Is that, is that kind of the way you've been thinking about yourself?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Yeah. But it's true, though. You know, I mean, it's, it's what I've been doing. I've been wasting, wasting my time now for awhile, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You're the worst slouch that ever walked the planet?</p>

<p>Juan: No. Probably</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay, so you're not that bad.</p>

<p>Juan: No. No.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. Now, let me ask you this: you tell yourself, kind of, "I'm a slouch."</p>

<p>Juan: Yes.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. Where's the getting you?</p>

<p>Juan: Bad posture, I think. I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, what I mean is, Juan, is it helping or hurting you?</p>

<p>Juan: Oh, it's got to be hurting me. I mean, gee whiz, I, I should be done. I should have finished this thesis</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No, I mean telling yourself that.</p>

<p>Juan: Well, I mean, it's not a positive thing. I mean, surely, but it's</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I like, I ask a lot of questions as you noticed, and some questions seem very simple when I ask them.</p>

<p>Are you telling me that, you know, that kind of inner conversation doesn't really help you much? That kind of criticizing?</p>

<p>Juan: In some ways I think it does. I think it does. I think people need a sense of, being self&mdash;critical, you know.</p>

<p>Why would you want to be so free and easy about everything, you know? Everyone has an opinion, but is it critical? No way.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What I mean is, does it help you to develop this writing habit that you want?</p>

<p>Juan: I think it, you know, actually, probably not. When I was...Because I dropped out of school, you know, and then I went to an art school, and that's when I, I got there on the strength of my writing because I had straight E's, you know. I think I did it a lot more freely then; it was a lot more fun. You're a kid. You know, you have this silly romantic notion of doing something.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, it sounds like you still have kind of a romantic notion of doing something.</p>

<p>Juan: Well, yeah, but you know, now I have all these</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's what great, that's what great writing is made of, isn't it?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I think so. I think so, but I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I'm not trying to talk you into it. I'm just asking you, you know, to kind of take a look at that, see if that's where you want to go.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I think I would go there's an MFA, you know, you can get it in writing but it would just seem easy. It would seem pointless. It would seem like a pointless degree in a way, in the same way this English degree is sort of pointless.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, that's something to examine and to weigh. But you're interested in it.</p>

<p>Juan: A degree, cultural currency. Someone says, you know, "You can get a job." So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, when you get a job, they're going to have to train you anyway, no matter what, no matter what you study.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I know. Yeah. So. But at least it's something that can be done. I went to a high school reunion recently and it was really&mdash;I had to crash the reunion, since I wasn't invited and I haven't graduated. It was a, it was a great time. Saw a lot of people I liked and a lot of people who, jeez, you know, 10 years, it's just fascinating. These people, man, it's a shame. You know, out of shape, balding, divorced.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: A lot of older people, huh?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. A lot of older people. I couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I noticed that at my reunions, too.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Wow. You know, so. Anyway. But you know, in a way, I get satisfaction from that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's interesting, it's interesting that you say you crashed the reunion, so that must have taken a little determination.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, it did. Yeah. Well, sure. Yeah. Yeah. It was funny. It was</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I'm wondering if you want to try to work on capitalizing on that determination and sort of spreading it. I mean, not that you're not determined. It's just a matter of adding on to it.</p>

<p>Juan: If I could feel large like that, larger than life, on a regular basis, maybe, like that, that would be good.  If that's what you're asking. I don't know. I felt &mdash; It was, it was, it was fun. At least I'll have a Master's, you know. At least, and these other, these other slobs will not have theirs, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And if you have it, you're going to feel something inside of you. Some some</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. At least it's one less obstacle you need to worry about. Someone will say, "What are you now," you know, "you un&mdash;Americanized dropout?" And I will say, "You know, friend, you know, this means nothing to me except in the cultural currency, except for the social areas, and so you don't have this, and where are you now?"</p>

<p>And so, I do have a lot of anger at least with that, but you know. Best of luck to them. But you know, you shouldn't treat people like, you know, why should you treat people the way people do? So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So, well, you've said a lot of things here, Juan, really a lot of things. As a result of our conversation today, you know, 45 minutes or whatever it is, what would you like to be doing? I mean, I know I asked that but, you know, these things change as people talk. You said career. You said finish your research. Write. I mean, I'm just kind of asking you once again to think about that.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I still want to write. I guess it's really the only thing I've wanted to do, and you know, I would be very, more than content publishing those cheesy novels you get in the checkout line at the Kmart as you bring up your, you know, blue light special items, but</p>

<p>That would be entirely satisfying. I mean, you know, I'm not going to be any kind of Helprin or Marquez or, you know, people of that nature. And that's okay, you know, but I would sure like to be able to go home, sit at my, you know, word processor and make a living at that. That would be incredibly, I, I, yeah. I could really do that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And you actually have written things.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's not like this would be the first time you put the finger on the keyboard.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. I actually used to publish things when I was younger. Little things, in little</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Is that right?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. But to, maybe that's, it just seems easy, you know. I don't know. It really does.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: How would that propel you along toward a kind of a life direction if you were to do this today, tonight, tomorrow?</p>

<p>Juan: How would it propel me along in a life direction? I don't know.</p>

<p>I probably need a good job, a decent place. I really think that I need those things. Some new clothes. Finish this darn degree and these, you know, then I would feel a sense of accomplishment or worth or, you know, I don't know. I think I need to grow up.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Are all those the things that you want to accomplish?</p>

<p>Juan: I guess. Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Those five or six things.</p>

<p>Juan: It'd be less to worry about.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay, and would that constitute "growing up," as you call it?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know. I don't know. I don't see it. I think when I was younger, I was almost ready for marriage, it seemed like. I'm glad I didn't because I was not ready for marriage. But, hell, now that I'm older, I, you know, I have no desire at all to, to mature or something, you know. Whatever it means; I have no idea.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So that's not something you give a lot of worry</p>

<p>Juan: No.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You don't give any worry to that.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I really can't, you know. I mean, I know that I'm an adult, especially. It troubles me when, when like those eight&mdash; and nine&mdash;year&mdash;old kids will say things back to you, and you're thinking, you know, "My God, you know, I would have never done that."</p>

<p>Maybe they're acting from the TV, but, so I know that. I don't care for that, you know, I think. Well, I don't yell at them, but it's sort of like, "Wow. Jeez." You know. So no, it's not something I give a lot of thought to, I guess.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So finishing your, your research, doing some writing and developing a career path, those are some things that are going on inside of you right now?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: As we sit here, I mean.</p>

<p>Juan: Almost everyday, everyday lately.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Like prey on your mind?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I think about it a lot, actually.</p>

<p>You know, I'm living at home. I went home to finish the second degree. It's going on two and a half years. I'm just, I'm dying to get out, you know. And none of these conversations I can have with my folks.</p>

<p>I mean, I can, but you know, they don't understand it. They won't grasp it; they never have. My family and extended family are busily pursuing, you know, the next sale at Marshall's and so on and so on and there's little resources, that even the friends around here&mdash;Well, I don't usually talk like this, but there's just really no one to do that with. So their thing is, "Go get a job. You've got a degree. Go get it." You know. But it never worked that way. "You get straight A's; stay in school." It never worked that way for me.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You said something there that really caught my attention. You said you don't usually talk like this. That's interesting point.</p>

<p>Juan: I don't think most people do. I mean, that's or at least that's I don't think most people do. I mean, you know. Do they? Wouldn't it be a drag if you were hanging out at a party with someone who, you know I had a friend like that who cried in his beer all the time, and I couldn't believe it, so. You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I'm not suggesting do it. I'm just saying that you don't get a chance to do it very often.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You're probably right: a lot of people don't.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. It doesn't I don't know if it brings any solutions, but it's</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, what I'm asking</p>

<p>Juan: Sometimes you want to blab about it. I know I do. Because I, you know, I just, I, you know, I feel like something should be happening. Something should be happening that isn't.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: In your life?</p>

<p>Juan: Right. At this point, you know. Maybe that, this completion of the degree will make, you know, springboard into like &mdash; So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it would, but the question is: how do you get started to finish it?</p>

<p>Juan: How do I finish the darn thing? Yeah. It's a good topic.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's right. How do you get started. My question is how do you get started to finish it, not just how do you finish it? I think you know how to finish it.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I just &mdash; The research is done. I handed in my works cited thing last trimester. I even honestly began an outline the other day. Something clicked, and so it's started to move forward, but I'm certainly not going to finish it by the deadline. I mean, I'm going to&mdash;</p>

<p>Wubbolding: When is the deadline?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, December something. It's not going to happen, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: How much work would it entail?</p>

<p>Juan: I want mine to be long and expansive. And by that, I mean stylistically. I hate things that are choppy and dry, especially if you're an English major. And I think, I've heard, that people here have handed in papers that are like 30 pages long or something and that's not really</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I'm just curious: when I ask these really weird questions sometimes&mdash;this is, this is kind of a really strange question&mdash;but if someone were to guarantee you the exact kind of career and job that you wanted, and maybe you don't exactly know what it is, but it would be, you know, some kind of guarantee that you would have what you wanted by that deadline, would you be able to finish it by then?</p>

<p>Juan: By the December &mdash; Yeah, I, yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Or if you were to win the lottery by then and somebody guaranteed a winning lottery ticket, would you be able to finish it by then?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I would. I, I certainly would. But the stakes are higher then, you know. So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So the point is that if you wanted to choose to do that, you could do it.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I mean, I could. I should. I know that. I can't</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Now one thing we do know that there's, probably, that there's not going to be anything out there that's going to be an incentive for you to do it. In the sense of an absolute guarantee about a job or something like that, those ridiculous examples I gave.</p>

<p>Juan: Oh, yeah. That's true. They won't, they're not</p>

<p>Wubbolding: So it's going to have to be something that you tap inside of you.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. I mean, yes. That's true. It would.</p>

<p>I don't &mdash; I would need to do that sometime soon.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: How about tonight?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know about tonight. I'm thinking, what's on TV?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's a bad night for TV.</p>

<p>Juan: Is it? Yeah, well, the Bears played on Monday and &mdash; You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No, I'm just kidding. I don't know if it's a bad night or not, but compared with your goal, is it a good night or a bad night?</p>

<p>Juan: It's got to be immediate. It's got to be. I mean, the immediacy is only going to get me out of the house quicker and get me toward these things sooner. But I don't know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: See, you can, you can go along the way you're doing for the next 10 years if you want. It's no, it's not like you're really hurting anybody or really doing great damage to yourself. I don't, I don't see that you're going to really do any damage to yourself. It's just that you'd like to move along quicker.</p>

<p>Juan: And what then, though? I mean, you know, why be there in 10 years? If I crash the next reunion</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah, and they could, you can say you're still working on your research.</p>

<p>Juan: That's right. They'll say, "Well, he's still he's getting there."</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And all those guys and women who are even older.</p>

<p>Juan: And balder, I think. Yeah. No, I don't know. I, I don't know. You know, why waste food and air on a person if they're not doing something. So. You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It seems to me it's up to you. I have a hunch you know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. I don't know. I, I have to spend three years in a PhD program, I suppose, and, man, I don't know if I want to do that. I want the darn degree, though. I do want the next one. I do want the next one. This thesis has to be decent because it can't be, it can't be, you know. I've got to get something out of this. Throw it in the college journal. Got to get one or two articles out of this.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, on one hand on one hand, you want to finish it; on the other hand, let's face it: what's the rush?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, I don't know if there's a rush, but...</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Your parents aren't pressuring you to do it or kick you out, are they?</p>

<p>Juan: No, but I mean, you know, that's just, that's just wretched. I think that's just a wretched situation, so. I miss my own place, you know. I miss having company. I miss, you know &mdash; So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's nice to be, to have your own place and not to have a lot of distractions.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. It is. So. It's not a, it's not a rush.</p>

<p>It's not a rush, but I can't prolong it anymore, either.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, you can if you want to.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, but I really don't want to.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Or you could choose, or you could choose another pathway.</p>

<p>Juan: Right.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: See, I think the career is out here and doing these other things is like here.</p>

<p>Juan: Like endless preparation and never getting there?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, like doing, getting some of these details out of the way like your degree and your research and do some writing, which will help you feel better inside because that's what you want to do.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Even if you just throw it aside, you know, publish now and then. I mean, what the hell? You know. That's the neat thing about plays: I mean, you get a check for $20 or $30 every now and then in the mail. It just keeps coming your way.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Have you had one?</p>

<p>Juan: I got one, so that was neat.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No kidding.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, you've already proven you can do that.</p>

<p>Juan: Isn't that a drag? I mean, that's the same thing. It's sort of like, well, what then?</p>

<p>It's sort of like the research is done; why write the paper now?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You have a play, you had a play inside of you, didn't you?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, that one I did. That one I was, that was, that was a, was sleeping.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Do you think there's any more inside waiting to come out?</p>

<p>Juan: I think maybe one more I got in there, play&mdash;wise. The rest, I do a lot of poems, so. One more. You knowI don't know. Maybe I need to be more productive with that, too. You've got to churn things out, right? You can't</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Have you written anything on that one play that's still inside you?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I did. I did, and that came out pretty well, too. My roommate took a monologue from that, took it to this Irene Ryan competition downstate, and people said, "Where did that monologue come from?" And he said, "Oh, it's my roommate," and so. But I never finished that thing.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You never did finish it?</p>

<p>Juan: I never finished it.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Up till today.</p>

<p>Juan: But it took him &mdash; Yeah, up until today.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Up until today.</p>

<p>Juan: But it's very personal, I think. I think maybe I'm just waiting for the actual story to finish before I go back to it, so.</p>

<p>I don't know. But it's good to be talking like this, I just, you know. Who wants to hear it? I mean, so. Yeah. It's pretty decent.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Who wants to hear what?</p>

<p>Juan: You know, well, you know, people</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Your story?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, people, you know, people when they talk, so it's, it's interesting.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, for what it's worth, I find it fascinating.</p>

<p>Juan: Well</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Really, I really do.</p>

<p>Juan: Well, good. I mean, good. This is good.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And I think the decision is, are you going to keep the music inside of you or are you going to, you know, release it? The music being the play, the writing, the degree</p>

<p>Juan: It just seems like that would be easier in my own place. I don't know why. You know what I mean? I &mdash; That would be much easier. It would be easier. Wouldn't be any distractions, you know?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Your parents are making a lot of noise?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, it's just, yeah. There's a lot of distractions, too, you know. Plus, you know, there's a lot of other things.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I mean, they're not, they're not making a lot of noise and preventing you from writing, are they?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, they're not, you know, but it seems like there's just something. Maybe it's noise in my head, then. You know. My sister is, you know</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You did mention that earlier.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Well, it is. There's too much noise going.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You mentioned noise.</p>

<p>Juan: Too much noise.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: But you think some of it's in your head. I'm asking you this: would it be any less if you moved into your own place?</p>

<p>Juan: I think so because, I mean, it's going to be</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Moving the noise in your head outside?</p>

<p>Juan: I just want a complete break from this. We're getting into another subject, though, and, and, you know &mdash; It's just &mdash; I just &mdash; Yeah, it's time to &mdash; I think the resources are strained. My sister recently got divorced. She's got the five&mdash;year&mdash;old son. She just got her radiology degree from I forget what grad school.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: She's home also?</p>

<p>Juan: No. No. She's at her own place, but she doesn't have a car, so we're, we're shuttling, you know. I'm doing her lawn work, and I don't mind. You know, grocery shopping, I don't mind. Then there's my, you know, my other sister, and the same darn thing is happening there.</p>

<p>Of course, her husband recently got his own construction and they at least, you know, came, came along after many years of that. But that was irritating as hell, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You know what, there's a thousand reasons for not doing what you want to do.</p>

<p>Juan: You're right. For not doing that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You've only named about five. You've got 995 to go.</p>

<p>Juan: To go. I bet I could, I bet I could generate them, too, you know. But yeah, I don't know. Heck. Yeah, I guess. I guess. I guess. But yeah. Something needs to be, I guess, ended and as you say, something begun. I can feel that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What would that be?</p>

<p>Juan: Where?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What has to be ended? Let me ask you this before you answer that. What has to be ended and begun, where is it? Is it in here or is it out there?</p>

<p>Juan: In a way, it's almost, it's not &mdash; I guess it's &mdash; I, you know, I don't want to say it's mostly internal but</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, how much would be internal?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, a large part of it, probably.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What percentage?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know. Nine pieces of the pie, I suppose, the tenth piece probably being external. But that external last piece</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Ninety percent?</p>

<p>Juan: Probably, and that last piece, though, is just really, you know</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, why not work on the pieces that are inside?</p>

<p>Juan: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And leave, when you leave here today and you walk out that door, would you be interested in leaving some of the obstacles in this room right here? The internal obstacles?</p>

<p>Juan: I don't know that that would be possible. I don't see that that would be</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Not all of them. No, no, no. Maybe like 10 percent of them.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, that would be a neat trick. That would be a neat trick. You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: See, I don't see it as a trick as much as a decision.</p>

<p>Juan: I hate to think that I've just been dragging my feet this long, you know, but I mean</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No, I don't see it as dragging your feet, but it's a matter of where do you want to go from here?</p>

<p>Juan:  Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think you've been doing, you've been accomplishing a lot, but &mdash; You've done some writing. You're getting an education. You have a sense of wanting a career. This is quite a bit. So I'd say you're a 300 hitter; now, how do you hit 325, in other words? That's the idea.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Well &mdash; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I suppose, what do you they say, you act your way into doing something even if you don't believe it, then eventually you do, right? So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: There's an old saying like that, you know. You can act your way to a new way of thinking easier than you can think your way to a new way of acting.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. There it is.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Something like that.</p>

<p>Juan: Something like that. So I imagine I will attempt that. Oh, I guess I can do that. I guess I can at least finish the thesis. Finish that damn thing.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Who knows? Who knows? That deadline might not be so close after all. Maybe there's time to do it.</p>

<p>Juan: I'm still thinking I'll get the incomplete. You know.</p>

<p>I really would &mdash; Maybe I can turn in a rough draft then, if she's accepting that. But I, it needs to be completed, it needs to be completed before I apply to another, to a school.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah.</p>

<p>Juan: So, yeah. It's not just fulfilling an assignment. It has to be more than that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Oh, it's something in here. You'd feel better, wouldn't you? I'm just, I'm just going on what you've told me.</p>

<p>Juan: Well, sure. Getting, getting an A is easy. I mean, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. You think you'll get an A?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sure.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You didn't even hesitate. You're very, you're very sure of that. It's just a matter of when you're going to get it.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. I think it's a good, a good topic.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's just a matter of when.</p>

<p>Juan: Right. Right. And what then? So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, let me ask you this: if you spend a lot of time worrying about "what then?" is that going to, where is that going to get you as far as finishing the immediate goal? Accomplishing the immediate task?</p>

<p>Juan: Probably nowhere. Probably nowhere.</p>

<p>But I'll tell you, the suburbs, at least for me, the south suburbs are such a doldrum. I miss, I miss living in Montreal. I miss living in New York. I miss traveling. I used to travel the country. Me and a friend of mine, you know, friends, actually, would come and go because, you know, out in Michigan, that's where you meet them and they'd drive up and you'd go, so. Being sedentary, I think, will kill you. So.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, you're right. It doesn't, it doesn't go, it doesn't, rather, reach the immediate goal. Very true.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What do you want me to say to you right now?</p>

<p>Juan: I can't think of anything. I think you've - This is, this is clarifying. I'm glad this has nothing to do with nationality, god, or concepts of macro social issues, you know. Jesus. Like that weird thing that guy said once.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's a little bit much to handle, isn't it?</p>

<p>Juan: Oh, yeah. What a nut. But yeah, I guess it's easier than I've been making it. That's what it strikes me as. It's funny. I guess you can really knot yourself up, so. That's enough to think about for now. I can't imagine what else you could say. You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, let me ask you this: in the next day or the next few hours, what will you do that's different than what you would have done if we'd have not had this conversation?</p>

<p>Juan: Well, again, it's probably going to be, I know I'll probably let myself off the hook more. I'll probably relax, try to relax more. You know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What would that, what would that look like?</p>

<p>Juan: It'll probably show on my face, I think. I'll just look more relaxed.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. That's how you'll look, and that's a big step. What will you do?</p>

<p>Juan: Probably at least&mdash;and I hate the phrase&mdash;but you know, flesh out the outline more.</p>

<p>I'll probably begin to think of where I'm going to cut and paste, you know, your quotes and junk like that. The nuts and bolts of the paper, probably.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Is that probably? Does that mean you will do it or you'll</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I probably will. You know. I mean, I will.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: You will?</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I will. I will. It was more fun just reading about the stuff, you know. Now that it's done, it's just like, I say it's sort of just like nuts and bolts, but that has to be done, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: When will you do that?</p>

<p>Juan: Maybe Thursday. Maybe beginning Thursday. I have to work this evening, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's tomorrow. Oh, you have to work tonight? Okay. And what time do you work?</p>

<p>Juan: Till eight. Go home, eat, laundry, all the rest.</p>

<p>I do have the night mapped out.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. So tomorrow would be &mdash; what time would you start this tomorrow?</p>

<p>Juan: I'd have to wake up, get some coffee. You know. Probably not till the afternoon. I'm not a morning person. So. But yeah. I would need to do that. I'd need to do that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What time would that be?</p>

<p>Juan: What time? What specific, concrete, detailed. Gee whiz. How about, about three&mdash;ish, I would think. Three&mdash;ish. I could knock out a couple hours of that. At least a good sustained hour, you know. Anything after that is probably I can get a good hour in, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Would you do it?</p>

<p>Juan: Would I? Well, I've got to have something if I'm even going to</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I mean, are you really going to do this? Or</p>

<p>Juan: I've got to have something. Well, I guess, yes. You know, because I mean, I have that deadline approaching. And I've got to have something, even, even something, and something, you know, developed enough to even say, "So do I get the incomplete?"</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, it would be helpful.</p>

<p>Juan: So yes, it would be helpful. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll try it. I'll try it. See what &mdash; yeah. It just seems like a lot to do, you know, but I guess it's going to always be a lot to do until you do it. So I'll try it and see if it's lots to do.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, getting started, how much, how much is a lot when it comes to getting started?</p>

<p>Juan: I guess just getting over the inertia of not starting, so.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: If you did that, Juan, would you have a sense of kind of like inner satisfaction?</p>

<p>Juan: No, because it's, because it's a thesis and stuff. No. I would be relieved. I would be pleased.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's what I mean. Inner, inner relief, pleased, yeah.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I would be relieved. Absolutely, yeah. But it wouldn't be the same as, you know.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, no. I don't mean you're going to be totally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, no. It wouldn't be, it wouldn't approach the other</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No, no. But what I mean is, would you feel like, "Well, I'm on the right track."</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: The engine is getting, you know, is starting to, to move a little bit, get the, it's starting to get the locomotive down the track a little bit.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Yeah, I would.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Now I'm going to ask you one more thing, and would &mdash; You know how to get in touch with me. Would you be willing to call me and let me know how it went?</p>

<p>Juan: If I finished the thesis?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: No, no. If you get started tomorrow. I'd like to know what happened after, from three o'clock until four o'clock.</p>

<p>Juan: You know, it's weird. If, that's, to me, is like making an appointment. I'll just do it then. I'll just do it and call you and say I did that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's what I mean.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Will you do it, though?</p>

<p>Juan: Sure. Yeah. I can keep that &mdash; I keep appointments or whatever, obligations.</p>

<p>I know what you're saying, but yeah. That makes it easier. So.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. So you, you're, we talked a little about, a little about life career. I mean, I don't think we solved it, but I think what you're talking about from what you've said kind of fits in with a, with a goal that maybe you have yet to define clearly. You know.</p>

<p>Juan: Yeah. Yeah. I would go with that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Who knows? Maybe you'll never clearly define your goals.</p>

<p>Juan: Youch. Yeah.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Because these things change. Well, you know, life is dynamic; it keeps changing. I see that as a real strength.</p>

<p>I'll talk to you tomorrow sometime after four o'clock.</p>

<p>Juan: Okay.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay. Thank you for coming in.</p>

<p>Juan: All righty.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay.</p>

<p>Juan: Real good.</p>

<p><b>END SESSION</b></p>

<p><b>Group Discussion</b></p>

<p>Carlson: Wow, Bob, I really enjoyed that session. Was this what reality therapy is like?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think that this is what it's like. At least, this is the way one person does it. And what I tried to do is do the best I could with a person who, who was a little difficult to pin down at times.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's one of the things that I noticed when I watched this, that he was evasive, and he didn't seem to want to stay on track. And yet, this reality therapy model is almost designed for these reluctant kinds of clients. Can you talk a little bit about how you were able to engage him?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What I tried to do when I got a sense of his style relating to me was to, to establish an atmosphere, an environment that would be friendly and where, where I would be somewhat firm.</p>

<p>And so I, I tried to establish that kind of connection with him, and I think the way I did it was to, was to listen to him and let him kind of, I guess the word is, become very "global" in what he would say and I would gently try to bring it back to focus on him. But I think you can easily misuse reality therapy and stick so blindly to the procedures that it's possible to forget about the environment and I tried to balance that a little bit, to let him talk, to let him ramble in the sense that&mdash;I mean, it's probably rambling only in my mind, not in his&mdash;but, but to let him kind of become very global in his statements. And at the same time, then gently to bring him back to something that we could really deal with.</p>

<p>There would be &mdash; I was certainly at times tempted to do what I call "chasing the rabbit." You know, when you chase a rabbit, you run over here and you run over here and you run over here and it leads you all over the place.</p>

<p>And you could actually say reality therapy things to him, and at the same time, chase the rabbit and get nowhere.</p>

<p>Kjos: And he put a lot of them out there.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Lots of cues that you could really pick up on, which were, which perhaps could be followed at some point. But at the same time, it's just a matter of selecting something, and I just chose to go in the direction that I, that I went in.</p>

<p>Carlson: Any other impressions you might have before we, you know, on the session and before we open up to questions from our audience?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think one of the, the impressions I have and something that's very worthwhile as far as a lesson is that idea of focusing. Focus, focus, focus on that person in front of you rather than wander all over the place. And again, that's probably common to most counseling, but it's certainly part of reality therapy.</p>

<p>And then, when you focus, what you do in reality therapy would be to use the procedures.</p>

<p>Kjos: So you chose that one issue and then just kind of stayed with that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. I was, I tried to stay with that issue because he brought it up and it seemed to be something that was in his mind as something that he would want to proceed with. And, and I thought, I just kind of was thinking that my goal would be to get him to have some self, some inner control, better control in his life, and, and some immediate success.</p>

<p>Carlson: And you know, you did a nice job of helping him to solve that problem, and yet did it really help him in the bigger picture of things? I mean, you helped him solve this one problem but sometimes people in reality therapy have been criticized for being too focused and missing the bigger picture for</p>

<p>Wubbolding: This, this is a good point because I didn't see it necessarily as just problem solving. And I think you can use reality therapy for problem solving, but to me, there's an underlying message that comes across in doing this with a person.</p>

<p>On the surface: solve the problem, get started. But underlying it, there's a kind of a message that the person learns, and I think the, the, the message is that, "I have control in my life. I can make better choices." It's kind of like almost concomitant learning, you know, it's what you learn along with what you learn. He learns to make a plan and to follow through, but he also learns a deeper lesson, and that is that, "Things are possible for me." And so I think there's a number of levels, at least two levels on, upon which to watch this video.</p>

<p>Carlson: And that "things are possible to me," that's kind of an underlying theme, isn't it, of reality therapy, this focus on the positivism, I think, the positive.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Right. Not to ignore and be nave about things, but to focus on what he can do.</p>

<p>For example, he talked about 10 pieces of the pie and he said, "Nine of them are inside." Had he said, "One half is inside," I would have said, "Let's work on that one half," and, rather than on the nine and a half over which he would have no control. So he said 90, nine pieces of the 10&mdash;piece pie, which kind of surprised me in a way.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah, it did me, too. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: I've got a lot more questions, but I think we need to get our audience involved.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sure.</p>

<p>Carlson: What I'd like to have our audience do is to have some specific questions about the video and then maybe in a minute we'll move into some questions generally about the theory.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: Can you tell me in relation to the video a little bit about personal style and the reality therapy?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Okay, that's a point that I think is really very good, that is, how does that fit with, how does style fit with the theory?</p>

<p>And to me, it's very important to distinguish between the two, between a person's style and the theory and method itself. These ideas, I think, should be geared to a person's personality and gender and culture and so on, and all these things are very important and very unique to each person. In other words, if you tend to be more assertive, you could still do reality therapy. I think I probably, in that session, tend to be a little bit laidback. I don't know if, how that would sound to some people, but to me, it was a kind of a laidback style, and I think that's, is one person's style. So it can be adapted to any individual person.</p>

<p>I've seen people be, fire questions at clients. That's not my style. I don't, I prefer not to do that. But, so a more rapid&mdash;fire approach could be equally valid. It's just that I don't, I don't prefer to do that, but</p>

<p>So I think that's a good point as to a person's style. I think it's important to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>Carlson: We have other questions specifically on the video? Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Yeah, well, two of them, two comments on situations during the interventions that you did during the video that I thought created a shift that were very effective. One occurred about three&mdash;quarters of the way in where he was enumerating excuses why he can't get started, et cetera, et cetera, and you presented the hypothetical situation where, "If I guaranteed you a job and all that you wanted in your quality world on December 15th if you finished this, could you do it? Would you do it?" And it kind of froze him for a minute and he said yes, which I liked because now he's seeing it, I can choose to do this and had to take ownership for this.</p>

<p>The other thing that I liked is when you did the paradox intervention with, he's dragging his feet and feeling guilty about it and you were saying, "So what's the rush?" Like, allow yourself; you don't have to do this.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And he started telling me that he needs to get it done.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: And then he started telling you, "No, I do have to do this," which &mdash; And my question to you is, when you call him today at four o'clock, what do you think you're going to hear?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's anybody's guess. I hope I'll hear that he worked for an hour.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Do you think that that's what you're going to hear? Because I'm afraid that this guy is going to find ways to sabotage this plan.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's possible. It's possible. If I were to bet, I would say it's about 65/35 that he will do it.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: He will do it.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. I'm certainly leaning in that direction.</p>

<p>Carlson: And how does a reality therapist handle the next session, then, if he doesn't do it?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: If he doesn't? Well, I would say that he succeeded on several points. He thought about it. He talked about it. He made a plan. Now do you really want to do it? So he didn't fail completely. It's very important when people not follow, when people do not follow through on their plans that we don't induce some guilt in them.</p>

<p>Or even see it as a, as a failure. It's very important that we see things differently than that client sees them. See their point of view, but see the world differently. See the possibilities and see the success that he's had. I even pointed out a couple of things that he had succeeded in doing in that tape. So that's how I would, I would handle a, quote, "failure" to follow through on the plan as actually he succeeded in three out of four things.</p>

<p>Carlson: The perceptual alternative then that you reframe it in a positive way.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Sure.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: One of the metaphors that the subject brought up was the barrier, the window that he saw, and you mentioned earlier that thinking is also a behavior. In approaching that metaphor, that barrier that he sees, would you approach it in the same way you approached the barrier he feels on getting the thesis done?</p>

<p>In other words, would you develop a plan on how to break down this cognitive obstacle just as, the same way that you would break down an obstacle in reality? Or would you tend to stay away from that barrier and focus on reality, let the barrier take care of itself?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Can you give a, explain a little bit more about the, the barrier you're referring to?</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: The window. He referred several times there was a window between him and other people, he even referred to, one time, that he couldn't even clean it. You know, this seems to be a real thing that he feels separates him from other people.</p>

<p>Kjos: Scratching at the window.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: Scratching at the window, also.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I would, I would maybe build on that metaphor and say, you know, "You talked about a window between you and other people. Were you interested in opening that window? And when the window's open, what would that be like? What would you be doing that's different than what you're doing now or in viewing this window as a barrier?"</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: So approaching it very similar to the way you, a goal and getting the thesis done? Okay.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Absolutely. Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>Audience Member #4: I guess my question was connected to the whole window part that he talked about, and I looked and he said several different kinds of metaphors. He talked about windows and looking at himself as being larger than life and also the noise in his head, and I was wondering if the question before talked about looking at that as a cognitive obstacle and the whole, at least my understanding of reality therapy is that you look at the client's perception of the world, and if you could look at those metaphors to help him understand what his perception of the world is and how to go about changing that versus looking at it as a cognitive obstacle?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, one of the things we do try to use a lot is the, is metaphors, and I would come back to those. I just didn't do it here but, you know, because there's so many directions. But those are very valuable tools and I don't know what else to say about it other than to use them and kind of give them a different meaning. We would kind of flip that around and change it around.</p>

<p>For example, one person told me that, she said, you know, "Doing this&mdash;" whatever it was&mdash;"is like climbing the top of the mountain." And we used that metaphor in saying, "Well, maybe the first thing to do would be to get a backpack. You don't have to climb the mountain; just get a backpack and take one step."</p>

<p>So kind of giving it a different little twist so that it's more manageable. But I would take those metaphors in the future and use them as manageable tools.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: I also was interested in the, in the metaphors.</p>

<p>But for me, as I heard him talking about rapping on that window and scratching at it, all the different ways he used the window, what came up for me was this whole idea of larger systems in his life, and as a Hispanic man faced with, you know, racism and living in a cultural context where going to school, coming from a migrant family, it's really huge to finish high school, but to finish high school, college, and pursue a Master's degree is a huge accomplishment but also something very outside of his cultural context. That one of the things he said is that his family does, he can't talk like this because it's, in his world, it just doesn't happen.</p>

<p>So I would want you to, for me, to connect the idea of control theory or systems theory with this client.</p>

<p>How &mdash; One of the, I guess one of the things that keeps coming up for me is that as you talk about control theory or systems theory, it's almost as if when you're working with a client, that larger context is not addressed. So it's like talking to a client about being trapped in a system without referring to the system. And I want to know how that works. I mean, why wouldn't you want to explain or get to some of the constraints of operating in a system that ignores him or puts him behind a window or targets him by looking at him but also places stereotypes and limitations and all kinds of other things on him because he's a Hispanic man.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: My rationale was to, let's talk about what is controllable to him, and, and what can he do about the situation that he's, that he's living in. And I think he knows the restraints. I have a hunch he knows them a lot better than I do and all I can say is I think we help him deal with that system maybe one step at a time. We only had 45 minutes here, and we could explore a lot more. I mean, he brought up right out, the first thing that he mentioned was, was something along those lines, but I chose not to go after that. I just chose to get some movement here as quickly as possible. And could easily explore all, maybe even start with his perception of the restraints that he has and how will you cope with them?</p>

<p>And how will you build up a support system? And so those would be very, very useful directions to go in, which I think you could do using this system, but I guess I chose to go in that direction that I did go in.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: I really respect the way you went. I thought it was great. I'm just trying to figure out in the context of reality therapy how systems come into play with working with the idea of systems comes into play when working with a client. And what are the ways that the therapist pays attention to that.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think mainly, and this may not be a complete way to deal with it, but mainly by getting him to make some plans and finding out where his control already is and build on that, and what kind of control would he want to have that he doesn't have and ways around those restraints and</p>

<p>Carlson: Would you ever bring the whole family in?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that would be part of this reality model would be to take a more directive approach with the whole family.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Absolutely. Sure, you could... It's very applicable to the whole family.</p>

<p>Carlson: Especially in this case, it sounded like there was all kinds of larger systems issues.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: I, Doctor, I want to get into your head a little bit. It would help me.</p>

<p>At the beginning, I remember&mdash;you may have talked a little bit about this&mdash;but what were you thinking and what were you feeling when he started talking and he talked? I know how I was feeling. I'm curious to know how you were and exactly what did you plan, and what did you see down the road?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I think what I did was I figured this was going to be pretty easy because he's going to give me so much material to deal with. I mean, it's like a supermarket, you know? You go through and pick something.</p>

<p>And sometimes we, we tend to look for the big problem or the underlying thing and, I mean, to me, there's so much that you can almost go in any direction with him.</p>

<p>So that's what I was thinking. And then as he talked more, I thought that I'm going to have a, a real task here getting him to focus, and so I just kept gently intervening to try to get him to focus on himself and what he could deal with. Because there's so many things that are impinging on his life. I mean, these are the thoughts I had, and so I said, "What can we really deal with here?" And I started with what he wanted, what I thought he wanted to deal with. Not what I thought. And not what, you know, someone with a lot of background might think he should deal with but, really, what did he want to deal with.</p>

<p>Carlson: So initially you were encouraged? With all of this material.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: I was wondering about how many sessions do you think it would take to help this client achieve his goals? It seems like he has a lot of issues and, as you just mentioned, he's unfocused, so I was just trying to get an idea about, you know, the timeline that we're talking about here.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, that's a very good point. Sometimes I answer that question by saying, "How many sessions do you have?" So, but that's not a very good answer.</p>

<p>The, I would like to see him if I could see him, I would like to contract for about 10 sessions and see where we are.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: So would it be like a brief therapy type of, of thing, then?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What other kind is there these days? Okay.</p>

<p>Carlson: So you would see the model, though, fitting quite well into the short&mdash;term therapies of today?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. Oh, sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>But, but I would say short&mdash;term and then evaluate, because you could, you could see any client, probably, and certainly him until you resolve all the problems; that would be wonderful. Or you could see him or another client until you sort of get the, as I said, get the engine moving, the get the locomotive started down the track until it's partway there, not all the way there. And that seems to be the trend in all of counseling, and this fits quite nicely with that.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: I think whenever, as, whenever you're working with clients and there's a cultural difference, one of the things that I've noticed, I think, in clients, is that often they just want the therapist to acknowledge and to know what this is, so to acknowledge that this is, this window is something, whether it be a barrier or an obstacle or feeling targeted and looked upon.</p>

<p>He said, "The walls don't have eyes," but my sense is that he believes that there are eyes in the walls, and so I think a big piece of the work that we do is getting into that client's world and just really acknowledging that the oppression exists and that, that it's really hard, that the writing piece does in some way mean a rejection of himself as an Hispanic person, as a migrant, a son of migrant family, and working with that in a way that would be, as you say, helpful for him so that it, so that it doesn't overwhelm him but that he also gets to, to know that you understand that piece of him.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think all that's in the area of environment, establishing a relationship, a connection with him and all</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: How would you do that? As you say, it's in the environment as you develop that relationship.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I mean, you could do it just the way you described it: is to acknowledge and ask him about it perhaps a little bit more.</p>

<p>Carlson: I think it's the</p>

<p>Wubbolding: What are, what are his thoughts about this, you know, as he, as he feels or as he's told, "un&mdash;Americanized" or however that person said that to him.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: Which is another interesting piece, that he would talk about people seeing him as un&mdash;Americanized, himself, but this is a person who didn't have an accent at all.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: That's right.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: And it didn't, he must have worked really hard not to have that accent.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I didn't know. I didn't know much about that as far as his background, whether he's a, is an immigrant or what.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you talk about that because that's one of the, another thing about reality therapy, is that reality therapy doesn't seem to want to know much about the background and doesn't seem to want to get into the history.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think it depends on the person. It depends on the individual. You certainly should know whether there's a history of violence or something like that or, or you know, any kind of dangerous behavior, but it's not something that's emphasized, that's true. What we emphasize is where are you now and where do you want to go? And rather than the history - or sometimes the history is a history of misery and not much history of success so we want to try to stress - I mean, that's what's presented to us a lot of times in the histories, so we, we kind of emphasize what's going on now. And that's a point some people criticize.</p>

<p>Carlson: I think we've already started to do this, but maybe we're moving more into general questions, too, about the theory, and so we could certainly welcome those at this time, too.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Yeah, I, you started on this and I know in Glasser's, when I listen to him and he's been asked that question, he defends not focusing on the past or dwelling in the past, as you say, by saying that he accepts one's past and, of course, you can't change it. But you know, frequently we &mdash; I'm going to give a hypothetical situation where a woman comes in, perhaps 30 years old and I'm in a clinical relationship and talks about problems in her current relationship and then says halfway through the session that from the time she was 7 through 15 she was sexually abused by her stepfather and grandfather and has never told anybody this before.</p>

<p>Now, you know, do we simply say, "Well, that was awful and I accept that, now what are you going to do today?" Or do we allow ourselves to take a journey back with this client so that they can help understand what's happened to them and how that shapes their pictures of quality today?</p>

<p>Is that not important to help kind of deprogram that? And how far, how long might you do that or do you simply just avoid it?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: This is, this is a very good point and you get 10 reality therapists in a room, you have a good argument about that.</p>

<p>Kjos: Even with five, I bet.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Even with two. There are some who are pretty puristic about this and say, "Well, we're not going to talk about it or talk much about it." I don't, I, I'll just give you my viewpoint. To me, there is a concept in reality that we call total behavior, all of our behavior being made up of action, thinking, feeling and physiology. Now, I don't believe that that is past behavior. I think that's a current thinking behavior and maybe feeling behavior, and so my thought is that that needs to be talked about explicitly as much as that person wants to.</p>

<p>We would probably talk about it and encourage the person to discuss it as&mdash;not "probably," we "would"encourage the person to discuss it as a reporter.</p>

<p>Not to relive the experience in every detail, but to talk about it as a reporter observing it. But not as much as perhaps many other counseling theories would talk about it. We would very quickly have that person evaluate is this going to help you to continue to talk about it? But I would not avoid the discussion of it.</p>

<p>Carlson: So it's</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Now that may be different from what you would hear from somebody else who teaches reality therapy, but I'll just give you that viewpoint. I don't think it's past behavior. I think it's very current.</p>

<p>Carlson: So the reporter, though, is somebody then who acknowledges that this did occur and talks about it but yet is detached.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Detached from it.</p>

<p>Carlson: And so it isn't something that one relives, relives each time</p>

<p>Wubbolding: We don't relive the trauma, no.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: You talk a little bit about physiology and I see some opportunities here as a, as a person in pain management. Can you briefly give me some ideas or experiences you've had that might be applicable to chronic pain and somatoform disorders?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I haven't had much experience with that myself. I will say that pain&mdash;are you talking about - Give an example.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: Well, chronic pain. Let's say someone who's been in an accident or has a low back problem. Something's really getting to them.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. We would, we would counsel that person much the same as we would anyone else who has a behavior. Paining is a behavior. Oftentimes we use the "ing" words&mdash;paining, depressing, angering&mdash;to indicate that these are behaviors, these are behaviors that are generated.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: They're not choosing behavior.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, let me come back to choice in a minute. In the sense that the person does not have a lot of control over that, but once again, we would certainly have that person get whatever physical help they need from the competent medical professional.</p>

<p>At the same time, counseling them about areas of their lives where they do have control. And you know, there's a famous quote from Maggie Kuhn, the founder of the Gray Panthers. She once said, "I wake up in the morning, and I, my arthritis kills me but I get involved and I forget it." So there may be a little bit more control over it than at first we recognize, but that's not to say we have 100 percent control.</p>

<p>Norman Cousins tells the story about going to visit Arthur Fiedler who was, at that time, crippled with arthritis, and he went to visit Fiedler in his home, and there he is sitting kind of with a blanket over him in his study and just crippled with this arthritis, and they had a dinner at his home and he got a little lively. And then afterwards he kind of shuffled out to the car, to the limousine that picked both of them up to take them to the concert hall.</p>

<p>And then in the concert hall, he kind of, or on the way in, he kind of walked a little bit more energetically, and he got in the, in the concert hall and conducted this orchestra for two hours without a trace of arthritis, and then came back home and reverted back to his arthritis, which illustrates, in control theory it illustrates the, what can happen when you really figure out how to fulfill that power need. Because who's more powerful than a, than a conductor who can tap that baton and have all these geniuses do exactly what you want them to do when, when you want them to do it.</p>

<p>So, so, but that's a, I mean, there aren't, there may not be that many Norman Cousins or Arthur Fielders or Maggie Kuhns around, but it just illustrates the point. It doesn't prove it, but it illustrates the point that, that we might have a little more control through counseling and through pain management programs than at first we thought we had. But I think the person needs some, a great deal of empathy.</p>

<p>Being somebody who had lower back trouble, I, I have a lot of empathy for people who have it.</p>

<p>Audience Member #8: I'm a little confused as to something you said earlier about the limitations and the potentials of the therapy with different populations. You said that reality therapy grew out of work in the criminal justice system, but then later said that it probably isn't a good choice of therapy for social pathology.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Well, I said I didn't say it probably isn't a good choice; I said I'm not sure of the effectiveness of anything with that person. But I think, I think you could use it with any clientele. At the same time, I don't want to make, you know, grandiose claims.</p>

<p>I think that would be inappropriate.</p>

<p>Audience Member #8: Are there some populations that this therapy just will not work with?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I don't want to sound, you know, Pollyanna or grandiose. That's why I'm being very evasive about the answer, except to say that I think it's applicable to anybody. The reason, my rationale behind that is that we all have needs. If we believe that we all have needs and we all develop these pictures in our head&mdash;the quality world, the inner house of what's desirable to us&mdash;and if we all generate behaviors, then this system should be operative there. It should be applicable.</p>

<p>But a lot depends on the skill of the user. It depends on the willingness and ability of that person to make some choices.</p>

<p>Audience Member #9: You've told us a lot about what reality therapy is, but I'm wondering what are some of the misconceptions of reality therapy?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: And there are many. In one of the earlier books on counseling theory, it stated that it was a watered&mdash;down version of behavior modification.</p>

<p>And I don't see that anymore in the literature because of the introduction of control theory as the basis, so I don't hear that a lot. I think some of the misconceptions are that it's a kind of a harsh method, you know: "We're going to get that person in touch with reality." Well, really, it started in a time of history when the psychodynamic methods were pretty much emphasized in William Glasser's training, so he started to counsel with people and suggest that they are responsible; they can do better. We're not going to talk endlessly about ancient history. And so as a result, he called it originally reality psychiatry. The only thing was, the psychiatric profession did not pick it up very much, and so people picked it up who were more therapists, teachers, corrections workers. And so he switched it very quickly to reality therapy.</p>

<p>And, and so as a result, people use it in kind of a directive way and say, "I bring people into touch with reality." I think that's a misconception, that it's, it's hammering on people. And I think you saw in this video that that's certainly, hammering on somebody is a far cry from what we do. So I think that's one of the misconceptions about it.</p>

<p>Another misconception is that because we don't talk a lot about the past or talk a lot, endlessly, about the emotional, affective, feeling part of a person's behavior, that we're not dealing with it. And I think we are dealing with it quite nicely by getting the person to take some action. And their feelings of alienation and oppression and rejection and whatever it may be, I think you can deal with them kind of indirectly by getting the person to do something that they can feel successful at doing, and then they feel better all over.</p>

<p>I think those are some of the, some of the misconceptions. And there may be other ones, too. If I think of any, I'll come back to them.</p>

<p>Audience Member #9: You had mentioned earlier that reality therapy is using a lot in the schools.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #9: You said it works best with people who choose to want to be helped. I was wondering, being in the schools, a lot of students are referred by their teachers and by their parents and have a lot of resistance, and I was wondering how you work with these students or, you know &mdash; Explain a little bit about how your therapy would work with them.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: I think there's two levels of application in schools. One is on the organizational level and one is on a counseling level or therapy level. Let's start with the therapy level. And this would be true in schools or anywhere: one of the, I think, approaches that's very useful with a person who's resistant and so on is the paradoxical approach.</p>

<p>Not that reality therapy thought of it or anything. Nobody in the system thought of it. It's, many people have done it for years: Victor Frankl, Milton Erickson, dozens of other people. But it fits very nicely with, with resistant people, which is to kind of validate what they're doing. Obviously not validating antisocial behavior or anything like that, but, and it should never be used with dangerous behavior. But as I did with him a little bit in there, is almost holding him back from doing what he was reluctant to do anyway. That can be very, very useful.</p>

<p>But on a counseling level also, it's extremely important that, that we connect with that person&mdash;hostile, difficult, surly, angry, resistant&mdash;because those are the behaviors they're generating to get their needs met. If we can see it that way instead of just hostile or whatever it may be, resistant, if we can see it as a behavior that they're doing as best they can to get their need met, then we see it slightly differently and then we can, can relate to the person and, and help them put some other behavior inside of them.</p>

<p>And have them evaluate it. That component of self&mdash;evaluation is extremely powerful. Is this helping you? Is this hurting you? Is it getting you what you want? And many people have not really taken the time to self&mdash;evaluate.</p>

<p>The organizational application in schools, which really makes it less necessary to even deal with this kind of disruption as is shown and where it has been done, there is data that shows that when these ideas are used on a school&mdash;wide basis, there's a lot less disruption.</p>

<p>What Glasser has done is take the ideas of W. Edwards Deming and apply them to education, as other people have done, too.</p>

<p>Deming being the one who really introduced the concepts, his concepts into Japan when no one would listen to him in the United States after the war, he took his ideas to Japan because they asked him to. And you see what the result is. So people are applying those to schools, and we call it the quality school, and there's, self&mdash;evaluation by the students is one of the key components. So when it's done on an organizational basis, that's another application.</p>

<p>Another keystone in that quality school is what we call practicing lead management as opposed to boss management. Abandoning the autocratic, "it's my way or the highway" kind of motto to where we will work it out, a more participative kind of management. Which is easy to say and a lot of people agree with it, but when you get right down to it, it's very difficult to put into practice.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's a tough thing to pull off. The students that were talked about being referred by teachers and parents seem a lot like the reluctant client that you talked to in this demonstration, and maybe a lot like the reluctant clients that Glasser worked with at the Ventura School.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Exactly.</p>

<p>Carlson: Probably people who don't want to focus much on their history because it hasn't been all that positive for them.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It's too painful.</p>

<p>Carlson: Too painful. So maybe this model will work quite well for these reluctant clients.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: There's a school in Shattuck, I mean, Quincy, Illinois, called Shattuck School and they have used these ideas for about four years. And when we first started to use them there, they had approximately 300 incidences a month&mdash;this is a residential school, small number: 50 kids&mdash;and now they're down to 40 to 50 incidences a month and never any violence. And so they've really gotten sensational results. They have data.</p>

<p>I mean, the documentation is there to show what happens.</p>

<p>Carlson: There's kind of a shift that we're seeing that kind of dovetails on this point in healthcare that we're having these mandated clients, these ones who might not come in on their own. Maybe the courts are sending them or their employers are making them go get counseling and it seems like your model might have a lot of applicability for this group as well.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: It does, and the way to start with that person is not "what are you doing?" but "what do other people think you're doing? What do they say you're doing?" And you'll get a lot of denials and so on and, well, "Yeah, I know you're not doing it, but what do they think you're doing?" I worked at a halfway house for women and they had, these were ex&mdash;offenders and none of them had done anything, but the judge thought they did. So we would ask them, "What did the judge say you did?" Okay, and it's kind of like almost accepting the denial at first and, and using it instead of attacking.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: I hear the words "responsibility" and "choice" used a lot in different therapies also. What's the role of choice in reality therapy?</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Yeah. Let me start with the word "responsibility" for a moment. We used to talk about that more than we do now. The reason is sometimes words which are widely used take on political meanings that we really don't intend it to have and people sometimes use them as weapons. You know, "You're responsible. Because I do reality therapy, I know you're responsible." So it gets to be kind of punitive, so we're continually searching for words that are clear and explain the ideas without a lot of jargon, at the same time don't have these meanings that are not intended. But "responsibility" was a word that was used originally. But really what it means is that I have choices. So, so what role does choice play in this?</p>

<p>One of the principles is we say that we choose our behavior. That's a principle. Now how does that play out differently with different people? What we, it's important to understand that when we say a person has choice, it doesn't mean everybody has every choice possible. I mean, when I wake up in the morning, I have a certain choice. I can, I can, I can't weigh any less tomorrow morning. I'm going to weigh five, 10 pounds more than I want to weigh tomorrow morning, okay. But I do have some choices to do something about, I just don't have a choice to make a decision that's different. I have blue eyes. I don't have a choice to change my blue eyes.</p>

<p>Now, there are some other areas. I wake up in the morning and I choose to speak English. It would be wonderful to wake up and be able to choose another language, but there's only one choice available; that's to speak English.</p>

<p>When I say "I," I'm using this as a metaphor for many people.</p>

<p>So we do have some choice, now it may be only one choice. And secondly, we don't have total choice over everything. I can raise my arm; that's easy. I can bring my arm down. That's a pretty explicit choice. But when somebody's depressed or upset, they don't have a choice to just, like that, abandon that. That takes some time. But if we think of it as a choice, clinically, therapeutically, it becomes very empowering to that person. Now, nobody says, "I'm going to choose to be depressed," so what we do is we suggest that, well, "Is there anything you're doing that you could do, you could choose to do differently?" That a person will have more choice over.</p>

<p>So of those four components in that behavioral component&mdash;subcomponents: action, thinking, feeling and physiology&mdash;we have the most choice over the actions.</p>

<p>So, so we really try to get people to choose to do some things differently than what they used to do.</p>

<p>There's another element I'd like to mention, though. I'd like to, to ask you to think about behavior as like a suitcase. And in this suitcase we have actions, thinking, feeling and physiology, and some of the behavior, some of the elements in our suitcase are like some clean laundry and some people have some dirty laundry in their suitcase. And at times, you'll, a student will come to school and the only thing they may have in there is some antisocial behavior and unhelpful, harmful behaviors and they reach in their suitcase and that's what they find. So they take it out and they use it.</p>

<p>Now this gives us another perception of their behavior. We say, "That's what they have." But that's not, we don't want to, we don't want to leave them with that. Our goal in education and counseling is to help them put something else in there: more coping behaviors. And so, as we work with Juan in the future, there may be a lot of behaviors he has in there which he grew up with which, you know, are in there.</p>

<p>Let's help him cope and put some other behaviors in there to cope with some of the, the things that, the systemic problems that he may, may encounter. Let's help him put some other behaviors in that suitcase.</p>

<p>So, so if you think of it that way, it becomes a little bit more manageable.</p>

<p>Carlson: Unfortunately, now we have lost our choice here and, and we're going to have a little reality that our program needs to come to a close. I'd really like to thank you and Diane would, too, and the audience for helping us learn about reality therapy. Thank you, Bob.</p>

<p>Wubbolding: Could I add something, please, here? I'd like to add just one comment. Needless to say, I'm pretty much involved in teaching it, but I always encourage people to take what's useful and leave aside what's not useful. No counseling theory should be seen as a cult. No counseling theory should be seen what I like to call "God in a box."</p>

<p>There's God; we've got God trapped. That's all you need. Take what is useful and leave aside what'mfs not useful. I think that's a very important aspect, and that's the spirit in which I teach this and I hope that you will, you will keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Kjos: Thank you.</p>

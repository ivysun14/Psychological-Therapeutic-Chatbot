<p>Client 0324-006, Interview #11. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) cold outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it? (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not...no. It hasn't been (inaudible) I </p>

<p>(background noises)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) discovered in the last couple of days like really bad and I'm (inaudible) talk to friends, I guess, and (inaudible) [cut myself] (ph) or (inaudible) 00:01:44 Like I really was trying to figure out how I could get away from his Thanksgiving so I could find (inaudible) to talk to except that (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes me realize that I've got to sort of start making sense and not depend on the old one. And also kind of that I... I really got spoiled when I was in college and I always had someone to talk to or in high school. I was...like I've always had really close friends and they've always been there and (inaudible). When there aren't people around that meet my criteria for close friends, then I tend of fall back on the ones that I have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two questions or two things; one was I was going to (inaudible) if I had been where you've been caught recently and I made this decision or (inaudible) you know, tried to change back in some way (inaudible) wanting to talk to somebody and (inaudible) I tried it and it wasn't anybody I...I'm not sure how I feel when that happens (inaudible) I guess I'm thinking I'd feel bad. (inaudible) That's why I asked you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't feel bad. (inaudible) But it's something that I should have (inaudible) recognize. I mean like, there was really only one friend...there was one friend in Nebraska I could possibly go see but I would be imposing because she's going to have in-laws there and the one that I really am sure I could not be imposing on to talk to is one that I was going...who usually goes to her own house in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving but since he's been married he's going to stay in Vermont and not come home until Christmas so she's just not going to be available...not going to be going home. And it's a little far to drive. And 00:04:19</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: But...and then there are...there's like one guy that I know that has been writing me and saying that he would like to talk to me and I would like to talk to him except that I have been too out of it to write him and had I, you know, arranged it sooner, I should have...would have been some way that we could have gotten together but kind of now all I can do is just write him and say that I'd like to talk to him sometime and hope that we can work something out in the future...that he's not already engaged or something like that; in a position where he can't talk. 00:05:04</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess what I'm hearing and I need to check out is like, what you're talking about is somebody that would...it would be...it would provide something different from if we plan to meet one time. Like that would provide you more space to talk but it sounds like you're talking about something different from...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...coming to therapy more often.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's...I don't know what it is but it's something that's...whatever a friendship is different from a therapy session. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It all sort of came out like Sunday night...I was just having dinner with my boyfriend and things were going very nicely and I had just spent all afternoon testing a client for (inaudible) like working really hard for like a really good...and actually accomplishing something. So in my own profession, I'm something that could help him in his profession (inaudible) 00:06:29 and how some of my confidence was actually worth something, even though I hadn't come here to learn to be an intelligence tester and so anyway, so those generally a good rapport (inaudible) between us. And we just sat down to a very nice relaxed dinner (inaudible) and somehow in the midst of while we were preparing dinner both of my roommates had come in and said something about what was I doing for Thanksgiving so they could plan on using the house for their families...plan on having a big dinner or what. And I (inaudible) and (inaudible) my boyfriend (inaudible) talking about everything under the sun and not just Thanksgiving but what (inaudible) wanted to do with my life. What I wanted to do after I get through working getting my (inaudible) and it's kind of the first time he's ever really asked me. And that I've ever really felt like he cared (inaudible) I'm very surprised. I was kind of the first time that they've ever really said (inaudible) to talk about it and could talk about what was going on...why I felt terrible. We were kind of...god, we talked for a long time (inaudible) 00:08:29</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) so my association is there's (inaudible) but I (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's pretty true. I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not? Could you go on without it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it didn't last either night. I mean there would be...there were kind of bad parts at, you know, at the end of our conversation or something like that each night but...it's all so distant (ph) expression...maybe it's about time. Maybe just skeptical (inaudible) I don't know...or maybe feeling it...I don't know; that I should...that he's (inaudible) really necessary to talk to and yet I felt like a burden talking to him and stuff. Some things we...like as far as how we stood with each other, we didn't get any (inaudible) and so, in that case, I felt like it was very one sided when he tells me about me, which (inaudible) But I know (inaudible) was able to get some reaction from him and some support and...I guess just to express some things that I really hadn't even expressed to myself that was going on. No one has ever asked me and...like you said what do you want to do? (inaudible) kind of listed off a whole bunch of things that I would like to do (inaudible) wasn't doing this. And that I felt really paralyzed in doing any of it. I guess maybe because I didn't know how to organize how to do things or maybe because I was very disgruntled at myself for having not accomplished (inaudible) in so long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) underlying for you how little you...how little control you seem to have over whether or not you approach some (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, there are a whole bunch of things like...I don't know. I'm not quite sure (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm sure. I kind of cut you off there. (silence from 00:11:57 to 00:12:21)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really...I don't know why I expect it (inaudible) couldn't get (inaudible) to do anything...part of me just gets...it was really hard to do things alone and I couldn't keep chasing all over the country to the few friends that I have...the really good friends planning my life and their lives (inaudible) and I guess I just started talking about like some things that I would like to do before I "settle down" for good in, one place. And some of them are things like just doing a lot of traveling and kind of experiencing or visiting or spending some time with a lot of different ways of life; a lot of different kinds of people and I...like my alternative to taking another job in New York this winter and this spring (inaudible) to like go to San Francisco and try to get a job (inaudible) boat or waitress. I did that out of California for a while. I could probably do...it would probably be (inaudible) but that's a really nice way to travel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean on one of these cruise boats? Oh, my. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's a really cool life because you're with a whole different class of people...whole nice class of non-intellectuals that are really cool. And you get to view the upper class from a very different perspective and them treating you in a very different way. And (inaudible) and I mean that's just one thing that I would like to do sometime and would probably be better if I did it now than when I'm 30 or 40. And yet I haven't done it. And I'd like to do some kind of anthropological research. Even if it wasn't (inaudible) Like I really would like to study different people on this Greek Island that I stayed on for a while (inaudible) which would entail just going there and living there for a while. And for a while, this girlfriend and I were going to do it together and then she decided to get married and get settled down and get her PhD. And it's something that I really don't want to do alone because it could get [really lonely] (ph). 00:15:43 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tell me this like it's two (inaudible) or maybe...maybe it's just one (inaudible) some sort of (inaudible) I'm not sure if that's what you're feeling but I guess that's getting conveyed to me somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's possible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't...I don't really know. I mean it's a taste...like I would not be content, I don't think, if I settled down doing almost anything right now. And I'm not quite sure how to go about...being mobile because I've been (inaudible) I just...I guess I kind of want to be really free...just go out [in traffic] (ph). Just take one job one week and one job the next week (inaudible) or whatever. 00:17:07</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) really just wants to go where you feel like going; not plan out ahead but start one place and if you feel like stopping for two months (inaudible) move to New Mexico or something. (overlapping voices) the process is too much and you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean for one thing, I really feel like there's a hell of lot in this world and a lot of things about people that I need to know before [I make any kind of decent psychologist] (ph). And somehow (inaudible) high priced existence is not helping (inaudible) working in the (inaudible) living in (inaudible) which I've done but there are other ways of life and the black and the white that (inaudible) or in New York or in this country. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it sounds like you're saying...so, this, isn't something that's like irresponsible or just what you're sloughing off responsibilities or whatever. (inaudible) some sort of purpose to it but (inaudible) well, it isn't, you know, that you have to get there by doing this, this, this and this at this particular time. (inaudible) if the essence of worrying about people would be to go where you felt like going to be with them and really just see it (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean...that's pretty much it. I mean it would be a...in a sense, a lack of responsibility. It would certainly be a freedom but it would be, in a sense, a very profitable kind of responsibility (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess what I was trying to contrast it with is a kind of academic life that sometimes feels free but there's these deadlines and then it's...you know, you have to do this before you do that and then you get (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>P; That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...pulled and then you do everything their way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, it's like there's a whole other world that doesn't run by somebody else's way. Yeah. (inaudible) see that before...become so methodical that every substitute isn't the same (inaudible) not much point in moving anymore. 00:19:52</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there...if you feel that's going to be the end result for you someday, you will have that feeling...no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not necessarily. I feel like if no one knows any other way of life than their own, it can easily result in (inaudible) society. I think if someone knows many ways of life or alternatives to a particular way of life where they're not contented (inaudible) then [they've got no life] (ph) at all. I also really feel very strongly that I need to be and want to be doing something for somebody else. And I'm really not sure how...somehow...being a psychologist [in it's present] (ph) form is not providing that fulfillment for me. I think the psychologist...psychology could...psychology mixed with anthropology (inaudible) some kind of social psychological (inaudible) purpose could do that. But right now I don't feel like I (inaudible) anybody (inaudible). And I don't know...there are a lot of kinder things that I'd like to try doing and I don't know...I'd like to try some...working...Christian (ph) movement kind of changes; kinds of programs (inaudible) people to help themselves; that kind of thing. Organizing people like me to help ourselves. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Discontented. (inaudible) I don't know, it's like I just would like to be [through the book] (ph) and find a style that (inaudible) be free to go anywhere. I'm kind of living (inaudible) except the way that (inaudible) (quiet from 00:23:55 to 00:24:13) And I just had this really horrible feeling that I'll never do that and I'm stuck right here forever and ever (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) described (inaudible) but it sounds like to you, in a sense, they don't because they feel very far away (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't know what it is that's stopping me (inaudible) I think it's like a whole bunch of different things all mixed together. (inaudible) Some of it is just not knowing which course to take, when and not having a clear idea of what to (inaudible) Part of (inaudible) Part of it's (inaudible) what I want and having conflicting (inaudible) and try and decide the priority for them. 00:26:26</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you're saying I need...I need to be so much more clear about some things before I could work on them or do anything and I'm so unclear. (inaudible) not being able to start (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure (inaudible) in that I want so bad to (inaudible) but I can't. Or I'm trying to move in so many directions at once that I'm standing still. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there's an awful...second thing sounds like there's an awful lot of energy in attempts going on but they go on in little bits and pieces and the net result is no movement. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just one direction or another (inaudible) and really (inaudible, quiet to 00:28:19) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) some of it is that I really don't feel together enough to do anything at all. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say what together meant right there? I mean meant for you like I kind of know (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) that I can gather enough of me together to head in a new direction with any kind of sense that I can do it; any kind of sense of purpose at all. (inaudible) try. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I have to have some kind of...this would be my way of saying it, has to be some kind of...some core to something that feels pretty solid; that I have a sense of confidence in; that I could move. I might now have to know where but just move unified way (inaudible) identity (inaudible) What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know...kind of dead. Kind of like it's really an effort to express whatever is there that I was feeling or (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) started telling me? 00:30:43</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that I was thinking that I might (inaudible) talking about the... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean it's hard to work them up again or is this also maybe some feeling like, boy, I'm not getting anywhere even when I try; like it's not moving for me even when I say something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to ask you to try something; I don't...it doesn't usually take very long and I'm not sure how it will work out but this, is something that...that this person I know thought up to do with people and I've done it myself. It's really interesting and it sometimes can be useful. And I'll say what it is and then if you don't want to do it, we won't do it. What you're to do is like imagine that there's a canvas somewhere in the room here; just imagine there's a canvas and you're free to put anything on there that you want to; anything at all (inaudible) And the only thing you need to do is tell me about what you're putting on it and where it is and I will want to take that down, if that's alright. And then, I don't know (inaudible) why am I possessing this? I'm thinking about that because I'm thinking that one thing that happens that frustrates me with us is that you get...you feel like, boy (inaudible) express what's going on and then I see myself really wanting to get there...get wherever it is...at different times, it's different things. But (inaudible) not a good way like either pressing...heel (inaudible) sometimes saying well, I wish you could fall (ph), which I mean but I don't...it's not helpful. So maybe (inaudible) totally different mode but I don't know. What does that sound like to you? I don't want to use the time to (inaudible) 00:33:22</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not bad. When you first said that, you know, I knew you'd (audible) started thinking okay (inaudible) but I can put anything on it. I want and I immediately thought of...I had a wall (inaudible) that we wanted and I had really had a good time. I painted it these really fun trees which was like really symbolic and it started out...what it did, it started out in (inaudible) brights...red and orange and stuff which was kind of (inaudible) white and it ended up in kind of a tree (ph) which I think it started out as (inaudible) I think it started out as brown or blue (inaudible) blue is all that we had. I guess it's a form of light or something or the basic structure (inaudible) and the branches are very (inaudible) lot of greens and the fruit was both sweet (inaudible) it's kind of all (inaudible) And somehow when I drew that thing on that wall, I was really into it. I really felt the life that (inaudible) thing symbolical and when you first said what would you put up there? I started well, the only thing I know to paint, a tree. Tree. 00:35:46</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to paint. You can use...you can put anything (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, right. I mean that's just...that was the first thing that came to my mind but I thought...don't write it down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the same time that I couldn't paint that tree or anything (inaudible) because I didn't feel it and I didn't feel (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) that was very real and vital to you, it sounds like and (inaudible) you end up feeling disappointed in (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I mean, I thought of it...I thought of it...it was very hard to describe because I couldn't see it. So I didn't feel sad, I just felt that was something that (inaudible) at the moment. I mean I could just remember it very objectively and I really had trouble remembering even what symbolism I felt in what I drew. (inaudible) picture of a tree but it's a very meaningless kind of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, that's what it was to me and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it was like...it was like lots of yellow and lots of blue and I really liked the color and the only thing I could think of that I would want to put up there would be a great big (inaudible) I mean that's...had I something to write on now, to doodle on....it's probably all that I would do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not like toward the edge. (inaudible) it would be sort of...the center would be like (inaudible) that would be just to (inaudible) very large but then (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:38:48</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 00:38:59</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:39:04 </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have (inaudible) convey that some other way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: they don't have it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said if they don't. (inaudible) convey it some other way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:39:23</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you step back about five or six feet from it and look at it (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see it very clearly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:40:08</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to look at it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Slightly. It's...I (inaudible) faraway as I can. (inaudible) when I couldn't do things (inaudible) I can't each one (inaudible) so I don't want to have to look at it again even though (inaudible) part (inaudible) At one time, (inaudible) it lasts a long time. It lasted much longer than I planned on it lasting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it just reminded me that (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) somewhat (inaudible) 00:41:39</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like it. I need to feel like (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you said that, I was just thinking like, if it's alright with you, I'd like to kind of keep that and (inaudible) like we don't have to talk about it again or (inaudible) feel like changing it around (inaudible) and that would be...that would be good. (inaudible) I'd like that or something. I don't know how good this, is. (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. 00:42:35 (inaudible) I really tried to look inside (inaudible) and each woman was good at something (inaudible) to know that I couldn't stand not being able to communicate with my boyfriend at that time (inaudible) probably why (inaudible) I have no idea. One would be a note to myself for being things that I didn't like...couldn't stand. One would be a note to society that I couldn't (inaudible) and I didn't respect and didn't want (inaudible) and it's like each one would be different (inaudible to 00:44:05) And in a sense though, they'll always be there and that there are always going to be certain things that I'm going to say no to. I guess it's that I would like to change some of those things. Like I'll always say no to being unable to communicate with my boyfriend. I would like to change so I can communicate so that I don't have to say no to that situation...couple situation (inaudible) I don't know...part of what I was when I got into (inaudible) saying no to conventional style of life and decided it (inaudible) and somehow being able to...to lead your own life and to make you own life without being (inaudible) without being pushed to compromise yourself by (inaudible) because in some ways it's not...I mean it's a very real fear. (inaudible) worry (inaudible) really underground type people that are constantly getting screwed (inaudible) the government, universities, anybody that doesn't have to like them. 00:46:17 (inaudible) personal or moral character (inaudible) They stand against something that is not proper to stand against. (inaudible) Their way of life isn't quite (inaudible) and in a sense, I feel like I face that all the time. (inaudible) school with living up to the facts of token work [out put first is meaningful things done] (ph) (inaudible) about that. I don't feel like (inaudible) and finally it's finding a few really good people to work with it that work...I'll probably...my supervisor thinks I'm not doing anything...not in the line of duty like giving tests but like you really have to go out of your way to find something that's worth while to do. And I just really want to be free of this (inaudible) without getting censored for it. 00:48:29 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: is there something in there like (inaudible) but the way I've chosen to (inaudible) or the way I see myself (inaudible) harder?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean the problem is, in some sense, you have to (inaudible) some things out of life where you'll be evaluated. Any kind of job, you're going to be evaluated. And I find it very hard to find people who stand it, I accept evaluation (inaudible) I agree with (inaudible) and I (inaudible) the only alternative to that (inaudible) is to remain a...as long as you're a student officially, like not allowed to get your PhD or something like that (inaudible) pretty much (inaudible) I guess sometimes [it scares me] (ph) (inaudible) 00:50:33 I really feel a certain (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me something (inaudible) or (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, both. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) deep down inside somehow I wanted to comfort (inaudible) sense of (inaudible) self and doing something worth while (inaudible) I feel need something done for them (inaudible) That I am capable of (inaudible) But that's silly. I don't know (inaudible) 00:52:05 (quiet to 00:52:30) Part of it is like it's just adding more value to (inaudible) some kind of re-evaluating (ph) (inaudible) and that I'm working towards (inaudible) feeling like right now (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you needing some kind of (inaudible) not somebody else, it's like you're (inaudible) you need to (inaudible) without that things feel confusion or like they're not going anywhere (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it makes feeling like you have a sense of direction (inaudible) difficult. It's not impossible. 00:53:52 (inaudible) I feel that I can (inaudible) some things I'm bouncing off you and I'm not sure whether they're not right or it's like nothing can get to you now or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Combination, I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I don't feel like (inaudible) sound like (inaudible) I don't feel that way. I just (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I don't know if it would anyway but (inaudible) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) Okay what about tomorrow? </p>

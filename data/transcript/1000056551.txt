<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 0518-014, Session Number 8.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm okay and you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The mosquito's back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The mosquito's back. How was the last treatment (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You look just the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (both chuckling) A little - a few pounds heavier.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? Good old thick British food, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, right. Right, yeah, even after seeing how a little bit of fever is... [inaudible at 0:00:51.0]...today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, how come you came in?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How come you came in?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wasn't enough not to come in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Any excuse is good enough for me. (both chuckling) I'm okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether we're going to have a storm or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't call your friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because... [inaudible at 0:01:15.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I called him before I left and I haven't talked to him since.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not - oh, that's okay. It's nice to have...[interest in things.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anyway tell me what you did? Tell me about skiing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, there isn't too much to tell. I didn't have that good a time because I was just with my parents.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can you speak Austrian or German or something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I guess it wasn't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a couple of words.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it real touristy or not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Cause that could be dragy (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that was the least of the draginess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Can you like rap (ph) to your parents?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not too much but I like them. Not - they aren't as difficult to talk to as others somehow, so it was good. It made me feel kind of funny, being a child going around with your parents.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wish I were. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I've been feeling okay. I moved back into my apartment... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...on Sunday. I went to West End last weekend or just the weekend that just passed, whatever it is, but it was like a strange time. It was pretty good but there's been this thing - I don't know if I've talked to you about it, I guess I have - just this friend of mine Alan lives in West End who I have this kind of strange history with. I met him my first year and he fancied himself in love with me or something. [0:03:13.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was all hung up on Marco, who I've told you about, kind of and so I never got very close to Alan. But I've always like really liked him a whole bunch and I have been fantasizing in my head about him probably for the past like month or so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kind of like I felt like, 'Okay, I want to fall in love with somebody. I want to be special enough. I want to do that thing now.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I haven't felt this for the last... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...month or months and he didn't want any part of it. I mean like it wasn't like he didn't want any part of it but that's not where he was at, at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I figured that but it was like a little bit hard because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...he's like the first guy I've wanted to be with in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were both feeling... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but it was okay, we're still like good friends. I didn't like come - I wasn't' like big enough, I didn't make a thing out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just like something that was in my head but I've kind of squelched when I got there, so but it was kind of really like a nice leisurely weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know walking around West End and staying up real late and watching TV shows and Clint Eastwood movies and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was okay and it was good to be out of my apartment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my trial is tomorrow morning and so I have all sorts of stuff to be dealt with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like in your head or like or do you mean like things you have to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both. I mean I just have it over with, like it's over tomorrow... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if I don't have to have a continuance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:05:04.7]... and I felt, I got it all worked out and I did it and my parents sat me down and it feels like it's the first big thing that's happened. Well it's not even that big a thing but it's like the first thing that's happened that I haven't relied on them to come through with the money or support or something, and it felt good just not to have to run to them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. To really do something completely all on your own.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know like to take care of getting a lawyer and...and it feels like now I just won't ever have to tell them or if I do, if it like comes out at some point or other that's cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't do, didn't not tell them to hurt them really. At least I don't think I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's just that I wanted to be able to do it alone (ph). And it just feels really good moving out of the house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know or like, really like something that just feels like it's just, because like I'm fucking 18 years old and I've never really moved out you know. [0:06:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Cleaner.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'Cause it's cleaner to be out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it really is. And I really have a good relationship with them primarily but it's just...it's parents, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're like the bastion of your security or insecurity or whatever, but whatever they're the bastion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like not fair to have them there in all that. And I've been thinking a whole bunch of not being in school next quarter which scares me a whole lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and just like you're going to drift around or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's like, I mean I know that I'm not doing any work. I know that I haven't done any of my work for the only course I have. You know it's a course that I've chosen and I'm really excited about... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...theoretically, but I'm just not doing any of the stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but I've never disliked school so it's never like this, I mean just to leave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just kind of feel like I'm hanging out 'cause it's this familiar thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I've just started getting this feeling like some way of being strong enough not to have to need the familiarity to be part of my, part of life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that I should be able to... [inaudible at 0:07:32.7] But I don't know, probably like really have to explore a whole bunch, maybe I'll be able to do it with you, figure out - because I know it's like something important going on but I can't figure out what's right to do. Like I really [learn stuff] (ph) about my reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean for leaving school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know or deciding not to leave school... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and that kind of thing. And I can't help to think the bravest thing to do is to leave school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I say switch and I guess it isn't. And also there's one other thing in the stratus (ph) that I kind of want to confess, because if I say it out loud then maybe I'll like not do it. And that's it's like there's this thing that I can feel myself doing that I used to - it's like the way I used to live but I like really stopped doing it once I became conscious of moving (ph) and stuff, and all at once I just became conscious of hurting other people. So it's this thing that I used to like, like some...a couple of boys or something and I know that they've been getting in some way involved in me and that I really liked them but I knew it was like disproportionate. I wasn't caring about them as much as they were caring about me or I wasn't really caring about them at all; it was kind of an ego thing. [0:09:47.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really stopped relating that way to people and I really tried not to do that because it's rotten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have a feeling that I'm doing that now. Like I just met this really nice - Greg's like completely innocent. He is second year here and he's from upper New York and he lived on a farm all his life and he didn't even have like a TV; his parents didn't have newspapers...the media 'til he was like 15 or something. And so he's like, he looks like the epitome of innocence. He looks like you could've painted him...blonde and wide-eyed and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I like really liked him and started talking to him about a week ago. And he doesn't have any friends and he lives in this apartment with a bunch of other people that he doesn't know. And they're all kind of straight, it's like...physics people or something and he's in art. He's just really delicate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it like started perfectly innocent because he was real...I was working at Midlands and he was working at Midlands and we just, like we'd see each other a lot. And I know now that he's like, I mean I can read the script.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and he like at one point blurted, when I said something blurted out that he like loved me or something and I like realized I was treading on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm being, and I'm starting to do that whole, old trip again...that isn't good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Letting someone really get deeply involved with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, because I really want somebody to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't want it to be that...'cause all that does is hurt them and it doesn't fulfill what it is that I want anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because what I really want is to care about somebody else, too. It's not just having them care about me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And when you talk about - there's something about the way you talk about it, like it's - I don't know - like you kind of, like you're deeply ashamed of doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really am and I think that's really coming. And everything...that I respect in me thinks that just a really lousy way to be with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would certainly hate it being done to me because it's like basically a lack of respect in some way for the other person, by like letting them hurt themselves or making them hurt themselves, because that's what always ends up happening...because you can't give them what they want, only you're getting a whole lot. You know it's just like really unfair and icky. [0:12:56.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I also really thought I'd grown out of doing that. I really thought that and so I'm like, I'm distrustful of myself that I'm doing it. And it's like some way of trying to be straight with people... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...is what I really want to be...if I can. But I also like, I know the desire to do that is like super strong in me... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...against (ph) you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially 'cause like everything's been so shaky for a pretty long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then... like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like having someone be involved with you, like that makes you feel like you're all right again for awhile?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Like this funny thing - I don't know if I told you about it, but it's sometime while I was [with] there was this guy who was following me around. He was really strange. He like would never hardly say anything to me but followed me wherever I went. And I thought I was being paranoid. I thought...I was just like seeing a lot of him, until he like chased me home one night from the library and stammered off this thing about just wanting to get to know me or something. And everywhere I went he like would always be leaving these [papers in like...in my pocketbook.] (ph) I mean just like in the movies or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I never said anything to him. I didn't like lead him on in any kind of way, but I knew that I really liked that he was doing that in this strange way, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it well it meant that like somebody cared, even though he didn't have any idea who I was or anything. It was just the idea that I was like attractive to somebody and I mean like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...wanted to pursue me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that in some way it almost helped me keep track of myself because... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It helped you keep track of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can't explain why exactly. Well it's a little like, well you know how I get lost? You know how... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I like get drifting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like there is this someone like staring at me. It's like there's - he's looking at something and there I am, you know? 'Yeah, here I am.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, because he's looking at you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. So there's like some kind of energy doing that to me, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Because...it's like he's grabbed onto you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or something, yeah, I'm not exactly sure what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I kind of want to get - I haven't said anything out loud to anybody or even to myself. I mean I've - it like finally hit me yesterday when he like came to the library and just sat across the counter from me for like three hours just because he wanted to be around me... [inaudible - jet flying over] And he's just like the epitome of virginal, everything about him, just completely everything is. Like he's so symbolic it's... [0:16:03.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it's like embarrassing. You know and I kind of feel like...like he's asked me about myself and I've told him a lot...and I really have done a lot considering that I'm 18 and... [inaudible at 0:16:16.7] ...you know just all the weird scenes I've ended up in at some point or other. So I kind of feel a little bit like this interesting, corrupt... (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know older woman or something, you know? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Here's this sweet little, absolutely adoring, virginal, backwoods boy, right, whose like entranced with me and I feel like literally really dark and he's like completely pale and blonde and he's also just incredibly beautiful to look at. But it...I like it. But then it kind of ends up being this battle when I'm with him, like there are these two little voices; one wanting to like be adored... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because I want the attention and the care.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This other...part that's really, uh-oh. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible at 0:17:25.8]...you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like keep that guy following you around helped you keep track of yourself, like even more so like someone you know and like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Except for I know it, you know. I know that if I like - if he likes me too much...it would be like - really does what I think is he's doing, what ends up happening is I get...angry at myself for doing it but I turn it kind of sour on him. I know that I don't let him...I don't like appreciate him for all that he really is, because I'm just like angry at myself for doing that to him, so I like in turn get angry at him for liking me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's this weird kind of contortive (ph) thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. See him as - I don't know - somehow having gotten himself into humiliating position or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And it's like...I set up this trap that doesn't satisfy me and doesn't satisfy him and hurts us both. I just...I just really want to...stop it before it goes very far.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think now that I've said it, it will help. [0:19:02.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It will help. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But - what happened the day that you left? Something happened. I can't remember but it was something that - I think I might have written it down; I'll go look in my journal thing. It sort of was something that I wanted to tell you about that happened to make me feel better. I can't remember what it was though. (chuckling) I don't remember. [silence from 0:19:53.1 to 0:20:17.3] I didn't feel as I would feel as lost after the rest of the day when I felt like - I don't know. I just I think I feel basically a little bit better... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...this week than I did then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not so spaced out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More like being here (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Except for that I still can't work...and that it's the fifth or sixth week or something and I haven't done any work, any school work at all. [The green bottle there] (ph) that Virginia Wolf would stand, but I just can't do any work. I literally can't sit myself down to do it. And it's always been true that I work best under a lot of pressure... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which is also disgusting. (chuckling) I mean theoretically I'd like to be able to have goals; I should be able to like uphold them for myself instead of... [overlapping voices at 0:21:50.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because somebody's pressuring... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because of some outside pressure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As a matter of fact it seems like I like when a lot of things I do really have to do with outside stuff. [0:21:59.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have the feeling when you said that, that like - I don't know - like it costs a little bit of effort or something or like you were sort of showing me this ugly side of yourself when you...sort of gritting your teeth and showing me, but like with the sense of you were ugly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like I'm sitting here telling you all sorts of ugly things now (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're kind of disgusted at yourself and you feel conscious of presenting this [disgusting picture.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Oh, dear.] (ph) Yeah, I guess it is. Like I feel a little bit less space less (ph) but I don't feel like I've gotten anything else really together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're just like all these bad things that I have to do something about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all the ends are sort of left hanging?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. That's like almost what I just said, that's it exactly because everything is like untied. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't want, I mean in some way I don't school to be over. I'm not into school but I'm not at all...worried about the quarter being over, because then I feel like I'm going to have to make a really big decision... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like a really gigantic decision, about whether to stay or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's really hard to sort out...all the different things going into control of them. [silence from 0:24:48.4 to 0:25:13.0] And it's also a little bit - I don't know - it's also hard because I'm looking for something now and I guess I - and I guess I mean I always have but I - but I just have a sensation like I want to be cuddly, I want to be cuddled, now you know? [0:25:39.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you need someone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And more than that, now I want somebody. I mean but that's so confused; like I meet a lot of people because I work at the library, so I'm always meeting graduate students who always need stuff, who are always asking for telephone numbers. And as soon as they ask me for a telephone number, I mean as soon as they like say something like that there's this think that clicks in my head about not liking them. Like even if I like them just like...seen them a couple of times and they come over to the desk and we giggle and rap and...play or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's something with, 'Oh, and can I have your telephone number?' that just... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really don't know why. I mean I think it's like I'm afraid to go through that whole scene of meeting somebody and...going over to their apartment and then worrying about having to sleep with them if I don't feel like it. And I mean like in some abstract way I want somebody... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but I don't want to go find them; I don't want to like have to go through all that preliminary stuff. You know and in someway I also feel in this funny way faithful, because when I saw Alan - like there are a couple of men in my life that are very - I feel like I love, John and Marco and Alan, and those three are like the people that I want, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't have any three of them, any of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're...Marco is completely asexual; (chuckling) Alan isn't - Alan has a girlfriend who is not around; and John is about to get married. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there's something you're not... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I keep on like - and I like meet people and compare them kind of to them in this funny way. And I don't do it at all consciously but I know that I'm doing it in some other way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that getting interested in someone else would sort of diminish - I mean getting really involved with someone else would sort of dilute what you have for them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dilute what you have for the three of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No, I don't think so. Okay, that I thought maybe, like when I - I don't think it could because like I've - before I met John and then I met John, I like was wondering how I would feel about Marco... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...if I would still feel as strongly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I would still like really feel like I really loved him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I still did the whole time. [0:28:41.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And after John I still feel like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I even talked to John about Marco...while I was with John, I mean he was like always this important person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't think it would dilute it. I think it would dilute me (chuckling) [as if it] (ph)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a sense it would make it even more hard to keep yourself together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I don't know which way it would go. You know my inclination is that somebody liked - if somebody like was really in love with me and wanted to work like some kind of important relationship out...was willing to like go through stuff...changes, then it would help, it would like help. But then somewhere else though there's this feeling of, 'how can you do that until you are pretty sure of who you are?'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's why I really like - maybe that's one of the reasons why. Because each of those three people, John, Marco and Alan, I really have a feeling like they really know me. Like that's the thing about all of the three of them, is that I couldn't do what I'm doing to Dexter...I can't - I really - the funny thing I'm deluding him because I know he's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...completely fascinated by me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that I can come across that way. I didn't - I forgot that I could; I haven't done it for a really long time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I...the past quarter I certainly was not feeling like I could be interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, all those three guys know all the ugly parts of me really well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're super aware of them; they kind of hate them but they all in some way love me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's really essential that they like know all that and keep - maybe that's why I was telling you as a matter of fact about all that icky stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so that I'd really know you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which makes you more - exist more I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It makes me not - well I don't think I've like, I mean I know that I haven't pretended at all with you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know I haven't or it's not even pretend, because it's not - I don't feel like I pretend, but it's just like I've glamorized stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I just exaggerate everything and I can - and I haven't done that at all and...it was kind of what I wanted, I mean for our therapy to be, just not to do that. [0:31:59.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know not have to do that to have to feel like I could talk to somebody and have to be... [inaudible] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But each of those people, and each of the people that I've ever felt really close to, like have to know all those... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...icky things better than the good things in this funny way, so there's like no possibility that I can put anything over on them, because then I immediately would lose respect... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...just immediately I'd humiliate the other person... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...by feeling that way... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...describing myself and not being real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. And they are in kind of a weak position, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well maybe that's why I don't want to go through the whole thing of meeting somebody new because they don't know. I don't know. I don't know. [silence from 0:33:00.7 to 0:33:26.3] I don't know. [silence from 0:33:27.1 to 0:33:42.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just like spin (ph). I had a whole bunch of flashes but none of them really had any cohesion... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...at all and I couldn't really sort them out and I was just trying to like let something come up... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:34:10.3 to 0:34:32.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just felt - I don't know. Like want to talk about, I want to talk about leaving school but I'm a little bit feeling like I'm not supposed to talk, sort of like I shouldn't talk to you about that or something. I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know why. [silence from 0:34:56.1 to 0:35:09.8] Maybe it wasn't important [and I'm like wishing it to be.] (ph) [0:35:11.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was or not really psychological or something then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sort of regular mundane stuff you should be able to take care of for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Except for that I keep on finding that all that regular mundane stuff is chocked full of everything else, but that's what I meant... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...is like it's not - I don't know. [silence from 0:35:40.7 0:35:56.6] I guess that also I guess I'm waiting for something for me but I don't know what I'm waiting for, but I can't think of what it is that I'm waiting for. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you just expected it right then, yeah. Come on! (both chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's not fair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. [silence from 0:36:39.9 to 0:37:09.0] Wanting me to have some kind of good effect on you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean I also come out with something - I can't, I'm not sure whether - I mean it wasn't even in direct relation to anything that I just said, it just kind of, okay, it was your turn to like drop some very insightful... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Profound really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...some kind of wise advice or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or maybe something like penetrating...to something that I had said... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that you were seeing through or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or that you were like - I don't know. There wasn't any relation to any particular thing; it was just like (chuckling) kind of... [silence from 0:37:58.7 to 0:38:31.9] Or something about wanting to be with someone I guess. [0:38:33.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a little bit scary 'cause Holly's going away; she's probably going to Ryder before the end of this quarter, which will be really strange to me because of, I mean, of all the women here. - Oh, I know what maybe I wanted to tell you. I mean of all the women here she's like my most constant, she has been forever (ph) through whatever I think has been, happened, sort of like we care about each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not - it's different than lots of my other relationships, like it's a different kind of loving her, it's not as... [inaudible at 0:39:34.2] ...like it's not like Diane or it's not like Cathy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or Diane, I'm kind of in love with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's more of a steady friendship thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, instead of the passion being frightening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean she's amazing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's going to be really tough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Jen's leaving and she's like - I don't really know what there is between her and Jen. I guess because I know her, she's least like me or people I've been (ph) with, just in her life has been really different. It's something about how she thinks and where she is in the cosmos or whatever is like really different. So I'm never quite sure if I know where things are coming from in her. I do some about some things but I like really feel like I know Holly, she's like really close to...me and personally, like I can really understand her background and intuitively know a whole bunch about her. I don't know that much about Jen but she's leaving, too, which takes away the people - [I don't know anyone.] And it takes away some people I know closely... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes it makes me nervous like to lose even one or two of the people I'm in love with, even though I have others like...like what if I ended up with nobody? [0:41:35.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, kind of, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess also, I mean the reason I wanted to be in New York, the good reason or I guess it wasn't really a good reason but it was more good than bad, was because there are people that I really loved here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if a lot of them are leaving and have gone, then see there's another phenomenon and it like scares me a whole bunch and that's being anonymous (ph). It's really hard not to be recognized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And around here I'm really recognized. I mean I probably know more people than anybody I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even if it's just...proof of your friends and just like people that you can run into and have coffee with. When I was in Berkley and didn't know anybody, literally, it was really scary because I just didn't even have like anybody saying hello to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I - and I was really lost then. If you think I was lost... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...before you should have seen me then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You almost disappeared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I ended up being delirious in the hospital for three days [and two nights,] (ph) just like completely unaware of who I was and then just wasn't anymore; I had like pretty much dissolved. And just like in all sorts of things I've always dressed a little bit differently. I don't just usually wear just a T-shirt and a pair of jeans; it's always like a brighter color, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, something to make certain that other people see you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right, yeah. My sister does that too; we talked about that when she was here. Because we'd go, like we went to stores together and I realized like she does the same thing I do; like we always talk to the sales people and like have special raps with them so they'll remember us and we'll remember them; just kind of like I have to make special contact with every single person you run into.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then...like, well when I go to visit people, like when I hitchhike or go visit friends in some other place, it's like I made a conscious effort this time to really care more about Alan than anybody else in the house or - because otherwise I like want to know every person there and have them like me and like them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I lose sometimes what's really important to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know but somehow not being anonymous also is like really important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:44:32.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I also have the feeling that it shouldn't be. Like I feel like it's - and I don't know - it's like both a good quality and not a good quality; like it's nice to talk to everybody and not to just like...pass people by and not touch them in any way but it also feels like it's this kind of weird need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I know it. Like you shouldn't have to - well like you should be able to recognize yourself or something and not sort of...if you don't get it you dissolve on the spot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's too close to dissolving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right that's what it is just too close to dissolving. And New York is a place I'm...in that way never dissolve. I might dissolve in all sorts of other ways... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never as to not being recognized.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But that's not enough reason to stay in a place. I mean that's not a reason... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that I should stay in New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so if all the people that I'm really close to are just a good reason for staying... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go, then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You won't have any good reason to stay here anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And also 'cause I have this sneaking suspicion that I've really been, and I guess in some really big way, always fighting and I'm fighting for and against it at the same time and that's...differentiating myself from my parents and getting away from them... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know and moving into that house last quarter really felt like. And it really feels like when I'm with them now in some basic way I'm a lot father from them than I ever have been and so...not that we don't care about each other as much but I'm just not quite the same when I... [overlapping voices at 0:46:53.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you're separate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But Jen pointed out that in some ways like there's still a false separateness because they're still like around the corner.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it might be some of her not...her wanting - her father died about two, three years ago, so it might be some of the stuff in her like wanting it and not being able to have it that makes her so vehement, you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and kind of angry at me that I still have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But still, I think in some ways she's right. [0:47:32.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still am in New York and they are literally three blocks away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [A short hysterical mile away.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wait, you look like you're... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...[crying or something?] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. [silence from 0:47:57.9 to 0:48:08.9] But when she said it, when she said that she really thought that the best thing I could do would be to leave New York... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jen said that. I really got scared.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-uh! (making noise)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Ah-ah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I also felt like I could handle it. I mean I felt like that probably is really - I mean I'm ready in some way although I don't want to be; I don't want to do it because it's going to be really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I could be [e-ching, which is that] (ph), 'Don't do anything big.' This is like 100 things small or something. It was basically, don't do anything very big 'cause you're not ready for it yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And when you saw that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just talked to myself before I threw it; I just talked myself into that I was ready to do it. So when I saw that it was kind of like that was a false readiness in that. And I wasn't really relieved; I thought I would be relieved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wasn't. I was just like, 'I'm going to have to do a whole bunch of work in the next five weeks to get myself together enough so that will be able to do it.' But then I'm like - I don't know - just little things like, I woke up this morning; opened my eyes and really just loved my room and just felt like I didn't ever want to leave it. And two nights ago a man moved here on Sunday night; there were just - there were like eight people in the house, all these friends of peoples; and we have a fireplace and we broke up some furniture for a little fire and made a big fire and sat around roasting marshmallows and just singing and telling... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it was so warm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...crazy stories and it was really warm and then we all smoked some mescaline dope and got tripy but it was still really warm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just felt like...this is what I'm really looking for if it could be this way... [0:50:32.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know, so why am I going - why would I go away? And then I realized that I'm not sure how much I really have it, because I thought I had it last quarter when the whole thing fell through... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so I'd better not depend on it. You've really got a cold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm afraid so. (chuckling and blowing nose)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you believe in Vitamin C?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not too much... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't believe in it very much either and I sporadically do and don't. Last time I had a cold I didn't believe it but the time before I did and it really helped, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe I should take some?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you should take some.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it time? [0:51:25.4]</p>

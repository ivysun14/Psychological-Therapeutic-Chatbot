<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yknow, it's all blind so they don't know who you are.  They just transcribe it.  Okay.  Nice day out there. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] so I got to sit on riverside.  Traffic this morning?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It was bad?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, it took me 2 hours to get in.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well luckily we don't compare much, which is good, good for you.  This is the first time you're here alone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So family, so that must be a vote of confidence that you're doing well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you May 21st.  You were sleeping seven hours with the Ambien CR.  Your appetite was good.  Your exercise and your energy was good.  Your self-esteem was good.  Your concentration was fine.  You were efficient.  Your mood was okay.  You're not anxious.  You're not irritable.  You're not suicidal.  You're not hopeless or helpless.  So, we thought that in the setting of your low grade depressant illness you were in full remission and we decided to maintain you on the Effexor and as needed Ambien and Ativan.  Do you use the Ambien?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I've actually been better.  In the beginning I was still using it, but since the last time I saw you -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, the Ambien or the Ativan?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The Ambien.  And the Ambien, I've actually been weaning off of it, like I've been doing it only as needed so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So about how many days of the week do you end up using it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe once.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Maybe once, maybe twice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how many hours do you sleep?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, pretty much 7.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So now you sleep 7 hours without the Ambien.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I might wake up once, but able to fall asleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get right back to sleep. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's your mood like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So mood is neutral?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We don't go for happy.  That's your problem, you know make your life happy if you want to be happy.  Here we go for neutral.  And neutral?  You're in a decent place?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not convincing me yet.  Are you sad much of the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get many episodes of sadness?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not like I used to.  No, not at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you anxious?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you irritable?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to enjoy things normally?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You get belly laughs?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> From what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just funny stories and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So we're plus.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm happier more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Experience of pleasure, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, going out with friends, you know, working.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The work is good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah the work is good, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's going on with the work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, right now I still do the coaching and the meets are just starting as of now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So is that an exciting season for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a little stressful, but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's stressful about it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just that you have to get the kids ready in time and have them prepared.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And are you tough?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm tough.  I have moments when I can, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you yell at them?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, when I need to, not like scream, but yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do you have a good group?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I have a good group.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's very gratifying for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When things go well, I imagine it's very gratifying.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, when they do well, if they don't, that is when the stress comes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, and when it doesn't go well do you think it's your fault of do you -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes I think it's my fault cause it's my job to get the kids prepared, you know, but other than that, like you know</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is there kind of a social scene that follows it like hang out with the other coaches?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I go out with the other coaches and co workers and sometimes the parents and after the meets or something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are some parents very involved?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sometimes. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Over involved?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, sometimes.  Sometimes we tell parents to like calm down and stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So they are like giving you coaching advice [INAUDIBLE] coaching.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not necessarily coaching advice, but [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do they sometimes say that you are too tough on the kids?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They don't?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Sometimes I get some of them [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That you should toughen up. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's good.  I mean -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you losing weight?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Since the last time I saw you, I have gained 5 pounds, but when I first got on Effexor, I lost twenty.  So, I pretty much since I started Effexor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How did you lose 20 pounds?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have no clue. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you exercising a lot?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was exercising, but the Effexor pretty much, just that one Effexor that's when I started.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think it was the depression.  I think your depression came with overeating and craving carbohydrates and that kind of stuff and when that tamed down [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I lost probably around June or July when I started getting [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is your self esteem okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you able to concentrate okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope, none.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're satisfied with how you're doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel so much better and when I had episodes and I used to get the episodes and [INAUDIBLE] episodes and the depression that I have gotten through some of them and I haven't had any episodes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you feel your brain going there and then kind of -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, like yeah, like a normal person.  I feel normal.  Usually like, you know, the other day I told my sister, my other sister where I lived with somebody, I'm like, "No, this would usually give me the anxieties and that, and like -"</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're immune.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm like no, nothings wrong.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Cause you're right, that's normal.  You might still get nervous a little bit.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I still get nervous a little bit, but it's nothing like I used to.  I don't get sick any more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't make yourself crazy.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What's going on between you and your mom these days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Things are good.  I actually went out to see her in Florida in August and that is one of the moments when I usually get the anxiety and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, cause she has her way, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's doing better financially and everything's good and so that helps with you know, everything as well.  But yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's not as tough on you or you're just not -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's not, well, it's both.  It's like she has not been begging for money more, she's been better since she is doing better financially cause I am a little tougher and able to stand up more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and the family your sister and now everyone else is up here, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, I have one more sister in Florida with my niece and my nephew.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] or [NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], yeah, [NAME OTHER] is the one that usually comes with me.  She's [INAUDIBLE], yeah, and then my other sister [NAME OTHER], which we are moving actually to New York.  [INAUDIBLE] area. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You are?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My sister, the one I live with [NAME OTHER] and I we are moving there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, usually due to her business which is midway between me and her anyway, so um -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And where do you work, where's your -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I work in [INAUDIBLE].  So, I'm slowly rejoining my half an hours work because it gets her closer because she works in Middletown and moving, like [INAUDIBLE] moving and we've looked for townhouses and that.  She's the one that had the anxiety and nerves and I was like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You managed it fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I was actually pretty good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you live with [NAME OTHER] and who does [NAME OTHER] live with?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] lives with her boyfriend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And [NAME OTHER]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] lives in [INAUDIBLE] with my niece and my nephew.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> She's a front line for your mom, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and socially, any dating?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've gone out more, you know, more dates and stuff like that.  I'm just so happy [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How do you meet people, like internet?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do a bunch of things dance with friends, um, you know, sometimes, I try the internet sometimes, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that less of a challenge for you now that you are feeling better.  I mean is it, you feel more comfortable on dates.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I used to get more anxiety.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Engaging in talking and you know, [INAUDIBLE] that stuff.  Okay, fine, do you have any side effects at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nope. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's like you [INAUDIBLE].  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I seem pretty happy on it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you are not going to harp on me to stop?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you're out of the acute phase of whatever you have, but I think we can probably agree that if we pulled it away you'd fall back into that state.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would even suggest stay on it for a long time.  I mean that would be, it just doesn't hurt you.  It's nothing bad, you just function so much better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can live your life in a nice world.  Do you need prescriptions?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yes, because I was supposed to see you in August, but that's when I was in Florida, I have only [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's not a problem.  I mean, we can always call it in also.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think that is what we did in August.  [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Do you need Ambien too?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Since I got a new prescription at the end of August.  I really [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't, I mean, that one they don't like for us to call in as much, but even so, if you don't use them, if you use them once a week the 30 you got would -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think I did refills on that too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, usually you do.  I think this time you didn't since I had, since I was kind of pushed back to see you in a month.  I think I got it August -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, this is August 13th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that is when I called it in.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, a refill request and we gave an Effexor 60.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And Ambien.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Plus 2 refills on that. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, the Effexor.  Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me write 1.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.  Yeah, because I'm almost out of that 1 and the Ambien I -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Ambien is 2 refills also.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Yeah, which I still have a lot of. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well might as well get the refill so it doesn't -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've weaned off of that actually. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  So this was a month ago.  Did you get the 1 refill yet or not?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm going to get a refill probably this week because I only have like 4 or 5 left, which is, I take 2 a day anyway, so I'll be done in -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Fine, but there is another refill after that.  And then your prescription after that so that would be till November, so you see what they do.  They fax these things to us and so then we just uh, you know put the numbers in and sign it.  So they could just do that when those are ready.  So you don't need to do that now.  Good, so you're uh, I mean, we would do well there's less, there's less to talk about, right?  You're life is now your problem.  I mean, do you see any challenges for yourself that you need help with psychiatrically?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, right now I'm actually -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What about therapy issues?  I mean, are, when I say therapy issues, I mean things that get in the way of you moving forward.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not right now.  You know, anything that used to, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Those things that used to be trouble for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that used to be, right now I'm able to think more.  It was just like if I just thought about something, like for instance, just the change in my life makes me always like anxiety or panic and for instance when I first moved to where I live now I was panicking and was like, "Oh my goodness."</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Panicking before you left or after?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It would happen when I would just start thinking about it.  [INAUDIBLE].  And now when we are thinking about moving in 2 months anyway, I'm like fine, you know like yes I'm a little oh my goodness I am going to be like in New York now and it will be a little farther, but it's not like, it doesn't churn my stomach like it used to be.  And -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And what is Woodbury like?  Woodbury is up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Woodbury is like up like [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that area.  I mean, is there any social stuff up there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so.  It is right by like a big downtown and has like all the comedy and all the outlet stores and stuff like that, yeah.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so it will be like a bit of a different social scene for you there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and in the back of my head I do think about that like oh, it's gonna be different.  I'm gonna be around these people I don't even know.  I'm gonna be like a half an hour from my friends.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it wont be easy to go to the movies or get down there very quickly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Cause I'm getting changes like I'm so used to what I have now and I think about it, but I don't get sick about it or anything like I used to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's a new challenge for you, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you will meet a lot of nice -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It will be better, but yeah, usually [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Over change, a lot of people would.  So, you're much more stable in that way. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I drove into the city by myself today with no problem.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that a new thing for you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've done it before.  I drove down to [INAUDIBLE] and got my car tuned 2 years ago, but other than that, I don't usually like driving just over traffic and this and that, but I got here, it took me a long delay because the bridge, but I got here. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where's your car?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Where I parked like 89 right there.  I don't usually park [INAUDIBLE].  Right across the street, no problem.  [INAUDIBLE] till I get home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, I guess it's a delayed maturation.  You know, you kind of, because you had these mood problems you kept yourself, you know -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like I just hated to do things at home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.  So we are expecting good things from you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Hopefully.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a mood disorder and you know, what we look for are social and occupational function.  That you're not stuck in those things.  What's the progression of your career with the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, pretty much, I can move up to management or manager and then like in the office in like the gym, which I do now, like do stuff and like [INAUDIBLE] if the manger is not there, I always act as a manager, but money wise, I get raise pretty much every January I get a raise and I have done well since I have been there.  I've been there for 5 years and I've already gotten a $7 each year you get a dollar or more raise.  Pretty much like my sister and my mom, I pretty much make the most.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah pretty much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're planning to stay with this company?  You like the work, you like the place.  And then maybe eventually you will take over as manager.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if you manage the [INAUDIBLE] you don't get to coach.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'll still be able to coach because on the team we have like 7 coaches, I'm like the second head coach.  The top 1 is the owner of the gym.  He has been there for years, but he's out with injuries so I am now like actually in charge so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're head coach.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right now, I'm the head 1.  And it's cool cause I'm like running around [INAUDIBLE].  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, their giving you responsibility it means they must trust you because if you mess up it doesn't reflect well on their business so they are trusting their, you know, the integrity of what they've build on you which means that you're doing [INAUDIBLE] in an unpretentious way you must be very good at what you do.  All right, and then socially you have to keep dating.  You are doing fine.  [INAUDIBLE] would be when you get pregnant and what does the medicine do the fetus and that.  [INAUDIBLE].  All right, good.  Let me see you in 3 to 4 months.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm gonna shut this thing.</p>

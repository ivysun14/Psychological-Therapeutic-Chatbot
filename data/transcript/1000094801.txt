<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi it's Josephine</p>

<p>SARAH: Hey, this is Sarah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Sarah, Josephine here.</p>

<p>SARAH: Hey Josephine</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi, Sounds like you are doing pretty good overall.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Yeah, I am doing really well overall. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How did John react to the email?</p>

<p>SARAH: It was really nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did not expect a different reply from him. </p>

<p>SARAH: No, I did not really either but I thought well maybe. It felt like it was what I needed to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think doing it in the e-mail, just like you did it, is exactly the way to do it. If he says that you don't ever have to meet with him again really around that issue. You can have a lawyer communicate with him. </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. So I am just not sure what my next step is. Whether I should just go ahead and hire the lawyer. I am not obsessing about the next step.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>SARAH: I don't know if my next step is to go ahead and hire the lawyer or to tell him that I have already seen a lawyer. I already know what my rights are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He knows that your parents may cover lawyer fees. Does he have parents that would cover lawyer fees?</p>

<p>SARAH: I am guessing they would.</p>

<p>MIHCELLE: Hi, it is Michelle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi Michelle, it is me and Sarah and you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Hey Sarah.</p>

<p>SARAH: Hey Michelle, how are you feeling? </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I feel really good today.</p>

<p>SARAH: I feel really surrendered.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: When he talked about the 50/50, did that scare you?</p>

<p>SARAH: I kind of expected it. I was praying that it was going to be different... that he would say something different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who just came on?</p>

<p>KARA: Kara. Hi. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi Kara. </p>

<p>KARA: Hello.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I loved both Michelle's response to your email, which was more spiritually inclined, and then Ana's which was much less spiritual, but very funny. I loved both of them. Both of the responses. </p>

<p>KARA: And Michelle response to Ana.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, I loved that. (chuckle)</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I think we all feel that way but we don't really want Sarah to know how we feel. (laughter) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I think it is ok to have protective feelings.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: She's trying to be so surrendered and stuff and basically we just want to kill the man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well I know that for me I had to have a friend that would listen to me plot his death. In kind of an exaggerated grippy way and then after I got that energy out then it could pull me back into the now and say, since I have to meet with him and the lawyer, what kind of a woman do I want to be. The answer was always that I want to be a woman I respect. I think sometimes to get to that space; we have to have a little bit of the exaggerated, one-sided version first. </p>

<p>SARAH: It is interesting because I have had trouble getting to that really angry space, but I have been obsessing about so many things. Obsessing about my bed, obsessing about the lawyer stuff. Someone pointed out that that might be that grief and anger energy is getting put into these obsessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. Particularly when, as women, often times, we are not comfortable with a lot of anger. Typically, we were not raised to be comfortable with a lot of anger. It is not uncommon, I think, that women are not quite as comfortable with the anger and upset as men tend to be. You might want to practice. I was really good at it, so I did not have that problem. But I think the majority of women are just raised to not have anger be their first response. </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah, it is really uncomfortable. I did have the thought "Gosh, I hope he dies in Belize." I did have that thought. It is very uncomfortable for me to have that thought. It just feels so wrong, so evil, and so whatever. I judge it. I judge the thought really quickly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you know, you can package it in a kind of exaggerated blaming energy and we all know you don't really wish that he would die then it gives you safe setting to give the exaggerated version that helps you then get more in touch with your deeper feelings. So if you go with that or starts with that it builds to what you really want to say which is "why would somebody I love want to treat me this way." "Why is somebody I love in the past, being so disrespectful of me?" Then we can get into more of what it really is, but sometimes we have to start with the mean version. </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>KARA: Years ago when I was, this had to be ten years ago, I was dealing with a lot of stuff with Judah and just really, really angry. And one day I was sitting at the computer and above the computer and we had this picture of the savior and that setting where he calms the waters and it says "Peace be with you" and I was so angry that I said, "Fuck you, where is my peace, my contentment, where's my whatever". I had stepped out of myself and I was watching myself do this and I was horrified, but yet I was just doing it. I was really angry with God. Shortly after that, I really got in touch with some spirituality and I've never felt closer to God since then. What I realized was that He knew that I had to get that anger out and He was ok with that. I had to get past the anger to get to wherever it was I had to be next. It was really important and God was not mad at me for that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: God is totally ok with anger I think.</p>

<p>KARA: Yeah. Or else he would not have given it to us. I think it is what we do with it. When I was doing my clinical, my therapy stuff, my mentor had a theory that if we could measure the emotions that anger would be the ether of the emotions, not the ether, the helium of the emotions; it was the one that came to the top. Like the grief and the remorse was way down at the pit of the stomach and then whatever was next like guilt and whatever and anger was right at the top.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That is a really, really good analogy. I do think when you think of it as the helium that you have to start with is dispelling that helium or putting that voice to the helium then you can drop into what is really hurting or really upsetting. </p>

<p>KARA: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who else came on?</p>

<p>MARGE: Me. Marge. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi Marge. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Hi Marge. Hi Helen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we are waiting for Joan and Ana. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Is Joan going to be on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that is right. She is on her vacation in Virginia. </p>

<p>MARGE: Is Kara there?</p>

<p>KARA: Yeah, Hi.</p>

<p>MARGE: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So far so good. Sarah I think you are using the group, I am sure that is not as your only tool, but I think you are using the group expertly. You are walking through, you are getting feedback, and you are getting support. I am just really proud of you.</p>

<p>SARAH: Thank you. Can I just say one last thing about the anger thing? One thing I have noticed is when it does comes up for me I turn it really quickly, it turns on myself. Like "How could I end up with this person?" "How did I adore with him?" "What was I thinking?" I turn it really quickly upon myself and away from him. It is more comfortable to be angry with myself than to be angry at him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it is not that those questions are not good questions, because the truth is they are good questions, so that you don't ever have to repeat that, but it is ok to make that a loving question. So you tell the inner family, you know what we are going to figure out how he fit into our pattern so that we never have to repeat that pattern. We are going to figure it out, there is a part that we have and we will figure that out. It does not mean that we did anything wrong or bad. It just means that there is probably an underlying pattern and we are going to figure it out. It does not have to be about "How could you, how could you?" Immediately stop and tell the kids the other version. The compassionate loving version.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. This is how I look at it, at that point in my life whatever it was I made a limiting decision about myself and it was working for me then to keep me safe or loved or whatever, but it is not working for me now. I have to put that tool in my toolbox and I can always go back to it, but there are other tools I can add to it. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Especially when it comes to picking spouses, I would get really specific about the pattern so that you can recognize it if you even start to walk toward it. I knew that the pain that I caused my ex-husband and the pain that he caused me was so so so overwhelming that I knew I never wanted to hurt anybody else that way, and I never wanted to hurt me again that way. I knew I had better get a very clear understanding of what got me there, but I did not want to do it in any kind of punitive way. </p>

<p>SARAH: Not punitive. Thank you. That helps.</p>

<p>MARGE: Did you get to check in about the e-mail exchange? Is that what people are referring to? </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Go on.</p>

<p>KARA: I was just going to say that, I am sure that somebody has pointed out to you, that one of the greatest gifts of anger is it helps you set down boundaries.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good point. Good point. </p>

<p>SARAH: That is something that I have a lacking of in my life.</p>

<p>KARA: Instead of looking at the anger coming up as a problem, you might want to look at it as actual assistance coming from God. You know that you can look the feeling from all aspects but that ultimately it is the presence in your life that is a good one because it is going to help you complete this cycle and move onto something that is much truer for you in your life. </p>

<p>SARAH: Thank you.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: You really are. I am not a lawyer, my understanding is that inheritance, Sarah, he cannot touch it. </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. I think the law is on my side.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: He can do whatever he wants but he can say whatever he wants. In the past all he has had to do is declare what he wants and you have usually acquiesced. Maybe that was the motivation that he thought maybe he could just say, "I want half of it" and you would say "Ok" and it would be done. You know what I am saying?</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There may be a chance that he will compromise when he sees the light or what the reality of what the lawyer says.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>KARA: Now Sarah, did your lawyer, the attorney that you spoke to, did he say that you would have to split that inheritance? </p>

<p>SARAH: She said basically that the law is in my favor in terms of getting it, however, a judge may rule, first it would cost us a ton of money to litigate but that is the case always with lawyers, and a judge may or may not rule in my favor even to spite what the law says. </p>

<p>KARA: Get another attorney.</p>

<p>SARAH: I talked to a few. I really liked her. I think she sees the truth. I think she really said you can chose to litigate. I can choose to make that choice and I may or may not win the case. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: No. I would just pick someone who would be eager to fight for me. </p>

<p>SARAH: I have a good feeling that she was. She was very matter of fact about what the realities were. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is probably good.</p>

<p>SARAH: She did say that there about five lawyers in San Francisco, and if he hires one of them it will be very costly. It depends on who he hires. How it unfolds to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I had asked if John had parents, because John does not really have any resources right? </p>

<p>SARAH: His family is way wealthier than my family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: His family has resources?</p>

<p>SARAH: Yes, his family. I think if push comes to shove, his stepfather would give him money. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>SARAH: If he needed it, his stepfather would help him out. </p>

<p>KARA: Does he have a job?</p>

<p>SARAH: He is working as this Kabbalah teacher. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: What is a Kabbalah?</p>

<p>SARAH: It is like religion and spirituality.</p>

<p>KARA: So he does not make a lot of money at that.</p>

<p>SARAH: He has not been taking a lot of money from the joint account so he is supporting himself, but I don't know how much money he makes from it.</p>

<p>KARA: Talk about finding a job with your hobby. (laughter)</p>

<p>MARGE: I was just going to say does it pay with benefits.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, he has a lot of fringe benefits. (laughter) </p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. Yeah. It makes me pretty angry. Given our sex life, the fact that he is selling himself as a spirituality coach is just kind of goofy. Just a tad bit of anger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is good. We just heard you connect with a little bit of anger. </p>

<p>SARAH: He uses the 12 steps in his teaching so it looks so spiritual and uuh. Yeah, I am getting some anger out. Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Good. </p>

<p>KARA: It is called scripture mingled with the philosophies of men. </p>

<p>SARAH: There is some truth in there but I don't know.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Is he likely to ask his stepfather for money to spend on an attorney or in place of fighting for that money? </p>

<p>MARGE: Would he like to fight for the money? Would he like me to ask his stepfather for an attorney? Was that the question?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. You said his family is much wealthier than yours but does that mean he would say "I need money for an attorney or I need money to live."</p>

<p>SARAH: I don't think he would ask his stepfather for money to live, but he might ask him for attorney fees. I don't know. I don't really know. I have wondered about talking to his stepfather in terms of talking some sense into John because he was our broker. The reason that money was commingled was because of him. I have been thinking that over, whether it is a good idea to call his stepfather to discuss our current situation.</p>

<p>KARA: That would be a really valuable piece of information to give to your attorney, I think.</p>

<p>SARAH: Yeah. The attorney knows.</p>

<p>HELEN: Hi guys, it is Helen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>HELEN: I am in so much emotional pain. I am going to have to get off the phone. Ok. I have to go. Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you sure? Michelle, do you have any sense of what is happening? </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I spoke to her briefly. I thinking maybe I am going to call her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you call her?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I spoke to her briefly today and she sounded ok. She called me and I was on my way back from a taping and she had gotten her tests results yesterday, and then went right to work, and then got up early this morning, and she said she was really exhausted, and in a lot of pain. I think I am going to call her now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you would call her and tell her there is not a safer place to be in emotional pain.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah I think so. That kind of surprised me. I am going to call her right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you Michelle. Well hopefully she will come back because the topic is really about our emotional patterns... I am hoping she comes back with us. </p>

<p>SARAH: I think she was going to have a really stressful week too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With the tests and stuff?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah, the way her week was going to go. Maybe it just did not go well. With everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did Ana ever come on? Did anybody get an e-mail from Ana saying she was not going to be with us?</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: No. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: I did not check. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I talked to her briefly this week and I expected her to be here. I talked to her yesterday. Well Kara do you want to check in? </p>

<p>KARA: Yeah. I'll stop if Helen comes on. I have been going through this counseling group training and doing a lot of processing. They have been going over lots of different topics and we have been doing an experiential model and actually processing a lot but it is supposed to be a support group. We are not doing therapy, you know. You know some of the topics we have gone over, like today it was control and yesterday was feelings.  And all this brought up some of this awareness in me, I'm thinking, "I have not really been feeling a lot." Then, "Oh, I am 'the champion' in my family of origin". I am that child that needed to do and my defense mechanism is typically to overdo. Doing stuff that I know really well gives me kudos and I used it over and over... but I guess that is somewhat positive though. </p>

<p>But today's topic was control. I am really controlling of my husband, and I don't like it when my plans change. I have a hard time with flexibility. I am going to Alanon. I know I am a mature adult, and a mature adult is a flexible adult and all of this and that. How comes it is so hard for me? How come it is so difficult to have change? How come I can be so critical and parental towards Gavin? </p>

<p>MICHELLE: It is me Michelle	. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey Michelle. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I called Helen and first is was busy and then it rang and rang and rang and rang and nobody picked up so I called again and it went to her voice mail and I said, "Helen it is me, you need to pick up because I am worried about you." Then I said, "There is no safer place you can be except with us." No answer. Then I said, "If you don't pick up, then I am going to have to come over and see you." But there was no pick up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. You might want to wait. What time is it? Yeah. You might want to wait about ten minutes and then give her another call. She has a right to not want to do it with us. You know.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. That is true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't have a sense that she is unwilling to process stuff. It just maybe not this moment. Anyway, Kara, did they help you with the topic of control? Did they help you solutions?</p>

<p>KARA: No. It was more in the support group because it is not doing therapy with the kids. It was more like tell us about a time when you tried to control, or how have you used these types of different types of controlling mechanisms and then I think they closed the group and not everybody went around and shared about what they are trying to do instead. Something like that. The last part that really shook me up, the last lecture was about children of alcoholics. There was not an experiential group after that actually the day ended like that. Man did that throw me off, because I have a really hard time, I think, accepting the fact that I married an alcoholic. I know I have some shame about it. I have tried to work through some of that. Just seeing the role, she did this thing where it was a like a play. I need somebody to be the alcoholic mom. I need someone to be the dad disconnected from the family, and I need the champion kid. A couple of things came up to me. Oh my gosh, that was me as a child. I don't know if there was active alcoholism. There were periods of heavy drinking from my dad. Sporadic and not frequent but when they were, they were heavy.  However, he was raised by an alcoholic parent and an abusive one. I saw my brother, the scapegoat, and I saw my sister, the one withdrawing, and then I just freaked out and I thought what if this is my family. Am I not the one breaking the cycle of addiction? I just felt this kind of shame. I don't know. It was really hard. </p>

<p>I called my sponsor, and I do realize I am not alone. Those people played that part really good. Everybody who played the little role which does not mean anything for me, but it just made me feel like people have this in their lives, obviously. Just hard. I guess this whole experience has made me see that I have a lot of work to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense, like what I said to Sarah, do you know why the most attractive man to you is the alcoholic? </p>

<p>KARA: Why the most attractive man to me is the alcoholic?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Certainly, you have been with Gavin long enough to know that you can leave. You can go date other people, but he has really been the one that you want to be with. Do you know what makes the alcoholic so attractive to you? That was a really important question for me to answer.</p>

<p>KARA: Yeah. Well I don't know if it is necessarily the alcoholic because that is his disease. I mean him as a person I can tell you some of the things. I don't like the fact that he has this disease. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know with an addiction, it pretty much runs our life and runs our family. You know that. That is what I am saying, not that he is not a great guy in many ways, but when we chose to create a family with him, there has to be some pattern that would be helpful for you to know what need it fills in you to be with somebody who struggles with that. Does that make sense? </p>

<p>KARA: The need to be the care taker or something like that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe... is he somebody that you allows a lot of care taking?</p>

<p>KARA: Yeah, I think so. Probably care taking and probably control... like I can be in control more I think. There are times care taking, and some about being in control.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The second one. The care taking, often times, is when we have that natural gift from God that instead of putting it in our professional life, we put it in our personal life which is pretty unwise. It does not mean that it has to be. If both people are ok with it, it does not have to be too troublesome. The one in control, I would keep, that is why I asked if you had some solutions, because all my solutions would be spiritual. In other words, when somebody has such a high need for control it is usually because they don't really have a God they trust. They either have a God who sends them tests, and stands back and watches, but they don't have a God really that they probably are fully trusting and moving forward with. I know that you are really working on that arena right now. It is not surprising to me that the control aspect came up. God does want us to do footwork. No doubt about it. He wants to set those boundaries, he wants us to communicate and be honest, but there is a difference between that speaking up and the controlling. They can kind of look the same if you are video taping them, in some respects, but internally they are very different. </p>

<p>KARA: I am sorry, the control and what can look like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just doing the footwork. </p>

<p>KARA: Oh, the footwork.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Speaking up for yourself. Taking care of yourself. It is just like if you video tape people at the gym, are they there just taking good care of their body and doing what keeps them strong, or are they there trying to control their weight and control their body. You kind of cannot tell necessarily on the outside; it is kind of an inside thing. </p>

<p>So a lot of the times the behavior is not necessarily super different but the experience inside is very different. I would definitely encourage you to watch every time you catch your control pattern, to just make it a God issue. Where is God? Make it a God issue over and over and over. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: So, Kara did you, maybe I missed a little bit of it, but did you say that you were the care taker and the controller? </p>

<p>KARA: In my family?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: With your relationship with your husband.</p>

<p>KARA: I am just kind of thinking and I am thinking that care taking is probably something natural and I would say in the beginning I definitely felt like I was trying to do a lot of rescuing so beyond care taking. I don't feel like I am rescuing necessarily today and then I just noticed I am controlling. I am controlling of him. I am controlling of my calendar or my schedule. You know. I think that is another form of control, not only people but places and things which I know I don't always have control over that. </p>

<p>It is just something that I know I have and I always have to work on it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want to encourage you to work on it from a spiritual standpoint. There are certainly ways to work on it psychologically. I really think the big solution is the spiritual. If we really trust God, and there is a change in our schedule, it is that God has a new plan. It is creative; it can be fun, wonder why it is happening. We can kind of trust that it is in divine order. We did not do anything wrong we are just kind of going with the flow. God is kind of guiding our life. We make a plan and God kind of puts up road blocks if he wants the plan to go different. When we have anxiety about that, it usually would imply that you want to work on your God concept. I know that you have in the past. Have you gone back and reviewed your God concept? I know that Ana worked a lot on her God concept and then discovered that she emotes like God is one of her parents. I think every now and then that we find, that an aspect has kind of snuck in there that we would really have preferred to not have in there.</p>

<p>KARA: I think sometimes I feel that disconnect from God. Especially if I feel I have made some decisions that maybe were not his will, and I know that the spiritual answer to that is probably that it is all in divine order and that if I was not supposed to make that decision or go that direction, God would have put another road block. So we are just going down that path. I think sometimes that sends me from connecting with God maybe. I don't know. Yeah. I should go over my God concept again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to be the topic that is on the radar screen for you. You know. I hope you don't let the shame do anything but just pass on through the radar screen. It is just like Sarah trying to look at what is the pattern with John. You don't want to use it in any punitive way. I think it is our instinct to be a little punitive with ourselves but it is not productive. I love the quote in the big book; no it is the 12 in 12 where it says, "Almost all of our problems are instincts gong astray." If we look at what the instinct is, to feel confident, or to feel safe, or to feel needed, or to feel important, or to feel appreciated, those are normal human instincts. Those are needs that are very normal. When they go astray, we end up feeling them kind of odd. It does not mean the need is wrong, it means that we probably were feeling, like in my case, my relationship pattern with men was my instinctual need for safety had gone very astray. Once I realized it was safety that made me behave in such disrespectful ways towards men, then I realized safety is a God issue. For a twelve year old, which is when I started making those patterns up, a twelve year old does not have the maturity or the sophistication to even really understand very much spiritually. My little 12 year old self, she did the best she could and she did it trying to meet that need for safety. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Michelle, how are you doing? It seems like you have just been doing really good. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I am. I am doing really well. My best friend got that part. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Steven Spielberg has this reality show coming on. I don't know if it is a summer replacement or when it is coming on but it is like American Idol only for young directors.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: He got two parts from two different directors that were actually for this show. One of them was for a comedy and the other one was serious. It was the serious one that he just did and it turns out that he made the finals and that is why he had to do the second one.</p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. The first one I guess he did not make the final one, the one with the funny one. He did not expect that to but it was fun to do. Then the second one, he had done one prior to it, and I guess what they do is they must submit initially. Then they screen the ones they think have some potential, they bring them on, and then they must give them projects to do and this particular project was you have to use a certain part.</p>

<p>HELEN: Hi, it is Helen. I am sorry guys. I am just really in a bad place. I called because I don't want Michelle to worry or come over. Is she on the line? (crying)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, she's here honey. It is ok if you don't want to cry with us, but we would love you to cry with us if you want to.</p>

<p>HELEN: I had my surgery yesterday again and I don't know whether I had a reaction to anesthesia, but I feel so physically sick the last three hours. I had to leave work and it was a tough call. I even went in to work after my epidural yesterday because I needed the money so bad and now I am so sick. I have got to work at 7:30 in the morning and then I have a job interview in Beverley Hills.  I just feel like I am just so overwhelmed. My back hurts so badly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just want you to have permission that if you had a reaction to the anesthesia that it is ok to cancel some things. </p>

<p>HELEN: I called my doctor and he said "you probably have the flu." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a girlfriend that had surgery a couple of times in her life, and she has a very bad emotional reaction to anesthesia.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I do. Real bad. I have had so many surgeries. Helen you can attest to that. Every single time, when I was calling on the phone, it dawned on me that I become an emotional basket case, and I have learned that because I have had so many that it passes. It takes 48 to 72 hours to get out of your system. </p>

<p>HELEN: But the physical pain. I feel like I have a fever and so much is riding on these job interviews that I have like a twelve hour day tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, if a lot is riding on them, this is not the time to go for the interview. You want to show up with the person that they would be hiring. This is not the person that they would be hiring. You would not give them an appropriate view of you. I think you can either reschedule it or God is just slamming the door on that one because that is not where He wants you.</p>

<p>HELEN: Ok. Ok. I had to go to the dentist today too on top of that. It was like another $400.00 so I keep thinking this is my salvation, getting this job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might be, but it needs to be rescheduled because this is not the person they would be hiring. They need to see who you are and somebody who is having a reaction to a medication is not going to be who you are. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: If it is your salvation, then it is there. It is your job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is already yours. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: It will be there for you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right on.</p>

<p>HELEN: Ok. Guys. I do love you all and I don't want you to worry about me. I would just appreciate some prayers. I am going to go to bed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Alright. Talk to you later. </p>

<p>Bye. Bye. (from group)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am glad she checked back in. </p>

<p>KARA: Yeah, me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was nice of you, Michelle, to take the few minutes to call her because I know how much you love her and we love her. Thanks for doing that. Michelle.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: About the film... Apparently they must submit something and then they screen them and they must give them an assignment. The assignment was use a certain kind of camera and you cannot have a huge crew, you can only spend so much money. What happened was, she got this idea on last Wednesday... somebody she knows died. He died because he was supposed to get an operation and get permission from the VA to get this operation but he put it off because he wanted to walk his sister down the isle but he had a stroke on Tuesday. So what she did was she said, "Ok, I'm going to use this for this contest." She put this thing together from Tuesday, when she found out that he passed away. The casting call went out on Thursday morning. I just on a lark, sent her my reel and she only called about half a dozen of us in there and he got the part. We shot all day Friday and then we shot today and he has the lead. There are only four of them. It is really quite touching but you never know. You never know. It was just so calm. It was absolutely positively calm. It was the most calm I have ever been for anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: My philosophy right now, I used to get so hysterical over everything, and call everybody and their brother, and tell them I was doing something for whoever it was so everybody would get hysterical, and now I really don't tell too many people and I just suit up, show up, and the rest is up to God. I can not control what is going to happen but it was nice to know that two separate directors wanted me for something and that whoever the powers are that be with the Spielberg people are going to see me in two different things. So that is nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is very nice. Very nice. Well you sure have been working on your recovery and in my opinion you have just really been an inspiration. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Thank you very much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can hear that foundation of spirituality behind almost all you are sharing. In addition to you humor, which I love. (laughter)</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Thank you. I feel really good. I really do. I just have so much appreciation for you and for this group and just for the circumstances that I have right now. I heard something on television the other day that really made me think. It was the Oprah Winfrey show and she had three or four people on and it was about people that overcame huge, huge trauma and what was the difference between them and other people. This one woman who lost her two year old and her husband in an airplane crash, she was so bitter for such a long time. Then finally, I don't know what happened, but it dawned on her that if she was angry with God for taking everything away, then what she was doing, she was mocking what He had given her. She was devaluing. It only counts if I still have it. I did not count now that it is gone and I thought about that and I have been so fearful forever about my son and my husband and what happens. I have had a wonderful relationship and a good life and I thought about that, and I don't want to mock Him for what I have. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is so beautiful Michelle. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: It was an inspiration. She wrote a book. I wish I could remember the name of it but I could find out. It just made so much sense to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It makes sense to me. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: It just lifts all that fear and anxiety from me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When my daughter was running the streets and doing drugs and I did not know where she was half the time, I usually slept pretty good. I think that one of the reasons I slept pretty good is because that I said to God, "If I only get her for a short amount of time, I am glad that I had her for this short amount of time, and if you take her home before I am ready for her to be taken home, I am going to trust that that is as it should be. But if you want my opinion, I would like my daughter to live." That was my prayer and I just hung with that same prayer and it worked. I ended up going to sleep on that prayer. Today she has got 18 years clean and sober. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Eighteen years clean and sober.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I don't know, I think you said in an e-mail to somebody. Maybe because I missed last week's conversation but I think it was in the recap. It was about if this person does die and they "go home", how wonderful for them. The loneliness, you will miss them and everything on this terrestrial sort of plane but how wonderful for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Like God says, "All is well." It really is. It is our limiting view that makes it more ominous that it needs to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: So I am in a good place for today. I don't know what tomorrow will bring. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is alright. We have our moments where we have to zip through those more human or personality or human feelings then we can reconnect the human and the spirit.</p>

<p>MIHCELLE: My husband completely organized his office.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that unusual?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: He spent three days throwing out all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Remember we talked about all the piles of stuff. His office looks so nice right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very nice.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. He is real excited about it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I know. Things are good. (laughter) Life is good right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who would have thought, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, Marge, how are you doing?</p>

<p>MARGE: I am tired. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I am sure east coast is late for a mommy of two little ones. </p>

<p>MARGE: I am just experiencing a down swing in my energy in general. I feel that it probably has to do with not different choices around meals maybe I am  sloughing off energy or detoxing. I don't know what it is. I feel like a puppy. I will have very big bursts of energy then I will just want to go lay down. It could also just be spring because the weather has been all over the map and we had our absolute coldest day of the year today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, my god. I have heard that on the news.</p>

<p>MARGE: It is going to be 50 on Saturday. </p>

<p>PARTICIPANT: Welcome to Vermont.</p>

<p>MARGE: I know. Literally, if you don't like the weather just wait a minute. I know that living here I am a lot more sensitive to weather and light and things like that than I previously understood. It is actually one of the things I like so much about living here because it causes me self reflection that I am not super human. You know. I just cannot keep going going going going going . Then one of the other things that I joked a lot about, Connor is potty training right now. It if very rigorous, the state that he is in because he is successful about 80 percent of the time but he is also not and continuing to try to make it a positive experience for him and have all that mess to clean to up. It is much worse than changing a diaper. Having to wash all the stuff. I feel like I am on constant alert. Do you have to go potty? Do you have to go potty? Did you go potty? I was folding laundry yesterday and I came down, and talk about control issues, he just walked over to his little potty and pooped. The boys were in the kitchen and trying to get a little reward for him. I walked in and I said, "What are you guys doing?" Jeffrey said, "Connor did a big long proper poop in the toilet, so I want to get him this but I only want him to have half." Then I noticed that Connor had just walking around in his pants and his underpants and I went wait a minute, "Connor did you use a wipe?" He said "No." My life is just a bit about butts for the last few years. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, For a while it is going to be about butts. </p>

<p>KARA: Those quotes you put on your e-mail are the most precious thing. They are so cute. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am hoping Marge writes a book about the things her kids say. </p>

<p>KARA: Honestly you have too. I hope you saved them because</p>

<p>MARGE: I do. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: They are so wonderful.</p>

<p>MARGE: Guys I got the best feedback today because I guess this is a state law this will make you laugh, when it is less than 20 degrees out the little kids are not allowed to have recess outside. Everybody knew they were going to be indoors, so when they drive up to the pre-school to pick them up instead of them playing in the little yard and they come into the car, you have to go in. So I went in and they were waiting and I just wanted to check with Connor's teacher to see how he had done since it was his first day back at school, using the potty. She told me, then she just stopped mid sentence and said that he only had a meltdown at the end of the day. I think he was really tired; he was frustrated because he could not get his shoes on. Jeffrey heard Connor down the hall and insisted on coming to him; turned to the teacher and said, "I think I can help." "Let me see if I can cheer him up." He went over, took him in his arms. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh my god. </p>

<p>MARGE: He said something to him and tried to make him laugh. He said, "It's ok brother." "It's ok." She looked me eyeball to eyeball and said, "Marge, you guys are doing a really good job with these boys." It is so obvious how much they love each other. </p>

<p>KARA: Yeah Marge. </p>

<p>MARGE: How much they rely on each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MARGE: I was just beaming because that I am not a perfect mother, but the one thing we try to live by is that our governing principle for behavior in our household; that everybody is accountable to is kindness. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Love it. Love it.</p>

<p>MARGE: They have just taken that out into the world. This is such a privilege. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are sure doing a good job. In my opinion. I know that you said, "I am not a perfect mother" but the truth is none of us are. There is not one out there that is perfect. That is not the state of humans. If they learn half of what you are trying to teach, they will be great. </p>

<p>MARGE: They are just such magnificent little beings and I am so grateful that I have just a little bit of a sense of how little I have to do with the path they walk in their life and some ways. It really is about me trying to get out of God's way. You know. Help me be the mother that God needs for them. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the potty training is a very brief period, unlike diapers. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I heard a thing on television the other day, and I am not saying that you need to do this, but I was surprised that it was a whole thing on potty training. Children that wear cloth diapers potty train way faster than children that wear the other ones, because they can feel that stuff in there. </p>

<p>MARGE: It does not wet. That is why I put them, basically, in underpants. </p>

<p>KARA: Oh, good for you.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah. I found out at school he has been initiating going to the bathroom by himself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very nice.</p>

<p>MARGE: We just ritualized it at home at morning and at night and stuff. Give him lots of praise for doing it and now he is got it. He has got it down. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Well Marge, you know Meredith, my sister in law.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That is my husband's sister. You knew that didn't you? </p>

<p>MARGE: Wait, Meredith?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Meredith Cantor. </p>

<p>MARGE: I just met her</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Huh. You know Meredith. I think she gave you for a reading. Anyway, she told me the best piece of advice she ever gave me, she said, "Unless you send them to the first grade with a diaper and milk in a bottle in their lunchbox, don't worry about it." (laughter) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is so great. That is so great. Just like relax and enjoy.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like not only are you doing good in the parenting, it sounds like things are going good with the abstinence as well. </p>

<p>MARGE: It is the absolute key, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MARGE: I have not in the last ten days, two weeks, six weeks, since all these changes have really been crashing big waves into my life, I have never felt better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is so great.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah so</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did somebody get knocked off or on?</p>

<p>SARAH: It is Sarah. My calling card ran out so I had to recall back on my cell phone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, ok.</p>

<p>ANA: Also, this is Ana. I came on. I had to keep getting off because my daughter was having a hard time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Were you on when Helen came on with us? </p>

<p>ANA: I was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Good. Good. I was just going to catch you up because I am going to hope that we can all get her an e-mail sent and lots of love and keep her in our prayers. </p>

<p>ANA: How old is Jenny? Ana. Six?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>ANA: No, she is going to be four.</p>

<p>MARGE: Oh, she is only four.</p>

<p>KARA: When in April?</p>

<p>ANA: April 7th. </p>

<p>MARGE: Oh my gosh. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Oh, she is only three.</p>

<p>ANA: Yeah, she is three. </p>

<p>MARGE: Connor's birthday is June 15th. </p>

<p>ANA: Really, how old is Connor going to be?</p>

<p>MARGE: He is going to be three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old is Jeffrey?</p>

<p>MARGE: Jeffrey is four and a half. He is going to be four in May. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Four in May. Ok.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: They are real little. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are.</p>

<p>ANA: They are still in single digits. </p>

<p>MARGE: I know. We are going to kindergarten orientation and registration in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When?</p>

<p>MARGE: March 3rd or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In general are you real pleased, Marge, with the Vermont school district?</p>

<p>MARGE: Absolutely. That is one of the reasons why we moved here.</p>

<p>MARGE: It is funny too, Michelle, when I hear people complaining about it. I talk to my girlfriends back in California, whose girlfriends are in kindergarten classes with 33 other children.</p>

<p>ANA: Uhh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Not Great.</p>

<p>MARGE: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So Ana, do you want to go ahead and check in a little bit more? How are you doing?  </p>

<p>ANA: I am doing well. I was talking to you yesterday, Josephine, about my obsession with Jenny's schooling and where was she going to go this summer. Well, while you and I were on the phone, somebody tried to click in and I when I got off the phone and I checked the message it was from a school down in Highland. They had not called me back so I thought, ok, they don't have any openings. In fact they have a summer program all summer and an opening and Jenny's best friend from Highland is going there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, Good.</p>

<p>MARGE: So you have her taken care of now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You got into the surrender and everything changed. </p>

<p>ANA: Right, yeah. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Ana it is a done deal? </p>

<p>ANA: It is a done deal, yeah.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: That is great. </p>

<p>SARAH: So do you have to drive very far to take her there? </p>

<p>ANA: Once we move down to Highland. Right now we are five hours away. </p>

<p>MARGE: Oh, you are moving to Highland?</p>

<p>ANA: Again just for the summer; part of spring and for the summer.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: How come? </p>

<p>ANA: Jesse got hired again by the Summer festival and he has to stay through early May but we will come back in September to come back to school up here. </p>

<p>MARGE: So you are in San Francisco now? </p>

<p>ANA: We are in Washington.</p>

<p>MARGE: Washington, I think you told me that.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: So Highlands is in California?</p>

<p>ANA: Yes.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Oh. Maybe I will come up for the Summer festival.</p>

<p>ANA: Oh my gosh, you should. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Highland is a really magical town. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: We have these three day weekend things that we have to use up by the end of the year and I think it might include something up in that area.</p>

<p>ANA: Oh, it is a beautiful place. It is growing unfortunately. Unfortunately, because they are doing a lot of in fill, so everywhere where you used to see these gorgeous pastures now you will see townhouses.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: Oh I see.</p>

<p>ANA: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you on when Michelle was talking about her acting roles she got this week? </p>

<p>ANA: I was on and off during that time and I wanted to be on because that is so interesting. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I just feel really pleased that two different directors wanted me for two different things and that the powers that be in the Spielberg thing are going to see me. I don't know if Spielberg himself will see me. I think he is probably just a figure head for the show. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would imagine anything that has got his name; I will bet he is going to see. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If God wants him to see it, it is a done deal.</p>

<p>MARGE: Yeah. Ain't that the truth?</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I just feel good about the work that I did in both projects.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Especially this last one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That I hope that one makes it because that one sounds very touching and I am hoping if we get to see it on TV that that would be one that we get to see. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Yeah. They only have a week to do this whole thing, edit it and everything. I am amazed what this girl got done and she has a full time job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>MICHELLE: I am just absolutely blown away but the amount of work that she and the cinematographer did in short amount of time. Basically an actor just shows up and don't knock anything over but they have to do all the work. [1:02:02.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep us posted on that so if there is a chance. </p>

<p>MICHELLE: Sure, if that thing gets on TV man, you will know it. (laughter)</p>

<p>SARAH: Thank you guys. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be sure and maybe check in with Helen. Alright, lots of love everybody. Bye. </p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Long day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I went out with some people from work yesterday. Mondays. And I'm exhausted today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What were we talking about last week? What I wanted to accomplish in therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how we ended the session last week, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm feeling frustrated about the whole ... talking about Tony all the time when I can't change him. I was thinking about what it was that ... my goals were coming here and one of them was obviously to figure out why I was so upset and I think that we touched on a lot of the issues that are upsetting me with my relationship but I mentioned that I want to quit smoking. I have this ... you know, my ... still my trouble sleeping came back and it was good for like a month and now I will be tired but just to (ph) fall asleep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So for about a month that stopped? You were able to sleep without difficulty?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would just be really tired and fall asleep, you know, but now I'll be really tired and not fall asleep. I want to ... I have this tendency when I get together, like I noticed last night, to just ... I think I'm way too OPEN with what I talk about with other people, you know? Like I was talking about my unhappiness with my salary, but nicely, with my co-workers, but then I couldn't drop the subject. [I have no idea] (ph). I do that a lot or you know we'll go out and Tony will say, "Well why did you bring that up?" and I have no idea. It's just whatever's on my mind. Not really ... I should be more, probably ... but when I'm hanging out with people, it just doesn't ... you know, I'm just talking and then later I'm like, ["Oh, why did I say that?"] (ph) [0:02:01]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say what it is about what you talk about that concerns you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't think it's one thing in particular, I would just be talking and then I just won't ... you know, these are people I work with, like, I don't know. Last night, I just wouldn't drop the subject about the salary thing, which I think my point was made and I don't think anybody was upset and I realize that I should probably not be talking about it. Where last week, I was out with a bunch of younger people from work that are more my age and they were talking about sex, whatever, and I was talking and I was like, "Why am I even disclosing anything that has to do with my own life with people from work?" because their conversations weren't that personal. I didn't say anything I regret, but I stopped myself in the middle of a sentence, I'm like, "Maybe I shouldn't be talking about this." And I wanted to ... maybe I should have written down something about ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay. Take your time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that whole issue that I feel like my sense of time is work (ph), like I'm just running out of time to do all the things that I want, even though I'm so young. I don't know why I do that. I'm getting better about being a hypochon .... I'm like a ... I always think something's wrong with me, but I don't ... I'm not one of those people that goes to the doctor. I'm just convinced something's wrong, but ... you know, I see my doctor, I don't run to her all the time, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that connected to the feeling that you don't have much time? There's something physically wrong with you or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. Yeah, I mean ... maybe I just have no concept of how ... you know, I'm working with sick people, my sister passed away when he was young and it just ... when he passed away, it just felt like I should do everything I want to do right away. It doesn't always make sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have a sense of urgency because of how young she died.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that also contributes to my ... with work, you know, my colleague was saying, "You have so much potential and people here really realize that," and I know that, but I don't know what I expect to be ... like, in management tomorrow? But I can't, you know ...[0:04:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have expectations for yourself that you feel like haven't matched (ph) yet or you have unrealistic expectations of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe. And what I need to accomplish in the time ... you know, timeframe. Like when we were talking about (inaudible at 0:04:36) talking about starting a family and I was like, "I have to do it NOW," and part of me was like, "Well, why do you have to do it now? There are other things that you want." And I can't get the idea out of my mind that either I won't be able to have kids or I need to have them right away and that feeling I was having which I've ... now that I'm not on the Pill, I've been kind of like, "Well we'll see what happens," you know, "Whatever happens will happen." I don't know. This house. Finally construction is starting next month. So that's exciting. I'm sure there are other things I can't think of right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how are you feeling about being in session and talking about the stuff you've been talking ... how are you feeling about how things are going here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it ... I mean I feel good. When I came in, I was feeling really hopeless about my relationship and feeling like I was doing everything wrong and here I think we've been able to identify what are the causes of the things that are making me upset. Maybe not necessarily as much what role I play in it, but at least targeting the incidences and why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling instead of just feeling like nothing's working, I can say, "Well I feel upset because these things are happening." And it kind of helps me put a handle on it. I think I've seen myself become a little bit more assertive with him and stop ... you know, if he says something to me, stop overreacting and assuming ... like if he says something to me and it's very curt, I wouldn't (ph) generally start arguing back and been a little bit better about sitting back and thinking about how I'm feeling and expressing how I'm feeling. At least I can say what's on my mind. [0:06:38]</p>

<p>I'm still not ... like sometimes when he puts me on the spot, I will just ... like if I don't know the answer, like "Did I do something?" I will say, "Well, I did whatever" and he'll say, "Well you're lying," and I'll say, "Well, actually I probably am because I have no idea. I think I did, but I don't know." And I feel like I have to have an answer. I wish I wouldn't just come up with things, you know. He's like, "You can just say you don't know." And I was like, "Well I can't just say 'I don't know.'" I'm compelled like I have to say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would happen if you said you don't know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he's telling me that it's okay with him if I'm just saying, "I don't know," or "No, I didn't do this." Most of the time, I think he would be frustrated that I didn't ... what was it ... I had to get a credit card from Lowe's because [we're going to get some of our] (ph) things on there, you know, the no finance charges whatever. I didn't do it, and he asked me and I was like, "Well, I was going to do it but blah-blah-blah-blah." And he's like, "You could have just said you didn't do it and left it at that." He was like, "I don't need a whole story about why it wasn't done."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you talk about this, do you have any sense of what it is for you, like what is it that happens for you that you feel kind of this need to say, "Yes I did do it" even though you haven't done it? [0:08:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't but I do that at work too. If my boss says, "Well what about this?" and I'll come up with an answer and generally (inaudible) while I'm talking, I'll remember what's going on, but I don't think I need to do that and I don't know why ... it's almost like being like panicked, you know, like, whatever. I say it and then I'm like ... [well at least I'm making like] (ph) that's kind of tough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it sounds like something happens for you. I'm wondering if you're aware of what it is that you maybe say to yourself or think to yourself about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think that somebody expects me to have (inaudible) something would be disappointed if I didn't have it or ... I don't know, I feel like maybe they'll be disappointed or upset that I haven't done it. I don't like people to point out anything negative about me. I told you, like, a client's daughter had called and running around trying to explain what happened and one of those professors like, "Really, it's (inaudible at 0:09:10) of a deal." Well for me, it was a big deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if you're being criticized or having a person be disappointed in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I've never really thought about WHY I feel the need to do that because it just instantly ... just open mouth and say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As if you're kind of defending yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) I'm not good at it so ... that's why I think I was like, "What? It doesn't make any sense." I'm like, "Oh. You're right. It doesn't make any sense."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're not good at it that you're not that convincing when you try to say ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm not a good bullshitter at all, you know, like I sat down with one of my client's families and I was really happy about the answers, blah-blah-blah, and she started crying because she was so upset and I was ... felt like I didn't DO something, and I was like, "Well ..." just made a joke like, "Well other people are asking for stuff, I just had a question for you about, you know, paint, because your apartment looks so nice" but I'm sure there were many things I could have said than THAT, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you felt uncomfortable in the moment and you wanted to ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have a break.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... make things feel a little better maybe? [0:10:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like if I'm writing ... if I write a letter to somebody, I can write it really well because I'm focused on it. But I'm not a good talker. Like sometimes I say things, I'm like I know my point is being made, but I'm sure there's better ways to explain what I'm saying. Maybe I wish I were more eloquent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I get this feeling that you're kind of hypercritical of yourself and there's part of you that isn't pleased with how you are when you're with other people. Like with your writing, the person's not in front of you and you can kind of say things in a more acceptable way for how you'd like to be. But it sounds like when you're in front of a person, you don't come off the way you'd like to come off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I think that's pretty accurate] (ph). I don't think I feel that way ALL the time. I think more of the times I notice that is when I'm on the spot, you know, like I was explaining to my client's family why she was speaking (ph) the way she was and I had done a really good job of figuring out why she was ... maybe I was a little intimidated by them too. She has this amazing vocabulary. I didn't understand half of what she says when she's talking to me, so may that's ... I mean, she's very nice and I'm sure she doesn't care, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something for you that happens that makes you kind of feel that you're not at the same level as the person or that they might be not as impressed with how you're dealing with it or ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean I doubt that she wouldn't be impressed; I mean they're very nice. Yeah, like if I'm having a meeting with my supervisor, then I'm talking about my cases and I feel like I talk really fast. And I'm not ... you know, we had talked about how I jump around areas, so I'm not making continuous flow, which probably my supervisor has ... supervising like 100 cases she's equally exhaust ... anyway, I'm sure I'm not making it much easier for her. She's never said, "I'm not ... I can't understand you." [0:12:28]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I'd like to share something just in my experience of you in here with me is sometimes I do have the sense that you're kind of speeding through ... I'm not sure if it's because ... that's my experience of you, that sometimes you go really quickly when you're talking and I'm wondering if you're aware of that when it's happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes, like I'm aware that I do it with my supervisor because my mind is racing on all these different things and I'll remember a fact that had to do with something ... a point I made before and ... I don't know. There's not a rush. I don't know why I do that to myself. It's not like there's a time limit, she can only see me for 20 minutes and I have to go through everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you aware of what that's about when it feels kind of ... need to kind of go quickly and?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think in that sense, because I'm reporting TO her about my cases, that maybe it goes back to that ... when we were talking about how I feel when I'm put on the spot. Well she's not putting me on the spot and evaluating me to find flaws, she might just be asking me, "How's it going?" and I feel like I have to say, "These are all the things I'm doing on the case" which I probably DON'T have to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about here with me when you're talking about stuff that's on your mind? Do you feel like you're being put on the spot or feeling pressure to say a lot? [0:14:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, it's happened a few times. My problem here is that I get so unfocused. It's hard for me to concentrate on any one ... I don't know why that is here, but, you know, we'll bring up stuff and maybe I've been thinking about it before and then I'll come here and I can't think straight at all, you know? That's why when we talk about a certain topic, I don't know, I just get hazy and my mind is wandering and I want to talk about what you're saying. I think those times when I'm ... maybe I'm more upset ... that's when I get a little bit more focused on the point I'm making.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you come in and there's nothing really pressing on your mind, you feel kind of not really focused and you're ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was saying, maybe I should drink coffee before I come in here ... be like ... you know, because I'm seeing you at the end of one of my busiest days, I don't know if that's why I feel that way, you know, I don't think I feel that way all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And can you say a little more about this kind of need to be like ... sounds like you want to be really alert, really quick, really able to kind of concentrate, focus.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much alert, I mean I think I'm alert. Not necessarily that I want to be quick, but I find it more ... I just feel like a little cloudy when I get in here that I know that there's things I want to talk about and have trouble focusing but not that I don't WANT to focus, like I want ... that's why I'm here, and I have no problem doing that and I feel comfortable with you. I don't feel like you are attacking me or ... I feel like you are genuinely interested in knowing what's going on with me to help me find the root of what is causing whatever it is we're talking about. But I don't know why I can't seem to focus. Last week I was okay, I remember not feeling as distracted. [0:16:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are times when you've been ... you don't feel as unfocused and you're able to talk about whatever you need to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Today I was upset with myself that I'm so tired because I knew it would affect us here. It was affecting me all day with my clients, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I am very much okay with you feeling tired and feeling like not really energetic at this point in your day. You put in a full day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe too I just wish I could be ... more because there are things ... I mean, I kept telling myself all week, I'm like, "You should write down what it is that you want to work on because something will happen and you will probably not remember all those things," and all day today I just didn't have time to even sit down and concentrate on it so that I could write down everything. [I'm trying to think] (ph) brought up I think the main points, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling pressured right now to come up with stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think that the things I gave you were the most pressing things; I mean I'm sure maybe there's something else, but if anything it would be internal pressure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I imagine with what you've talked about today so far that, you know, this is a kind of not a very comfortable exchange to have - you know, me asking you right now in the moment, "How are you feeling? What is this like for you?" This may be kind of uncomfortable for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm too tired for it to be uncomfortable for me, you know. I was thinking maybe I should be on one of those medications - like Ritalin - that helps people concentrate because it's so hard for me to, but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, my experience of you is that you have a lot of stuff that you kind of want to talk about, and that you feel ... to sort of fit in as much as you can in the time that you're here. I don't know if that's what it's about for you or if it's that you just can't focus. [0:18:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's a combination of both. I think that there ARE a lot of things and that I can't just settle down and focus on one and really ... like you and I talked about it, that we'll touch on something and then my mind will go to something else and then I'll talk about that and then I'll wish that I was still talking about the first thing because it was a valid point or maybe we'll move onto a subject and then I'll think, "Oh, well what about this," about something that we've said earlier, but that's how I am in most conversations too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that satisfying for you or is it ... it's not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I have thought about the fact I don't ... like my mom does it too. My mom and I can have a great conversation because we both jump subjects all the time, but most people, it's not, and I can tell for some people they're like, "What?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They get kind of confused with what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm. But not so much that it inhibits my ability to have a conversation with somebody, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is your ... I mean, when you are sitting with your supervisor or you're sitting with your friends and you're talking and you feel kind of this pressure compelled to sort of talk more than you feel like you want to, can you say a little more about what you're experiencing internally? Like, physically, do you notice anything about the experience that's different?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think sometimes I'm fidgety, like I'll move around and I'll [play with] (ph) this and maybe I'll ... here I just play with my fingers a lot, but I'm not nervous, you know. Just thinking about with my supervisor, we'll be sitting there and I just feel rushed, you know, but I have no idea why. And that's the main feeling that I notice. And then my mind is racing and I have all these details about my cases and I'm running through and probably talking a little bit faster, but nothing so absurd that my supervisor has ever said, you know ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're able to function and do what you need to do. [0:20:33]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She might say, "Can we back track?" I mean, people do that to me, like, John does that to me all the time, and I'm like ... no, not John, my other client yesterday, I was like, "Can we go back to the same subject and talk about this just a little bit longer? Then I want to talk to you about this next thing." I probably do that to people too. So I can't say I'm always unfocused (ph). I'm good with my clients. [That's a good] (ph) goal of what I want to accomplish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, that's one of things that I do notice is that you are very critical of yourself. And there are certain things that you expect out of yourself and I'm wondering if it ... just as you said right now, it doesn't happen ALL the time. It happens sometimes. And so that's a really important piece of information to know that it doesn't always happen, and to kind of be aware of when ARE the times that it doesn't happen? What is it that's different about those times for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well can I ask, like, ... you ask me sometimes, "How do you feel when something's happening directly?" Like you asked me when Tony and I get in an argument and I can't think of anything to say, what would be your steps if that was happening? Like if I meet with my supervisor ... well I meet with another supervisor on Friday, and she's going to be taking over half of my cases and I really don't want to be a spazz when I'm meeting with her. Would you recommend that if I notice that, that I ... is there something ... because it's ... I can notice them and then I'm still just ... that just puts me a little bit off ... more off center. [0:22:21]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say a little more about that? What is it that you notice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like if I notice if I'm meeting with my supervisor that I'm all over the place and not focused, I'll notice it, but it doesn't ... then I don't know how to make it better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you'll be aware of the fact that you're racing through what you're saying or moving faster than you'd like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or jumping around all over and that I don't ... would you ... like what should I be looking for when that's happening and how do you think would be a good way to acknowledge that that's happening and ... I don't know what I want you to do, but you know, how ... if you were with me at the time that was happening, what are the type of things that you would ask me to look for so that I know what to look for because I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're aware of some of these things, like when you start jumping around from topic to topic or when you feel like you're talking faster than you'd like to or when a person points out "Let's back track. I've lost you here." So those are ... seem like really clear things for you that when you're in the moment that you're aware of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's ... you know, that I don't ... I can't get my mind to stop doing that, you know? Maybe I should take a deep breath and sit for a minute.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think would work for you if you were in that ... if you imagine yourself in that moment where you're sitting with the supervisor and she wants you to go through your patients with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do I imagine?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what do you imagine your experience would be in that moment? [0:24:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would be ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if you're sitting ... imagine that you're right now in front of your supervisor and she's asking you for the information you're giving ... you're about to tell her this information about your patients.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's even somewhat that I'm trying to access that information that I DON'T have and then I'm talking and it comes to me, then I say it because it came to me even though it doesn't ... it's not necessarily appropriate to the subject we have moved on to because I want her to know of that detail ... something that we were talking about before. So would I just NOT bring it up and maybe I should just have a notebook and write down and say ... in a pause in the conversation I could say, "Can we go back to talk about?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean as you're talking, if something occurs to you that you haven't ... that you've neglected to say about ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm. Instead of throwing it into the conversation and throwing off the flow, maybe I should write it down and then make a note that I want to talk about it but not in the middle of what we're talking about now. Because that's what happens. Even I think when you and I are talking, I'll think of something ... like I just thought of something else that I wanted to work on but I was like, maybe I'll just try to remember it so that I don't forget to tell you before I leave rather than interjecting it into the conversation we're having now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm wondering what would be wrong with just saying, "You know, I just remembered something else I have to work on."</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the middle of this ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing, except that I think it would totally ... I think we would move to that and then we would probably come back to this and then ... and I do it consistently through a conversation. It wouldn't be like we talk for 40 minutes and I remember a few things. We'll talk, while we're talking about this, I'll think about what else I wanted to talk about. Then we'll talk about that and I'll probably think of something else and then we would never get anywhere in the conversation, which is what I do with my supervisor. Luckily, we're going through cases maybe 10, 15 minutes - 10 minutes on each, so we're changing subjects anyway. I don't think it's as apparent. It doesn't throw everything off, but ... [0:26:30]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like here, when you ... when you're not able to focus or stick to one issue or one problem area, that you're not really accomplishing ... you don't feel like you're accomplishing enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I originally thought that way, but you had said to me ... we had both talked about why it's hard for me to focus on [a certain] (ph) area and I'm definitely focused on what we're talking about and WANT to talk about it, but then if I think about something else, I'll change the subject and then ... you know, maybe that we wouldn't actually focus on anything because we would keep changing the subjects. Because I know I've done that for a lot of sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know, for me it's valuable to kind of be aware of what is it that makes this shift happen for you or make you feel like you want to go from this particular topic to another. It doesn't ... see, I don't necessarily see it as a negative. I just see it as a process - that there are all these associations that you probably have as you're talking and that there is a connection between them. It's just that it may not be necessarily apparent in the moment, even in one session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (clears throat) I'm kind of losing my voice. Some other thing is that ... I had talked to you about ... I think at one point, about how much I didn't like being alone. While I'm not scared of the dark, I get really freaked out, like somebody is in my house if ... not ALWAYS when I'm home alone, but like, I shower at night and my husband's already asleep. And I'll be in the shower, and I always have ... like, I HAVE to shut the door and if the door to the bathroom is open, I just get really creeped out and I think somebody's there even though they're not. Or ... my husband always sleeps on the couch; it's like a futon. That's where the TV is and I don't like ANY noise when I sleep. I'm just like the worst sleeper, anyway. No light and no noise. And we have a back bedroom that has like a very small window covered by trees and I sleep in there, but sometimes I just cannot sleep in there because I maybe think I hear something or whatever, then I'll run back into the living room and sleep on the couch. I don't know why I do that. And I've always done that, though. When I was little, I used to sleep in my brother's room when I was scared. I just feel better if somebody's there. I'm interested to know why I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have any ideas?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because I never actually hear anything, you know? I'm just afraid that I will. I've never seen ... I've never been broken into or had anybody in my house that wasn't supposed to be there, but I'm SO afraid that it WOULD happen, you know? I don't know why. I'm better; I mean I used to just not be able to sleep if Tony wasn't home. And I've always had roommates, not necessarily in my room, but in my apartment. I was never really alone and when Tony and I first moved in together, I told my friend, he was like, "[It isn't] (ph) normal to not be able to spend any time alone" because he lives alone, and I was like, "Well (inaudible) I don't HAVE to be, it doesn't ... it's never been an issue." [0:30:21]</p>

<p>Oh and (inaudible) that I told him I want to ... I'll talk about exercising and I want to start this and I want to eat healthy and then I'm so ... cannot motivate myself to do any of those things that I set my mind to. Just ... it's not ... maybe I lose interest, maybe I'm being lazy. I WANT to do that spinning class; just somehow I manage to not have time, which I probably WOULD have time if I MADE it, you know, just like the exercising. I do it on Sundays because I'm rested, but during the week I'm just ... you know, I WANT to, and it's not that it's PAINFUL to exercise, I just don't, and then I get frustrated why I can't set my mind to do that. Maybe that's not that unreal (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes I get the feeling when you're talking about things that you don't like about yourself, things that you're critical of with yourself, that you kind of are hoping that I'm going to help fix you in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) a little bit. Like I was thinking when I was making my list in my head, I'm like, "Well, do I want to know why or do I want to stop?" And I knew that would be something that you would be interested in too because we had talked about the boundaries of where you ... you probably COULD say, "Well, you should do x, y, and z" but you'd rather that we do it together, you know, so do I want to say, "Well WHY do I do this?" or do I want to change this behavior or do ... you know, I want to know WHY because I think it would just ... some of the things that we HAVE worked on, I think if I at least center on what's causing me to do that, then I feel like I have a little bit more control over changing it myself. When I don't know why I behave the way I do or ... then I feel totally helpless. Which I think the working out thing is probably not unusual, it just frustrates me that I can't or I won't, you know? [0:32:38]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is it okay that you're maybe just not feeling like working out at this time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like maybe I'm kind of hoping that you can tell me whether it is something that is me or is something that is normal?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not ... you want me to tell me that you're normal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not feeling normal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, sometimes (inaudible at 0:33:10) issues but I think everybody probably does. I don't think ALL of them are normal, I think some of them are. I just think some things I just wish I could change about me but I don't like making (ph) that I ... that I should change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know, it sounds like a very normal place to be, actually, to really be kind of struggling with things that you don't really like about yourself, things that you want to improve on in yourself. But at the same time, not giving yourself this kind of unhelpful pressure to make you feel like you don't measure up or having a list of all these "shoulds" for yourself so that when you're sitting in front of another person you feel like maybe you're not up to par with them or you feel like you have to have a bigger vocabulary or you feel like you should have done all the things that you needed to do so that when Tony asks you, you say, "Yeah, yeah, I did that." [0:34:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was thinking the way I actually with my mother and Tony's mother, I don't necessarily feel like I have to measure up with them because most of the time they just annoy me, but I probably do the same thing like when Tony's mom asks me something and I know she's a very critical person anyway, I do say ... well the problem is she doesn't let anybody else get a word in edgewise, so I never get to that point where I'm explaining, because (chuckling) she always interrupts me. And with my mom ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess I would talk really quickly if I was in that situation, kind of get your word across and ... but you started to say that when you talk to your mother, your mother-in-law, that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I don't feel like I have to measure up to them, I feel like I have to explain things to my mother-in-law if she doesn't know something. I think I need to tell my mom to stop butting in. She keeps coming with all these facts (ph) of ... the one was, "Your mother-in-law doesn't think you like to cook." So then, I have to try to figure out how I can squeeze into my conversation with my mother-in-law that I really like to cook, you know? Or "Your father-in-law doesn't think that you like to have company," then I have to squeeze in that I would LOVE to have company, it's just my house is ... you know, I think I'm going to tell my mom I don't want to know anymore. Tony never tells me that stuff and I'm glad. I don't want to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's this sort of a constant kind of barrage that you get, not just from yourself, but also from your mother-in-law, your mom, about ways that you can improve on yourself, ways that you're deficient, ways that you may be lacking. And it seems like you're aware of this, that there can be some real criticism that comes your way from them and it sounds like you own a lot of it too, that you don't even necessarily need to hear it. You're pretty good at it yourself. [Is that it?] (ph) [0:36:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I don't know how NOT to internalize it, you know, like Tony ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And do you know what? I don't want you to take from that another criticism. That's something that I really want to be aware of here with you. It seems like that would be a natural thing to do when people whom you love and care about are giving you feedback. The natural thing is to take it in and try to make sense of it. And it sounds like this is what you're trying to do with the information. Because there's probably some kernel of truth in it, but I guess the question is what do you end up doing with that information?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I always wish I were better at that, you know? Some people can just ... things happen and they just let it bounce off, you know? Even like I think what I was getting so upset with John and one of my other clients is that I don't just take it at face value and let it go, that I do ... I do it with the thing that Tony says, even if I don't agree with what he's saying, I'll say, "Well maybe he's right" because ... we have once ... not once, but he ... when we used to go out with that certain couple, he would always say, "Well why do you ... why did you have to say that blah-blah-blah?" And the last time he asked me about something and he's like, "Well it's not a big deal" and didn't make it a big deal for me. Maybe I always remember that when I'm ... especially when I'm with them, I'm very aware of that (inaudible at 0:37:53).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know if that's how you're describing yourself, it sounds like that there are things that you really take to heart when you hear them from people you care about AND from people who are ... people you work with. You're very sensitive to what people's impressions are of you. And that's information for you to kind of take in and try to make sense of, that people's impressions of you, whether they're close to you or not, really have a lot of weight. And so there are things that you're trying to kind of make sense of in terms of who are you, what do you want to be like, who do you want to be like? Are you, as you are, good enough or do you need to improve on who you are? [0:38:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish that ... I think part of me just WANTS me to be who I am and not have to think about ways I have to change, selfishly, so that's why probably when those things are pointed out ... where I mean I think this is the first time in the session that we really concentrated on my personal self-image, because we always talk about my feelings of everything else, and it's not a particular area I'm sure I'd like to talk about. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean not on how you feel about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a little ... there's something uncomfortable about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I would like to be somebody who is very happy with the way that I am and not feel like I really have to change anything. But on the other hand, I always think that there's something that needs to be changed, so ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess there's a question of where is the impetus for the change? If there's something that you internally feel like you want to better yourself in, not because you want to please other people, necessarily, or have them value you more because of it, but just because that's something you want to give yourself, that's a very different kind of thing. And it sounds like one of the things that really pulls you in to all these criticisms or judgments people make is that you want to be liked by them, you want to be approved of. And that's ... I can't think of anything more human to want to have people care about you. But there's also a struggle to be true to yourself. How do you do that? How do you ... yes, you're trying to figure out who you are, how to remain true to yourself, but still take in what other people say about you, take in what information there is. [0:40:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish I didn't care so much about what other people thought, I mean I did well with John; he spent ... was it last weekend? Yeah, he hated my guts all last weekend, and I was like ... maybe it was the weekend before, I don't know ... I was a bitch and he called everybody he knew I told them how (inaudible) I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You talked about it last week, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't dwell on it, you know? I called like I usually do, checked up on him because I knew he needed somebody and didn't ... the first day I was upset. But then the second, third, fourth day ... by the time I saw him again I was fine. And we talked about it and I said, "I'm glad that you told me that you're upset with me" and didn't tell him ... because on that Friday, I was so upset I had confronted him and said, "I know that you are saying things about me, and I'd like you to tell them to me because I trust we have that kind of relationship," which totally backfired because he either didn't remember or didn't want to tell me. He wouldn't say anything and then spent the rest of the weekend telling everyone I yelled at him. And I probably should have not (inaudible) but then over the weekend, I didn't internalize it as much as I think I usually would have. Just let it go. Rather than the first few times it happened when I got really upset and for (ph) what reason. [0:42:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what helped you to kind of stay grounded in it and not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was, you know, after I got off that one phone call with that Mrs. Grey and everybody was like, "Why did you stay on that phone call?" My one co-worker was like, "This is what you do. 'Mrs. Grey, I have to go,'" and hang up and the other one's like, "You didn't get paid for that" and a couple of other people were like, "Well, you didn't have to take that call. These are the reasons that ... these are the things that she did to you, like she hasn't paid her bill in three months and she's not a client anymore and she has put herself in this situation." So with John, I tried to rationalize all the other things that are causing him (ph) to behave that way and not necessarily what I did. I mean, yeah, I feel bad that I confronted him about it and it went awry, I mean, I don't feel so bad about confronting him, I feel bad I didn't drop it when I saw the signs of him getting upset. I had no idea it would last for four days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like there's a port (ph) that you got around ... not putting yourself out as far ... as much as you did was really helpful to you to get that feedback and the reality is when you are upfront with someone and share what your impression is, they may not be pleased with that, and they may misinterpret and they may make more of it than it is or distort it. And it sounds like that's one of the intimidating, kind of scary things about confronting someone that is like this patient.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I probably didn't think it through when I made that decision. I said, "I'm going to ask him if there's anything he has to say to me," but that conversation lasted like 25 minutes and after he said he didn't, then I should have just let it go. But I was glad I did it. I would have regretted not having done it. [0:44:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you were in a place where you really needed to kind of say what you wanted to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for me personally, I needed to say it, otherwise I would have exploded and then by Monday, when I had left it alone, he finally said, "This is why," not why he was upset before that but he at least explained why he was upset all weekend. (inaudible at 0:44:29)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know, one of the things that I wonder about, and this is ... we'll need to end, but just as a question to throw out, is when you're dealing with someone like this patient, and they just make you crazy and you're the sort of person that doesn't like to be mean to be people, you don't want to be hostile towards people, what do you with all those feelings? Where do those feelings go? You must experience them with someone like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're asking me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, just as a question to kind of throw out for you to sort of mull over, but ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, usually I think ...and my supervisor and some of my colleagues who know him are really good about just listening and we just joke about it and vent it off, you know, like I spent two hours with him Monday and when I got back ... well when I left his building, I just stood in the street and took some deep breaths and then I went to the office like kind of edgy, and then I had a cigarette and told my co-worker, "You know, I got that off my chest and now I just want to refocus my energies."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is it okay for you to feel that kind of anger towards him and not feel guilty about it, or did you feel guilty about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I don't feel bad as much anymore as I used to. Now, because I'm not so isolated with my job and I have co-workers who also (inaudible) group and we can hear about other people feel. My supervisor ... I had my review and it was all good, but she said maybe some more clinical experience would help me in a lot of these situations that I'm going through because I don't ... I have an administration gerontology degree and I've worked with seniors when I was an undergrad, but maybe having some more clinical experience would help me explain either the behaviors of my clients or how to ... [be accepting] (ph) to behaviors that are happening instead of just going on however I feel is the best way to deal with whatever's going on. Maybe. [0:46:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well we need to end for today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I do not have my checkbook, I realize when I was coming, and so can you tell me how much I owe you next week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think it's been three weeks, right? I think we're up to ... I think we're up to 120.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It will be 120 next week or is it 120 today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's 120 today. I'll just double check. Yeah, it would be 120 as of today. Actually, let me just see here. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we have how many sessions still (ph)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We are at the - today's the 15th session, so that means we have 15 more sessions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, (inaudible) last week (inaudible) No, I'm not done yet!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought we were at 20?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I thought it finished at 20.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I need some more survey things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I have one for ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For this session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so I will get you some more the next session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I can't make next Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can only do it Wednesday, Thursday or Friday? Preferably Wednesday or Friday? Probably Wednesday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about ... are you not able to do Mondays? [0:48:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can do Mondays but not this time, it would have to be ... I'm taking a client to the doctor and then ... could we make it in the afternoon? Or Wednesday any time during the day, or Friday earlier in the day? Or Thursday earlier in the day? Basically besides Tuesdays and Thursday and Friday evening ... like during the day I'm totally flexible. Maybe you'll see a whole new side of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Unfortunately the only time that I could see you on the Wednesday would be late in the evening, unfortunately.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How late?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 6:00.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me just look at my schedule. I just have this thing on Tuesday night and (inaudible) on Monday night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's not too late for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: 6:00? Yeah, let's ... I mean, it's kind of late, but that will ... maybe I'll go run some of the errands I've been meaning to run.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so why don't we schedule then for the 25th at 6:00 and if I don't hear from you I'll assume that that's fine. Scheduling is very hectic around here so it's hard to have earlier sessions particularly now because I'm on an in-patient unit, which is hard to kind of, have any sessions in the mornings. So, we'll see each other on Wednesday at 7:00.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, and I'll bring a check. (inaudible) bring home all the stuff that's been sitting in my office.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, looks like you have quite a lot to take with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible) home today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've been accumulating some stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I had bought shoes and I had hid them from Tony at the office and then I wore them yesterday but I wore my other boots there and I brought them home and I realized that's stupid because it happened so long ago. It's like a buffer. Bring them to work first and then (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well take care; I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

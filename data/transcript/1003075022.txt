<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so, what's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Say again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't hear you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, same old same old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why am I seeing you this early?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because we had put it, I think 1 more week out —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I'm heading out of town and it worked with your schedule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so that's right.  Um, for spring break, you're heading out of country?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's cool.  Um, you looking forward to it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're getting very excited, so.  We're packed up and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, good to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Next week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, we've —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two weeks, so, I'm finalizing some school work, trying to get things going.  I have a big test today.  I finished up 2 papers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, those are kind of the biggest hurdles.  I have a couple more things I have to get done before we go, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you're seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, yeah, I think it's going okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A couple times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A couple times.  I can't tell.  It's always hard starting with somebody new.  I missed [NAME OTHER], you know, seeing him, like —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't tell if it's going to be helpful or not.  I mean, it's nice to talk to somebody different, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, is she going to be able to help me, suggest things, we don't know how to groove yet.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right now I know as much as anybody, you know, like I can suggest things [INAUDIBLE] so.  So far I don't have anybody, you know, who's going to be able to suggest something that I don't think of and just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well what would you suggest to yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I suggest everything that anybody else does.  I just don't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just don't do it.  Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If it comes from somebody else it's a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of a breath of fresh air, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, I like her a lot, I do.  I just, hopefully it'll —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is she, I mean, does she ask you questions or does she —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she, she does.  I mean, but we're still in that whole, she doesn't know anything about me.  Well, she has a lot of records from you but not —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't know anything.  So, we've kind of backtracking of all the history and how much does she want to know.  I can't tell yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm just, I can't figure out how much history does she want.  Or do we just deal with the current things or so it's a whole bit of a, you know, what do we call that.  I can't afford to come here every week so we're doing it every other week.  Yeah, I just can't afford out of pocket to be here, all the time.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need to kind of spread it up and it certainly, I mean, she seems really nice so I'd like to keep trying a little longer and see what we can come up with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, all right.  So, what I'm hearing is so far, you have some good idea about some of the things you could do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're not doing them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's very hard to engage the things that would probably make me feel better sometimes.  Oh well, you're thinking too much, keeping myself up at night, you know?  Getting up at 2:00 AM, probably need to stop thinking.  You know, I'm not taking care of myself healthy wise.  Well, you got to think about it, you know, you better exercise, or, you know, just basic things that I really don't need anybody to tell me what to do, they're all up to me to do.  So, I'm hoping just talking it out with her will help me step by step, more step by step things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm hoping that she will be able to drive me with a slow down, just why don't you this week do this.  And next week we'll, you know, do this.  You know, because I'm just, I'm getting way ahead of myself and not, I feel like I'm not getting anything done.  Does that make sense?  So many things, I'm not getting anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But she doesn't really need to tell you what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She needs to help you figure out why you're not doing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that mostly.  Because I think you, I mean, not totally —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think you know what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what is it going to take to get, like, what kind of exercise would you be doing if you were exercising?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you know, I am exercising some.  But, you know, I had goals for prior to this trip that I never met.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Such as?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Weight, weight loss and basic comfort, you know, shape and everything.  This trip isn't just [INAUDIBLE].  Work on and just haven't done it.  Just haven't had the desire.  I've been tired, you know, I've had every other excuse and distraction and haven't been able to do it.  And that's a big —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And every other day, or every 3 days, you start something and then you don't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  And so it's been, that kind of thing has gotten back to throwing me.  Instead of just being, "Well, oh crap.  It didn't work out today, it'll work out tomorrow."  It's gotten back to really just bugging me.  Not just, "Ah, okay, you know, do better."  So, yeah, if she can help me —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay so —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With some underlying issues —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, if you don't work out then you're, it's completely a failure and your worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At this point, yes.  At this point, those thoughts do come back.  But this trip is 17 days away —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now.  Sixteen days away.  I've been paying for it for a year now.  Why am I not in the shape I wanted to be?  Not recognized.  It's not that hard.  You know?  I'm not looking to look like Cindy Crawford here.  It's just a couple minor things I wanted to do.  I couldn't do it.  That is a failure to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Such as?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just weight loss, just, just basic, 5 pounds, 10 pounds.  A little more structure, a little more comfortable.  So that I can go and take pictures and be happy with what I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little more comfortable in your clothes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, with me, in my clothes kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mentally comfortable —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not physically.  Physically?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Mentally and physically.  Yeah.  It's things like that.  So that's like, I mean —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, what's the past, what have you done exercise wise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just about every day I've done something.  I've jumped on the bike or done the elliptical or, or walked, walked 3 miles, try to do, um, abdominal [INAUDIBLE] whichever.  My problem is eating, not eating very well.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Such as?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been keeping a notebook of eating.  In quantity.  So I've been keeping a notebook and I'm going to show her next week.  Do you know what?  I cheat myself.  I even cheat in the notebook that I'm trying to keep.  Walk around the house looking at things going, "Man, what can I eat?"  You know?  So, what good is that if I'm sabotaging myself?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes you just have to eat something.  It doesn't matter necessarily what it is.  Is that correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Some things I come up with are just crap.  Scouring looking for something that's unhealthy.  Just cause that apple sitting there looks like crap.  So, this is what I've been dealing with for a —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Month now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's, yes, you can cheat in the notebook but it's not really cheating because you can't, it's like someone, like my wife sets her clock in the car 13 or 17 minutes ahead.  It's like ridiculous.  What's the point of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know it's early.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Seems to work for her.  I don't know.  So, 17 days.  Um, so when you walk 3 miles, where did you walk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other neighborhoods or [INAUDIBLE].  I don't go far but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How do you know it's 3 miles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because 1 loop around our neighborhood is 1 mile.  So either I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long does it take you to walk a mile?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifteen minutes maybe, almost.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifteen minutes or less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I walk fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Damn, so you do walk fast.  [LAUGHING].  Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sad part, that's probably the speed I run.  I walk, I run about as fast as I —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I put on my iPod and I go.  [NAME OTHER] jogs, I, [NAME OTHER] jogs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you walk as fast as —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you know he runs —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no.  As fast as you can, more or less?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I walk as fast as I can so that I'm sore and hot and know that I've done my best.  I was going to hopefully change for 4 miles today, this week.  I didn't do anything yesterday because all I did was study and, and I kept distracting myself from studying and I knew if I got out there that would be another hour or so that I wasn't studying.  So, I didn't do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's the difference if you walk?  You could take a half an hour break but not an hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, would that be more acceptable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I should've, I should've done something exercised but I was in a mood.  [NAME OTHER] was out of town for a couple days so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you walk 2 miles twice?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who walks 2 miles twice?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four miles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah.  Oh, you're saying do a 2 and then taking a break and then do a 2 again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I get all hot and sweaty and then I don't want to get cleaned up.  I don't want to go back out again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was windy and cold yesterday too.  That's another reason I didn't go outside.  I can't stand the cold</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> True.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll figure it out.  It's just these are things that piss me off these days.  These are the things that drive me nuts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, if she can get some underlying something going on.  These are the things she and I have discussed as far as these issues.  But you know what, school is almost done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is March, and this is March, okay?  I've tried, I don't know, same thing.  I'm going to eat less, you know, because I'm, you know, works for a day, right?  Well, something on the 20, Sunday night the [DATE] my oldest and youngest ganged up on me at dinner, the other is away at college, and told me how I needed to, you know, I needed to take care of myself.  Because especially my [AGE] son, my daughter is very, has told me a million times, but, you know, he's like, "I need you in my life and you can't die, you know, because you're going to kill yourself because you just eat and all this."  So, the morning of the [DATE], I took my running, my walking stuff, I hadn't exercised for a while.  And since I fell about 2 months ago on the ice and my knee hurt, I didn't know if I could walk or not.  But I did.  I walked 2 and a half on the track.  I did that for a while and I thought, "What the hell,  I mean, how many times have I started?"  So, I missed a couple days.  I missed, um, no that's the wrong thing.  Well, this is also being on time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is my task and staying on time and I'm feeling a little better.  But, um, this, this is, I didn't do this for February but in, starting in March I started keeping track, um, except for [DATE] when I shoveled snow, I did not walk.  And the [DATE] and [DATE] for some reason I haven't figured out, I don't know why the [DATE] but that was a Thursday and Friday, and the [DATE] which I, I traveled to Florida that day, I walked.  And I walked and I walked and I started walking more.  And as of this morning, I walked 113 miles in March.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, but it's like, yeah, I could not do it.  And some days, like I ate too much for dinner last night, it's like, "What the hell," I had seconds.  Well, I shouldn't have done that but, but, you know, I've lost a significant amount of weight surprisingly.  Um, and it's, you know, it's just sort of like, well, get up.  I have a dog.  I have to walk the dog in the morning so might as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting a dog this summer, something that forces me to be out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, if you, you know, if, I guess the question is, if you lost 2 pounds between now and the time you went, would you be happier than you are now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that won't be enough.  I can lose 2 pounds in a week.  It comes back.  I fluctuate like anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you, it has to be 5 pounds or nothing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It really needs to be 5 pounds because I can do 2 pounds.  I mean 2 pounds can be in a couple days.  The way I fluctuate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Depends on if I had, you know, an extra —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, is —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Am I hearing, so you're only satisfied —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It really just needs to be something significant.  It really does need to be like 5 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's not like, it's only good enough if you can do something that you can't do.  That's not what you're saying, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That you can't do easily?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It needs to be, if this is going to be weight loss, it needs to be where my clothes fit different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, what if you fluctuated, instead of where you are now up and down, you fluctuated 2 pounds less and you fluctuated from there up and down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it would, less is always better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not going to, you know, but the point is there are things that, I mean, I want to look back at pictures and not go, aw great, great.  You know, I want to look back at pictures and be happy and not be focusing on the way I look there.  And I know me, you know?  I, I will look back at pictures going, "Oh, nice."  Looks great.  Look at the arms.  You know, I just want to look at pictures.  So, the only way I could've done that would have been to lose what I wanted.  And I didn't do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's 5 pounds?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Five to ten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Five to ten.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, 2 pounds, sorry, not going to make those pants fit me better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Seventeen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two pounds are going to be put on the first dinner you have when you get there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you're going to be busy, I mean, you're going to be working, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to be on vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but you're going to be —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If you're going to be on vacation, you're always going to be on vacation.  This is a pointless conversation.  This is, this is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even with all the diving and swimming and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, this is —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're still gaining weight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably, yeah.  Unless the food is bad and they don't have a lot of vegetarian options.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well why is this pointless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because this is a pointless argument.  This is what I go through every day, just thinking about this stuff.  And it hasn't got me anywhere yet.  There's no point in doing this now.  It's old, same crap.  The random things I go through in my head.  Just, the weight loss needed to happen months ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it didn't apparently.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, it didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, if it was 5 pounds, then it would've needed to be 10 pounds or if it was 10 pounds it would've needed to be 15.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, really, really.  Ten pounds would've been great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I'm —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, I'm wondering.  How do you know you'll be satisfied?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I know what I was [INAUDIBLE], a few years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what was perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's where I felt good, looked good —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Seventeen days.  What's to stop you from making a chart and walking 3 miles every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing besides weather if I can just get my school work done.  I plan on it if I can get out of here, get out of school, get home and get outside.  I plan on —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, weather is bad —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, I get cold so easily.  Usually I get on the elliptical inside and try to do something but it never feels like I do as much inside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right.  Well, then if the, I mean if the weather is bad then you can walk an extra mile the next day</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Until you make it up.  And then, pick a time after which you're not going to eat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like in the day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, well, in the evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight o'clock, 9:00 —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whenever it is.  You're going to the store and if you like pickles —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes, I found, I love these pickles and sauerkraut.  I swear to God, one of these pickles have 0 calories, it says 0 on it.  And the sauerkraut has 2 calories.  And it's something to eat.  If you have to eat something, it's something to eat.  All right?  And if you, and then the other thing is, actually you can buy these sugar free Werthers, you know, these candies, butterscotch.  I think there's like 30 calories in 5 of them or something, I don't know.  But even the regular ones aren't bad.  That's 20, you know, 18 or 20 calories.  So, if you have to have something, it's better than ice cream.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's my problem.  Usually I just want something sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this thing, if you suck it, it last 10 to 12 minutes.  Not quite a whole loop for me, when I'm running or walking I mean.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying, I'm making, I'm trying.  It's not that I'm sitting down eating Bonbons going, "Why am I fat?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just, I'm frustrated and I feel like this is a deeper thing going on in my head like I can't control something as simple eating and working out, how am I going to control any other emotions?  You know, I feel like this isn't just a, it's just one thing.  There's a little something more to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah it's the hardest one too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's very hard, let me tell you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is, it is.  And [NAME OTHER], and working with [NAME OTHER] and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh—huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you can't make somebody else in charge of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no.  He's doing his own thing and, you know, I watch him and he'll, like, do, you know, he'll lift weights.  We just have a couple of arm weights at home and of course his arms are bulking up, like, because he's done it for two weeks.  I'm like you just suck.  You suck.  He thinks about not eating and he drops weight.  And he lifts weights in his arms for like 3 weeks and he looks like freaking Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It's like, why am I not a man?  They just think about that shit and it works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I could tell you why.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that's, well, you could have had hormone shots and a sex change operation but I doubt it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't think that would work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's ridiculous.  Just to have those changes be easier for females.  I bet they are for some.  But that's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, have you ever lifted weights?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do, I get bored.  Well, I don't have access to a gym and those arm weights.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I try it while I watch TV, I just get bored.  Bored.  It starts hurting, I get bored.  I have arm bands though that I can, like, hook to the door.  I'll do that for a while but then I get bored.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you can't just do that.  I mean —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bored.  I get bored of things very easily.  There's only so much I can —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have an iPod when you walk?  I know you told me that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I better go to class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  You don't need scrips?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Um —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think you guys have recently taken care of faxing things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you have enough.  All right, um, you, here's your suggestions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, but look at me, just, um, get something.  If you're going to say, "No eating after 8," get something so that, there's no eating after 8 but if you have to you can have 1 or 2 of these or a pickle or this or that so you're not eating shit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excuse my language.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, but, because sometimes you have to eat something sweet.  I, you know, I know somebody that had a Hershey's Kiss diet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whatever she did all day, at the end of the day, she could have 1 Hershey's Kiss.  She lost a lot of weight.  But —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know but it's just adding, doing something different and, and I think if you end up, kind of, taking some charge, you know, and obviously some days, as long as it works more days then it doesn't work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a positive.  And, and it's something you can take charge of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.  And it makes sense.  And I mean this —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so I need to just turn this off.</p>

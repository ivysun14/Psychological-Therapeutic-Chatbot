<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hope you're feeling better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I'm worse, but that's OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. That's not OK at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got a lot going on. I'm trying to be stoked (ph) but I'm feeling it. So (coughs) (blows nose) as you hear, I'm getting sick. I've been in a lot of pain and I got some really bad news last night and I'm just sort of trying to figure out what to with it right now. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:48) news is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A friend of mine, his wife died very suddenly last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh god.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know much about what happened, however (pause) basically this was—how do I explain this? But back when the university was almost entirely male, they had a lot of fraternities and therefore they had a lot of women who were sort of honorary members (inaudible at 01:24) and stuff, whatever. And so, this is one of my fraternity brothers and somebody actually—while you're in, you know, involved in, it gets very, very much discouraging to anybody who's a female member because of their beliefs that little sisters (inaudible at 01:43), whatever, gets, you know, one of those bad reputations, et cetera.</p>

<p>But he did date (inaudible at 01:50) after much later somebody else (inaudible at 01:54) in the house. And so, yeah, so there's going to—as soon we figure out what's going on, we're going back to Brooklyn for a very, very big funeral. So, they don't anything what happened and although I wasn't as close to her—the person who died—I was very, very close to Richard and so, it's pretty devastating. [00:02:23] So sort of getting everybody together, possibly, you know—it's just a lot of stuff going on. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you hear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: E-mail that I got, like, I guess you send e-mails at night—I got it at, like, 6:00 am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So, and (pause) so right now all I know is the services will be in Brooklyn. I know the name of the funeral home, not the (inaudible at 02:51), whatever, don't know anything else about it. And it has to be devastating. To my knowledge, she wasn't ill. He did say it was unexpectedly, so (pause) aside from that, that's all I know. So, (inaudible at 03:10) other people from our organization and trying to figure out what's going to go on in terms of a bunch of us getting down there, so. Because there's quite a few people who are in this region, like, a very good friend of mine is nearby. And so probably, we'll rent a car, grab her and see if there's anybody else in the general region that needs to get a ride down there. [00:03:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They currently think she had lived in Brooklyn?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, we all went to school together, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, she grew up in Brooklyn though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause), like I said, it's a lot of process right now, mostly because of the fact that I know that my friend's completely devastated, you know. (Pause) And none of us want to bother him too much to find out what happened, you know. (Sighs) So that's—yeah. So and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She was about your age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About my age, yeah. They're in Texas. So, he's (pause) in the military. [00:04:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's in the military?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's an Officer in the Airforce. (Pause) Like I said, it's just a lot, it's a lot, yeah. Richard (sp?) (inaudible at 04:58) very close, but he originally was an F-14 pilot. He now teaches test pilot school, that kind of thing. Yeah, he's very, very highly placed. He's (pause)—I'm so proud of him. He's done a lot. Not that you'd ever want to do anything to become decorated. He ended up missing during Mike and I's wedding because he was busy earning his Silver Star and the Bronze Star and all this other stuff, like, you know, very, very, like, very much, you know, a war hero. She was a pediatric surgeon and (pause) yeah. So... [00:05:49]</p>

<p>It's just like I've had a lot to process though. (Pause) I know that if the same thing happened to me, I wouldn't be able to cope very well, so (pause) that's pretty much all of us who (pause), you know, have known them or just know ourselves realize that how much that's (pause)—how much it would break us apart to have it happen to us, you know. First of all, it's a really (ph) good man to have this happen to.</p>

<p>I knew her. I don't know her that well—I mean, it sounds weird to say that it's someone, you know, I attended hundred of organizational events with, you know, and over the years I just never got to know her that well. I've never been that close with women, except for a couple. But it's pretty much been all day just texting back and forth with friends. I'm not even a texting person, but all of us are at work or whatever, talking about it. And it's (ph) just been devastated, you know. [00:07:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else have you been doing today, mostly just kind of sitting at home and texting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Texting, sleeping. I have massage therapy, so that could walk. Mostly just being sick and miserable around the house, that kind of thing. I found out about 6:00 am. I had to call a couple of people first things and then I just went back to sleep until not that long ago—maybe noon, just because I've been running a fever and, you know. Yeah, so. But it's just, like I said, a lot to process right now.</p>

<p>Call my mom, that kind of thing. She's been really helping me with what is, you know, the appropriate things to do, that kind of stuff right now, so. Like, trying to find a florist, trying to get people, like, you know, the stuff that (pause) when it's the first time that you've had to deal with a funeral as a grown up, the kind of stuff that you're supposed to know about, that kind of thing, so. [00:08:26]</p>

<p>It's weird, like I said, and my mom, although she doesn't know individually that many people, she knows the story, she, you know, she knows the tradition. She knows the group as a personality in general, so it's (pause)—she was pretty sad about it too, so. But, you know, she pointed out that, you know, it is (pause)—he is the one person of all of us as a group that is actually prepared and has had to deal with lost by his job and therefore, like, if there's anybody who's going to be able to have access to the right resources, it's him, which is true. You know, they've got tremendous resources in terms of grief counseling and things like that. And he's been through it enough and he's been enough of a leader and he's not too (pause) humble to utilize that kind of stuff. So that's just good, which makes me feel good because it's (inaudible at 09:56), you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you'd want to know that he's going to be taken care of as well as possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So his family's in Virginia, so staying in the Mid-Atlantic for a while is probably going to be in the (inaudible at 10:12) for him. For a long time he was stationed at there, so he's got people to take care of him. And the great majority of our social group is still in the area also, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But yeah, like I said, it's a lot to process. I think I'm taking it worse right now probably or at least I'm seeing it through a different veil, because I am right now so sick and I'm (pause) yeah. So, I'm doing a bit better right now, but earlier today and yesterday I was, you know, high fever, that sort of thing. I ended up not going to work, which was sort of, like, I had to make this calculated guess as to whether or not I'd get in trouble, but since this is—what I've been sick with has been jokingly referred to as the Plague. No one would think that I was faking—not that they would anyways—but I was helping out when other people had multiple call-outs before. There's been a lot of call-outs about this so, and I stepped up and took care of things earlier this week when it happened. And it's sort of unfortunately a hazard whenever we have big events because you get exposed to the public.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:44) people, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have a very low immune system, so. So that's, yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there any complications that are more likely to arise for you because of your other health (inaudible at 12:01).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well I have to stop getting the immunosuppressants, obviously. I can't—I'm at the point right now where I take so many analgesics for aches and pains that right now—the biggest thing is this fever. I can't really take anything else for the fever. So, last night when I had a fever over 101, I had to do, like, home remedies for that, which was ridiculous. Last time I had this happen, I, you know, had been sick like this, I had roommates that stuck me out in the snow. Last time I had it, I had already had so many analgesics I couldn't get the temperature down, they put me out in the snow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my god. That can't be good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was like ten minutes of it though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK. [00:12:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, they were very kindly doing this. They were doing this as, you know, (monitored) to try and big down my temperature. This time we did apple cider vinegar, which reeks a lot. And I still don't really think it actually works, but it was on the Internet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you do with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You take a bath in it. It smells really bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It supposedly, you know, it's not really (inaudible at 13:23), but it evaporates off your skin and reduces temperature. Like, I really doubted it was going to happen but, you know what, I wasn't feeling so great and (pause) it's amazing how when you are sick and you're running a temperature that, you know, how much, like, folk remedies on the Internet sound like a really great idea. So, I was sent from one of my fraternity a recipe for what is called Kennedy cough syrup, which is three parts Vodka, one part cranberry juice. (Laughter) Yeah, I don't necessarily certain that that's going to work all that well, but it was a really nice thought. [00:14:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is nice to get reconnected, as terrible as what's going on is though. But yeah, I may need to (pause) go and get see and figure out what to do. They're really hesitant—and I understand completely—just to start giving people antibiotics anymore, because there's so many strains that are very...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Resistant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...resistant. And I agree 100 percent. So (coughs) it's just that complications can happen with me. Like, I can be OK and I can get very sick very quickly, so. And, yeah. And, like, the world has changed in five years. Five years ago, every time I went on vacation, in general, I had around the house I had anti-virals and I had a stock of antibiotics that my doctor had just, like, especially when I traveled. Nobody does that anymore, you know, because of the fact that there are so many resistant things. [00:15:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I see] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that they don't trust me, it's the fact that in theory they're not supposed to do that. They weren't supposed to do it in the first place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Because this could happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, not that this could happen but, like, you could get these—you could start creating these resistant, you know, strains. But (pause) I, like I said, got my self (ph) scheduled for pretty much sleep time for now until Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And you're off of work until then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't have to—I'm really trying not to make any plans if I can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to get better. But now...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably next week is when I'll look (inaudible at 16:05). I don't know yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not in the next few days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't imagine that they can transport a body from Texas to Brooklyn. [00:16:13] And when I called the funeral home, they knew about it but they didn't have, like, any plans at all yet. So I can imagine that it won't be until next week. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 16:24) tired. It'd probably work a bit better for you anyway because you'll have a chance to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Heal and work, which I kind of need to do, so. I'm just sick of being the person who has all this stuff going on, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't (pause) I don't like being that person that, you know, has, like, OK, my car was hit this week. This week (inaudible at 16:49) sick and I've got, like, a funeral and I just don't want to be that person, you know? So (pause) I don't know. I'm adapting poorly to this whole, like, no car thing, you know. I'm trying to but I'm getting there like it's, you know, being in pain and stuff like that it's been very crummy and so, (pause) I'm getting there. But I knew it was going to be an adjustment to being more cranky than usual about it, so. It's not, like, completely no car. I mean, there is (inaudible at 17:34) rent cars for the weekend or whatever, but... [00:17:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but it's kind of no car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of no car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's still no car, yeah. It's, like, in-case-of-emergency car or grocery shopping car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With-some-planning-in-advance car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So, not the same thing as going outside my car and turning open the engine kind of thing, you know, yeah. But slowly but surely, I'm getting adjusted. The thing that mostly I'm also annoyed by is that I sort of, before I got sick, I've been sort of planning on trying to get myself adjusted again to using a bike, especially in the city kind of thing and just getting everything together. And this is sort of putting a cog (ph) in that because, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You don't really feel up to riding around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Taking my dog outside to use the bathroom and coming back, I'm coming back in a cold sweat. So this is not, like, riding around getting my bearings kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Riding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you should be, like, lying in bed eating soup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the plan right after this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Excellent. [00:18:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't want to call off anymore appointments because it, you know. And I needed to be on campus to see a massage therapist anyway so that is a you lose, like, a lot of money—I mean, not [that it] (ph) but you lose a lot of money in general though if you don't cancel 40 hours to 48 hours in advance, so. But I need to be out there anyways and so I'm just going to go across the street to the hotel. I'm not even taking the subway back (inaudible at 19:11), I'm just going to grab a cab and go home, because it's—yeah.</p>

<p>I am unfortunately sort of—what's it called—predisposed to also getting secondary infections when I'm sick, so. Well not that everybody isn't but, like, I can pick up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You especially, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can pick up—like, lost people get like a, you know, if they have a lung infection they can pick up, like, you know, something wrong with their tonsils. I can pick up staph, like, on a cut I can, you know. I can pick up all kinds of random infections that nobody gets, eye infections or whatever. [00:19:47]</p>

<p>So, speaking of that, I actually stood my ground at work about that recently. We had a lot of people who I think I mentioned that for some reason got frustrated while doing their updates. Like, they felt like it should happen faster and just sort of did stupid things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and, like, shut their (inaudible at 20:06) update (inaudible at 20:08).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I ended up having to work a lot of fixing phones then. And there was a lady who had a tremendous case of pink-eye. I went and talked to my boss and she's like, you know, "We really can't technically deny service." And I said, "Yes, I understand that right now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you can't what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Deny service to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh OK, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, yes, but, you know, there was nobody else and I said, "I want you to understand that I want completely, like, if I get pink-eye that I have to, like, I am going to—I want workers comp because I'm being exposed to this kind of stuff." And she totally agreed with me, she was like, "I'll go fill out the forms," you know. Not like it is a mean thing. Like, as in, if we turned her away, we risked a lot of liability issues—technically, we can't do that. [00:20:50] But, you know, at the same time, apparently this came down because I also didn't want to work with somebody who has chickenpox about six months ago—or had a kid with chickenpox. And so we had to do a lot of research about this and, you know, because we're so, like, short-handed, normally when this [kind of] (ph) happens, she'll totally get somebody else in there and she's like, "I will fill out forms and I will make sure that we vouch for you if you come down with pink-eye because of this." But at the same time, I use gloves, I wash my hands, all that kind of stuff. But she was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sucks that there's no policy, there's just that, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. In state to state, apparently there are a denial of service (inaudible at 21:31). Back in Brooklyn...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 21:33)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we would turn people away. Here, apparently, like, because it is considered to be a utility, you can't—because it's a phone—if it was a computer we could do it, but it's because it's a phone it's considered to be a utility, we cannot have a denial of service. Yeah, I know. Can you believe that? So, like, and this all came down before because I actually—we have reason to believe that I might be actually immune to chickenpox, which is amazing in itself, yeah. Because back in—apparently now they immunize people for it. I know, it's amazing. But they won't give it to adults.</p>

<p>But as a kid, whatever somebody had chickenpox in the summer, it was really common to have all the other mothers have the kids get exposed so you could get it done in the summer when you're young and all that. I have been exposed many, many times and have never come down with me. And my mom never had it because chickenpox apparently is unknown in the country where she grew up. Just like rabies is unknown in the U.K.—they don't have rabies with animals. That's why they—that's why when you bring things over—these are very self-contained things. Chickenpox apparently never made it into the Eastern bloc. And so, she never had it so we don't really think—we don't know that she ever had, like, the (inaudible at 22:53), like, biological immunity.</p>

<p>And my doctor doesn't want to play, like, games—with (inaudible at 23:00) immunosuppressants, there's only a live virus and therefore does not want to take the risk of immunizing me. Yeah, it's a very good reason. So when a mother came in with kid full on-blown chickenpox and I asked a question about it and she's like, "Well yeah, I needed to get my phone fixed and, you know, he had to be home from school because school doesn't want him there." I'm like, "Yeah, school doesn't want him there, but you don't bring him to the mall to go shopping." So we had to fully explore that last time. And we were able to get somebody who has chickenpox to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To help them out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to help the mom and kid, you know, but we did find out legally that I guess if it's anything other than a phone, we can deny it, but a phone is considered to be a utility. I know, weird thing. But she was very supportive of the whole thing, which was good. And I stood my ground. I could've just grumbled about it, but I said to her, you know, "I don't want to catch this. I could catch this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was very, like, you know, and she was like, "I will back you to the hilt if you get it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so it's little triumphs like that, but, you know. A feeling like I'm standing up for myself for something that's kind of awkward and the thing is that, you know, there are times when you can't accommodated because there's nothing to do. I mean, and so at the same time standing my ground and saying, "OK, well I understand that but if this happens, I need to be," you know, which was, you know, something at least. But it's just been like, like I said, it's been really kind of a (pause) it's been very high octane up until Monday night, when, like, I had (inaudible at 24:45) going home and coming to sleep but Monday, by the time I dragged myself home, like—normally it's just my leg, but it had been, like, all over my problem joints were keeping me up and swollen. And so pretty much, I couldn't find a way to sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you had texted me in the middle of the night, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 25:08) not good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that was an interesting experience. But yeah, because of having to do so many things. Normally, like I said, if I'm kept up in pain, it is either—occasionally it is the areas that I have the joint replacements but usually not, unless it's winter. It's usually my leg that keeps me up. However, all of the small joints—I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your hip or knee?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's the hip. It's technically not even really the hip—it's this part where the hip bone attaches to the spine but it is a non-moveable joint and therefore it's harder for them to do much with. But it is—definitely, I mean, it feels like hip. But yeah, like, these joints do after a while start to hurt, but I have doing so much with, like, resetting phones and doing all this stuff and (pause) it, you know, it had to be done. But at least I didn't have to sell anything, which I've always been afraid about having to do so, just because of the exhaustion of having to memorize all of the stuff. So that was good. [00:26:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. You got through it OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine it was a really hectic weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was a really hectic weekend. Yeah. But it went smoothly, which was good. And yeah, it could've been a lot worse. So it happened—I think that it was all the planning that I did that also made it a lot easier, better, so—which was good. But it was good. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. No, I'm sure it makes it (inaudible at 27:07).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really enjoy, I really—as much as I take about them being bad, I really enjoy it. I'm having the time of my life while I'm doing most of this stuff, you know. I really do, because I love talking to people. I love, you know (pause), it's just a really lovely way to see how much people appreciate the brand and really help people out. And so it is nice. [00:27:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 27:34) it's, like, actually a pretty positive event.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a very positive event.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 27:36) people are really excited to (inaudible at 27:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, people are very positive and not angry...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 27:40) cool stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People wait in line, they're friendly with one another, that kind of thing. It's just in general by the time I got to them, you know, yeah, some of it is problem solving. Some of it is making a joke about the fact that you, like, keeping account of how many people say that they don't know the password to their e-mail. All weekend, by the way, we almost broke 500.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 28:05).</p>

<p>CLIENT: People think they don't have a password to their e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you mean you broke 500 for people who think they don't have a password to their e-mail? Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they don't have to put in anything in and we explain to them then if that's true, then how do you keep people from reading your e-mail?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, yeah. So, yeah. So that was exciting. But I mean, for the most part it's light hearted (inaudible at 28:27) about that kind of stuff. It's not too bad. We didn't have that many really big crazies, which is good. In the store, the crazy people were actually part of the entertainment. I don't know if I've ever told you that she decided literally a couple of hundred feet away from a Psychiatric Hospital, so we get...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 28:50) psychiatric?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, I sure have heard of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so when we get crazy people, we got real crazy—yeah, like, shopping cart fall (ph) baby doll kind of crazy people. What was bad, it was usually at least somewhat entertaining (laughter) you know, it's kind of strange to say it that way, but it was not like as in, you know, not people who are looking for something that is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 29:15) trouble (inaudible at 29:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's light hearted, at least. It's definitely, you know, so we would—but in this shop, you don't have to worry about, like, you know, all the 48 hour holds stop and those people come in to visit the store. But normally it's just, you know, people who are expecting you to do things that you can't do. But that was kept to the minimum. It was really nice. So, when we ran out of the phones, they were OK with it, people understood, you know.</p>

<p>The people who, like, ordered—and this was something we knew was going to probably happen. The people who ordered a phone online and then decided they didn't feel like waiting and decided to wait in lines anyways. When we told them that they couldn't actually use their upgrade because the upgrade was used, like, their burn (ph) was, you know, when they ordered the phone online, et cetera, they were pretty OK with that even too. They weren't—that was—we were really afraid that people were going to be angry about that. No, so that was good. It was really good. It was a lot of people, you know, that's not too bad. [00:30:22] So, it was, like I said, a pretty positive experience, which was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, well that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just tiring, you know. It's very tiring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (inaudible at 30:33) go well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. But yeah, that's my plan. When I'm done with this, it's taxi home, chicken soup, pretty much. And that's about it. But it's just (pause) yeah, it's like it's a slew of information to process though. Changing my routines of certain things too, you know. But I (pause) yeah. I'm not feeling so awesome, not making a whole lot of sense, in my head at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 30:33) physically all kinds of crummy and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nyquil doesn't exactly make you feel like especially lucid either, you know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you start to think about it (inaudible at 31:32).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm sad. I mean, it's like I said all this stuff together is just, you know (pause), it's just a lot to handle. But (pause) I know I can do it and it's just a matter of time. It's just (pause) these are—it sounds weird to have, like, there's problems I can sort out. The things I can do something about and the things I can't, these are things I can do, I can do something about eventually, you know. Given time I have control over them, you know. I can, you know, I can—this is a place I can get to. I can rent a car, I can step up and (pause), you know, be there for somebody who needs it. These are all those (ph) stressful and it's exhausting. I can get sleep, I can do, you know, I can do this stuff—these are the things I can control. And therefore (pause) when I say that, you know, that it's going to be OK, this is going to pass, it really is that way. It's just that right now, I'm just slugging through it. And it's the problems that I have zero power of. I mean, yeah, I don't have any power over getting better but I do sort of, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah sure, it's going to pass.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's going to pass, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not the real problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, nobody has tonsillitis forever, you know, or whatever. And so, like, these are all just things that I can...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:20) figure (inaudible at 33:21) figure how soon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. And, you know, it's (pause) yeah. (Pause) It also gives me the chance to be able to do the things that (pause) I do well, in terms of organizing things, things like that, you know. I actually got this text from my friend that—it sounds so weird to just read it, because I can barely remembering the exact stating of (inaudible at 34:07) read it. It was really sweet and actually really helped me a lot. She said something like, "Debra, thanks so much for keeping me informed. I don't know if you knew this, but I've always looked to you as a role model, a mother figure, when we were in school. I thank you for keeping us all informed again, you know, and being the type that holds all the friends together." And I don't know why, but it just really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, when you feel so darn powerless...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I mean, I feel guilty because I know that sometimes she went along with stuff because I was doing it that she—this is not, like, drug use or anything like that. I meant, like, (laughter)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:49) or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, more along the lines of OK, so this is the kind of engagement ring Debra (sp?) got, so I'm going to get something kind of like this. You know, Debra (sp?) got married at this age—she's a year behind me, you know, this is so I'm going to do this. And so I felt a little bit guilty because I felt like maybe because of the fact that she did, you know, feel that way that (pause) she felt like—not pressured, but, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice to be put in touch with somebody you're really proud of, (inaudible at 35:16) not have nearly enough of that, I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like, you know, following by example isn't necessarily the important thing to do, but it is nice to know that, you know, that somebody does. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it's like, you know what, if I'm organizing, even for people that can't make it down there, you know, people who, like—because this is before digital pictures. People have old pictures and/or you have any notes of condolence that, you know, I can hand deliver them, that kind of stuff. That really, I mean, to me it is nothing to do that, but it is everything to Richard (sp?) and in some way, it also really makes me feel like (pause) there's something that I can do, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, [it would allow you] (ph) to be useful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like to be useful. I really don't like to stand around and just watch things happen. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you're going to love it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unfortunately, I've gotten the criticism of that sometimes I have the problem of—there is a difference between things that I need to do and something that needs to be done. And I don't necessarily always know that. I will often do something because I feel like I want to immediately influence and affect something when I should just stand aside and let somebody else do it, you know. But this is not one of those situations. [That's something I heard] (ph), like, it's mostly guys, guys that are not very good at being in touch with their feelings and things like that, so therefore this is—or organizing things right now. So this is something where no one else is going to—well, not no one else, but I can be the person who steps up and does this, you know. Yeah, so. (Coughs) Like it or not, that's pretty much—it sounds weird to say it, but that's just about all I have to say. I don't know how much time I have left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 37:24) seven or eight minutes or so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you mind if I leave early so I can go ahead to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, (inaudible at 37:27) to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...taxi. Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you going to go over the (inaudible at 37:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. Well I hope you feel better and I'm sorry to hear your news.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it is (pause), you know, it's really unfortunate but I'm glad that it's—at least, it's in a place and it is with something that I can do something about. [It's just] (ph) that's how I feel useful, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, take care (inaudible at 38:00).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will let you know about next week because...</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure sure.</p>

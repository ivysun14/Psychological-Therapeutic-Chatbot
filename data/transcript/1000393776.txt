<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
 
<p>ANALYST: I will have to cancel, let's see, next Thursday and Friday, both; Thanksgiving and the day after.  And if it's pertinent, then the following week also; Wednesday and Thursday.  That's uh, December 2 and 3.</p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I don't know whether this means anything, but it, it uh, when you cancel on Thanksgiving and the day after, it makes me think that uh, I hadn't really thought about it.  But I suppose by next week, well, we're going out to dinner and in such a way that probably it would have occurred to me it would be best to cancel if you already hadn't.  But yet I don't think I would have thought of it until, I don't know, right before, the way I — seems like I'm always doing that.  (Sniff, Pause) </p>
 
<p>Because the only thought I have is, well especially when you mentioned the next week, uhm, I, I mean I've been thinking this way sort of anyway.  But then I react this way when you cancel, is that uh, I'm hoping that by then I'll either be in the hospital or have had the baby.  And I, I used to think, try to keep myself thinking that I'd be late.  But after the doctor told me I was dilating, uhm, I don't know, I just started thinking, well maybe I'll be early, if anything.  And uhm, anyway I, I stopped thinking I'd be late.  And (Sigh) so I sort of think I won't be here, anyway.</p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Uhuh.  You know, I wonder if you're aware that you have never mentioned a date that you sort of have in mind as the due date.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: I never said what the doctor told me?  Because that's the only one I go by. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Yeah, I don't recall it.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Oh, well it's December 1.  Well, that does seem strange. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Uhum.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I don't, well, the next thing I think of is something that sometimes is on my mind.  And I, I think I almost hope the baby will be born in November, even though, I mean, what difference does it make? But FNA's birthday is December 3, so it's very conceivable that our baby could have the same birth date.  And, I don't want it to.  And I don't know whether it's because of FNA or because of my mother and that she had FNA then, that makes me feel that way.  But somehow I feel as if I'd be losing something if — that would be my own, or something.  Well, I mean it's, I suppose maybe has something to do with the fact that FYCZ and I had the same date for birthdays, too.  Although this would be different. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: That, that was December 1, for FNA, right?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: No, FNA's December 3.  But I've been thinking that it would be  possible, but — since it's so close. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: You propose this as maybe your reason why you might not have mentioned it?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: No, but it just came to my mind.  No, because December 1 is, otherwise been very much on my mind, in that people are always saying, when are you due, and I'm always telling them.  So that — </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: That's what makes it curious.  Why, you wouldn't have mentioned it, at least in, sort of in passing, even.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause, Sniff)  The only other, the only other thing that comes to my mind why I might not have, is that when I'm here it isn't on my mind, because the whole, I'm trying to push the whole thought of the baby being born, out.  I mean, it seems like so many times my thoughts have been on the fact that I didn't want the baby born.  I wanted to have it stay inside me. </p>
 
<p>And uh, (Pause) oh, I mean in the, the question it seems to me obvious to ask would be well, was I really just not wanting you to know?  And I don't know, first I was surprised when you pointed that out, because it didn't seem that I wouldn't want you to know that.  But then, I suppose it depends on how I'm thinking about it.  Because if I'm thinking about it that it would be helpful for you to know, simply because at some point I'm not going to be able to come here, and that affects you.  I mean that's thinking about you in 1 capacity.  And then, I think about the feelings I've had that, which are an entirely differ—,  different capacity, and maybe then I wouldn't want you to know the date.  (Sniff, Pause, Cough, Silence) 
 
<p>Uh, I just started thinking about something else, uhm (Sigh), in connection with yesterday.  Because I didn't, I didn't connect this at the time.  But it's been on my mind, well really since we were up in PNOTS, because MSCZ and I both left something there.  That either that I wanted to write to my mother or to call and uhm, point out the things we left.  Because MSCZ was afraid — MLWZ gave MSCZ a picture that he was afraid my mother might throw away, not realizing he wanted to keep it.  And uhm, yet I kept putting off either writing or calling.  And I'd use the excuse well, uh, we were about to know about an apartment, and then I'd wait and tell them about the apartment at the same time. 
 
<p>And then finally I realized I wasn't going to be able to do that.  But I still kept putting it off.  And it was getting to the point where I really wanted to call, because, I mean, just in terms of my mother's coming down for a few days when I get home from the hospital.  And I don't know whether, well she does—, she's not sure, it turns out.  But we weren't sure whether or not she'd want to stay in a hotel or stay with us.  Because it isn't going to be so comfortable, staying with us, since we don't, I mean we just have a layaway bed, and it's, it would be crowded.  Uh, and s—, but then when I got home last night, I just knew last night I'd call her.  And there was no question in my mind and I, I don't know, I mean there was no putting it off thinking well, I'll do it later.</p> 
 
<p>But just when I was about to call, she called first.  Although I still don't really have any question that I would have done it.  Because I was just in that kind of mood, and I, and so I was in a very receptive mood to get a call from her, too.  And then, I don't know, later I thought well, it must have something to do with yesterday that I suddenly changed.  And yet, well I was thinking of it I guess, because today I had the feeling I've had lately a lot.  I don't know whether it's just being more sleepy because of being near to the end of my pregnancy, or if it's something else.  But I often feel I'd just as soon lie in bed in the morning and uhm, I'm often restless at night.  And I suppose part of it's due to just being uncomfortable.  But also I'm very aware of, at least the last 2 nights, of having dreams.  And they're dreams that, I don't know, they're not nightmares.  But on the other hand, they're not dreams I want to have, for some reason. </p>
 
<p>And this morning, I mean, when I woke up, or when MSCZ got up, I just had the feeling I can't, I just can't stand to get up, now.  And when I finally did get up it was the same feeling of not having a lot of energy, and, and somehow just not feeling the way I was last night when I knew I'd call my parents.  And it seemed to me very clear at the time what I had been dreaming, or at some point I, I remembered.  Now, when I think about it, all I remember is that the dreams I had the night before, were all different situations when I was with friends.  And try—, oh, now, I'm beginning to remember the other one, too — and trying to — and feeling I was unwanted or I should be leaving, and trying to leave and not being able to.  And it was different situations where I'd be trying to leave, and yet not being able to, and feeling sort of afraid to.</p> 
 
<p>And I think last night's had something to do with, uhm, that well, the part I recall is being in a strange house that apparently, though it's not at all like her real house, belonged to FBB, this friend of mine who's living in PBB right now.  And I was with her and there was some question about using a bathroom.  Well first it was, it was she who was planning to use the bathroom.  And somebody said well, your father wants to use it in 15 minutes.  And so she decided it wasn't time.  And I thought, well, I'll run in and out.  And there were 2 bathrooms, but one — only one had a shower.  And it involved taking a shower.  And then, the rest of the dream consisted of my trying to h,  hurry out of the bathroom, and not being able to get out of the bathroom.  I mean, not that the door was locked or anything, but just something else would have to be done.  And it, it s—, I don't know, it seemed almost like I was drugged and unable to move fast.  And yet I felt very anxious about not getting out in time f, for this man who al— it was almost like he was my father now, and not hers.  And who would be very angry.  (Sniff, Silence) </p>
 
<p>I don't know, what strikes me about both of the dreams is that somehow the feeling I recall having in the dream, is of not wanting to, to leave.  I mean, either th—, it was leave the different friends.  Because I had that, I mean that dream seemed to go on and on, every time I woke up.  I'd go back to sleep and it would be a different situation, but sort of the same theme.  And uhm, and yet I, I felt aware that I should leave because I'd s—, either I'd outworn my welcome or for some reason or other, it would be better for my relationship with these friends, if I left.  And yet, I didn't want to and I, I'd, would be trying to, and couldn't.  And it seems almost like I didn't want to leave the bathroom, either.  And that, that was why I kept finding other things I had to do.  (Sniff)  And yet I felt I should.  I mean, I, I wanted to on the level that I knew this man, whether he was FBB's father or my father, would want me out of the bathroom.  (Silence, Sniff) </p>
 
<p>Because I was just, uhm, wondering especially about the dream last night and sort of thinking about yesterday, and the feelings I was talking about at the end.  And it made me think that it was a strange house to have imagined, because it was almost like a castle.  It was built out of stone, it was very big, and therefore very cold, and everybody kind of disappeared into different parts of it. And, and yet, t—, here was this crush on bathrooms, which was rather odd.</p> 
 
<p>And then I was just thinking that, in the dream it seems like I had no connection with anyone anywhere else in the house.  Except, I think somehow I overheard FBB talking about what she should do about using the bathroom.  And then, and then I decided to use it.  And then that was where, if I had any contact with this man who was, it seems like he became my father and wasn't FBB's after a while in the dream, that this was where I was going to have it.  Because that's where he wanted to go next, and that I never saw him anywhere else, either there in the house, or anywhere around it.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>Oh, then it makes me think of something I (Sigh) — well I think of it in 2 different ways.  It just occurs to me, I think those 2 bathrooms were next to each other, and one was part of, sort of part of his bedroom and then my mother's bedroom, assuming that he had become my father.  And uh, the one with the shower was connected to his bedroom, so in other words it was his bathroom.  And, uhm, makes me think that my parents had a bathroom off this room that always had the closed doors.  I, I mean I'll always think of it as the, the door being shut, or as it's the feeling sort of strange to go into the room, even though I was in it a lot.  And there was a door off the hall into that bathroom, but we never used it.  I think generally, it was locked, anyway.  But, uhm, so they had their private bathroom. </p>
 
<p>And sometimes, if there was some reason to see my mother, for instance, and we'd knock on their bedroom door, my father would go into the bathroom and shut the door.  Either i—, uh, we, either it would be don't come in, don't open the door.  Or he'd go into the bathroom and shut the door, and then we could come in. </p>
 
<p>And then it makes me think that in looking at apartments now, I mean 2 bathrooms is a great convenience, so from that point of view, I suppose, it's attractive to me that many of the apartments we've been looking at have two.  But then I found I react very much to the apartments that have one of the bathrooms off the master bedroom, as if there's something really special about that.  Even though otherwise there might be well, so handy that I don't even see what i—, difference it would make.  But so i,i,i, I mean i, it's really, I don't think it's a rational reaction at all.  I think it's an emotional reaction.  And, when I like the idea of the bathroom off the master bedroom.  (Sniff) </p>
 
<p>It also makes me think of something that — I mean just in terms of that dream and my taking a shower — it's true that in that house we lived in all those years, the uhm, other bathroom — I don't know when they put a shower in, but they put it in a tub.  And so it, I mean, so it didn't have a shower stall.  And I remember there was a time when I used the shower in my parent's bathroom, but I think it was always at a time when my father wasn't home.  And I don't know whether it was before the shower was put into our bathroom or not.  But now I prefer a shower in a tub, because I'm used to having more space.  And I feel very closed in in a shower stall.  And yet, there was a period when I preferred to do that, and I'm sure that the shower had already been put in.  At least I, I don't know why I'm sure, but it just seems to me for some reason, there was a period when I preferred to use my parents' bathroom.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And I don't know, I, I'm just recalling, it seems that I always had a curiosity about it, anyway.  That, well, for a long time the only scales in the house were in that bathroom.  And so I remember going in there if I ever wanted to weigh myself.  But then, I don't know, I, it just would seem that I'd be very curious, and I'm not sure what about exactly, except somehow I thought I'd learn something.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And I think, it must have had more to do with my father, what I thought I'd learn.  Because during the day, again, if my mother were in the bathroom and we wanted to see her about anything, she would let us come in.  So there wasn't really a mystery about her.  And her, what she'd do in that room or just her, seeing her in it.  But, unless my father were fully clothed and, I don't know, going in to get medicine out of the cabinet, or something, he would never have let us see him in the bathroom.  And I th—, I think I used to wonder, too, about I could imagine my mother using the bathroom and my father walking in.  But I could never imagine the reverse.  Except I knew it must happen, so I, I don't know, it was one of those things I couldn't figure out.  </p> 
 
<p>ANALYST: You must have wondered what he would do in the bathroom, and you would go in and see your mother after he would go in the bathroom.  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose that's so, because well, I don't know, I think of it now in terms of (Sigh) well, sort of I suppose, comparing him, what I would imagine him doing, to what now I know MSCZ does in the bathroom.  Now I've seen a man in a bathroom, and the way I always wondered how my father used it.  And, and yet even, even there, MSCZ used to be bothered when I'd come in, and I think I used to come in because I had a, I don't think I admitted it to myself, but I think I must have had a certain curiosity about just what would he do.  Because it seemed like, almost as soon as he went into a bathroom, no matter for what reason, I would have to go into the bathroom, too.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>And yet I think I tried to imagine what my father was doing in the bathroom, and I d—, well, I don't know if I really did or not, or if I — left sort of a blank.  But it seemed as if whatever he was doing, nobody should be there, including my mother.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>I don't know whether this is true that it ever happened.  But I think of something I did once, in connection with it.  Uhm, I was thinking that the other thing that might happen, is if my father were dressing, but didn't have his trousers on.  Then he'd, and we knocked, and it seemed like we could come in, because he was almost ready.  He would, they had a very big closet, so that he would go in the closet and sort of put on his pants there, and then come out. </p>
 
<p>And I'm not sure that he ever really did that, but it made me think of a situation where I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed.  When uhm, I was a freshman at college, I was, I had a roommate.  And we had a room that was really a room for just one person.  So it was very crowded.  And one time, uhm, the dean of residence was taking somebody around, I don't know whether to show them these different rooms that had been doubled up, or not.  But we had no warning and I was, I think, just in my underwear when they knocked.  And I was right by the closet, so I just went in it, thinking that whoever it was would leave.  And then they came in and started looking around.  And eventually, they wanted to see the closet, and there I was.  It makes me laugh now, but at the time I was, well, I mean it struck me funny afterwards, but on the other hand I felt very awkward and silly.  And that there had to be a big explanation about what I was doing in the closet.  (Sigh) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Who did you think was coming in?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: I just knew it was somebody strange, I didn't, maybe I realized it was the dean, I don't know.  (Pause) But, uh, I don't know where my bathrobe was.  I keep thinking about this and thinking that the logical thing would have been to grab a bathrobe.  And I think my roommate was there then, and I mean, she could have just said oh, could you wait just a second, or something, until I had something on.  But instead, my whole thought was, the closet's a safe place and just th—, it's the right place to go when you don't want to be seen. </p>
 
<p>And, and, I, I, keep thinking about that in connection with my parents' closet.  (Sigh) And I had the same type of curiosity about their closet, too.  As I did d—, or not the same exactly, but I had a curiosity about their closet the way I had one about their bathroom.  And uhm, I don't know, as if there was some mystery in there.  And, and I always wanted to see inside it.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>I, I went into thinking about, well, just sort of another feeling in connection with my parents' bedroom.  And this was connected with the fact that they had a full-length mirror on their closet door on the outside, so you didn't have to open the door.  But if we were changing hems on anything, or for any reason had to use a full-length mirror, we'd go in there.  And again, it would be times when my father wasn't there.  And, I don't know, again feeling that I was sort of in a special place.</p>

<p>And then I went from thinking that to thinking of, although their b, bedroom door was open a lot of the time, I had an image of that hall being made very dark because that one door was closed.  And I don't know whether it would make it that much darker.  But just, this image of being in the hall and that door being closed.  And for some reason, I think I was thinking of MLWZ being in the bathroom, being a baby.  And that my mother had a bassinet then, and so he was bathed and changed in the bathroom that we all had.  And yet, their bedroom door being closed. </p>

<p>And I began to wonder who was taking care of us when my mother was in the hospital.  When she had her hysterectomy, whenever it was after MLWZ was born.  And I don't know, maybe somehow I had her either during that time when she had to stay in bed because of her back, or she was still recovering from the hospital, but in the bedroom the door was closed because my father was there.  And then, whoever was helping with MLWZ would be with MLWZ. </p>  
 
<p>I don't know why I started thinking about who stayed with us.  But I, I began to think well, it might have been, we had I think, if I remember correctly, there was a time, for about 2 or 3 years that my mother had a maid that she liked very much, who was I think, probably the best one in her mind.  And this woman was very fond of all of us. And I think we were all fond of her.  And I just couldn't remember whether she was with us before MLWZ or after MLWZ was born.  And yet, now I have, I mean I remember her name was MLWZ and that's all, I don't have any other memory of her, except once we went to visit her after she got married.  But it's almost as if, even though I know at the time we all liked her, she was very unimportant in my life.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>And I was just wondering why I've had all these memories and thinking about yesterday again.  (Pause)</p> 
 
<p>ANALYST: What about yesterday?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: Well, I was just thinking there must be, s—,  because it followed yesterday, some connection.  And (Sigh) the only, well, I shouldn't say the only tie, but I'm not sure I recall all of yesterday.  But I know that I was thinking about this feeling that I had to protect myself from men who were out to seduce me, and then that led back to my father, and what I wanted from him.  And then, my father seems to be sort of central to all these memories and my feeling somehow, that I didn't know him or I didn't know what he was doing, and I wanted to know.  Or I was being left out (Sniff) and I wanted to be there.  (Pause) </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: What do you think you wanted to know about him?  </p>
 
<p>PATIENT: (Pause) I don't know, I think it must be mainly what his penis looked like, assuming he had one.  Because he never would let us see it or anywhere, I mean he wouldn't even be halfway undressed.  And maybe even further, to what he did with it.  (Silence) </p>
 
<p>Because, it seems like my whole concentration when we weren't allowed in by him, was that it was because we weren't to see his penis.  And he had to get it well-covered up before we could come in.  And then, I don't know, that's, seems to be what I assumed was always happening. </p>
 
<p>ANALYST: Well, (Sniff) our time's up. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How things been goin for ya?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My sister is dying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no.  Is she recognizing it now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  Um, I got the call last Wednesday night.  She had had - she had been very confused and delirious, hallucinating and it - she was - she insisted she had lost one of her pills in the bed sheets and nobody could convince her otherwise and then she's - that's the nurse coming out, and then she wanted the seam ripper because she was gonna take the sheets apart until she found the pill and that's the seamstress coming out.  So -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does she have metastasis to her brain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, she has - it started in the ileus, it went to the liver and now it's gone back to the intestines.  Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what's causing the delirium?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's dying.  The dying process.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so she's that advanced.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yes, it's gonna be a couple of days.  They stopped the C P N because she was running a fever and they suspect she had some kind of a belly infection and the doctor said that that will feed the infection so let's not and the night that things were so bad she kept going after her port and she would open it up and insisting she had to do something with it and they'd say no, no, no, no, no you don't, no we don't need that and they'd have to sterilize it and as soon as they'd be done she'd be at it again, I thought, then she needs some sedation if she's this agitated.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This has gone faster than you thought.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not faster than I thought.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Faster than anybody else was willing to say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Willing to say.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I truly did not think she'd live this long. She was, four weeks ago, the weekend of the big snow, she was going down to [DEIDENTIFIED] for another round of scans and chemo and she got - we got to my house at eight p.m., because she met me in [DEIDENTIFIED].  My furnace wasn't working.  It was forty two degrees in the house.  So I had to put her in the bed under the electric blanket and get the furnace fixed and she got sicker and sicker and finally said I want to go to the emergency room, you know [DEIDENTIFIED].  She was terrified that if she went to the E R here they would just see her as drug seeking, so we drove down to [DEIDENTIFIED], she vomited beautifully for the E R nurse.  They got her under control, we got home at two a.m., got up again to be down there at nine and she vomited again and she said, oh God that's vile, and started to cry, I don't want to have to have surgery again, I don't.  She had surgery in January and she's never recovered from that.  They had left the drainage tube in and she was hospitalized at [DEIDENTIFIED] for eight days, trying to get the vomiting under control and she - once they finally got that under control and I took her back home to [DEIDENTIFIED] and one of her nieces came - excuse me, one of my nieces, her daughter came and things have not been under control since then.  She finally decided she wasn't gonna go down to [DEIDENTIFIED] again because she was too weak to make the trip and could she get her chemo up in [DEIDENTIFIED]. And then she spent three more days in the hospital for pain control and they finally called the hospital and she said well but it's open access so I can continue to get my chemotherapy and I thought, no, please don't it will just make you ill.  And so when I got there on Friday she wasn't ready to die yet.  When I left on Monday, the hospice nurse had been there and they had all talked and she had signed her D N R and I thought wow, you mean that hasn't been done yet.  Well, she had been signed a D N R like for the hospital, but the hospice has to have their own, everybody has to have their own D N R I guess, so she signed her D N R and the nurse made a couple of recommendations so that if she can't - when she can't swallow anymore they can deliver the Morphine and the Compazine rectally um I think she's going to need - I noticed when she was down at [DEIDENTIFIED],  she'd get - first she would get agitated,  she would - restless. I need to clean out my purse.  Or I need to straighten out the bedside table and about an hour later, I need something for nausea, I need something for pain and it was always - she couldn't recognize her - what her discomfort was.  So I clued my nieces in on that one um and then when I was in the hotel yesterday morning they called and said, you know we think everything is under control now, we think you can go home.  Um, I said okay, I'm three  hours away, call me if - and she has been getting up by herself and she actually went all the way down stairs and I'm thinking, you guys, if she breaks a hip then - you know, if she falls and breaks something you're really screwed and if you need somebody just to sit up at night out in the hallway so she and her husband can have some privacy, that's all - just so I can have eyes on her so that if she starts to get up I can get somebody else up um, because we don't - it's gonna be very soon that's she not - she's gonna try to get out of bed and not be able to, and I don't like the idea of her trying to go down the stairs alone.  She said it was very tough getting back up the stairs and that's probably the last time.  Oh they were gonna try and get her outside yesterday because it was such a gorgeous day, but she said oh well I did it the other day and it was pretty hard getting upstairs, well yes this would be a multiple person undertaking, but they are going to need somebody to be sitting up all night because one of her daughters has a [AGE] month old, one of her daughters has a [AGE] week old and one of her daughters is [DEIDENTIFIED] weeks pregnant.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh geez.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Those people have to sleep at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Her husband has to sleep at night or he will lose his mind.  But they - so, she's still drinking water but she drinks water and you see it go out the tube.  And she eats an orange popsicle and a few minutes later you see it go out the tube.  So there's, there's clearly a blockage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so the malnutrition is gonna set in and the dehydration is gonna set in, in a couple of days.  I think she's probably gonna stop talking in a day or so.  And I notice that you can see her cheek bones now and that's a little dehydration and a little bit of weight loss, but everybody was there over the weekend.  Even my weenie brother from Florida came.  I called him three and a half or four weeks ago and told him, you know, if you're planning on going, now would be the time and you say that why?  Because she's dying.  Well do we know that for a fact, oh cripe -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When has he ever -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, I was trying to give him the opportunity to do better than he did when our mother died and he did not take advantage of it, so that's fine.  When she dies we'll send you a certified copy of the death certificate by bicycle messenger. Donations can be made to the fund for your brain transplant.  But he did finally - when we got the phone call Wednesday night, he promptly got on a plane and flew into [DEIDENTIFIED] and rented a car and was out Thursday and Friday but he didn't want to stay any longer. He was - was saying well I'll go home Sunday at the latest, but by Friday he wanted to go.  Okay.  My other brother had been here, took a weekend like four weeks ago and flew from [DEIDENTIFIED] and made, made the trip primarily to ask her is your soul right with God, but at least he came and they came again just for Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, but her husband's kids have all been there and we've all been there and my mother's best friend, who is [AGE] and lives in [DEIDENTIFIED] was there. She was only there for about an hour but she was there and we know she can't make the trip for the funeral.  So, we made all the phone calls to the cousins, did you know what's going on, well this is what's happening and all of her friends were there, but she sent two of her friends out on a scouting mission to funeral homes yesterday.  I thought that would have been done by now, huh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have a grave?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  Her husband's having a - was initially having a terrible time with not feeding her, not continuing the T P M.  But that was probably had - well it was making her very nauseous in the mornings and her quality of life is better without it, but on Monday she's, she's said to them and the hospice nurse, I hope this doesn't go on too long - okay, now you're ready, that's fine.  That's fine. So, I have cleared my calendar -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And told everybody I know I'm off the map, you can ask me a day ahead for something that I can't schedule anything other than that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm off the map for child care at church.  I'm off the map for Wednesday afternoon taking care of my friend's grandson. I'm done until after my sister dies. When I called people I just said, you know, [NAME OTHER] is dying, you know, and my nieces asked me, what did you tell people, I said, well your mom's dying and one of my nieces said well that's pretty cold and clinical.  Well, what would you rather I had said.  Well I don't know, she isn't doing very well, she's taken a turn for the worse.  Let's call a spade a spade.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, this culture just sanitizes -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything, when my sister - years ago, a number of years ago when my aunt died, my sister called and said, you know, I'm just calling to tell you that [NAME OTHER] isn't doing very well.  Well what do you mean?  Well she was in the hospital and the doctor said he really couldn't do anything for her.  Is she dying? Well yes she is.  Okay.  And my mother's best friend called last night after she got back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and said, thank you for calling me and thank you for saying that she was dying and not couching it in pleasant terms and thank you for being very, very frank.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Isn't there some job for you as a hospice counselor or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Could be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You seem to - you've got a lot of experience.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well yeah I feel - it's been a hard couple of years.  I mean, sitting seven months at my friend's side during her dying um, it's just been like one thing after another - and I had to buy a new car.  The other one finally could not be fixed.  It needed new ball joints and rocker arms and I thought well if it's just annoying and the mechanic said no this is unsafe and I cannot find the parts anymore.  I cried when I said good bye to that one.  It's been fourteen years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A hundred and seventy nine thousand miles on it.  I was afraid it was gonna fall apart before I turned it in. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's at auto hospice now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's already been an organ and body donor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We were beyond - I was hospice, I was automobile, automotive hospice.  It has by now been used for an organ and a skin donor, I'm sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got a lot of use out of that car.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did and what I got was the Scion X B, that thing that looks like the box.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I mean it, [INAUDIBLE] came in the box.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's five inches shorter than the other one was so I don't have the cargo space, but it is exactly as wide.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh okay.  No problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I only paid two thousand more than I paid for the other one fourteen years ago. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's pretty amazing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's pretty amazing, yeah.  And couple of the financing offers came back at seven point nine percent and I said oh no, absolutely not.  I will not pay that kind of interest.  Not with my credit scores, not - either Toyota financing, they stole my credit scores -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Despite my little income, comes back at six point two financing - or else I'll come back tomorrow with a loan from my bank at six percent.  Although I could have taken out two credit cards, I could have paid it with - almost with one credit card and finished off with the other one and then just gotten a loan from my bank before the credit card bill came.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I wasn't gonna dink around with them.  Not when you have seven seventy five to eight hundred ten credit score.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you just don't buy anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't.  I pay my bills on time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't use my credit cards, I pay all my bills - when I use them I pay them immediately and I pay all my bills on time.  So I've been having a lot of anxiety the last few days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I'm sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I recognize that as the death of my sister. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And but it helps to make the phone calls.  That helped a lot.  There's nothing that can be done to prevent this.  There are things that can be done to prolong this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah that is not desirable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That is not desirable um, she could be hooked up to an I V and hydrated but there is no point in that because this will just be distressing to everyone and there will be a longer period of disorientation.  A longer period of her trying to get out of bed.  A longer period of waiting for this to happen. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's more natural this way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well the time honored way to die is you stop eating and drinking and take to your bed and people usually would die in about five days.  Um, I expect this to go - I expect her to stop talking in day or so. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still seems the start of infection in there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They suspect there's infection.  She was febrile and so they got out the Tylenol um, but she, she's not getting up anymore. She's been in bed since earlier in the week, so, once they take - once they don't get out of bed anymore, except maybe to wobble to the bathroom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if she has an abdominal infection, those get really painful and they push the Morphine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I think they're - I think they're going to have to start not just increasing the Morphine but giving it more often.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I did gently suggest that to my nieces that you know, so because when my friend was in the hospice, the whole time she was there, oh no you can't have anymore pain medication for another hour and a half.  We went through six months of that!  Oh, no the Morphine isn't scheduled for another - no, no, no her Ativan isn't scheduled for another hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And they didn't have breakthrough pain [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She had, uh Duragesic patches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But still -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But for the breakthrough pain, no she couldn't have it any more than every four hours.  I was not happy.  I was not happy at all with all of this.  No, no you can't have it yet. No, no you can't take just half the dose.  You have to take the whole dose.  So she was completely - she had no control.  I was very unhappy with this hospice. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] thought they'd be more flexible than that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that - we were very surprised.  Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think most of them are pretty flexible though, or at least contact the doctor and say this is inadequate at times, give us a new way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Part of the problem was that the, um Ativan was making her more agitated.  She had a paradoxical reaction to the Ativan and so they gave her more.  She got worse.  They gave her more.  And after she'd been there two weeks, somebody, a volunteer or staff person came out to some of us sitting in the living room and said do you have any questions?  We looked at each other and said well yes, I do. I thought that if she asked for her medication she would get it.  Well that is the way it's supposed to go.  Then why is she being told you have to wait, you have to wait, you can't have that.  It isn't time.  And they had no answer for it.  So I think they did - they did tell my nieces that if it happens again that she becomes agitated to the point that she combative and it's dangerous that there is some place they could take her for five days of rest and I think they're just gonna have to start with uh sedation.  Because it is - that is a possibility.  Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Once you've got delirium setting in, it's [INAUDIBLE] brain failure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well right and all of her organs are failing her.  Um, she's still urinating.  So there is some getting absorbed from her stomach, but very little.  Most of what's going into that bag is bile.  And that's the darkest color green I've ever seen in my life.  Even down at [DEIDENTIFIED] they said no, no you don't have an obstruction in the large or small bowel.  But her intestines were clearly failing because the only thing going into that tube was bile.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So no, maybe she didn't have an obstruction but her intestines were clearly failing.  So - and with the lack of fluids the kidneys will probably go next and her daughters know that, that's the sign that we're coming down the home stretch here when she doesn't need to get up to go to the bathroom and she's starting to get a bed sore.  Um, so the hospice came and put some kind of an adhesive on that just to protect it and she decided she can't stand the pull ups anymore and she's going commando.  But three of her - two of her girlfriends were together - they have this little girlfriend club and they all sit there - they said all right, all right and her two girlfriends got the pants out and put them on over their jeans and so [NAME OTHER] got up and said all right well let me put mine on and the three of them stood there in these stupid underpants and we have that memorialized on tape.  That will be suitable for framing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Her other friends very shortly I'm sure, um and one of her husband's kids took one of her wigs and put it on and came upstairs and scared the snot out of everybody.  So there's been a fair - there's been a lot of yucking it up at her expense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, she doesn't want her bedroom door closed anymore.  If she wants to nap she just wants everybody to shut up because she's starting to feel isolated up there so one of her nieces suggested that they should put in stadium seating.  She didn't think that was funny at all.  So she's still being bitchy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I don't - I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't want to suck away all the change now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well no, no we don't want her to become tender and sweet. No. If she does then we definitely know it's gone to her brain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I would not be surprised if there is - a couple of months ago she had a brain scan and there was nothing in the brain.  This may be just part of the process.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I expect a week.  Um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're holding up all right with this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I cry a lot.  And it comes and goes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you're grieving.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um hum, although I did a lot of my grieving a year ago, and my friends were very good about - oh I have a book for you to read.  Oh, well here why don't you read this book.  So I got a lot of that and I went to my minister before I left town and said this is - thank you - and said this is what's happening and these people are largely unchurched.  My nieces, my sister, um, could I have a couple of candles just to offer to them, here this is - if you're looking for some - if you want to write the memorial service yourself, and I asked my minister if her fam - if they wanted it would she be available to come up.  Oh sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if they didn't want a minister, my friend, [NAME OTHER] who works at [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] she does memorial services for people who don't have a minister and she said oh sure she'd be happy to.  What they're probably going to do is contact the [DEIDENTIFIED] minister who married them fifteen months ago and - to do the memorial service.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That would be good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which - but I went armed with addresses and phone numbers and just said here it is and put it in a pile and - you know, let them look at it in their own good time and I suspect that they won't write the memorial service until after she dies.  I asked my sister do you want to write your own memorial service?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I don't know what I would say, okay, well think about it.  Yeah, think about it.  You can if you want.  And since she's been a labor and delivery nurse and a lactation consultant, my nieces thought maybe a nurse-in would be the best tribute.  That they could all go up there and nurse the babies.  There'd be two nursing and one seven months pregnant. [INAUDIBLE].  So we're prepared to be stupid and silly. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, celebrate life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she said - I said -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's most important that you celebrate life.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well right and she said well you know, I said a memorial service and she said well I think it's gonna be a funeral, and I said well what's the difference and I told her a funeral is largely a religious right.  The main purpose is to pass on the religious teachings about life and death is what I've seen, whereas a memorial service is a celebration of a life that was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now if you're Lutheran - both.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right and most are both.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They both are both -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, no matter what, and I told her you know it will be both and she said well but if the body is there isn't it a funeral.  I said I've been to memorial services with a body, I've been to funerals without.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, she definitely wants to be buried.  She does not want to be cremated and she's already picked out her outfit and she's already decided that the wig is going with her.  She wants to wear the wig in the casket, so she's - I don't know if they - she clearly hasn't picked out a casket yet, if she was sending friends out on a scouting expedition.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So she's - on my dad's side of the family, she's the second cousin to die.  The first one died very suddenly of a blood clot. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She had had a blood clot in her leg and it broke free and went to her lungs.  Um, and that was just very sudden and very unexpected.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And on my mother's side, except for a cousin who died at the age of five in a farming accident, she is the first cousin.  So everybody's kinda going oh, oh we're that old. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the impact it has.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well everybody's kinda going oh, okay.  Now she's only [AGE] but when you get cancer and you get metastasis -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well we have lots of cancer on both sides of the family.  I am not shocked by this at all. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What happens is [INAUDIBLE] to which generation is dying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We still have two aunts on my mother's side.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um plus, plus, an uncle by a marriage - no, plus an uncle and an aunt by marriage. On my dad's side we still have one aunt.  So this is again, you know, wait a minute the older generation isn't done yet.  We shouldn't be burying the younger generation yet. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> My mom's side of the family was huge and several of her brothers and sisters are still living.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But some of the twenty six grandkids -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have already passed on -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great grandkids have passed on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's like everybody gets together.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At first it was the oh, we're next thing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But then when you're looking down -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right and usually a whole generation goes okay well who's next.  But -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but it's not that clean and -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anymore, no.  Um I just found out that her ileo-malignancy was diagnosed as a carcinoid.  Last spring they said no, this is an adenocarcinoma.  Oh if it had been diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma in the first place they might have recommended chemo right away and caught it before they found the liver metastases. So, but one - [DEIDENTIFIED] they're very compassionate, they're very good but they were still gonna have her do more chemo and it was clearly - I didn't think it was appropriate anymore and that was my big fear with them that they would not call it quits.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Soon enough in the game.  And I think they should have called it quits when she came up - when it bounced back to three places in the intestines.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So was it carcinoid or adenoid -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was an adenoid.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, so I don't know how the pathology didn't quite get picked up on the first time and I don't know, maybe it was when she went to [DEIDENTIFIED] that they changed it, that they said none of this looks like an adenocarcinoma.  But -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Carcinoid is not anywhere near as common.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right carcinoid is about one percent of what they see and small intestinal cancers are about one percent of what they see. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But pathologically there's a big difference on how the tissues appear but you have to stain them [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, certainly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We grew up in a household where both parents smoked heavily.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And all of our aunts and uncles smoked heavily and all my parents' friends smoked heavily, so who knows.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm going on vacation next week with a guy who had twelve carcinoid tumors and he's alive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Somehow they got them all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.  Wow long ago?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Couple years ago.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They got them all?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  My sister-in-law's mom died of carcinoid.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, it was pretty slow.  Three years they didn't make any headway at any given time.  They still slowed it down, but -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They were able to shrink the um hepatic tumor -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then it popped back up in the intestines.  It was in the omentum and - we're done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're done, but I wasn't in a position to say I think you ought to call it quits, because she wasn't ready to die.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  That's her decision.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's been about six weeks since she talked about seeing the third grandbaby born. She wasn't able to - she was in the hospital when the second one was born four weeks ago and about six weeks ago, six and a half weeks ago she said,  you know I don't think I'm gonna be able to be there for that one.  And that was about the time she stopped talking about ever seeing the last one born</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At all.  She doesn't - or certainly seeing that one born, being there for the birth and she stopped talking about that one now.  Even with her hugely pregnant daughter is right there, she doesn't talk about that grand baby anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a bitter pill to swallow for her.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well she got to see one of them born.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But she found out about the liver metastases as she was driving to [DEIDENTIFIED] to be there for the birth of that one. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sure she was trying to stay alive long enough.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh she clearly was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She clearly was but there's just - there comes a time when there's nothing you can do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely nothing.  My mom was dying of ovarian cancer and my brother's wife was pregnant and my wife was pregnant -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She didn't live to see either one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She tried.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Didn't make it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I don't think this is gonna last a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  They're lucky to have you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.  I appreciate that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Very lucky.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My job has been babies and laundry. Although they decided since the babies - the youngest is only [AGE] - that really we shouldn't all be handling him.  We can sit there and say goo-goo-goo but they really don't want hands on him, especially since the other one seems to be having a reaction to this M M R -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, so they - but I took him down to the park and he fell asleep in my arms on the way back and so that was kinda - that's my favorite way to take a nap anyway with a baby on me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is a cool thing to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes. That's pretty big.  This guy's gotta weigh twenty five pounds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He is a big boy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's nothing like a baby smell.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sour milk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that baby feel.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  The, the newest one he can't even hold his head up yet, so he's just a little floppy thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But my nieces refer to me as the baby whisperer.  Yes, I am having a lot of anxiety over the whole thing and I just say, oh, okay I understand, all right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  How are you -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got plenty of drugs for at least a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay that's still 15 of the Lexapro?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And the Halcion [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've got refills on that.  And I did check at [DEIDENTIFIED] and make sure that if I happen to be out of town could I refill those.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, could I refill the Halcion and the Verapamil at another [DEIDENTIFIED] and they said yeah but they could only be transferred once.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But when I get back into town I'll just get my doctor to write me a whole nother script and I'll be done with it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Although the Halcion I could get them at maybe at [NAME OTHER] because that's controlled substance, that's a Schedule Four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I can't, since my insurance won't pay for it anyway, I can just get two refills of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they've done that for me if I'm gonna be out of town - can I have two?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm surprised that they'll give me a scheduled drug, two refills of it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The whole thing is loosening up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it used to be you could only write one month at a time.  Now every physician that I know will write three months at a time for neutral substances -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And some of the insurance companies will only allow even Adderall and Ritalin written three months at a time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And as far as I know that's directly against the whole law -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But they won't accept it anymore.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I know why that is because they want you to get it by mail.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Exactly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they, and they won't deliver it in thirds.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They will deliver it so you have three months worth of Oxycodone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You have three months of Adderall and Ritalin, the Schedule Two things. I happen to catch last night there was a subcommittee hearing on CSPAN about mental health budgeting and [NAME OTHER] from [DEIDENTIFIED] doesn't have a clue about psychiatry.  He wants to know, well what does stress - what in fact does stress have on this and why are people, so many people are taking medication and some of it is just to get them through the rough spots.  He has no clue that these are neurological illnesses.  Absolutely none.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the neurodegenerative illnesses if not treated, and they're greatly worsened by stress.  Some of which is imposed by the federal government -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the insurance company.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You hang in there -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'll see you in three weeks. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And thanks very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I think your strategy for programming the phone is brilliant to remind you about appointments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, my God.  I, look at this.  It's an encyclopedia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not at all.  Actually -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yours is one of the thinner ones for someone who's been here as long.  Lots of other people's have been thinned down -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they can put on microfilm, so.  No, this isn't bad at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it has to do with the agency generates paperwork.  I mean, as you know, there's so much oversight now of medicine and especially mental health, and some of the problems locally, and so there's a lot.  To me it's repetitive.  Sometimes I'll fill out what seems like the same form three or four times for the same visit.  But, you know, hopefully it's helping somewhere.  But don't, don't think that the paper means anything.  Don't worry about that.  So well, how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since my cat died, I'm just not the same really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I was thinking of you recently.  My cat got diagnosed with severe hyperthyroidism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, my.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She had lost a lot weight, um, and she needs to start taking medication.  Um, so sometimes they do develop a condition pretty quickly.  And, uh, yours, I think, had like a dental abscess or problem, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I spent all that money getting teeth cleaned and getting everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think he did a, the job right, because he kept pushing this tooth.  It was still -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Infected.  I think she died from that.  I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it broke in half.  I miss her.  And my other cat is, like, lost.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So and it's depressing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would you consider a new addition to the family?  There's nothing like a kitten to perk everybody up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I don't know how he'd react.  And I'd hate to make the commitment and then have to, you know, I know instantly I'd fall in love with a kitten.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't want to make the commitment, and then he's not happy, and then have to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wonder if there's a setting where you could test drive?  You know, like if there is, like if there were a situation where somebody -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do know a lot of people -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Might have them up for adoption, and maybe they could bring it over and see how they do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do know a lot of people that are in [DEIDENTIFIED] and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] is such an animal lover.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I can see why.  You know, you want to be fair to the cat that's left.  But the cat that's left, may feel kind of like how you do, like, "Oh, I miss the company," you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He, oh, he definitely does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not that anybody fills the shoes, but you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he's always looking at my, my roommate's room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she was always in his room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're so cute.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll go, "Oh, I love you," and he'll be looking like, "Is she coming?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Still.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This article was amazing I was reading about how they know how they really feel, and they have humor, and they have this.  And they took, they didn't really explain it, they just told some areas and said, "You decide."  And they were amazing.  And my cat is funny.  I was thinking about, just last week, he was real, he was, I don't know, uh, he did something and I, I didn't want him to do it.  And I'm like, "No."  And I never yell at him.  And I really yelled at him.  He was just getting on my nerves.  He was just, I was irritable.  And when I went near him, he slapped me.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Isn't that amazing how they sometimes will do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He slapped me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "Oh, my God.  He slapped me."  [LAUGHING].  I went by and, like, shhsh.  I'm like, I never yell at him, you know, he's usually all sweet and cuddly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He slapped me.  And it reminded me that months before, when she was alive, he did that one time, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I went walked, um, by him after yelling at them, after yelling at both of them.  And he slapped me, and I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I whacked him back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He told you what he thought about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Isn't that funny?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "Oh, my God."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I yell, really yell, I'm, I never yell.  But I was loud.  [LAUGHING].  And then I walked by him, he goes shhsh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He told me what he thought.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, they're amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well since you have friends in [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, I bet there's someone who's willing to bring one over, and just see how they do.  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it takes pressure off you, too, to say, "You know, if it's not this one, we'll probably find another one."  You know, from somewhere.  You know, this is the right way to go about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he was like running, and hopping and skipping and stuff before.  Now he's just laying like an old cat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sad.  He's the one with the crooked neck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he, he's a little mental, I mean, he really is, but he's such a love fuzz ball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.  They're such good company.  I have a friend whose dogs, um, she live down in Texas, her dogs got loose, and um, got into a chicken coop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And a farmer shot them both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One died.  The other one survived.  It's been a difficult course.  But she just got a puppy and they both just really brightened up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, the new dog was, uh, the older dog was very receptive to, you know, it's like the cheerfulness of having a baby around when, you know, someone in the family has died, or whatever.  But, you know, you could probably test drive.  [LAUGHING].  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I can tell there's something missing.  Yeah.  I can tell you feel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's weird.  It really, I always have just one of my legs going the one way, I mean, it, I just, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's weird, and he's not the same, either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And that's so sad.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, um, [NAME OTHER] on Thursday, my boyfriend, he went out and there was a cat walking around, and it ended up, and it was knocking into things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Found out the cat was blind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, poor baby.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he left food out for it, and the neighbor, finally they found the cat and put a note on his door, "Thanks for the food," because otherwise he probably -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who knows if he would have hung around or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he said, he was telling me, "It's walking into things."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Poor baby.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It just couldn't see.  And you know how usually -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You, your, an animal will look up at you.  It didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was so sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He might be deaf, too.  I don't know, if he didn't respond to noise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Because he was following noise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was following the noise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it can at least do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But anyway, the owners found him, she said she was crying.  He told me she was crying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Good.  Well I'm glad somebody is taking care of him.  Do you ever watch the Cold Case series?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Don't you love the cats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I love the cats.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tripod and Cyclops.  [LAUGHING].  That's what one boyfriend called them.  He didn't last long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the studies, like just about, do you just talk normal about stuff, or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, you know, they would, they would, you know, give feedback, possibly about, you know, it might have been possible to ask more in this area about depression, or whatever.  Or follow up on such and such, you know, but, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But they cannot release the information to anybody else at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Well, you know, I have been a little, feeling a lot more depressed lately.  I don't if it's because of what's, uh, it's since it happened.  And I wonder if, you know, my medicine needs to be adjusted or, I mean, it's been this way for a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might want to talk about that.  Exactly.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've really, I've been, I mean, today I did get dressed and did my hair and make-up, but it's, some days I'm like, "Oh, I don't even care."  I, I mean I just throw stuff on, and I'm usually not like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's just like this past 6 months have not been that great mentally for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel like there's sort of a seasonal piece to it, too?  Like you're usually more down in the winter, or at the change of seasons, or it could be any time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Randomly, honestly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like it was really, winter I was, yeah.  And I think maybe because of her, and I felt so bad.  I look at him and he's not the same.  And, it, really, I don't know why, I've been, I've been not the same.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And this could be more severe than some other bereavement that you've had.  Because you've lost two pets before, right.  And this one seems like it's really get, hard to, you know, I'm saying move on with the bereavement process.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not that you get over -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She was young.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well not young, but, you know, animals usually live 16, 17, and like that.  She was only 10.  And I thought there was at least six, seven more years.  It's the youngest -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she wasn't sickly.  Well she wasn't real, real healthy, but she wasn't sick.  And so she was, like, very nervous until she was with me about year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she, then she knew she was loved.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she really calmed down.  And, well sh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like she had a pretty good 10 years.  That's a pretty good track records.  But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> While she dying then she stayed in my bed -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Day and night, night and day, until she did not leave on.  I fed her there.  She was sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.  She had a bad infection, it sounds like.  Just a very, maybe more widespread than the doctor recognized initially.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, the sad thing to me is, uh, I, I don't, I don't know if it could have been avoided.  I don't know.  I don't even want to think about it.  It's go, let's go on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you did everything you could.  It sounds like that.  You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everything that a person knows how to do.  But, yeah, I am hearing that this is really hanging over you.  Yeah.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel like the depression is so bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a while it was just like, fine, and that lately, since this happened, it's like, the stress, I don't know what, but I just, I don't, I don't know, I'm thinking even medicine, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think maybe at least the medicine that you're taking, those are pretty robust doses.  But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, the Wellbutrin, I haven't been taking the extra, just the 200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he gave me the 100s, and they're, like, a horrible color, and I don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're like a brownish-orange, and I'm thinking that's got to be some kind of dangerous dye, or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  I'm so glad that you said something.  I had no idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're horrible.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And different generic manufacturers will sometimes manufacture different, you know, a different color, whatever.  Uh, well I was thinking anyway, given that you're on the Zoloft at 200, um, and the Wellbutrin, it's the sustained release, you've been taking 300 for a long time, and now I know you didn't add the 100 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So at least you told me.  And that's been a while.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because I suggested adding that a while ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every time he gave it to me, I'm like, "Ew, I'm not taking that."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Oh I wish you'd told me sooner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, um, what's worth doing anyway, [PATIENT NAME], is changing from the SR to the XL.  I was just talking with somebody else about this.  It's generic now, so it should be just as inexpensive, I hope.  Um, and it's a more extended release.  It's a smaller pill.  To my knowledge, they're always white, for one thing, dye free.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and um, with that, you can take two or three of the 150s a day.  Because it's longer extended release, there's less risk of lowering the seizure threshold, which was one of the original concerns about the short-acting Wellbutrin.  So people will sometimes take 450.  And with the SR, I had suggested going up to 400, which was thought to be more or less the maximal dose of that.  But if I wrote for the XL for you what you could do is, I could write for three a day, and then you could start with two, and then you can see.  Because Wellbutrin XL 300 do better by me than -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The SR 150, which might have been metabolized faster by your system, or out of your system faster.  If you say, "Well, it's more of the same," then you could just add the third.  And you don't have to pay for an extra prescription, or additional pill, or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's funny, because I have noticed from day to day, like when I, I feel really, and then I'll take the pill, it does lift me up a little bit.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I didn't realize it wore off that quickly, but, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, with  your particular metabolism it might.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And even with the XL, you could take that twice a day, still.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, if you're, if you might be someone who someone who -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well the other one I took it in the morning, because if I took it, I, in, later on I couldn't sleep from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  Exactly.  It's finding that balance with where it's helping give some energy and possibly, like if you have concerns with focus and concentration, you know, if it's helping with that, as well, um, but not interfering with your sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So yeah.  Why don't we try the XLs, up to three a day.  And that way you don't have to worry about adding another ugly, [LAUGHING], since the third one might something unpalatable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's purplish brown.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're kidding.  I wonder why they do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, but I s, I had actually two bottles of it I should, if you want me to bring it in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You could give it to someone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can always find a home for them, because I mean, I do, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll definitely bring them in, because the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know they're expensive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they're ug, and I'm like, "I'm not taking this."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's too bad.  I have never heard that report.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll have to bring them in.  I'll bring them, I'll give you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Next time I have to remember.  I'll probably put it in my phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's really helpful to hear, too.  Because, you know, unless I have direct experience, I wouldn't even know.  But that that could be a turn-off to somebody, it's important to know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know all those dyes and stuff you hear the stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know I haven't been ar, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "I don't want to take" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I hadn't thought about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought, you know, I take enough pills, I don't want to have to take dyes, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.  Exactly.  And what's nice about the XL, is, you know, if you want to add the third, you can add the third, you know, that's an approved dose.  But you may get more mileage just out of the two every day.  And that way you get a little extra from every prescription -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To tide you over, and that's okay, too.  So does, do you feel comfortable starting there.  I have other ideas, too, with what we could add, if we, you know, if it's, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That doesn't pan out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wouldn't mind trying that.  Actually, I, I feel safer with the same medicine, than to start something new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know that historically, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, that sounds like the way to go for now.  Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Try that, because I, I have been feeling down, and I'm like, "This isn't right.  I shouldn't feel this down."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a more complicated bereavement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And getting out of bed, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You are grieving, but there's some strong elements of the depression recurring, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Well we'll just, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There isn't any time, I mean, I've been on this medicine a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is like the worst -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you and I have worked together for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I haven't seen you this down in a very, very long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there are brighter days ahead.  You're always going to miss the one you lost.  Um, but you'll cherish that memory and you'll find new ones to love, and, that you, especially something so unexpected, that take a lot of getting used to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I didn't think she was going to die.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's, uh, sweet.  She's so sweet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She had a good life, huh?  I think, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The part of her life with you is better than most cats ever dream of.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true.  I think that to myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be like, and I think, "Oh, but I could have been, done better."  Because [INAUDIBLE] demanded the attention, and it took away from her.  But she was happy.  She was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I bet she loved watching you two, also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, that's the funny thing, too.  Cats have a certain spectator ness about them, so even if you were paying attention to the other one, they say, "Well that's really interesting."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She would come in, we'd go and, and, like, uh, pounce on her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "Get off of her."  Because he's like twice her size.  I'm like, "Get off of her."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was he a little jealous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very jealous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Rival for your affection.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But she, she squeaked.  She went, "Rrrr."  Like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they're so, I love it when they talk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I, I, I go, "Get off of her."  And then a co, a co, you know what, she would a lot of times play me, because she would start with him and didn't think I'd see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then look at me crying, so I would yell at him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yes.  That's good parenting training, you know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So funny.  So funny.  I'm like, "You know what?  You're playing me, girlfriend."  That's what I'm saying to my, she'd start it, and she didn't think I see.  And then she'd look at me like, "Look, look what he's doing."  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They are amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They are amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mine can just be, uh, looking like she's napping on the counter, and then I'll go to walk by, and she'll stick out her paw.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, "What's the password?"  You know, like, uh, "You're not going to get away without paying attention to me.  Even if I'm sleeping, I want you to pay attention to me."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, aren't they something else?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really funny.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Aren't they something else?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're a hoot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know it's bad when they start slapping you back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that is, I have to admit -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just yelled, I mean, I didn't hit him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a little unusual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He slapped me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like, "You slapped me."  I went by him after I yelled at  him, he went shhsh.  [LAUGHING].  They're amazing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is a hoot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now in this, uh, magazine in the, in the office, I mean in the waiting room, there's a man in there telling these stories about animals.  What they do with the cops, and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just amazing things.  And they said, "Do they think?"  And do they, you know, they're so much like us, we don't even realize.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, they, they're probably a lot smarter than people are.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, who caused pollution, you know?  Probably not animals.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know it.  And then, [COUGHING], they said a story about this pig that, uh, it's job helping, um, helping, um, handicapped children or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Run all the way to get to his work one morning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, in there they said that after that he could never eat pig, which was his favorite meat, from reading that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said that was his favorite meat, but after he saw that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could see becoming vegetarian.  You know that I would, but I'd really miss the chicken and poultry, I mean, chicken and fish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I can certainly understand that, too.  So I'll be writing for the Wellbutrin XL three daily.  All right, start with two, just see.  Maybe this sits better, make sure your sleep is okay.  So forth and so on.  You know, if you feel like you need the additional, it's there.  If not, you're just a little bit ahead for next month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to make a follow up appointment for the usual time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And then if you decide you want to come back sooner, just call [NAME OTHER].  It's all right, we've got some room to work with.  So that's good.  All right.  Look those over.  See if it makes, makes sense.  I want to get your pharmacist's attention that it's not the exact same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, what's this last one mg?  Xanax, is that's 30, not 60?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Should it be 60?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Dispense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] take twice a day.  All right, got you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin Extended -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's right.  Yep, as of the beginning of the year, that's right.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Take that daily.  Hopefully, I'll have to remember to bring in those other ones, because they're sitting there.  And I heard someone say their prescriptions are like over $100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They can be sometimes.  Even for generics if the person doesn't have, um, you know, a payment plan or coverage.  Yeah.  So you know, I do recycle medications.  Even samples where a place that I work are throwing them out, because they consider them expired, you know, when it gets that month.  You know, and if people say they can't get their medication, I'll say, you know, "This one is about to go."  You know, in, and, it's available.  You know, I think if you keep them in a cool, dry place they stay good for a while.  Um, so sometimes people make that option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> These aren't even that old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When they were normal, I, I took them.  And then they stopped being normal, and I stopped taking them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which must mean that your, um, pharmacy changed generic manufacturers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's really strange.  One time, um, I should actually tell you since you're on, uh, generic Zoloft.  One time I had a patient who really noticed a big difference between one kind of generic Zoloft and another kind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And she remembered when and where she got the one that worked better.  But, of course, it didn't stick on her mind what was the name of the company.  Whoever looks at that anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But sometimes it's on the bottle, but unless you happen to keep the bottle.  It turned out that it was actually her prescription coverage company that was able to track down the one that was good, and then find another pharmacy that had that same kind now, that was close to where she lived -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which was amazing.  Because I think her pharmacy changed -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Providers as well, and then she just said, "It just doesn't work as well."  You know, and generics can vary by as much as 20% from the original in terms of potency.  So it could be 20% more or 20% less than the original brand, and then if you're changing generics, that could mean a 40% difference, if you went from one that was 20% less to one that was 20% more than the original.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's, could be, actually leg, 20% off of what -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stronger or less than the brand had been.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, man.  Generics?  All generics?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So I do think, though, for good business practices they try to get it as close as possible to the original brand name, but I guess some, uh, some are easier, some types of chemicals are easier to do that with than others, or some types of molecules.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] costs and everything?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And, actually believe it or not, the other one I hear it the most about is Wellbutrin, bupropion, or Budeprion.  But there can be a big variability.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it certainly is, looking at, you know, what you, the generic extended release that your pharmacy carries -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It may just go a, a lot more of a long way than the SR.  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he changed, so maybe he stocks it different too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well the other ones were white, but he, I do, think my Zoloft was changed to generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was blue, and now it's tan.  He did change it, my Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.  I didn't even think about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So maybe, you know, once we, once we are in a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We'll see which is which.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin situation, we can also look at the Zoloft situation, and see if that's, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.  I would never have even thought that in a million years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did change it.  Oh, wow.  And it does, see it really does affect you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought it was me.  I thought it was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it can make a difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, because I definitely ran across that with another patient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's, I, I wouldn't have even thought of that.  You know, I think that they're the same, but, wow, that's something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's totally different now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now, it was 10, but they are like, more oblong looking now than they were before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's got to be a different generic.  Yeah.  And some of them are round.  Some of the Zolofts I know are round.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.  I should ask the, I wonder if that was since December?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's worth looking at, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I know, I mean, after that happened with her, it got me in a depression, but I haven't really come out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I, I function, I do what I have to, but not where I have days where I feel good, because I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if the brand changed, you know, well you might not be getting the support you were used to getting from your medication.  It's a possibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So we've got some things we can follow up on then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Try to get back to some -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I knew I had to speak to you about this, because I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I'm glad.  I'm really glad you made it in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really wasn't feeling like myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And for me, usually I, I'm aware, even though she doesn't call me.  Like if she doesn't here and there, I still make it.  This is the first time I've really missed.  Ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Oh, and it's not counting against you or anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, you're a good, you know, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, I think that, I don't know, I, I called her.  I went, "Do I have an appointment today?"  I just totally, usually I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was in the back of your mind.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was like 15 minutes before I was to show, I'm like, "You know, I'm going to have to reschedule."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well now you're smart to put it into your phone.  Yeah.  I'm glad you came when you did.  You know I appreciate it, it's, you know, it's the last part of the day, we took a little bit of extra time.  I'm glad we had it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, you know, I think we needed to get into some real detail on this, but I appreciate you being very patient about that.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Well thanks again for participating.  I'll let you know what results I might be able to share, and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are there results?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think they're going to have, you know, like, feedback about communication and whatever, so, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'd kind of like to know, it would be interesting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you, there's also a, and I'm sure, if you ever want to participate, it's totally up to you.  And you can even decide later.  If you wanted to participate in the follow-up study.  Like sometimes they'll pay.  You know, maybe one area I can tell you of, of interest, especially to pharmaceutical companies, is treatment-resistant depression.  You know, where someone is, you know, they've been treated for a while.  Maybe their medication isn't working as well, or if they need to make a change or add something.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would definitely do one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  There's a place here where you can put your contact info.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Right there, it says "Additionally," by checking this box, then you could, uh, contact with additional questions and if you choose to participate in follow up meetings, you would be paid a fee in connection with, um, the study.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  If you would prefer e-mail or telephone, you can put that information down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes a source of a little extra income is helpful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm sorry about missing the appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'm glad you made it.  The important thing is, you know, and, and this way we got a little extra time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was very needed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it sounds like we probably needed it actually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had to come and see -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was just, this was really, had me worried, because I had [INAUDIBLE], so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I never related it to him changing that medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pos, that could be a part of the picture, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's got to be some of it, anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could be a piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm really glad you, that I could see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's really because patients tell me that I know there is a difference, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I didn't really, it's, it's, I'm glad you told me because I didn't associate it like that.  I think generics are, they have to be this, they have to be that, they can't be that far off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And most of the time they are pretty close, but a few I've been hearing, and you know, and in my particular field, there can be big differences.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's, he changes a lot, too, different medicines.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he's probably just trying to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just wonder if -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, for the economy, and another generic manufacturer comes along and says, "Hey, I'll sell you for, you know, $5 less a month," or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean for, like, um, simvastatin also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's changing it a lot, a lot.  And then he gave me the one, one time, I, every time I took it, I thought I was going to pass out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told my doctor, he said just stop taking it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  There might have been some ingredient that just didn't agree with you, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well on the commercial it says if weakness or, it could be stop, discontinue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was weird.  I'm like, "What's wrong with me?  Is it my blood sugar or something?"  But I stopped taking it, and it went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm glad you talked to your doctor about it.  Yeah, anything that doesn't seem right, you know, we can get to the bottom of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Horrible.  Like I broke out in a sweat, and I just felt like I was going to faint.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm thinking, you know, and, you know, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You reacted to something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Huh.  Okay.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's good to see you.  Brighter days ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it just?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can leave that for [NAME OTHER] if you want her to contact you, or give her a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, either way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good to see you.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You too.  Bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bye-bye.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I have had great success in the past doing this. I mean, I've gotten a couple loans out of it but I've kind of got away from asking for mortgage people, E&G (ph). You know, you ask for a referral each week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT And, you know, I ask more for realtors and a lot of the other work I do. And, um, I don't know why—I mean I think part of it is out of the frustration of meeting with these people and getting nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've got to do something. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe if I approach my meetings differently with these people and say, "Hey, throw me a loan. Just one loan."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what they say to do in the marketing materials I get from the title company.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They say to call up all your clients and ask them for just one loan, just send me one loan. And of course I've probably got one phone call to make. (laughs) But he has a couple of closings from this week which at least gets me into —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the titles for? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No they're actual closings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that will get me into November.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least, early December, with some closings. I had trouble getting work done this week. Been sleeping a lot. [00:02:03]</p>

<p>Doing a bit of—well, didn't go to practice on Friday. It was cancelled on Tuesday. Didn't ride my bike here. Getting kind of sloppy. I've been doing my exercises though; my squats, no burpees. I don't think I can remember how to do a burpee but I'm sure they're on the YouTube.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long do you spend doing the squats and stuff? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, doesn't really take that long –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. They look pretty intense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Squats I do 30, 30, and try to do another 30. Sometimes I do more than 30. And then the pushups, I do like 10, 10, and try to squeeze out 10. So it doesn't take that long. I don't take a lot of breaks in between. And so, less than 15 minutes. </p>

<p>But it's, um, you really feel like you've had a good workout. [00:03:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. That's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've noticed a difference, at least, not so much in my legs because they're already somewhat muscular, but in my arms. And running, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know how much I'm really getting out of biking, other than the long trips, you know, but I don't think it's as good an exercise at the speed I go as it could be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I tell you, though, a few burpees would help your cardio.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell you—I'm heavy breathing when I'm done with these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really? Oh, okay. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Get a little cardio in there. And, um, cause I try and just bang them out. And um I think the pushups—there's like certain positions in yoga where it doesn't seem like you're doing a cardio workout but you finish it, you're like breathing heavy. [00:4:04]</p>

<p>I think the pushups kinda are the same thing. It's not like you're doing a crazy running but just the basic position of it. It's a good cardio workout. So, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still haven't bought the insanity tapes yet. Still eating too much. Trying to decide today whether I go—I've got work to do which I'm going to blow off cause that's what I do. Um, but I've got to go test-drive some cars.</p>

<p>The guy was suggesting that I couldn't be on title because of my credit score, which doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you say couldn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could not, yeah—which kind of screws everything up cause then I couldn't get resident parking if I'm not on the registration. So hopefully he's wrong in that regard. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's kind of a sloppy fellow, and he's got to read real close. Seems like he's been doing this for a long time. He knows his shit—like, he knows everything about the 2004. I mean, I know he knows that I have one so maybe he quickly did his homework, I don't know, but he really knows the ins and outs of these cars.</p>

<p>He's not some young kid, just, you know. So (pause for .03 seconds) and that's the car I want anyways, irrespective of what it has or doesn't have. It has the all-wheel drive, and the wagon –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me it's more practical. The gas mileage is slightly better than the car I have. [00:05:57]</p>

<p>And, um, Ian and Lucille will be happy with it. I think Ian is just excited for a new car. Lucille—she's not a big fan of my car. She hasn't—I haven't put her in the car since the daycare incident where she just cried for 15 minutes in the driveway, "Mama! Mama! Mama!". But she's been better, you know, at least interacting with me since then. (.04 second pause)</p>

<p>Isn't supposed to rain today? I thought we were supposed to get —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ah, I kind of wish we'd have soccer practice just so I could see the kids. If it's cancelled maybe I'll go over there, or Ian could come over and spend the night. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds nice. [06:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We've got a game on Sunday. One of the guys who goes—his dad goes more often—he plays all kinds (ph) of sports so he's off playing tournaments. He used to work in the sub shop so once a year he does steak bombs (ph) and he does just like a tremendous job. It's like the shaved meat—just really like a professional.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So hopefully, that's what I voted for on Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which would be nice. But the woman I'm taking is just starting to back out on me, which is just like—uh, I hate trying to find people cause it's expensive. You invite people and they're like, "Yeah! That sounds great." And you're like, "Oh it's $117 per ticket, probably another $10 for parking, and then another $15, $20 for food. And if you want a beer inside the stadium that's 11 bucks." You know. [00:08:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People are all of a sudden like, "Well, maybe I don't need to go." So, (.05 second pause) but she kind of suggested she could work around it. I feel bad making her pay for her ticket if she didn't go. Only doctors do that.</p>

<p>My prescriber gave me a heads-up that –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did she do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She was going to charge me—nice. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can hardly give 24 hours notice when I don't have it in my phone. I thought she'd be more cognizant of when my appointments with her are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you mind texting me her number? I actually, I heard that you had—what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't want you two talking about me. [00:08:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She asks about you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if she's single or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (laughing) that wasn't actually what I had in mind. (laughs) No, I mean, honestly my question—you've had a very good experience with her and I've been impressed with how conscientious she's been about following you closely and really rearranging your medication in a way that's been very helpful. I have someone else who I would be referring to her for a consult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (.06 second pause) Yeah, she likes the med stuff. She really gets kind of excited about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's a nurse practitioner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's got a bunch of letters after her name. Wait a second—I don't want to send you your information—(pause for .22 seconds). It's on its' way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's easy when someone has an iPhone. You can just share the contact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to not talk with her about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm completely indifferent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever you think. I'll leave it to your professional judgment. Don't tell me how to close loans, I won't tell you how to—as much as I tell you about doing your job. [00:11:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughing) In this particular case? Should I do what I think is best?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just cause I tell you what you—you know how to do your job—it doesn't mean I really think that I should do your job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I have your permission to talk to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do you need it written?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can send her an e-mail or text message that says, "Ethan said it was okay to talk to her." (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:11:29) put a piece of paper in front of me to sign. I'm not going to proactively (pause for .04 seconds) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'll send you an e-mail and you can write that on it. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that'll work. It's just I've got all these things like that, you know, that I've got to do—little e-mails I've got to send out and stuff. I can't keep track of it all and I'm not using reminders or calendars (ph) like I really should be doing, you know. [00:12:03] (pause for .06 seconds) </p>

<p>Since I got all my titles done in the early part of the week I feel like I've got (pause for .04 seconds) some free time. Do you know where the closest Toyota dealer is? Is there one in the area?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's one right by here. Is that a Toyota dealer? You know where I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's a Honda dealer. But I may be looking for both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good idea (pause for .04 seconds) cause I want to go to that one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's kind of like silly. I was just going to lie to my dad and say I test-drove the cars and I want the Subaru, you know. Subaru seems to have better cargo layout for my needs, you know. [00:13:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, you know for soccer, carrying around soccer balls, and the actual bench is kind of wide so you can make it a little more—I don't know. </p>

<p>(pause for .04 seconds) It seemed like—I don't know if I told you that my dad was going to, he was going to pay the monthly amount and then have me pay a smaller amount.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, um, I kind of got the impression that's what he was going to do. What that number is—I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that I had one more contacts in the new business with any sort of regularity, you know. (ph) [00:14:01]</p>

<p>Now that makes such a huge difference for me. (pause for .05 seconds) I've got a couple of closings in the middle of October, which I'll be paid well on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'll have another re-fi (ph) sometime in October. Then I've got these two new closings so hopefully I can survive into November. Just all this shit, you know. I got the Comcast, I got to pay (inaudible at 00:14:37), I got to pay this company, that company. I owe like 1800 bucks on my website. </p>

<p>Just, always in the hole. (pause for .07 seconds). Will I be out of the hole one of these days?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope so. [00:15:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .05 seconds) I'd hate to run into you in the Square with my sign, you know—homeless family man. (pause for .06 seconds) My rent's going to be going down a little bit, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At home or at work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cause they're going to be doing some construction –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's right. You mentioned that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause for .06 seconds) that'll make things a little easier on me. A little extra spending money—actually I would use it to catch up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Try and catch up. That way I can just fall behind again. (sighs) [00:16:03]</p>

<p>I'm falling into this pattern where on Fridays I've got this sense of relief, you know. (pause for .04 seconds)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause for .07 seconds) Yeah, you seem a bit more kind of relaxed and upbeat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't be so sure about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) (pause for .05 seconds) I was getting ahead of myself, ahead of this thing. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's like yesterday I was supposed to go to the office and I just went by and picked up stuff to do work, and I got home and actually was just kind of bored that I did work out of boredom, you know. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, it was like eight o'clock and I just lay down on the couch, and I haven't been laying down on the couch watching tv and there was nothing really exciting. Well, I like 'Person of Interest' and I fell asleep watching that. I don't know—I keep telling myself that I'm going to come home and take a nap, and it never happens.</p>

<p>I wake up on the couch at like one or two o'clock in the morning. Forgot my medication that keeps me somewhat regular, so I woke up to (inaudible at 00:17:49) this morning. My bowels were like, grrr, so I have a problem with that. [00:17:58] </p>

<p>I'll actually say to myself, "Take your medicine." I actually sort of balance. "Well you know you'll have trouble in the morning so take your medicine now." It's a powder that I have to mix up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, I, um, they removed 18 inches of my intestines when I was in my early 20's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cause of the Crohn's?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Crohn's Disease, yeah. And the area they took out absorbs bile salts, so I don't absorb bile salts which, um, causes just irritation in my intestines and so I take medication that absorbs bile salts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the side effect is you absorb cholesterol. Cholesterol binds to bile salts and that's how you absorb it. You don't absorb cholesterol directly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [00:18:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this is a cholesterol medication. So I have excellent cholesterol. My triglycerides aren't that good. I have very low cholesterol. It's kind of a pain in the ass to take this medicine all the time. It seems like I'm kind of—I imagine I probably could try and suffer through a couple of weeks of getting my intestines used to the bile salts but I don't know. It just wears you out. (pause for .07 seconds)</p>

<p>I can't remember if I ended up taking—yeah, I think I did take it. (pause for .20 seconds) (heavy sigh) (pause for .05 seconds) Big plans for the weekend?</p>

<p>(pause for .10 seconds) Do any of your other patients ask about your personal life?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you give them that shit-eating grin or—?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) It varies. Occasionally I'll give a snide answer. Bigger than usual you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) (pause for .08 seconds) Ah, but the guy called me from Subaru so he's going to keep on top of me, which I guess is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'd like to get those test-drives out of the way and I can say to my dad –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I'm looking forward to the most out of having a new car?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having a radio. I don't need the air conditioning anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You mean, like up until next spring or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And, um, I mean it will be nice not seeing the check light on, and worrying about this —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that and the other. So, uh, it'll be a couple of years of not worrying about the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm, yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (yawns) And so maybe by then—went to a seminar from the title company and this new consumer finance protection bureau is trying to re-do how mortgages are done and closed. The proposed rules leave it up to the lender as to whether the lender will do the closing or they'll have the vendor do the closing. And, um, I think in the state, just the way the court cases have come down they're going to have to use agents. [00:22:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Does that mean you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm an agent. So here, title agents have to be attorneys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—shocker, that the one thing that they haven't looked at to solve the problem of all these mortgages gone awry, you know—as bad as things have been they haven't been as bad in this state because we have attorneys who do the closings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas in other states it's just the title company, you know, and, um —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So somebody who doesn't know what they're doing. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. There's typically an attorney involved and so it's harder for the lender to, you know, to get an attorney to do something that they shouldn't be doing—although many of them have done it. It's not like we've been immune from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I got to sort of hope for the lobby groups to back up my interest and keep me with a job. My buddy who does real estate and personal injuries is like, "Oh I gotta start doing more personal injury."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So I don't know. I think it'll be a while before this thing's implemented but –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It could make the decision for me on whether I have to find another area of the law to practice or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might just get a job at the coffee shop. How much do you think that pays? I can't be making much less than I'm making now, you know. I've started to make a little more this year, since June, but when you consider the benefits—[00:24:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .08 seconds) You mention right at the beginning that you kind of stopped reaching out to lenders, but that if you did, and did it in a somewhat different way that could make a difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you sort of slipped that in there but that actually sounds like it could kind of be a big deal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could use E&G (ph) more for lending. I was so caught up in being president that I didn't think so much about using E&G (ph) to grow my business. And, um, (pause for .07 seconds) we'll see. Just the rejection sucks. [00:25:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know you meet with people and then they find some reason, you know –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're polite about it, but (pause for .06 seconds) (yawns) (pause for .03 seconds) I'm overtired. (pause for .26 seconds; during which there is the sound of a whistle at 00:25:29], [00:25:32], [00:25:34]; inaudible voices at 00:25:39) [00:25:47]</p>

<p>Sounds like there's conflict in the street. (pause for .03 seconds) That guy needs to be in therapy. Either that or he's helping to fix the (inaudible at 25:59) and that's not going to do it. </p>

<p>Guy honking, could be a girl honking. After that first honk, does it really—it's for self-gratification, cause once I hear you honk, I know you're there and you're upset, but the people who keep honking—eeh, eeh, eeh, you know, it's for their own personal —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .05 seconds) I'm smiling because, um, this seems to be a sign of your good mood. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's Friday, I'm lucky. We even have camp so I can go hang out with the kids, so –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never really—the games are okay cause it's a more controlled environment, where the actual practices are, um, I'm in charge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:27:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's high-stress with Ian not always behaving, and (pause for .03 seconds) a couple of kids who never behave or listen, and, you know, it's hard to keep things moving. Some kids just run around and do whatever they want. Their parents could care less; they're just off on the sideline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which bothers me about Jess; she's never paying attention to what Ian is doing, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, I need help. I need them to follow directions, and I can't parent and coach. That's the hard part she doesn't get. [00:28:03] (pause for .47 seconds)</p>

<p>Do you think my good mood could be the medicine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I'm on enough Prozac to truly make a difference. [00:29:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean the medicine hasn't changed in the last week, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, the Lamictal which is the mood stabilizer went up to a hundred, so that's probably working.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be that. The other thing is, uh, (pause for .03 seconds) you've got a bunch of sort of good stuff going on. You've got some closings, the new car –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Trying to decide what color to get.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I might get the silver because I've noticed that people have trouble seeing my white car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've heard that studies have been done that green and blue are difficult colors to see in cars. It's kind of an off-silver, it's not really like a bright silver, it's a darker silver.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:30:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mix things up a little bit. Sorry for cutting you off. (pause for .03 seconds) These are my problems these days. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Right, yeah, so maybe that is affecting your mood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .04 seconds) So once I get the car and all these closings go away, I'm going to be bitter and depressed again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .03 seconds) I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .03 seconds) Well you're no help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .04 seconds) Um, more closings—I mean, again, I think for you (pause for .03 seconds) a lot of the way you talk about how things are going well or badly, is by how much is coming in or how much good stuff you are or aren't getting. [00:31:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .03 seconds) I'm too tired. I fall asleep so I don't think about loneliness as much as I have been just cause I'm out like a light. I don't know why I'm so tired. I don't know if I've got something, like a bug or –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's all the exercise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's all the exercising.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't really done anything this week other than my squats and pushups, and I totally didn't feel motivated to ride my bike this morning, which was unusual. [00:31:47] </p>

<p>(pause for .34 seconds) I wonder if the Abilify has anything to do with it. It's hard to get kind of a straight answer from my prescriber about what that's ultimately helping. She seemed to suggest that it amplifies the Lamictal –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where I thought it would work more with the Wellbutrin or the—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she seems to suggest she can't understand how I would be depressed on the amount of Wellbutrin I'm taking. [00:32:56]</p>

<p>(pause for .06 seconds) I would think that—I cut back on Trilafon as well, to four milligrams a day, just taking that at night. (pause for .06 seconds) So I'm slowly winding down and Trileptal, I'm taking half this week. Next week, half of a half, and then I think every other day after that—I'm not sure. I'll probably have to call her and figure out what I'm supposed to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If she ever calls me back. (pause for .10 seconds) Do I get a referral fee? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. But I do appreciate it. [00:34:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) That's nice. Lawyers would get referral fees.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not all lawyers do it, but like personal injury.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I referred a friend to a personal injury guy, and uh –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he paid you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He'll pay me a percentage of his fee, which he's going for the whole policy which would be $100,000 which means he would pull in—if he does a third it's $33,000. He may have done less, I don't know. Then I don't know if he'd pay me between 20 and a third of what he makes. So I could end up making a big chunk of money, which would be nice. [00:35:00]</p>

<p>[00:35:05] [sound of telephone rings]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .04 seconds) Yeah, I know among psychologists you actually can't do that kind of stuff. I don't know how it would work across professions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Technically you're supposed to tell your client that you're doing it, and you're supposed to do some comparable work –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it doesn't really work that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sent some business to my labor attorney and he gave me some cash. So now, I don't know. He may have some stuff lined up for me. He always seems to have something going on, but people don't seem to want to go forward. Like the market up North–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. (inaudible at 00:35:58)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I haven't heard anything. But I imagine at some point they probably will—it sounds like they need to. [00:36:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be nice. (pause for .48 seconds) I bite my fingernails. Not out of –</p>

<p>[00:37:06] [sound of telephone rings]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Any sort of, um, anxiety or anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You got to keep them short for practice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm always trimming them and I don't always have a proper trimmer on me (ph), so (pause for .06 seconds) Do you have nail-biters?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would suck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like, to be an anxious nail-biter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had a friend in elementary school who chewed his nails, and they were always putting stuff on his fingers to stop him from eating them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. I've done that. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like something you would do to a dog. You know, spray something so they'd stop being bad. [00:38:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. (pause for .05 seconds) What's it feel like today (ph), when you're feeling a bit better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .04 seconds) Well, it's, unless something work-related comes along to ruin my day. I've got to get out and at least test-drive one car today, I've just got to do it cause I'm not going to do it tomorrow, Saturday. I went on a Saturday and it took forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cause it was more crowded?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, (pause for .10 seconds) probably could go straight from here. (pause for .05 seconds) Not too far away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to drive? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh? [00:39:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you going to test-drive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever's over on that lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honda, or the CRV, or the Rav 4.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which probably both have better gas mileage than the Subaru.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you looking at all-wheel drive or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are all-wheel drive. You can't get them front-wheel drive, which I would get. Um, but um, I don't know, I'm just assuming. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you're just higher up, you know, it's not like, the car's shorter. I don't think it's as wide. It's like, here's the back seat and here's the rear of the car—there's not a lot of cargo room unless you put the seats down or take the seats out or however it works; where you have a lot of room with the seats in this one. But I'll check them out, drive them. [00:40:03]</p>

<p>Cars drive—I don't, I never really—you know, other than fast versus slow –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't make a difference to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To the cornering, the handling. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) And I'll drive the slow car, I don't care. So, they're usually cheaper. I think these are all four cylinder cars. They're probably about the same.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 160-something horse power (pause for .04 seconds) which is not bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not great, but (pause for .06 seconds) So I'm cured? Is that the diagnosis? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh. What do you think? No, I don't think that's the diagnosis. I wish it was but I don't think—are you feeling better, a little better? [00:41:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause for .07 seconds) I have a whole day ahead of me. Not a whole lot pressure-wise. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got two things I really need to be working on but I'm just not motivated. Real simple tasks, like writing a letter, filling something out—you know, just a small claims complaint.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah the motivation is tough for you. I guess even when you're feeling a little better it's not as hard but it's going to be hard to do that stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's always like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. (pause for .06 seconds) Cause you know I don't believe in lazy (ph). Isn't that what what's-his-name said? [00:42:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah—Balzac?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I get this brand-new.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know if you noticed but there's something wrong with it. So I go to this –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something wrong with –</p>

<p>CLIENT: The picture. Do you notice anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Looks like an alligator.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a big black spot here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. Now I can see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See that's the problem. Nothing I own, um—it sucks. It's nothing nice that I have. At the training they gave us these little pads that have a sticker on the back that you stick to your phone and use it to clean—there's a felt side and a sticky side—and you use the felt side to clean the screen of the phone, which I thought was a great idea so I stuck it to my case. </p>

<p>And I used it a couple of times. Then I went to use it again and it had rolled off. (laughs) That pretty much sums up my life right there. If you wanted to write a book, that's how you should start it off. [00:43:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be it. I see. That might explain something about the motivation, if that's how things turn out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or if that's how you anticipate they turn out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's nothing nice. I can't keep anything nice. I spill stuff on clothes, my car—well maybe I'll have a nice car for a little bit. People are trying to give me dogs too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said, yeah. We should put that off for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, cute dogs. All right, well I'm going to go test drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Have fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll try and be more depressed on Tuesday. Make your job more of a challenge.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I can roll with it either way. [00:43:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No comment. (laughs) [00:44:03]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Again, no one knows who you are, who I am, just, you know, they.  All right, I saw you, uh, [DATE], so it's been three months?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and I'm fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, you had the extensive neuro psych testing, now doing remediation, your moods you say are weird, not especially sad, but low motivation, fitful sleep, overeating, gaining weight, very low energy, um, no suicidal thinking, not helpless or hopeless, no manic symptoms, no OCD symptoms. Um, so we thought that your mood disorder was in partial remission. Your obsessive compulsive was partial remission and your sleep was disregulated and we tried a whole host of sleeping meds including Trazodone, Restoril, Seroquel, Gabitril all trying to, you know, let you figure out what might get you to sleep and we added that to your Luvox 150 and your Imprimine 10, correct? All right, did anything help you sleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The first one I was on, I forget which one that was, was on your list.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it the Trazodone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Didn't work after a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it worked in the beginning then it stopped working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah then, um, the next one, I forget what that's called, the one has three little sections to the pill, you can snap it off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that's the Trazodone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that's Trazodone?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the Trazodone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, that's the second one we tried, um, that one just knocked the shit out of me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, but, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It made me, it made me feel nauseous, go to sleep, um, it did something to my arm. My arm would just, make me feel, it was like it, it made, it made some kind of reaction with my arm.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That doesn't make sense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm telling you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Try to describe it for me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I just became very nauseous and it gave me phantom -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did it do to your discomfort?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Phantom pain that I get in my arm, um, and it would knock me out like I was drunk, like a drunken sleep and then I'd wake up and, um, if I'd sleep through the night I wouldn't dream, I would be exhausted the entire day.  Exhausted.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay so you stopped that. What else did you try?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, the first one was the Gavi -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Seroquel? Gabitril?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Gabitril was the one we tried first, that didn't work after a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, so, uh, I just, I'm always tired now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, how much sleep do you get?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably way too much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You over sleep? When I saw you last you couldn't sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, now it's, uh, erratic. It's erratic. It's erratic. I can be up until four in the morning or I could be asleep at one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your energy level like?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Zero.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're dragging all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't leave the house.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your mood like?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why didn't you come in sooner?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When I don't see you I just assume that you're doing okay, but you could have called.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember why.  I haven't done anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When you crash like that, you gotta call.  Um, all right, so stay in a little bit every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Terribly so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You irritable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Don't have the energy to be irritable. Nothing gets me mad anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're flat?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You get pleasure from anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No motivation?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Feel suicidal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any plans to hurt yourself?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have a plan. It's a plan that I do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you feel hopeless?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Helpless and overwhelmed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Able to concentrate?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Spin your wheels, can't get anything done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exactly.  I'll drop a napkin on the floor and three days later I still didn't pick it up look at every day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Getting dressed and showered every day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what do you do most days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Lay around. Watch 15 hours of TV.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You going to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What does he say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He just does the best he can cause he knows you're going to try and talk me into an MAO inhibitor and I says there's no way I'm doing it. There's no way. I read about it again this weekend, on the Internet and I did, I can't, I can't monitor my diet like that. Yknow, I can't walk around with antidote, I just can't. Yknow what, there's just too many food things to eliminate to worry about to eat, but a lost of the weight that I gained, um, cause I just get so fed up lookin at myself. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you overeating?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No now, now I'm eating</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not eating.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I'm eating right to be as good as I can. I'm on bagel withdrawal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's your self-esteem like?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Since I've seen you, have you been revved up in anyway whatsoever even a day of fire energy, racing thoughts, talking too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's been nothing manic whatsoever? Gambling, spending, indiscretion?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't even tell you what I spend, I spend too much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But no impulsivity, nothing manic, only depression? You haven't been revved up for a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is a very long cycle, which is bad for you, because then you get stuck in a depression for a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, we're clearly under treating your mood disorder.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I think you won't let me be more aggressive. Yknow, you've had, I mean in retrospect, you had a really good run on the Lamictal and Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I don't think the Wellbutrin did jack.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, maybe it was the Lamictal, but you did well for years.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, for you compared to this. Compared to last year. I mean really seriously.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But after a while the Lamictal wasn't doing it either. It was bothering me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you're saying that, but you didn't get these kinds of depression from it. You got mild depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I didn't like the physical responses that I had with Lamictal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was having lost sleep, it was inconsistent, um, it was knocking me out early, um, so I tried something else.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. Well, we need something so to just get our target sense, we need to lift your moods, we need to lift your motivation, we need to lift your energy, we need to reduce your sleepiness, sleepiness.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, get you more charged up and we have to go after the cognitive side of depression the helpless, hopeless, worthless, poor concentration. So we've got the whole spectrum of depression to fill in. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] if my medicine works.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but yknow, when you have to be thinking of this like asthma, yknow this is a chronic condition.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sometimes you're doing better and sometimes you're doing -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just sick of the inconsistencies, sick of the feeling that I feel now and, um, yknow, I mean this goes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's easy to be demoralized and it's easy to throw your hands up and say, yknow, that's the whole thing, but you know since I've treated you since [DATE], you know that even within the topics of your mood disorder you can do really well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We've seen you for long periods of time doing great. I mean, yknow, we can qualify that. You haven't moved forward socially as well as we hoped. Career-wise you haven't had to push because you know you've found this nuce for yourself where whatever, you don't need to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] try to work, I couldn't work.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but you do work. If I thought you had enough money not to work I would have said it that way. I didn't. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're really, yknow, you're very creative in what you do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I appreciate that, I just don't, if I had to go to a nine to five job, I wouldn't go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You couldn't go and I'd be working on disability papers if you needed the money, but having said that you really functioned very nicely in whatever world you've created for yourself business-wise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, uh, yknow, I'm impressed, um, with what you've accomplished here. Any new, yknow, you stay depressed when there's no fuel on the front burner.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely, yknow, I'm still waiting to finalize this one, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It looks like it's gonna happen.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, it's definitely gonna happen, the town is really up for it and the lease is drafted and everybody's signing it now and it'll be signed when the lease is, um, you know, submit our application to the town, um, they're on board, we took the papers up there, yknow, um, it should be good. Hopefully we'll get started September building, like I'm hoping, yknow, six months later I can.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You close on the deal before building or you have to build it out and do everything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No you sign a lease and then they, um -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sign a lease before you build it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah sign a lease now, um, now that the town has accepted the concept and got the plan and everything else and the terms are worked out between me and [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I build the building and I don't get paid until I hand them the keys.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They don't give you anything down?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nope.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's all out of pocket?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get a construction loan or whatever.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'll need a loan, short term loan?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Short term.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then you get a big chunk of money once you hand over the keys or just a monthly lease?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get a monthly lease.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that lease, it's inclusive, in that lease is a, uh, I'm basically making 23% on my money because I'm getting a 23% return. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. And so how long will it take on that lease money to pay off the two million dollar loan?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I borrowed the whole two, I already laid out like two hundred already of my own, um, so, uh, maybe four years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right and then at the point it will be great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> From that point on it's all gravy.  Besides that I don't intend to wait four years. I'm gonna go to the bank and borrow against and make a deal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Borrow again, right, once it's signed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Once it's signed, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I go get my construction loan today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have a good bank, you have a bank that knows you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> People to go see.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's gonna require some managing, so now what, how much time do you spend on this? Very little time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very little time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So things will get active again soon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you will have the where with all to do it or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I'm gonna have to cause there's nobody else to do it. That's gonna be hard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is OCD under any control?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it is, uh, the only thing I constantly hear about is how miserable I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I think you have a-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't, I don't, I would normally a number of instances with these deals, I'm meeting with the town board and all these local idiots, I could of easily in my old way, yknow, stood up and said what the fuck and they beat me up and cursed and screamed and like stood over me and I did a good dead and they're gonna do what they're gonna do yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good actually, right? That's very good. That's good. You could have blown the deal on your manic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So something gives you distance from that. Yknow, I don't think it's OCD, whatever we're calling OCD is just [INAUDIBLE] to your mood disorder which is, we call it a cycling disorder of bipolar, but at this point it's called depression and depression at some points comes with lots of juice that feels like OCD and at other points like now comes with no juice, not, the neurotransmission dials to your memory. All right, we need, uh, see usually I use Wellbutrin for this kind of depression, the depression that comes with the very low energy and over sleeping, but in your case we're not crazy about Wellbutrin right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] and through all the cycles I was still taking Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still taking Wellbutrin, I know, although you were doing better than you're doing now.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But that doesn't mean Wellbutrin stopped it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you were doing better. Um, the Abilify you thought was too agitating right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the, uh, you really, yknow, I mean we're using the Imipramine [INAUDIBLE] for pain at 30. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had a little bit of nausea with Imipramine.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  See that dose is nothing for depression, it's a pain dose, it's not a</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I haven't had any, I've been through physical therapy and I'm feeling fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cymbalta makes you sick?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And Nortriptyline, I had you on, I was trying to get you to 75, had you at 25 and we stopped all your meds around then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't like that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You didn't like [INAUDIBLE]? Do remember was there a reason? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I forget, but we stopped it for a reason.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now you're on the Luvox under-dosed.  Have we ever had you above that dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The 150?  Is there a reason?  Did you not want to take more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, you're the man, you tell me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, a more normal dose of Luvox would be double that. Um, you found Lexapro didn't help, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think, did I ever use it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, we tried it once in [DATE] and, uh, Cymbalta we tried twice, didn't help. Seroquel was too sedating, Effexor right at the beginning, made you I think manic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which, uh, the problem is we don't have you on a mood stabilizer right now so if we point too hard, we could over shoot, you know that, still we gotta crank pretty hard now so I would suggest we do a, uh, you're not gonna take the MAO, which is really what your brain should see, at this point, having failed so many trials, I think we should do a one, two punch on the increasing the Luvox, you can wait a little bit see if we get traction there, but I don't think we'll get enough and so at the same time let me add a tricyclic called Vivactil.  Tricyclics are good antidepressants, they're good stuff, not quite as much as MAO's but getting there. Like the toxin, like the Imipramine you were on, but a good dose, but the nice thing about Vivactil is it's energizing, gives you juice and in your case that's what you need. Virtually no side effects, I mean many side effects you would know from the Tofranil, yknow, tricyclics in general can give you orthostatic hypotension, so if you stand up fast you can get dizzy, you get some dry mouth and constipation and sedation, not with Vivactil, but in general, so all these are tolerable and we will go up slowly and if you get any of them we'll just reduce the dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that would cover us on serotonin and norepinephrine.  I mean the third, if we'd be making a poor man's MAO, yknow, and we, adding Wellbutrin to that would kind of cover all three bases. The three bases are serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And all of our meds kind of tweak here and there, but those three are transmitters and the MAOs globally increase all three so it would be kind of, if we were to eventually add the Wellbutrin it would be a poor man's MAO inhibitor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Without the dietary restrictions.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Without the dietary restrictions, obviously. We only need the dietary with MAO. Now the other thought, although we can't do it cause you're on Luvox, but, uh, we used this Emsam, have you heard of Emsam.  It's newish, it's not so new anymore, it's an MAO inhibitor patch. We slap it on.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I saw that on the Internet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, yeah?  Slap it on and at the lowest dose you don't need to follow the dietary restrictions.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And even at the higher doses, officially you're supposed to follow the diet, but when you look at the numbers, it's extremely rare to get into trouble with the diet. The problem is it's not that good, yknow, it's probably equivalent to other regular antidepressants. It doesn't have the panoche of you know the MAO. It doesn't have the juice that Parnate or Nardil or real MAOs have so in your case it's not worth it and we never used it along with an SSRI like Luvox. I would use it with Vivactil, but not with Luvox because, uh, potential interaction so it doesn't give us much.  I understand your concerns about the diet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's expensive.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, you have -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's expensive [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No it isn't. Let me give you the newer one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I read about it this weekend, there's no way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You play around online a lot with this stuff?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I, yknow, I'm desperate and I just said I knew I was talking to doc that you would want me to do that and I just can't do that kind of a restricted diet. [INAUDIBLE] was in the list you just showed me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's more expensive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The list on the thing that's shown now. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Take this home, at least think about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I read about it thoroughly on the, uh, no cheese, no casseroles and cheese, no cheese, um, uh, yeah, you say, the fishes he was talking about, you couldn't eat canned tuna or, um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you think the Luvox is helping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. I don't know, yknow, where I'm at, you know, if I'm feeling like I am then I'm feeling nothing's working. I think of where I'm at and that calms me down so God damn much that I don't have the strength to get up and get dressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right rather than increase the Luvox yet, I want to do one thing at a time. Let's augment first with Vivactil, um, and the Luvox will interact with the Vivactil also a little to raise the dose. So we're gonna start slowly at a low dose and then inch our way up. Don't do things without talking to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's fair enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, you want to stop, you want to move whatever, give me a call I will get right back to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In fact, I want to hear from you regularly, like at least once a week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, not that I have to call you back, but just leave me a voicemail. You know my number right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Leave me a voicemail let me know how you're doing at least once a week.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will.  Fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you're really not much better, I want to see you in a month. Which around here is very sacred, yknow, most people I don't see for you know three, four months. You I really want to see. Can I talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about you?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Absolutely, he's the man. As are you, so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He speaks very highly of you.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, as you know, he's the best psychologist out there, bar none, he really is the best. I deal with so many of them I just, yknow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he's great.  Amazing.  Oh, God yeah.  No, he's the coolest most grounded guy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, let me, uh, the Vivactil, I know you're gonna look it up and find a reason to struggle with it, but try not to, try to check that impulse.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I only look it up because he tells me you should look this stuff up and you should know what you're taking.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I want people to know rather than not know, but I don't want you to look for rare side effects and then use that as a reason not to take.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE], that's the bottom line.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right so, um, Vivactil -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This stuff, no way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 10 mg take one every morning times one week. If you're okay, then two every morning and then stay on the two and then I'll put plus/minus three every morning.  Okay, you can go up or not go up to the three, but first make it the one or two, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And here's the voicemail every, why don't we make it every Monday. Okay? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And what, um - one in the morning for the first week and then two every morning on the second week and I still stay on the Luvox there?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, Luvox at 150, but on the phone I might tell you to double, but not yet.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On the prescription, I'm writing that you take three a day of the Vivactil.  Do you need any other prescriptions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I'm gonna need a new one for the Luvox cause this is my last one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get the three month supply or do you just bring it into the pharmacy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I bring it to the pharmacy and we talk about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A lot of people mail them away these days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't care.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right now do you take one of the 150's or two of the 75's?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take the 100 you gave me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you take one and a half of the 100?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It comes with a line in the middle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, if I increase it, I'll increase it by 50. I could give you 50's so you increase by smaller increments, okay. Let's, I'll write take two a day of the 100's just so you'll have enough in case we increase. Your anxiety level is okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not answering.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I thought you had no juice?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It kinda goes [INAUDIBLE].  I'm going stir crazy.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what do you think that's about?  Do you think that might be some paranoia?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nah. Paranoid about what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.  By the way you might not need the Imipramine once you're on the Vivactil.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not taking the Imipramine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you stopped that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How was the pain, did it affect your pain to stop it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, no, just the anxiety of just trying to get through the day pretty much, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but you're sitting around watching TV.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't tell you what I watched. I couldn't tell you what I watched. I get furious watching it the whole time, um, it's like a miracle, it's amazing, normal I mean, I'm a good guy, I'm a rich guy, yknow, and I got no life. I stopped worrying about family. Everybody's taken care of, everybody's got, they gotta live their own lives, I can't -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Everyone's covered, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't sweat it anymore about things, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still talk to your mom a lot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She worried about you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I don't usually tell her anything, um, because I don't want her to worry, but I did the other day when I went to pick her up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want her to come in here one time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want her to go to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't want her that involved?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't need her involved, it's not gonna do any good, I'm more concerned about her.  I mean I can't be more than I already am.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She knew the um -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The extent.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bet I could use her to get you going on an MAO inhibitor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No you couldn't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ain't taking it, um, I understand what it can do, but I also understand what it can do and, yknow, I can't, I just can't, I can't be watching every step I take, I deal with enough as it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But there is the antidote.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I ain't walkin around with no damn antidote. No way, I cannot emotionally handle that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No way, can't I live with enough disabilities and worries about not doing this and not doing that and I'm not gonna wake up in the morning and am I gonna be on a two month of absolute neck pain and headache and, yknow, nausea or vertigo or I can't add another thing to my friggin thing man, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I agree, but you're so miserable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, we'll try the poor man's way. Maybe it'll work the opposite for a rich man.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I just wonder if we're missing the bipolar side of it, yknow, most people.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that Seroquel thing I see in the magazines all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, in fact I gave you that last time. That was one of you're the sleep meds.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, was that for bipolar?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bipolar depression they're pushing for now, it's an, it started out as an antipsychotic and then it became clear that it works as a mood stabilizer and then it looks like it works a bit as an antidepressant, but more as a mood stabilizer. But most of us who do this a lot, you know the kind of high end drug guys, whether or not you're bipolar we usually put refractory, your medication resistant depressives on a mood stabilizer in addition to antidepressant. We don't know why.  I mean, why is because we started doing it for people who were a little bipolar and then it became clear that most people with medication refractory depression have some element of cycling to their moods so I just wonder if that's the piece we're missing even on the depression side.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So which is the mood stabilizer that I'm taking now?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not. I'm not giving you one. Right now we're just throwing antidepressants at you to try and juice up your brain, but I can't forget that you did pretty well on Lamictal for a long time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Seroquel is that a mood stabilizer?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a mood stabilizer, but not like Lamictal. Lamictal is an anticonvulsant, Seroquel is an antipsychotic. The things that you've been on more like the Seroquel are the Abilify and I never had you on Risperdal.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what my aunt is taking she's a schizophrenic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's an antipsychotic, I mean that's the new rage is using antipsychotics for mood disorders. I had you Seroquel in [DATE], so you're ahead of the cutting edge.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah I'm the guinea pig.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh, we tried it for sleep.  All right, maybe not Lamictal again cause you don't like the side effects but at some point we may want to go the mood stabilizing route again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so, too.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, you want to do it now? I think you're too depressed right now for that to matter to us much. It matters more when you come out of the depression and it's a way to prevent a relapse of the next depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's more relevant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right now we just gotta throw rocket fuel into your system.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but I don't want to be speeding and banging off the walls.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right and if that starts happening, if you start flipping in any way whatsoever, you gotta call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And in fact it's the tricyclics that have the most potential to push you, but that's what we're looking for right? We want to get you out of this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but banging off the walls ain't good either.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just want to be up, I want to reach the day where I get, yknow, take my vitamins and whatever I'm taking and I go through a normal day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow when I function all day and I'm tired and I go to sleep at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm thinking a mood stabilizer will be part of that.  Let me give you just in case you do rev a little bit and I want you to take something fast, like boom, boom, so we'll give you some Zyprexa not to stay on, but just to use in case you call me on the phone saying I started revving up, I haven't slept for a day or two, just take that, put it in the medicine cabinet, don't use it, but just remind me if it comes to that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Have I taken this before?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just don't remember.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a pretty famous drug, but it'll rope you in if we need to quickly. There's only a few there, I'm not writing a prescription, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Keep these in my pocket.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me hear from you in a week and let me, um, see you in a month. Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nice to walk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you walk over?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I walked over.</p>

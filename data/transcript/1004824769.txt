<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey. </p>

<p>(inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll just put a check right there. Thank you. I was just taking pictures of that Van Gogh thing out there. It's cool, it's pretty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were taking a picture of it or just looking at it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I took like, some pictures of it; it's like a cool kind of background thing. How's it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I told that Lucy chick to get lost. That felt pretty good. She, ah, I sent her a text yesterday morning I think. And she was like, 'I don't know if this is going to work, I think you are just interested in me physically' and just some bullshit fucking thing. And I was like; I don't think this is going to work. And I just let her have it. I was like you are completely ambiguous, and I can't, you know, I was like you know, I just can't do this. And, and I was like also, don't insult me. You know, don't make it sound like I'm some sleazebag that's just after sex. I've shown you nothing but kindness, and caring and thoughtfulness and, was like, don't make it sound like—that's just completely insulting. And on top of that, that was a very, very two-way street, you know, so don't, I'm like fuck that. I don't have time for that. And of course she contradicted herself again, and she was like 'yeah, the sex was really, really great. And I think you're just a really, really awesome person.' And I was like whatever; I don't have time for this. I was like clear—she's, she's like, she was like 'clearly I'm just a very disappointing per—'I was like, well you just, you got to figure some shit out I don't know what's going on with you, but, I was like good luck. I was like. [00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's confused. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but it felt good to be like, this has nothing to do with me. I, I, now I'm not interested. Forget, you're not going to play that, like you're not, you don't think this is going to work out, fuck that, it's not that you don't know this is going to work out, you're fucked up. (chuckle) So it's like, I don't think this is going to work out for me. You know. So, I don't know. (pause) On the flip side, this is weird like. Saturday, did I tell you this chick like friended me on Facebook, who I like had a date with two years ago? Did I tell you that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think you mentioned it briefly. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we had like a really awesome date, and we made out, and I never heard from her again. She friended me on Facebook, and we had a really nice exchange, and I was like, for whatever reason I was never that, I just really liked her, and I just assumed something, I knew it wasn't me, so I just assumed something was going on in her life or whatever. I don't know. I mean I was bummed but, for some reason it didn't really upset me per sea, So she friended me on Facebook, and I was like alright that was kind of a clear sign right there. And we kind of exchanged some, Hey, how ya been, whatever, and I was like you know, I, I don't know, I said something like you know, you've popped up in my mind you know, a number of times. Anyway, long story short, we had like, an awesome date on Saturday. Like really awesome. Really, she's really cool a nice person. So now, the trick, is now I'm all aware, first of all this is all wacky, I can't believe the really weird dating escapades I've had lately, but, I'm being very careful to not, get like, too excited or to—you know what I mean? Like I just want to, she's really, really cool, I really like her. And, we had a really awesome time. And we kind of spent the night together, whatever. And, it was just very like, she was very sweet, she was like, I'm really sorry about what happened that first time, whatever, just very, I don't know, it was awesome. We just laughed a lot, and then the next day, she was like, and that was the best second date, two and a half year date, whatever [00:04:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really cool. So it was really nice. I just, yeah, it's kind of cool, and it's weird because I really liked her back then. So it's weird how sometimes you just never know. But. But I'm yeah, I want to be careful because I know I'm in a weird place and I don't want to get all wrapped up and, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the difference, is, maybe you can feel excited, it's not like you have to keep a lid on feeling excited. If you're excited, you're excited. You were just into her, it's a good first date, but also, holding in mind that you've been excited on other first dates too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well then, it's even deeper than that. I just, I really got to work on this like, you know, it's ok. Like even if, even if, she was suddenly like, even if again I didn't hear from her. Like you know if the worst happened, I just got to get to the point where it's not completely, a spiraling, self defeating, you know what I mean? [00:06:01] (pause) and it's funny because, that's, that's what make me sad, you know what I mean. It's like I'm excited, but I'm sad that I even have to think about, you what I mean that I have to be prepared, well, I really, really like this girl so I'm already bracing myself for bad things happen, I'm like, getting the [inaudible] spiral and hate myself and all that shit. It's been sad you know to have to think that way. Or, it's also even sad to think that means so much to me. That this one person is in to me, so, you know what I mean? So now it's not even about dating anymore it's, I go, now that I get what's really going on, it's like, it's all about Wow, I'm just excited that this beautiful girl, like I still, you know what it is? Deep down I still can't believe it each time it happens, and that's sad to me. You know. Like, while we were out, I was like, I can't believe this is going so well. Like she made the first move, she kissed me at the bar, and still deep down, there's a voice that just says well how is this happening? You know? That's sad, because I know that's not who I am now. But it's just a bummer that it still echoes. You know. [00:07:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You once said that voice was a twelve year old. That was the age. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't know what age it is, but yeah, it's just this awful, but yeah, I don't think it's my voice. That's the thing, that's not me, that's what's been ingrained in me you know. (pause) So. (pause) And I don't want to go the other way, like today's a girl, like I'm not going to text her today. But I also don't want to, I also don't want to, I don't know. What I'm trying to say is I'm probably over thinking everything now, because I'm like, I don't want to get caught up in it, I don't want to get to invested, and I'm like (laughter) It's like, you know. But like, yesterday I was really like, you know, well maybe that's not true. There's just something about her that, unlike Lucy or some of these other, like there's something very open about her, or just healthier about her. When I text her, she texts me back, like there's no weirdness in the texts. And it's just more light and friendly and sweet you know. So yesterday, we had made some jokes, she some really funny comments, and we were like people watching and stuff. [00:08:48]So I sent her this I was like these are the top two quotes of the night and whatever. And we had this really nice back and forth whatever and she remembered what I said about taking her to the lesbian beer store. In the Center there's this amazing lesbian beer shop, in the Center. So I made this joke, I had forgot about that and then she reminded me, and she was like yeah, you know, the, you know, so when I wrote back to her I was like, that one is going to happen you know. So you know it was really sweet, she was like I'm excited you know we were like, that's just normal, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean we are going to get married. There's no like weirdness. It's just two people that had a good time, that like each other and they're just sending friendly, kind of flirty texts, it's just, I don't know. Anyway, I don't know what I'm saying, but. (pause) [00:09:39] so (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say, trying both not to be standoffish, not go too much in that direction but also not to be over invested. What does that mean over invested? When you say that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well just what I said. To automatically feel like, this one beautiful girl is in to me, so if she ever stops being in to me, it means that I'm, that, that, that old voice is right and I'm just some ugly retard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what's the voice? The ugly retard? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea; I mean I'm just talking. Deep down there's a voice that doesn't believe I deserve these things and that somehow I am less attractive than other people, or I'm less cool than other people, I'm less adult than other people, like whatever, it's just a stream of negativity you know. Right, it's like my music isn't as good as other people, I'm not as cool as other guys, you know. Like that I'm somehow trying really hard to be something I'm not. It's just all that awful self hating kind of shit. [00:10:55] So that's what I mean by over investing, like suddenly, ok, great, we had a great first-I really like this girl so, just you know, I really want this to work and if it doesn't, it's going to be like the end of the world. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So getting really dependant on her</p>

<p>CLIENT: On it continuing to go well. Yeah. (pause) Yep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The feeling doesn't come from inside you then, it's dependant on, </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I said its battle, its part of me. Like we had this, we had a great time. And it seems so far to be you know. Like, like it seemed like she even, like we both came to the date with the same mindset. That, from the get go, it was very, I mean she parked at my house, and we went on—like, it was very clear that her intention was, you know, I really liked you, and I want to, and she was, she was very sincere, like I can't, I can't believe you gave me another chance. And, so clearly we both really like each other you know. [00:11:58] But what I'm saying is, I don't want to take that, that's wonderful, but it could change next week. It could, who knows if she's a lunatic, or whatever, I, I might not be into her a month from now. So it's that idea of just really going with it, and enjoying it, but not feeling like it's a house of cards you know, that, you know. (pause) For example, Michelle, Samantha, this chick, it's always been like, if this doesn't work out, fuck, like, I'm not going to find another girl like this. I'm, it's going to be like a fucking nightmare trying to fucking. And see, that sucks to think like that because clearly I keep finding another, you know. [00:12:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's, it's a place where your memory gets erased. In a way, it's like, there's no past. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well because I think what that voice does is it says, even though those chicks, it's good I'm not with those girls, but there's still that deep, deep down voice that says yeah but you somehow, maybe you know, they kind of just saw that nyyyah (ph) You know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they sort of get explained away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, exactly. [00:13:14] (pause) So, I don't know. It's very complicated now; it's not like black and white like it was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear you, it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I'm saying? It's like how great, I told one girl off, who fucking deserved it, and I was completely articulate, I wasn't mean to be mean. I wasn't, I said what needed to be said. I haven't gotten in touch since. And on top of that, how wonderful that this wonderful thing happened the same, you know. So, it's cool, it's all good you know. But, I guess I'm just scared, I just don't want to, you know </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even as you are describing the sequence today, it sounds as if there's a little bit more memory inside of past relationships. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because when that voice comes up now I'm immediately like na-na-na-nah, I mean, I don't want to be with Michelle. I mean yeah, sometimes I miss her and, but what am I really missing? I'm missing that she's stunningly beautiful, the intimacy, and all that, but that wasn't going to work long term, you know? And what the hell would I miss about Samantha, that wasn't even good intimacy, it was just ice cold everything. So I, I squash that voice, it's just sad the voice is, even though now it's tiny, it's like oh wow, it's still fucking there. So even as I'm feeling good, I'm not panicking, I'm not you know. It's just, I, I guess what I'm saying is, now, more and more I have these moments where I'm like wow, I'm just fucked up. (chuckle) Like this is all deep stuff that isn't going to go away tomorrow. You know, so I have to be extra vigilant and be aware of it and it's just sad. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's complicated that our task is only to squash that voice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That our task here isn't only to squash that voice</p>

<p>CLIENT: No here, that's what I'm saying, no, no</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually we want to get to know that voice </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, here's the opposite. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We want it to get louder so we can get to know it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's more about just, that I have to manage it out there. (pause) [00:15:25] But. (pause) I don't know. (pause) But yeah it's cool. She's a nice person, really nice person. She lives with her brother, younger brother. And she has a 12 yr old kid, and seems like a very nice kid. And yeah, I don't know. Just very nice. (long pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You remember whoever her is, having a child has been more complicated for you before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry, a girl, oh yeah, when they have children? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in this case, I mean</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it doesn't in the beginning, but it grows, complicated. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It grows too like, how are we going to do this, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure it will at some point. But I think also I've kind of come a long way, like I'm willing you know, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't seem as much like a deal breaker. [00:16:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all. No, because now I know enough about myself to know, that I'll know, like, I can spot a Michelle, or a Samantha a mile away. Like with Lucy, I immediately sensed something. So, other than that one day when I got all worked up, that was, remember I was saying that was a, that was a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like I don't want to go to that place, and I didn't. I haven't even thought of it, or when I think of her now, I have no feelings of, she was a beautiful girl and now I'm not going to see her, I don't give a fuck. She's, you know. So there's that feeling to where, I know enough about myself to where, if I really like you, and you have a kid and if everything else in your life, like you're kind of seem to be like, you're a good mom. I think what I, my only thing has been with that is, will they want another kid. It's more practical in some ways. Like, I want to have; I do want to have my own kid. So that's more and more becoming kind of like a practical thing, you know? That you know, will they want to have at least one more or two more, whatever. So, (pause) plus I like, I mean her brother seems like a really nice guy, they just seem like a nice family. Like her son seems to be really mellow and sweet and, you know. So, I don't know. It's, I mean yeah, it is definitely more complicated. I mean it's complicated in the sense of we can't always go on a date or whatever. I mean I guess maybe it's because she has her brother, it's easier to go out or whatever. But, still, I mean it's a logistical, you know. (pause) [00:18:23] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you are describing, you just described, how you are kind of thinking of Michelle, and kind of fluctuating back and forth between these two moms's. It really sounds clearer, and maybe this has been clearer to you, but it just seems even clearer to me right now. How much it's been only about exteriors. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not, there's not</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why I'm being careful here. She, she, she checks off on that list I have. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which in some ways is a danger? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I'm saying. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's like you're saying okay </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I'm saying </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well could I be attracted to something else, there's been nothing about beauty inside people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's the thing, I mean, one thing I'm excited about here, is it seems like she's more of the whole package, but, but I agree with what you are saying </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely, I just mean in general </p>

<p>CLIENT: It worries me a little bit</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In general. And I imagine it with her it probably will be different because of where you are anyway, versus years ago. But just getting to know this thing that's been old. Your self assessment is awesome. [00:19:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think what it is, is coming up, you can't not be attracted to what you are attracted to. You know, unfort—It just is what it is you know. And I, and I, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually, I think it can change too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's what I'm saying, like for example in this case, she has a kid. She's actually not super skinny, you know, she's not super skinny. So as pretty as she is, as beautiful as she is, and she dresses the way I like whatever. She's not, you know. So, and I don't care. You know. So, but, but, I know what you're saying, yeah, I—it's not even about that, it just in general, I don't want to. You know, some of it isn't a bad thing, you know, I've come, I'm just a romantic. Like I, like I do, Like, I've been thinking about what you said, I just really want to connect with somebody. As charming as I am, whatever the fuck. Or I'm able to date, I just really want to connect with somebody, and have a really just nice, kind of normal, dating relationship that lasts more than a year or whatever. So, but I don't want that, I don't want to get caught up in, I don't know what I'm saying., I think you get what I mean. I just don't want to get caught up either way. You know, I just want to get to know her, and keep having a good time, but not worry if oh we didn't see each other this week or I haven't heard from her, or, you know. In that way it is a little bit like a game. I think there's just a reality initially, where you know, neither person wants to seem over eager but, (pause) Ah who the hell knows, but. It's all very tiring, but. [00:21:21] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is hard to talk about, I think. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? For me? Yeah it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I notice things I'm asking that are just about trying to open up, what the insecurity is for example. Even though I know, we both know, its better, its different, it's so different now. It's hard to open up, it's like you want a reassure us both, and it's so different now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because you know why, because you know why, my, my, there's nothing scarier to me than seeming desperate. That's what I worry about. And I worry that I don't want to seem— Again, now that I've said verbal—I've said it out loud, clearly that can not be the case. Clearly, even with Lucy, even with any of these chicks, where's the desperation? Gwen, right, I didn't even text her back. I just you know. So clearly, so I'm so worried that I'm worried that ok, if I text Kelly today and I say, Listen I'm playing a show this weekend, do you want to try and maybe get together before then? For the weekend, that's going to sound too eager or something you know what I mean? I'm so scared of that. That's what I'm saying, like I don't want to let it go the other way. You know what I mean? [00:22:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you might be afraid that you would come across sounding desperate even in here just by talking about what you are feeling. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of the things I'm saying, I actually think, it will start to feel better the more you can talk about it, because a lot of what you are talking about are fears of something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not actually</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they are fears of rejection and fears of someone who I think of as beautiful and this or that is going to be like ugh, this guy, you know what I mean? That kind of like, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get the sense it might take the form of someone who rejected you that I might think oh, therefore you must be reject able. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like I would take that as a fact, of, to judge you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, no I, I do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so I think it feels sort of like you have to protect those stories a little bit, as though I would see that in the same way you mother would. [00:23:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, yep. Well I mean in general I've felt that way in here a lot, before. You know there are times when I leave here, or even when I'm talking. Where I'm like, Oh man, (pause) Like, you know, like, I must seem like such a fuck up or not a loser but, just yeah, fucked up and kind of overly, not desperate, I don't know what's the word, needy or so wounded or you know what I mean? Things that aren't very manly you know. [00:23:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what wondering is what's this image, these words that come like desperate and needy? That's, that's like the worst thing possible? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That the way, that's the way I felt with all those, with Meredith—what's that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't even know what that means to you really. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well just the idea that, you know Mer—the idea that, it, it again goes back to this nerdy, I don't even know why I'm saying that because I don't, I don't think I was nerdy, but just being like this kind of, shy, very romantic sensitive (chuckle) kid, who you know, just wants to connect with people. And then because of a lot of trauma, that's stunted, so now Meredith, Michelle, Samantha, whatever, it's like, it's as if I got dates with the high school beauty queen. (pause) And it's a combination of that inner voice saying you're a chump, you somehow you sold your way into or something. But even more than that, that somehow they are going to see, that I don't know. I don't know what they [00:25:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That what, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm so overly sensitive and, and like, I'm not as cool as I think I am, I, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So sensitive means not cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I mean I think a lot of this also could be, and I'm not trying to explain it away, I think it's just a real thing, you know. Because of music, I mean, I've also been, the things I've been interested in, have made me have friends and be in circles that's full of aloof hipsters, right. So, if you're a stunted, a 40 year old, 30 year old guy, whatever year old guy, but you're really, there's a part of you that's a scared high school kid, or whatever, shy. What happens is, all those friends, all that bullshit aloofness, all that artifice, seems very real. So it seems like when I'm not with these people, when they are along in their apartments, they are just super cool. And like, they are just always kind of stoic and nothing kind of affects them, and you know. It's insane. But that's, you know, you remember Dave, when I talk about Dave? That's I don't think about the Dave who I spent night after night with, who cried, who was obsessing over his break up with—I immediately go to the strong Dave who got over it and he, and he's, when we go out to bars, he never gets rattled by chicks, or, you know what I mean? I just immediately, I do to these people what I do to women, like they are immediately just these, what's the word (snaps fingers) not prototypes but, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. There, you know? [00:26:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They get edited into these specific characters. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they are all, they're all still somehow what I aspire to be, which is maddening because Dave lives in a shithole and works construction, and I don't know what his future prospects are. But I, but I always think of him as a, well not always, I shouldn't say that, but. There's a moment, when that voice gets strong, in that moment, I think of Dave as like the kind of older brother who is just cooler than me, you know? It, that's less and less and less, but it happens you know? Or if I'm out at a bar and I see a couple of dudes, who they've got the whole fucking, they just walked out of a hipster catalog. I can't help it; I have that moment where I'm like yeah, see these girls are going to want to talk to those guys. Not to me. And even if I rationalize it, like do you remember the date you just had, it will be like, yeah but that's, like there will be some but, and I don't even know what that but is, or I don't understand what that but could be, but somehow that voice doesn't let me connect, do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how strong the inner story is. That your mind will rewrite a character. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry to interrupt you but can I tell you a story. So when we were people watching on our date, it was really fun whatever. And there were these two chicks across from us, so we were like you know, we were both like those two chicks look like they're on a date, and they were both kind of like attractive, lesb—you know, there was something about them that seemed like they were together you know. It was, and at one point, they were looking at us, and I was joking around and was like You know, I don't think I'm going to go to the bathroom right now because those chicks like are going to have, they want you. (chuckle) You know what I mean? And, which is kind of hot, it was like awesome, those chicks are just totally (chuckle) checking you out! That other voice though in me, like deep down was worried. Like it immediately got paranoid that those chicks were like, how is that chick with that guy? Yeah. [00:29:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's such a [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isn't that amazing? Now, I was very psyched because even knowing that I looked them right in the eye, I didn't let it, it didn't rattle me at all, but I acknow- I mean I couldn't help but acknowledge that they was a voice deep down saying that. You know. I was very, I mean, I'm, at the time I didn't think about it. But it's great that I, I've lost, I didn't let it, and actually it was the opposite, I was like fuck right she's with me (chuckle). You know, like, it was kind of cool. But, the fact that even phew, you know what I mean, that's and awful thing to think about yourself. That's sad, you know? Why would you think that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so sad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know (pause) So. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like no one fell in love with you when you were a little boy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like its how it starts to [inaudible] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah exactly, it's that there wasn't that unconditional, I'm, there wasn't anything like, I'm going to, like, my mom was like, oh so and so's son so, there wasn't anyone who was like, you know I don't care if so and so's son was Brad Pitt. Like you, were, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're my son. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah there wasn't, I didn't feel that. So what happens now, (pause) Even if it's not a romantic thing, it just becomes like yeah, this person likes me, but if there was someone else, I just happen to be here, so, you know what I mean? So you're seeing all the good things, yeah, it's not that I'm not like— I get that I'm likeable. But I grade things, so I think like well yeah, but Trish would really like, if someone else was here that's whatever more than me, then that's who Trish would like. Why, why wouldn't she? And that's what happens in the bars, if I'm like, yeah well that dude clearly, he's younger, he's out of some hipster catalog, so yeah, why, now that he's here, why would this person still like me? Or why would someone who I want to talk to, now want to talk to me? Now there's someone better to talk to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, it's hardcore shit. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like all people can be lined up and put in a hierarchy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right, that's right. Yeah, (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you must have felt that as your mother's son. That you've, you were, I don't know where you put yourself, but you weren't at her top. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anywhere. I didn't put myself anywhere. Yeah. (pause) [00:31:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did she even talk about other people's sons? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's always, like for example recently, like now, I don't even hear it. I don't care. But, there, my uncle was talking about a house he's looking at in Midtown. They want to maybe leave, maybe come closer, like somewhere in Midtown, Midtown area or where ever the fuck. So he's talking about this house, her friend's son, totally nice guy, very nice guy, he's a dentist, he's a sweet guy. He just bought out, she goes on, she proceeds to talk about the house he bought, and. Now, I know enough now to know, my mom's she's really not, like, if I were kid, that would be really hurtful, but as an adult, because she's talking to my uncle. Because its right in the same neighborhood, and it's not like she's going out of her way and be like, oh I'm going to talk about his person's son. But it's kind of those kinds of things, where, what would make me angry in the past wasn't even that she was trying to tell me, it was like, why are you even bringing that up? It, it's, so it's, in some ways it's not so much that, it's the, it's just the, this is what I've meant in the past, as people, we're not, she's not my kind of, I don't give a shit. Like I don't care who it was. Like me and my dad and that side of the family, we don't give a rat's ass that Trish and her husband just built a fucking house. Or we would just say it and that would be it. "Oh, in Midtown, oh that's cool, my, my therapist, or whatever her husband, my friend and her husband built a house there. I would leave it at that. I wouldn't be like, yeah, you know it's got marble floors, and a pool and you know. My mom gets very, and that's clearly about her, I think that it's that she wants that house. She's always wanted you know, like maybe a nice single family house, and a little more, you know. But when you are a kid, you know what I mean? I would hear it a different way. You know. I think a lot of those times; my mom didn't mean to hurt me at all. I think there were times, when I think maybe she did. But I mean, she did, in a roundabout, like without realizing, that what the fuck you are saying. Like when it's more like about looks or whatever, you know what I mean? You know so and so's son is so tall and handsome you know. I there am no way in hell, my mom said, aw, I think I'm going to say this to hurt my son, you know? But it's just not good parenting. Like it's not thinking of, you know. [00:34:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The best case scenario is that it's not holding your hand at night. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's also possible; there may have been moments where there was unconscious hostility. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wouldn't, I can't imagine she ever wanted to hurt you, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no but it is sub—the idea that you know, if I were taller, whiter, handsomer</p>

<p>I mean, I can't believe I'm saying whiter, but that's what we're talking about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's such an image, that alone, that's what you described, that's what, that's what you imagined she see's in you, or sees as a lack or something. It's all physical. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well think about it, right when I wanted to get my surgery she didn't try, I mean she kind of did, but she didn't try to talk me out of it. I mean she kind of did. Now it could be pos—she also saw, I mean I was so at a weird bottom. My mom is also very astute to know when I've hit some kind of wall really hard. Because I'm so closed off to her, that when I do, she's just very astute, very sensitive. But she's really, so on the one hand, I think it was because she was like, wow this is obviously something, really, I mean it was out of the blue kind of. So she was like wow, this is something, obviously. But there was no, she said, she did say, you, you look wonderful, there's nothing wrong. But it was so little, so, too little too late at that point. Whatever she did say to reassure me, pfft, it's like, it just bounces right off, you know, it's not like, believable.[00:36:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not enough. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or not believable you're saying, maybe she's just saying it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And also no on in my family really, said anything either. I think only a few of my cousins went "Why?" or something. But, like my uncle, my other aunt, there wasn't, there was a little bit of "Whaaaa???" But, they were like, you know, if that's what you really want to do, you know. But it's just they are very you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. What did you make of how I responded? Do you remember? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah, you were like "Why?" (chuckle) yeah, absolutely, absolutely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but, a lot of people might have said why. I'm curious if you felt like I had an opinion about it or not to you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I just remember that, I remember that I was aware that I was sad, that and frustrating that I couldn't believe someone, who was probably being completely honest, and wasn't trying to bullshit me. Or some of my friends or a few people that, I knew they weren't lying, but I didn't believe it. You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how strong the story is inside of you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now, I will say I mean, I'm not going to lie, I think I do look better. I think I look cuter and handsomer or whatever. But, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you've also said you sometimes look in the mirror and you aren't sure you're even going to have the surgery or not </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's kind of gone away more and more. Yeah, that's, I don't feel that anymore. (pause) Yeah there are moments when, yeah but, but I guess what I'm saying is, the sad part is, why not be like, even if something might look better or whatever, it doesn't mean there was some sort of monster before that. There was one kind of attractive and another kind of attractive, you know what I mean? [00:38:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, even the fact that you started the sentence, even if something might look better, there's already adjustment </p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell you there is</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is, because that's what you grew up with. Not with whole people who are loved for their wholeness. Not for their bits and parts. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess you know you are right. In that way I still don't, like if you were to tell me, like, I see a difference but, not in a way that I think is better, you looked fine before. I still kind of don't, </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't believe me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so. No. (pause) Which, and again I mean, I knew even at the time, I was like yeah but why? I mean, even if things didn't work out with Samantha, she initially it did work out, I got, she totally fell for me and I fell for her. That wasn't this guy, that was, I mean hold on, it was this guy (laughter) you know what I mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I had other experiences, I you know, but (pause) [00:39:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think I keep saying this today, Brian that is how strong this story is. It's, it's an unconscious story that was embedded deep inside you as a child. That this was how to be and it had to do with only external appearance and those people were better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not a mother unconditionally wholly loving her whole son and regardless of whatever the details, just knowing you are a whole loved person. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You treat yourself that way. You cut yourself up into bits and pieces. And be judged and evaluated and turned over. I mean sometimes, even like the way you look at your own self, is your, you know, like I look like a schlep today or I, </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you know I wore this yesterday. It's like you're just parts like you're a piece of cloth with a pair of shoes. Or that, [inaudible] not </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) or that, that one little thing signifies a complete lack of everything else. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it's going to turn someone off or on to you, by one teeny little thing of you, it's like the sum total. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (Long pause begins at 00:40:25] ends at 00:40:56) I'm glad I'm coming here. It's working. It's good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you just say that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just thinking like, like before, first of all I don't think this, I would even be talking this way. But, now when I do like, I, I don't feel, I feel like, now instead of feeling like anxious and hype, like —remember when I said something about when I'm in here and I'm talking I feel weird like I'm outside myself, where I hear my voice and I feel unsettled. That still kind of happens, but now, now I take it to just feel like, I feel, I feel alive now, I don't feel, you know what I mean? I just feel like 'Yeah these are things and I'm a person, and I'm saying these things and, the unsettling part now is; now I just feel like an adult. I feel like an (chuckle) adult person </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckle) </p>

<p>CLIENT: In the world. Like I don't feel, I don't know if that makes sense, but. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe there are moments where you actually, can just be here for a second. And not be quite as, outside yourself, anxiously watching yourself be here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's, that's </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Judging, judging, you are constantly judging yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Way more, right, right, right. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which certainly prevents any person from having real contact. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I guess that feeling, is like amazing. It's like, Wow that's, that's more than night and day, that's really a drastic change. Yeah, like, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it, I just feel very different when I'm here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not just here, that's the thing, everywhere. You know. (pause) [00:43:02] ends [00:43:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thursday</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cool. 12:50? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes (Laughter) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) See ya later. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye. </p>

<p>(Door opens and closes followed by silence, movement around the room) </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Workman's Comp is finally going to take care of the, the bill, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You actually got that in writing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no.  I don't have it in writing yet.  It was in writing yesterday what I was told.  So, the attorney, uh, said he'd have it in to the adjuster by the end of the week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, we'll see.  We'll see how it [INAUDIBLE].  Then I'll get reimbursed for my visits here.  But, I'm not holding my breath.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put the money on the, under your mattress I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sleeping very well now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good to hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ambien CR does the trick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  I'm not taking any of the [INAUDIBLE].  Um, well I'm taking some.  It depends on what's been triggered.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like how often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, a couple times a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Use it during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Night, no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What do you take at night?  Just the Ambien CR, one of those?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, so did you get something filled out for work or is Workman's Comp covering your medicines?  Their -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not having to, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't paid for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, they're going to reimburse you for all the back too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah.  It may take them 30 days, but yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about back pay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, for, I mean you got [INAUDIBLE] Workman's Comp you going to have any money coming or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, just the, what I've paid in for the prescriptions and what I've paid in for the office visits here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  But no, no money or work or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you settled that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] settle for a million dollars and not deal with the medical because we spent [INAUDIBLE] pain in the ass to deal with medical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But maybe once you get past this it won't be, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe, if we ever get past it.  It's been 9 years and we just get something constantly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's, it's, having to go through the attorney is that, that much more frustrating.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't know why, uh, well yeah I do I guess, but anyway, glad things are going the way they should.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, they're going better.  I don't know that they're going the way they should but they're going better.  [NAME OTHER] has to have surgery on the [DATE].  She has, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's wrong with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Endometrial cancer.  I don't believe surgery is going to take care of the cancer [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When was that diagnosed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They did a biopsy I guess?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  They did a D&C and they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It came back that it was cancer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, she's got really great doctors [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they're doing a hysterectomy and then going and see what else is going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  She has a umbilical hernia as well and they're going to fix that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When's surgery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Next Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, she's going to be down for the count for a few weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What else did they do besides surgery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Radiation.  If they find any pockets of cancer outside of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The hysterectomy.  That's only if they find something.  So if they don't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So if they don't find anything then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then she's good for go with the, with the surgery which hopefully it'll be just the surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't know if they're going to have to cut her open or if they're going to be able to do it laparscopically.  Hopefully they can do it laparscopically.  But she'll be down for about 5, 6 weeks instead of 10, 12 weeks.  She's, she's more worried about people not pitching in at the house, me, me getting bogged down.  I'm like, "Just take care of you."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "So we'll take care of the rest."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ordinarily, you know, that should work out [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pick up the slack I would assume.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They just, uh, they're lazy.  [NAME OTHER] is not so much lazy.  He does stuff but he does stuff for a, a purpose.  He wants something out of it.  It's always like, "No, you can't go because you did this.  Now, if you want to go somewhere just give me a game plan.  No you can't.  It's not a tradeoff."  Um, then [NAME OTHER], she's just downright lazy.  "I work a job."  "Well, good.  What do you think the rest of the world does?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As long as they have somebody to cook their meals for them and throw their laundry in the dryer if it's been sitting there, then yeah, I'd like to live like that.  Free too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're, uh, we bumped your Abilify up, what do you think?  That been beneficial?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [NAME OTHER] says she's even noticed a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You look, you look different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I, I feel like it's, um, a good bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You look different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I haven't had the mood swings like, like I was having, so.  And I'm sleeping good.  That Ambien CR is just, and I'm gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I stay gone until 5:30, 6:00 in the morning.  I think, I'm a lightweight now, I can't stay up until 11:00.  Have to record stuff if I want to watch moonlight stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Listen to you, listen to you kind of joking, why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Joking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Joking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I haven't seen that in a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's, it's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You need some Ambien CR prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, probably in another week and a half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Looks like you got everything else though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what're you going to do on your birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going over to my sister's for dinner and then whatever else they have planned.  I just know I'm supposed to show up there for dinner.  So, yeah, I'll be [AGE] tomorrow.  My sister turns [AGE] this year so that's, that's the big birthday.  [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were talking yesterday and it's like, "Oh yeah, you're going to be [AGE]."  I'm like, "You know, I'm glad I passed that."  I didn't get the big [AGE] over the hill thing.  I guess they're waiting until I'm [AGE].  Oh.  But she doesn't, her birthday's in August so her birthday's the same day that we bought the house.  So, I, I know how long we've been in the house by her birthday.  But, she's concerned about hitting [AGE].  I'm like, "It's just a number, another number."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When, when she is laid up and there is a lot of work to do, you need to be real careful of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not to feel like you're going to, you know, "I got to cover it all so she doesn't start worrying that things aren't getting done."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  That's one [INAUDIBLE].  It's hard because I've had that surgery.  I know what it's like.  And, um, she thinks it's going to be up and at them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if, even if she's not, you don't want her to start, you know, "Wow, house is a mess," or "We need food," or blah, blah, blah, whatever.  And then, uh, you know, you feel like you got to go do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's, that's, she's a tough act to follow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, don't try.  Don't try.  It's kind of like, I don't know.  It reminds me of when, when, when, when parents split up, you know?  The kid's stay with mom, then mom has this, uh, need to be mom and dad.  I have to say, "You can't."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "You can be mom.  You can't be both."  Just be you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just do what you do and that has to be sufficient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'll keep the main area clean and that will be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If, if, if that's you and that's what you do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I'm going to be doing for her because she, she can't stand the clutter.  And it really won't get cluttered, I mean, we're all adults, we don't have, well we have the baby during the week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But we toss all her stuff off to the side and when she goes to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you don't have clutter you must have one of the rare houses in this country.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We don't have clutter, no.  We don't.  [NAME OTHER] won't allow it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So like I say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's militant about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She may get a little behind, but that's okay.  Let it go.  She just needs to get well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  She's, uh, she's had this for quite a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She has?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that what they said?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh, about 3 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She got symptoms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she's had weight loss and she thought it was just her diet but she's had, she's lost 35 pounds in about 3 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bleeding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bleeding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  She, um, she's anemic so hopefully this is going to take care of the anemia part and get rid of some of the medicine she's taking.  And all that'll take a while though, to get back to normal levels.  But she's been on the iron for a long time and it's just kind of like keeping it where it's at.  It's not dropping it but it's not raising it either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So.  [NAME OTHER]'s birthday is next Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a big month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going to be [AGE].  She's going to be [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is she acting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  We got into an argument last week and she was acting about 10.  She didn't understand they, uh, her and [NAME OTHER] owe me money and she couldn't understand why I wanted her to pay me all at once instead of waiting on his income tax check.  I said, "Y'all can square that up then."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, "That's not about me, that's about you guys."  "You guys figure that one out."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She, she did.  She finally called me back.  She said, "You're right mom."  Well, I knew I was.  She, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, she is maturing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That phone call back tells you a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.  Well, the, the guy she's with he has, has a lot of immature moments and I think she feels that need to straighten him out so she's maturing quicker.  I just wish she would go to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's only [AGE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's got time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A perfect time to go to school is when you're [AGE].  If I had it all to do over again I would've.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's easier to do when you're younger but some people like, uh, kind of determined.  They got to do it their own time, their own way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, she's determined to work these little jobs that she doesn't get enough hours at and then she gets so frustrated and calls me crying, "I don't know how I'm going to pay everything."  I've got a job, you go to school.  But she don't want to hear all that.  She just wants to hear, is Mama going to fix it?  Mama can't fix it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Think that's what she's asking for, money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  A lot of times, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She'll figure it out.  I said you always do.  You'll figure it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's how we learn.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep.  So, but, uh, pretty much, everything's all, all well.  [NAME OTHER] is, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He get hooked up with somebody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His, uh, number's came back.  He's at, uh, 293 on his CD4 so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's very low but he has a doctor's appointment on the [DATE] but they can't get him in any sooner.  And it's like you come back with that kind of number and you're having to wait a month to get in.  It's made him a little anxious.  And of course he thought we were going to have snow and he was all over it.  Like, he's like, "We're going to have snow."  Of course it was snowing a little last night and he wanted to be out in it and he's, his immunity is so low.  It's like, "You're going to get sick if you're out in it.  It's snow."  It's like a 6 year old.  It was, it was funny once.  He's like, "It's going to snow."  [NAME OTHER] would come on and it's like, "He said it's going to be 3 or 4 inches."  I'm serious.  It felt like we had a 6 year old in the house.  It's good to be that excited about something, you know, that keeps you young.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's just nice for me to see that you can see that, you can see what you just described.  It wasn't very long ago and you would've just been, "Yeah, he was being annoying."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He was running all around.  And, not now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's the miracle of drugs, therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's, uh, in your determination that's always been there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have not tapped into it so much, but obviously are now.  But so, at this point what you have to do is look at, "Okay, this is where I'm at.  Where do I go from here?"  This is your new base.  You know, it's not, you're base isn't where it was.  This is where you function from and where you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm already planning to appeal the decision that they made because they're sending me for x-rays this Friday and I just, just feel like it's just drawing out.  And, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More tests.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> More tests, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's always their answer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And all that does is just delay it, you know.  I don't know what they hope -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, they're sending me for MRI so my back [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had it done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had it done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had it done.  It's unnecessary radiation exposure, the way I feel about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because if they see something different now they're going to, "Oh, well there's something different.  She's probably better."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, what do they expect to see?  It's going to, you know, "Awe, it's, it's all gone."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's miraculous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've been healed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  I mean, I don't understand it.  They have all of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  They have enough to base the disability on now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  On [NAME OTHER]'s, we applied for disability too but we haven't heard back anything from them on hers at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They said she should've gotten it, kind of, right off the bat with the cancer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not necessarily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that's what the people at the cancer center seem to think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, may be.  But people that, that are, that have HIV that, um, you know, actually have the illness and not doing good at all and they don't necessarily get it automatically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nothing is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing is automatic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Free lunch, if it sounds too good to be true -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We know it's not.</p>

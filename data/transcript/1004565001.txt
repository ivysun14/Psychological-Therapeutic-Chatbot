<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other - so the regular morning time I got I have a little earlier in the morning. That's this group thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, you said 12:30 last week. And I don't know whether meeting three times a week is going to be necessary or better than two times a week. I'm kind of hoping for guidance from you on that and could kind of see where it goes. [inaudible]; I can do it if we need to but regardless of that it would actually - it'd be much better for me to meet Mondays and Thursdays if we're meeting twice a week instead of Wednesdays and Thursdays because I'm having anchors in the middle of the week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. My thought would be to try it three times for a while and see how it goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And does 12:30 work on Mondays?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I've got nothing but time. I mean actually it's good because it's good for me to have a reason for me to come into campus because then I get work done in a good way. And I like feeling I have a workday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So with anger - my sleep medication stopped working entirely so I spent an hour and a half thinking about this last night - I think there is a couple things that come to mind for me. And the first is that I somewhere along the way got trained pretty well to think that when I express anger to another person that person immediately responds back, lashes out in a much bigger way, so like a very childish burning and physical. Like, my sister who was two years older than me would hit me; I would hit her back. She would hit me really hard. And so my dad would be annoyed with me and I would express some complaint and he would explode. [00:03:03]</p>

<p>And the other half of that is that my experience of people being angry with me is that anger turns people from people who are reasonable and who love me and want to take care of me to people who - basically to monsters who want to hurt me. And I don't think it's exaggerating to say when my dad loses his temper he wants to hurt people. When my high school boyfriend lost his temper he wanted to hurt me. James's got that impulse but pretty much after our first fight it became very clear that that was not ever going to work. And so he is, he works really hard on that. It's only - he's only I think, yes, he's only said things that were deliberately meant to hurt me a handful of times since the times we've been together and we've had a big ass fight. [00:04:20]</p>

<p>And then another side of that is that when I get angry that means that I will become this monster and I don't want to hurt people. But now I got all of this rage at myself and I want to hurt myself and that's really scary. Does that thread follow for - I mean does it make sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. I mean I think I sort of follow your train of thought there and you can see the blue line about how dangerous and overwhelming it feels when people are explosively angry at you including yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I'm really - I have to really steel myself to say things that I know are going to provoke anger in other people and so I have to really steel myself to say when I'm angry. And usually I plan ahead and I'm actually pretty good at diffusing situations at this point - maybe I'm deprived in life - and end up saying this is what I need. This is why what you did wasn't acceptable in as gentle a way as possible but that also doesn't budge. [00:06:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, kind of almost like a sort of diplomacy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm good at diplomacy. So I got some good stuff out of it. But I don't - but you're right. I don't know how to - anger just really, really scares me, my own and other peoples. And other - when people yell or are visibly angry around me in situations that don't have anything to do with me, my reaction to that is getting worse or has gotten worse recently. For several years after I broke up with Bryan I couldn't stand being around yelling at all. I just had to leave the room. And I got better with it, especially even when I was in the hospital and people would have outbreaks sometimes it wasn't so bad. It wasn't good but it wasn't so bad.</p>

<p>But this weekend James and I were coming home from the airport and there were two people, strangers to one another, shouting at each other on the train. I think somebody, I think the woman had tried to convert the man and he was really upset about it. And so it was this shouted competition about Christianity and I started crying; had to get off the train before my stop and wait for the next train. Yes, it didn't have anything to do with me but I just... [00:08:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes because it was really upsetting. I mean frightening but also sounds like upsetting. What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the other thing I did yesterday was I had an hour and a half conversation with my mom, which started because I was having a very good day and I applied for a job and was going home. And I was like okay I haven't talked to mom in three weeks or a month and she doesn't know that I'm dropping out of school - I'm dropping out of school - she doesn't know I'm taking a leave of absence; I need to keep her updated and I'm in a strong place where I could have a conversation with her. I really - it was a really good conversation. But it's pretty eerie the degree - basically most of our conversations right now center around depression because that's - in some ways she is the person who most understands what's happening to me and what I'm going through because we present in eerily similar ways. [00:10:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And so it's really helpful to hear kind of validations like oh you too can be like perfectly happy, totally forgotten that there's anything wrong in your life one minute and then in an hour be suicidal because you had a negative interaction with somebody. It's not like part of the normal depression spectrum so it's really nice to hear somebody else who has that. Yes, like you also have real problems in relationships with constantly trying to take care of other people even as you are the person who is sick. And then the danger to that is that she wants it to be more similar than we are, so sometimes she's not very good at hearing it when I make distinctions between us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was talking about having trouble because I feel that I'm pretty comfortable talking about being depressed with anybody. It's been part of my whole life so it's a stigma for it but I've never really received the brunt of that. I'm real lucky there, or so I've never noticed it. And people say how are you doing, and I say I'm taking a leave of absence. And they say why is that and I say oh I'm having some health issues. Oh what kind? Oh I'm real depressed, you know, that kind of thing. And everybody wants to tell me to exercise. And I... [00:12:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have a prescription apparently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well and I know exercise really does help depression and it probably would help if I exercise more but the fact of the matter is, it's not going to make it go away. Just everybody thinks they know where I'm coming from and so I'm having a hard time getting people to realize that this is actually a crisis for me and this is a life-, in my mind at least and I've not heard from my traders to the contrary, this is a life-threatening situation. And I'm having a hard time getting people to wrap their heads around that because they just don't want to hear about that. And then they want to fix that. So I'm talking to her about this and that's not what happens for her. For her it's - I mean she's talking and she was like oh it's the same thing for me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say that's not what happens for her, you mean that she doesn't get suicidal or do you mean other people don't respond to her the way they're responding?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That she's not having the same difficulties with getting people to understand how sick she is. She says oh it's like that for me, and then she says oh with my family I'm in this tough situation where I don't want to go to family gatherings because they put me back in these really unhealthy places. But I don't want to lie about why I'm going but I can't say I'm going but I can't tell them that it's really their problem because she feels like she is the one that's receiving treatment who is trying to work things out and who is trying to get past these unhealthy patterns of behavior. And her family is still stuck in it but they think that she's the sick one. And so she's having problems where everybody else thinks that she's the sick one and I'm having problems where nobody - where I'm trying to say look I'm sick and nobody really understands that. [00:14:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like she's identified a page in your passing. Sort of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of yes, yes but because we both - but so she says oh that's the same situation and I say no it's not really the same situation. And she has just - so it's really good talking to her and also really difficult. And it's really emotionally draining. And I never know when we're just going to lose contact and I'm just going to feel abandoned. And also she just, she feels like - I mean she knows that she abandoned us and she feels horrible about it. And the only thing I can say to that yes, that what happened. But it will be okay. It happened...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's the only thing you can say to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I can't tell her that she didn't abandon us, you know. And I can't tell her that I don't feel abandoned or that I don't feel that she was not a mother for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So we're assuming that this thing to do would be to reassure and take care of her when this comes up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can't in good - you can't honestly do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and so all I can say, which is the truth, is I care what happened. I think that it has repercussions for my life and I think that's because both you and Papa were really sick for a really long time at the same time and so we just got left out. And it's not really, I mean in some sense it's not okay but you couldn't help being sick. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're working pretty hard here. [00:16:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm working pretty hard to try to say yes you are responsible for this but I have forgiven you and you should forgive yourself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the part that sounds like you're working harder on, to me, that you're trying to find a frame for it which is honest and you can say honestly but which takes care of her as much as possible I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, because I think about my mom, and where I started was thinking with anger with her, my mom just crumbles under anger. She can't, she thinks she can handle it. She thinks she - she said to me multiple times I know you're angry with me; you ought to be angry with me. You can tell me that you're angry with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you can't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't because she'll - I mean it's my considered opinion that she can't take it. And so I mean growing up, I knew that she had tried to commit suicide and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you were little?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I was little and I always thought that if I get angry with her, she'll kill herself. I mean it was the same way with Bryan because he threatened to kill himself when I broke up with him. I knew his anger was coming out of anything that he could take as a rejection but as my rejecting him he was so scared and so he just got so angry with me. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I'm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I'm losing you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it's okay. The thing I couldn't quite get over was he would get so scared and then he would get so angry at you. He would get so scared that you were going to reject him and then he would get angry because of how that fear made him feel? [00:18:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And because when he got angry at me I would capitulate. So I mean the argument that comes to my mind is we were in high school. I think we were seniors; we were in a play together. The worst play of my life. It was a disaster from start to finish. I was the, I got the lead, which in retrospect kind of sucked because I got date raped on staged and it was supposed to be a positive thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It's a show called the Robber Bridegroom, based on an Eudora Welty short story but either the show is not meant to be played straight and the director was just too stupid to understand it - I mean I feel justified in saying she's a very stupid woman; I know her pretty well - or it just should never have been written. But, so it was a really hot show. I was cast as the lead. The male lead, the person who date rapes me on stage and it's supposed to be okay, was somebody that Bryan hated, like bitter enemy. I could get along with him but didn't like him very much. He cheated. He should've gotten expelled and he didn't and I don't have time for that. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>Bryan was just increasingly frustrated and increasingly unhappy. Very, very depressed; very, very volatile. At one point at one rehearsal, he quit the play; he walked off. He left during rehearsal and was like I'm done, and he expected me to go with him. And I said no, no you're being childish. I mean he was being childish at this moment. I didn't say you're being childish but I had been trying to mediate and get everybody to a point where they could focus and work and he just storms out. And no, I'm not following you. So that night we meet up. He's so angry with me and I am so angry with him because I think I did exactly the right thing. He has no right to expect me to do that. And I'm not - basically it came down to I was saying just because I'm with you doesn't meant that I'm going to publicly support everything you do. Doesn't that I'm always going to agree with you and I'm not going to say I agree with you when I don't. And for him that was like the ultimate betrayal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect there's even more. I think you tend to leave out the way in which these things are actually a two-way street. You are quite clear and make sort of sense that you feel angry at his anger towards you because just because he's going to walk out doesn't mean you have to walk out. And - but the other side of it seems to me that he's walking out on you. You're there trying to get everybody to work and get everybody focused and sort of take care of things so this play can go forward. You're in this terrible situation having to get date raped on stage by some guy being an asshole. And in addition to his expecting you to follow him, he sure as hell isn't thinking about taking care of you. [00:22:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he was just very jealous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there was a part of the story you tend to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The part where...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...think of. You're sort of very careful to think of the way in which in that case is a part of how he wasn't treating you well or how he was expecting something of you that he does not have a right to expect. I mean you're pretty careful about noticing that sort of thing in this case and others. But I think the part you tend to not think about so much is the part where they could actually be doing something for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I don't think about that. Certainly didn't think about that with Bryan because I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying it because it's so surprising that it was going on and where you were coming from, but I think it's important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I honestly don't notice that I don't leave it out, or that I leave it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The point where I'm like wait a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Yes, yes. I feel like that he really was so good for me in a lot a ways and that I never had anybody tell me that I was beautiful before. I never had anyone who would tell me - just really love me before. That was really good for me. And in some ways that was kind of the seed that - he had planted the seeds of his own destruction or dumping because eventually I started to think about myself as a loveable person. And then I was like well you're going to have to do better. You need to treat me with love. [00:24:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's the thing. I didn't know that he was also that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean in some ways he's like - I've avoided the whole eating disorder path, which I could very well have gone on, and I think a lot of that is that for the past 10 straight years I've been with men who thought I was really, really sexy and told me so all the time. And that's really important, yes, that's really good. And he was just interesting. He was just smart and liked the same things I did and was a companion in a good way. But yes, always a really bad person. Well not a bad person but really a bad person for me.</p>

<p>So I mean the way that ended up with was I started out by yelling back and saying no that's not right, and then I turned into me trying to comfort him and get him to stop yelling at me. And then it turned into just me not saying anything at all and him yelling at me. And then it turned into him breaking up with me dramatically and like dumping me on a friend's front doorstep. I thought the friend was home; the friend wasn't home. I was alone in the middle of a suburb at night, and [inaudible at 00:26:43] border. I didn't have a cell phone; I didn't know anybody and I ended up knocking on the neighbor's doors and calling the school and they came back and got me. [00:26:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. He would've given you a ride or something or you were going to stay with your friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was, yes, I had been planning - I'd been planning we were just going to go on a date and we had the pass to go on a date and be back by 11. But I was like okay, you drop me off at my friend's and she'll drive me home. But she wasn't there and he didn't check. And then the next day he came back and said I'm so sorry I can't live without you. And we got back together. And that happened one more time but that was basically the pattern of all the fights. Teachers are stupid. Why would I get in the car with him after - like after the first time that he drove recklessly with me in the car, I should have just been like no, I'm never driving with you again. That's it. Why did I do that? [00:28:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How reckless was he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty fucking reckless. There was one time where he was driving really fast and yelling at me and was tailgating another guy ruthlessly in the middle of this Yuppie neighborhood - actually it's not, it wasn't, not Yuppie. Kind of like genteel, southern, old mining neighborhood - and the guy got out of his car, stopped, got out of his car and came to Bryan and yelled at him. It was that bad. And I was the passenger; I didn't do anything except to say slow down. He didn't slow down. You know, he never hit me but he would do that kind of physically intimidating thing. Like I'd be standing and he'd punch the wall next to me. A rifle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he would...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might see him at a wedding in a week or two.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that'll be exciting. He got fat. I am ashamed at how much pleasure that brings me. Yes, he started drinking in college and didn't realize the extra caloric intake. And he doesn't like to exercise. [00:29:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I was - I don't know. I always just, I felt like if I could protect him, he wouldn't do that great. That's how I felt. That's how I felt and it's still, with my mom I protect her. But I'm still honest with her. But I'm still honest with her so I'm trying to find a way for it in that relationship. But we had a really good conversation. It was really - I think it was helpful. She talks about how she felt so close to us when we were infants, one and two, and how she knew everything we needed and she knew exactly what to do and she was so close. And then she just lost that. And I think she's just constantly grieving over losing her children. What am I going to say? I mean I don't need her any more. I mean I do in some ways. I want her; I mean I want to be in a relationship with her and it helps me to talk with her about the depression and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I find there are ways she can get with her children.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean she did. I asked if she thought about last year (ph) last night. I wasn't sure how that was going to go but it went well. She said she had but she was - she didn't think that - she was afraid that she was not going to be emotionally able to take care of a child. So I can see why. I think there's probably some outside support in these situations. I don't know. I feel like she wants, she wants us back when we were one and four and seven. She wants us back at that age and I'm like it's just not happening. And she knows it cognitively but that's what she's grieving for. [00:32:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and there you are having to take care of her. I don't mean because of you, I mean it reiterates all the problems that she hasn't said about. In other words, I mean there's important ways that epitomizes why she can't be there for you now let alone before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I like to talk to her, which is a big step forward from a year or two ago, but I can't talk to her when I'm having a bad day. I can only - I call her when I'm at my best and when I can support another person's emotions. Oh, that reminds me. I needed to ask you this. So if I needed - this girl that was in a group therapy session that I was in briefly clearly really needs a friend. You know me and I was like yea, let me know if you want to go out for coffee anytime and talk; sometimes it can be really helpful. And I know exactly what's going to happen, which is where I'm going to be an emotional support for her and it's going to be really draining and hard for me. I don't have to do that, right? [00:34:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No you don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I was just oh she just really needs somebody and I'm just not that person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and that's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a hard time with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am avoiding my roommate these days. She's in exam stress and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She needs one too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. You know, people come to me for comfort and for advice and I like that. I am really proud of that but it's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean that's one of the most difficult things about being so depressed and having - I mean another thing Mom and I were talking about as being the same for us is having reserves that you call upon and then get depleted in times of stress, like you have to build up your reserves. And I don't have the same kind of emotional reserves that I usually do. I just can't take a conversation in which I'm listening and being sympathetic and giving advice, I can't do it as much or as long like I - I don't know. I feel... [00:36:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I sometimes feel just trapped, like I need to get away. I can't take - I can't do the empathy. I can't take on another person's sorrow because I've got a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean it starts to get sort of evocative and claustrophobic for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Certainly claustrophobic. I'm not sure what you mean by evocative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other person's sorrow or upset or difficulty evokes your own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes; sometimes not. Sometimes I find myself [inaudible at 00:37:01] and sometimes I find myself thinking but this is so easy, why is it hard for you? This is so much easier than the things that I'm going through. And I hate that, I hate that. I think one of my favorite phrases ever coined was a friend who on Facebook - it was a Facebook conversation - said look guys, we don't need a suffering Olympics. There is no hierarchy in suffering. But - yes. And it's hard for me to say my being tired, even if I'm not up to - even if I'm not sad, if I'm just tired and I'm at a low ebb because I've had a hard day and I need to be careful with my mood right now, that's more important than this thing that you're going through right now that is suffering and I can't listen to that. I have a hard time saying no to that. So, I haven't been as good of a friend or roommate. Also could be because I've been avoiding people. [00:38:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure that makes you a less good friend; it may make you a friend with limitations of the sort that everybody has in one way or another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:38:54].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what I mean, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm completely at my wits end and have given all I can give and am really worried about crashing to the point of being suicidal, so I think I need to excuse myself right now. I don't think that's bad friend behavior.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell myself this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I remember something about a turtle, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I hurt one of my friend's feelings yesterday, and I actually don't feel very bad about this because I think this was wholly on him. He was one who told me to exercise for the second time around. I told him that he - he didn't remember from conversation to conversation that - he's not a very good friend. He didn't remember from conversation to conversation that depression was what I was dealing with. And so he said I probably told you to exercise last time didn't I? And I was like yes. I said okay look. I said basically what I said to you yesterday which was most people go through mild to moderate depression. I don't want you to treat me like that. That's a big deal. That's hard. But what I'm going through is something really different and it just is. And he is one of those people who I know has gone through moderate depression. Having a really hard time finishing his degree and is kind of just like an Eeyore sort of person anyway. And he just got really quiet changing the plate and then left after a while. But still, Dude I just told you that I'm taking a leave of absence because I'm suffering under depression and you talk about your own problems? [00:40:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, what the fuck?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Fine, go away. I don't have a lot invested in him, but I still feel bad that saying what I needed to say was something that hurt him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds like there's really - I would imagine a few things that make [inaudible at 00:41:37] for the people so crucial. Is it a concern of the moment or are you worried that the bottom's going to drop out if you told him your amount of pain? But also I think maybe at times a lot of what you feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's one of the things I justify my existence with. And not - the thing is making me feel good about myself in a way that's healthy and making me feel good about myself in a way that's unhealthy. And this is I think both. It's like I have to do X, Y, and Z in order to feel like I gotten through today in an okay way. But it's also I'm really proud that I am a good listener and that I apparently give good advice. [00:42:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, why wouldn't you be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm really proud of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, no it sounds like the part where it gets trickier is where you feel like you could end up with a justification, your sense in that. If you're not up to a probably at times certainly a high standard around it, then you're of little value or something. [inaudible].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And also just I don't know, I just grieve that this depression is taking a lot of these things from me. I can't live the life I want to live right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes me think too of your mother wondering how much the way this matters is because of how's the value to her? Like anything else it's a value to parent. You know like if she wanted you to be a soccer star and you were a soccer [inaudible at 00:44:02].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, well that's another thing that she and I have eerily in common. I think we both place a large, incredible amount of our self worth on how well we take care of other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I'm saying is I imagine you are her little child here. I mean so much I know of how you feel with her is not like you're her little child, but I guess what I'm saying is I think this may be one way which you are is that I suspect you feel like you were always a value for her for how you were able to look out for her or take care of her or pay attention to what was going on with her. [00:44:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not - in very, very subtle ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Kids are incredibly attuned to these kinds of things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because she wasn't conscious and she is not conscious and that's why I have to think that's the ways I would be valuable to her. I think partly because she was raised by very narcissistic parents and that was her value to them. And so she was kind of set out into I'm not going to be this mother. But she was so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she can't deal with having leaned on you or needing you that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but she was so sick and she really needed her kids to be a certain kind of kids and really wanted that. I mean I - that's one of the things I remember most vividly about my emotions at that age - at seven, eight, nine, ten - is not wanting to be with my mother so that she could take care of me but wanting to be with my mother so that I could take care of her. And so that shaped me, wishing that she would take care of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:46:15]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Over there (inaudible) by the clock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Yawns) So, uh—so—so despite being away doing something fun this weekend, um—I'm feeling super irritable. And—and I mean, actually, I ended up feeling really irritable over the weekend, too, sometimes. I went to a fan convention. (inaudible) attend a sci-fi convention, and it's mostly focused on books. Um—and, so first, like, I made a couple of mistakes, like, kind of going in. The biggest one being is that I really only liked—I really liked having my own bed and to only share my hotel room with one person. [00:01:29].8</p>

<p>And last minute Lucy (sp) said, like—asked me if I could—if she could share a room with me. And I was like, oh, sure. Whatever. And then the next day I went, no, I don't want to share my bed with anyone. But at that point, it was too late. So that was kind of frustrating. And she wouldn't say yes definitively until Friday, which is when the convention had already started. I had asked her to text me or e-mail me yes or no. And what ended up happening is she texted me saying, oh I'm having a shoe emergency. Do you think that this kind of shoe would go with jeans? And then two more texts about traffic. And then she was there. [00:02:24].1</p>

<p>So I was kind of like—I don't know why I'm involved with this shoe emergency, but ok. Um—and like one of the—sort of—when we were unpacking, one of the first things she said was like—oh, you're gonna be so happy and so proud, I went out and bought clothes by myself. And that ended up really (inaudible) also—um—mostly because, like when phrased that way, I was like, oh that's kind of weird. Like—it's kind of weird for—it's weird for me to have another adult say, I went out and bought clothes by myself, because, like—it's what we usually—like—people usually do when they're—it kind of reframed (ph) for me the act of shopping with her, which I already don't want to do any more, but like, I don't know. [00:03:30].1</p>

<p>It's like I kind of just got so tired (ph) just thinking about it. Um (pause) in a way where I felt like—I don't know, like, you know, like an unpaid personal shopper or—like I was enabling some kind of like—not enabling—like that I kind of had stepped into this role of, like, care-giver or care-taker, which I really didn't want to—which then got highlighted again because she—she forgot something at home, like underwear or socks or something. And she said—she made—I was like, oh, yeah, you should just go out to the mall and buy some. It's right nearby. And she kind of joked or commented that she has a work concierge as a perk through work that will just run errands for $5 an hour. [00:04:27].6</p>

<p>And that was really off-putting and weird—um—for like a variety of reasons. Like I—the idea that work is just sort of subsidizing someone running my errands is something that I've never conceived of. Like, I've never worked anywhere where that was like something that anyone got. So like I mean at the University like no one really does that. And I don't know—like most of the people I know like with various jobs like that is not a perk. Or if it is it's like, oh, yeah, someone like way above me has like this weird—they send their intern out for like their dry cleaning. [00:05:31].8</p>

<p>So that felt kind of weird. And then I was thinking, well why are—why are you sharing a room with me if your job pays you enough that it subsidizes some concierge? Because the—like one of the reasons I said yes was like, oh, you can't afford a hotel room on your own, I totally get it. Like, that's what's going on? But then I'm like, but wait, that's not—actually I felt like why did I just inconvenience myself when I think you could have afforded the room regardless? [00:06:16].5</p>

<p>And then she made the comment that she wasn't sure she wanted to go, she's been very stressed. And I'm like, oh, you know, that really sucks. And she just almost decided not to, but her husband had said, well, you know, if you're feeling grumpy and you just want to, like, sit in our apartment and read your Kindle, you can do that in a hotel room, also. I was like kind of, yeah, fair point, but I don't really want someone being really grumpy in my hotel room all weekend. So I don't—it like—it really kind of—I felt like everything really got off on like the wrong foot –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like with her for the weekend. And we—I was like, ah, this is frustrating. And oh—I felt like—like what—if I had like actually remembered that I don't like—if I'd actually put value on like me not liking sharing a room with more people and sharing a bed physically, then I wouldn't have had to deal with all that. [00:07:24].4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was (inaudible) on myself for, I guess for putting myself in that situation. Like not valuing what I wanted enough—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or what I want or like or need or –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like as much as she was irritating you, you were also annoyed with yourself for not having any (inaudible) value of what mattered to you more so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which would have kind of kept you from having to deal with all this crap with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Um—and part of why I really like having my own room and sharing it with like one person is that I look at it as a way to like get away from people or to get away from stress. And I'm like, I'm just going to go to my room and sit down. Um—and I felt like she was really wanting something from me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:08:32].5</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whatever it was it was like, but I just want to sit here and take a nap or—I don't know. The person that I shared the room with—I think I've shared a room with him twice, he's my friend, Julian. And while he has his own, like, neuroses and worries, he doesn't generally drop it in my lap. Like, he does a little bit, like he was really worried about attendance for his—for a reading he was doing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he just seemed to spread like he was nervous at me. And I was like, yep, you know, it could happen. But then he was also kind of spreading it around, too, like he was talking [inaudible] being nervous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. [00:09:21].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. I didn't feel like he was expecting much more than like encouraging like—it'll work out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. He was looking for that level of support and reassurance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it got more—do you think more involved?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like while I was slightly—like he could sort of—after the reading he—he was sort of like—kind of suffered from (inaudible) in half, like worrying, like, there were a lot more people this year, it was really good. Last year, there were only three people and, you know, maybe it did go well, maybe it didn't. But it was kind of—I was like that's like (pause) he—he wasn't asking me for reassurance. He was sort of announcing it, I guess. [00:10:21].9</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I didn't feel I was cut out for that (ph). So (pause) he—and it just made—like, I ended up feeling more, I don't know. Because I was feeling stressed about sharing the room with Lucy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I had also asked my ex-boyfriend Elliott if he could drive me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 'Cause he goes—he likes it, and he goes real early, and he has a car and whatever. Um (pause) and I often worry about asking him for favors because I worry that—sometimes that he's still in a way hung up on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though we haven't dated in quite a while. And he has a new girlfriend, and all those other things. Like, I don't know. I still worry about it. Um (pause) and the whole weekend, he was super like, he was kind of clingy and following me around and wanting to do everything with me—which made—and then—which also was super frustrating. And I don't know. I was thinking like, oh, I should not have asked for a ride. Like, I should have figured something else out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:11:54].9</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause). And I could—there was this one point where I just was like—I really want Elliott to go do something else that's not like with me in the hotel room. Or like kind of standing quietly with—like while I'm talking to my friends. And he asked if he could take a nap in my hotel room. It was like 7:00 at night. And—'cause he wanted to (inaudible) but earlier in the evening I said—I was like—I was like, well, I don't know. And then I said, you know, I can't really talk to everyone. Lucy's not here right now. I don't feel comfortable just—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Which is mostly me being like, I don't want you to do this, but –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to push it off. And I was so relieved (inaudible) that he left and—ah, I don't know. Like, I feel bad that I was kind of using him for a car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:12:52].8</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then again, I—I don't know. I might be in denial about the fact that—about whether—the likelihood of him kind of puppy-dogging me if I, I guess, implicitly invite him. I don't know. Because it's not like I'm inviting him to a party, I'm inviting him—I'm saying, are you going to this event and can I catch a ride? But like I feel that this attention from him is almost like, I've invited you to this party, so—I should somehow be involved in him staying entertained all weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [00:13:38].3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I get it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) you'd rather?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no, definitely. Um (pause) but see like—by Sunday afternoon I was just super tired, cranky—like I had a—like good times at various points. But Saturday night I was just—I was frustrated at kind of everyone. I was frustrated that Elliott was being really clingy. I was frustrated that I just didn't say, no, you can't sleep in my hotel room. Um (pause) and Lucy had offered to pick something up for me at my house. And then she forgot. And she was just gone from the hotel room all day. And I texted her a couple of times, being like, so where are you? Like, are you still around? What's happening? And didn't get any response, which—like it was unclear to me whether she had left left, and wasn't coming back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:14:53].4</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—also frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and I don't know. Like she said something that actually hurt my feelings in a really odd way. Um, so Friday night and Saturday night, I ended up having like a sudden small room party with like 10 to 12 people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just like, oh I guess this is happening.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I like, you know, invited two people up. And then they were like, oh can I bring a couple of friends, too? And I was like, oh yeah, you can bring friends too. Come on up. And I'm like, oh my God. What have I done? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:15:37].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The next thing you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh. (laughs) And like, I was, you know, fine with it, but I felt—I was just kind of like, oh, I didn't—I was like, I really should ask my roommates before I like spontaneously spring a room party on them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like no one was really upset, so I was like, ok. I guess that happened, and it was enjoyable, and I did like like seeing them and whatever. But um (pause) so Saturday night it—it—it like (pause) it was very much like Julian and an author friend of his were like, oh let's go up to the hotel room and have drinks instead of paying the room—the bar party—prices. So I'm like, yeah sounds great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:16:29].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then someone else was like, oh can I come up? And I'm like, oh yeah. And so—like a friend of a friend came up who is like really into cocktails, and then two other friends of mine were like, oh yeah let me go up and (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there were a lot of people um (pause) so—and another thing that had been going on—like there was like an event going on at the con—like a bunch that I wasn't attending—because I was like it's in a really big, crowded, hot, noisy room. And I just don't find it very enjoyable, like—you know, the consumer (ph) (inaudible) I'm just like eeehhh. And also it's bad—a spontaneous bad fiction writing contest. And whoever writes their like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) [00:17:20].9</p>

<p>CLIENT: —does their worst, wins. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Although it's funny, I kind of like—I feel like I've got the joke.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:17:29].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: They do the same thing every year. So I'm like after the first four times, I feel good—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like other people I knew were going (inaudible) that again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—at one point at the party I think there it was half the people I didn't know, like the party in my rooms. I was like, ok. Like, you're a friend of a friend, you're someone that I met—may have met today. And Lucy made the comment, like, you know—how do you like—I—I don't understand—how do you know all these people? Or (pause) or how do you have all these like, you know—how do you know all these people and how do you have all these friends up here? I was kind of like, I don't know. They're just people and friends of friends. And she said, like but how do you do that? I mean, you hate being around people. You—you don't like people. You're always going—like, you're always going—you never want to do things where there are a lot of people. And I was just like—like what? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:18:28].7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like for a variety of reasons. Like partially she because sounded kind of—it didn't feel joking. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, the impression I get of the tone from what you've described is like she was being—she was lashing out a little bit because she was jealous?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It felt like she was jealous and also part of that is kind of like—but I've tried to meet people a certain way –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) so why isn't it working for you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) with this weird vibe part of (pause) um (pause) like how do you know all these high status social people—high status socially—like people socially when you aren't like networking or whatever? Um (pause) when doing it like I don't really like—I mean, I know some of these people are very popular, but it's not like I'm friends with them—I'm friends with them because they're awesome, not because of –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:19:41].2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just—I really don't think that I—I don't hate people. And it's not that I hate large groups of people or—like I take naps a lot during conventions just in part because I really like naps. And also because I find it tiring. Like I still really enjoy seeing people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it was just that—it was just so like wrong-headed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like, what are you saying about me? Like slash—I don't understand how you—you—like (pause)—so like I will often joke with Ashby saying but you hate everyone. And Ashby will be like, that's true. But partially that's something she says about herself all the time and she honestly does hate people. So, you know, I know it's not a sting and I know that I'm teasing her about it a little, but this stuff—I was like but that's not even true, so it's a—kind of weird and hurtful that you said that when it just like (pause) it can't really be like a slightly insulting tease when it's wrong, because –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. 021:04.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: —then it's just kind of insulting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and it just feels—I just really didn't know what—I just kind of—I was like, (inaudible) to say back. Like I—like, I felt very flummoxed by it. And I kind of just like shrugged, and was like, well I like people. (pause) And went on socializing. And so at the end of the night—like everyone kind of left all at once, which was convenient (laughs). I was like, yes, you're all leaving right at midnight, I can go to sleep. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and so everyone kind of like trickled out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then so she would ask me who various people were. And I was like, oh you know, that's X, that's Y. But then her next question was but why should I know them—(pause) which I think—I—I don't know. Like I just felt like well, you might know them because they're local geeks or they're friends of friends, but —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I really don't know how to answer that, like I'm not sure what you're asking me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt like she was just asking but why are they important or what is the value of knowing them? Like I don't know, it's hard to describe. Like kind of like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) she had asked in the first place who they are? </p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although she had asked in the first place who they are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn't the who are they? It was the why should I know them –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I—I get it –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —it wasn't as though you started talking about these people as you though you thought it was important for her to know them and then she asked why would I need to know them. It was that she asked who they were, you answered her question, and then she said, why should I know them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:22:49].0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As though you were sort of implying that she should or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I feel like—yeah, it—it was kind of like I don't—it was—it felt very like I'm not sure—like where did this come from? I don't know why you should know them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nor do I really care particularly. Like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and at one point she asked that of Julian. And he—his comment was like, well you know, she—this person is a local author and geek and—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —whatever. And it was this, sort of like, but why should—but why—but why should I know them? Like why do you think I know them? And (pause) it was just very like—I can't—like I have a hard time describing it, but it just felt very odd. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:23:49].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also (pause) I mean feel like at a—if we're all at a sci-fi convention, there is—you sort of presume, like, well, you know them because they like some of the same things you do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I have my (inaudible). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it never does. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Um (pause) Is it kind of disconcerting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean the other aspect that—I've thought of in other contexts and I don't know if it was really happening at this point was that—there are people who are like well-known fans, like oh that's that person who runs the multi-cultural steampunk site.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:25:19].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, oh that's the person who this. And so like people know them, so they're like Internet famous or fandom famous or whatever. And so like I have encountered people asking me like—well, everyone's like, oh so what do you write, if I hang out with author friends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or—or like fan fiction friends or whatever. And I'm always like, nope, I don't write, I don't—any of that. I'm just here with some friends. And I had joked with one of my friends for a little while, I was like, um my claim to fame is being friends with famous people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:26:02].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not really because (inaudible) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —whatever. Um (pause) and so there are a lot of people who (inaudible) like whoever you seek out, like fandom famous people, to become their friend or to be like a fan of them, and kind of, like try to gain social capital through that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And all this stuff. And it –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of social climbing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it always creeps me out a lot (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and so when people—sometimes the people are sort of like, yeah but why are you friends with this person? I just feel like they're asking what is—like what value do you get from that, in terms of social capital? Like what do you get out of that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like their friendship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that do for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Which is like—I don't—it's not—it's pretty much never what I'm thinking. Um (pause) and the things—I think like, oh which friends of mine are doing X,Y, and Z, like important things in terms of like, oh I really want to find someone who is organizing programming for this event. Ok, who do I know that knows someone?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:27:27].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not –that's me thinking, ok who among your friends knows someone? It's not who do I become friends with in order to –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and so (pause) I guess because I don't—I've never—I don't—been—really created objects that people are fans of. Like, I haven't written a story that people really like or drawn something that people really like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) I guess I find it—like a little—I don't know. (pause) It's not like a person's been a fan of what I've created and therefore also interested in me. I feel like what are you a fan of? Like are you a fan of the Internet persona, which is me? Are you a fan of the idea of have—that I have a high—high status friends? Like... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. You mean when people try to become friendly with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Like—so I guess what it is, is generally I assume someone is being friendly with—because they –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They want to be your friend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And when it seems like, no they want to know like why I'm important, how I'm important, so therefore what is the value of my friendship?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:29:07].4</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get very creeped out. Um (pause) actually off-putting is probably the better word. Like I just sort of feel like oh—I don't—like if that's what you're interested in, I'm not (pause) if you're interested in like what you can get out of this friendship, I'm really not interested in that any more. If you want to be like a—I guess like a professional networking contact, sure, but like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't do that on commission, so —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —whatever. I don't know. I think—and also because we were sharing a bed, I was kind of like—because she was kind of lying in bed, and I was, I think, playing with my phone or a book and she said—asked me these questions. And I'm kind of like eh—like I can't—A, I find these questions off-putting, and B, I have no way to really exit this conversation because I'm sitting right next to you in the bed. (inaudible) And um (inaudible) [00:30:23].7 </p>

<p>(1.5 min. silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I'm ultimately not really sure what to say. On the one hand, while you're talking about it kind of pretty clearly on the theme of the way—I think you're feeling used by Lucy in various ways. And (pause) or like—to her is probably you're (inaudible) kind of general and partly wishing either you — you were better at or it was clearer how to kind of set boundaries about, you know, what people want from you. This sort of (inaudible) part to me as I listen is when I think about it and ok, so what is it you want from me? You know? Like uh—(pause) I guess if I think about it (pause) I wonder if—I—I think it's (pause) I wonder if it's hard (pause) sometimes (pause) I mean, I know in a way, you're just talking, and you're talking (inaudible) of your head, and you're sort of talking about, you know, why you're feeling a bit irritable and why things over the weekend were difficult. Um (pause) and I'm sure you don't have to want anything from me, but I can try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) [00:34:47].7</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So good luck. (laughs) They get—but I guess with you I—I know that can be—the reason—one of the reasons I'm bringing it up is I know that can be—you can be I think anxious or at times a bit inhibited at—anxious is better. I'm not going to lie to you. I know it's anxious—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [00:35:10].0</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —about kind of leaning on people, which I think is related to the part of it that's about difficulties like pushing back on people. I guess I imagine you feel like you're making a kind of demand of them in saying no—that may be part of what you find difficult to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was a little like –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean part of this was also having my morning coffee shop person being like you look really miserable and cranky. I was like oh, that's really awkward for me. (laughs) That like I'm just walking down the street and apparently I look really cranky—and I just feel like (pause) that the reason—one of the reasons I didn't call a friend or chat a friend or text or whatever is I feel sort of like (pause) I feel too—I feel—I feel like I'm just being cranky and negative, and just pissy, and I'm like why would any of my friends want to listen to me be cranky? [00:36:34].2</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I—are you also feeling like you're being that way with me? Like that I'm sort of—somewhere in your mind I'm somewhere over here, and that everybody is kind of recognizing how kind of cranky and pissy (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, like that's fine because I'm a therapist or whatever, but—ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just more like it doesn't matter if I'm really cranky –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You mean here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because like, well, that's what you do (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm sort of like—I just—like I don't just want to become ornery all day. Like, I—I don't know. I'm just at work trying to write some e-mails and I'm just like—I just—I don't want to write to anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone at work. I just felt so cranky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your—you're not coming across to me as especially cranky or pissy. I mean, if you feel that way, ok. But it's too bad, is really what I mean. Is that –</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:37:38].5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But uh—uh (pause) it's coming across to me more as—I kind of noticed that you're sort of aggrieved about the things that happened where you felt not that well to hurtfully treat it (pause) uh—yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good to know. I'm (inaudible)—I hate to hear—I did think that like all my coworkers were just being like, wow grumpy person at work today, which—other—that happened on Thursday when my coworker just announced he was grumpy and he was going to remain that way for the next few months. And I'm like ok. And then was really grumpy for the whole day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:38:41].8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause)—and like there's things at work where it's just like I'm really annoyed about and don't—like I'm really appalled over all this (inaudible) –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —all the time, and I'm—I worry about sort of uh—I guess not being as politic or polite or –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —whatever. Like the e-mail that I would like to send him versus what I actually probably will send him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like don't want to send the wrong one. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and sort of all of that mixed up with—and then I had this probably like good/bad weekend and I'm mostly focusing right now on the parts that—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I didn't like, even though there was other alternative (inaudible), like—0:39.46.4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Again (pause) at least to me, it doesn't sound—it doesn't come across like you're running down the whole weekend. (pause) You know or you're—I didn't have the impression that the whole weekend went badly. Um (pause) which I know you have spoken differently about some of the things you were describing might have been how it sounded, but it didn't, actually. (pause) Which, again, I guess I mentioned (pause) sort of the idea that, at least, to me, it seems like the kind of negativity is at a much lower volume than I guess it sounds—maybe feels like to you? [00:40:47].0</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I feel like I'm transparently in a bad mood. Um (pause) which, is, you know, well that's not fun for anyone. But it is good to know that I am not transparently in a horrible mood. (laughs) Which, I don't know (pause)—I mean, if I—I do find it really hard to sort of—I do find it hard to often talk to friends when I'm feeling just like—and then these 20 horrible things happen, and I'm really cranky. And no, you can't fix it. I'm just annoyed or upset or mad at myself or whatever. I also think part of it is also seeing (pause) if—actually, it's a couple of people, so—well, it's Lucy, and my friend Jenna, and—on a professional level mostly there's Jenna. They're just getting very like (pause) I don't know. So Jenna is very social—is very nervous that she's imposing on people and that her friends don't want her to be around and that everyone hates her. So on the one hand, when she says that, I'm like that's not true. And like—and I'm like happy to tell you that, but there's a point where I'm just like I'm done telling you this. [00:43:04].6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if you keep on telling me like every few minutes that I hate you, I just don't want to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Like kind of like Ashby?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like I'm done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to go. I have to go other places. And (pause) so Jenna was doing some of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it was also she was obsessing over whether or not she could ask someone to do something, and whether or not she was –</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —annoying them by asking, and—this and that, and I'm like I don't know, you should just ask. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like instead of just spending an hour with me talking about whether or not you can ask someone to give you a ride home and what it means and do they hate you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:43:56].1</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) So the way that that was just irritating me, I'm just like oh god am I doing that other people?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Um (pause) Right. Like now you're worried—I guess—I mean not so much with me, but there's sort of an implication that you're putting me in that same situation and I'm going to have to remind you every five minutes that you're not really that cranky or in a bad mood. I mean—I don't—I know that you don't think that's what really will go on, nor—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —would that be a problem in a place like this. But I do think that sort of relates in some way to a worry about imposing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's time. We should stop —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: —unfortunately for now. I will see you next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll (inaudible). Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's ok. </p>

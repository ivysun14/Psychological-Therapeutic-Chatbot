<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, how have you been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you tell me, do I look like I've been better?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood is better.  I want some of what you're on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let me just say a couple things.  This is my third week back at work—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I mean after we had come in the last time, you said I could go back to work.  I did go back to work about a week later, I think it was right after [DEIDENTIFIED]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did go back to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, actually, let me get us on track.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I saw you [DATE], your mood had improved dramatically over the last ten days.  Your appetite was good, you were gaining some weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Too good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were a little expansive.  You had a decreased need for sleep, sleeping 5 hours, good energy, you were exercising, your self esteem was good.  You were not grandiose, you were not suicidal, you were not hopeless or helpless.  Concentration was fine, you were reading, you were getting pleasure normally, so we thought you were in a good state.  You finally dug out of the most horrific depression that I had almost ever seen but you may have gone a little past the mark.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my wife's worry, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so at that point and, you know, you're on this very aggressive cocktail, Nortriptyline with Parnate with Zyprexa and Lithium.  What we did was we pulled back on the Nortriptyline some and we raised the Zyprexa some and kept you on the Lithium and Parnate where they were.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The Parnate, we went from 70 to 40.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you went down on Parnate also.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	After I called you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was real quick, after we spoke, right, right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was a quick taper down during that first week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so in this month, how has your mood been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My mood has been super.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mood is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From my perspective.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you a bit elated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel good about everything, I don't know if you call that elated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does he seem elated to you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't understand what the word elated meant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like high.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't say I'm high.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well your wife says yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you'll have to take her word.  You know how to filter, between the two of us now, you should know how to filter it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I should average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably somewhere in between.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, well you're saying normal, she saying high, so somewhere between normal and high is still high.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true no matter how you look at it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well at least no one is saying low, no one is bringing the average down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's no low feeling here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Listen, before we get to anything, it's great that you feel great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do, I really do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But what we have to do is make sure it's stable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's why I've come.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I don't want to get out of this state.  This is the state that's taken me a long time to get into and to see that effect, in [DEIDENTIFIED] years I don't think I've ever felt this way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Honest to God, I really do mean it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You feel like you've never felt—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This well about myself and my ability to do things.  I'm doing things that I would never have done before, never even thought I would do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Basically I'm one who would never make phone calls, I'd wait for somebody else.  I can't stay off the phone now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Now is this someone like you don't even know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a spare minute and I have to be talking to somebody and if it's like she's shopping, I'm talking to the person in the store, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a little annoying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well to you it's annoying, to me it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's having fun.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's having fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm having more fun than I've ever had in [DEIDENTIFIED] years, I have to be honest and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you thinking about sex a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, actually, in truth no.  I mean I love my wife—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do anything that shows bad judgement?  Are you doing anything that shows bad judgement?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my eyes no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Meandering, gambling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not to excess, not to excess.  I did take my mother in law to [DEIDENTIFIED] last weekend when my wife was in [DEIDENTIFIED] but really I wanted to take her because she likes to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so you didn't gamble more than you should?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no I did not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your mood is a little high.  Are you grandiose, are you over confident?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I may be a little more over confident than I have ever been in my life, that's for sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you a little arrogant these days?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Occasionally my wife will say that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm being honest, I'm being honest.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so in what way is he arrogant?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Believing that he's right when sometimes she doesn't think he's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah and like he'll, it's like his way, you know, and I heard his, I've heard him talk to his friends where he's really never been that aggressive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Assertive.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or assertive and he was assertive.  I said wow, I said that was some way you spoke to him, he says well he better get used to it, he says because now I'm going to, you know, I'm going to be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The new me, the new me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is the new me and I like the new me.  The best part of it is I like the new me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not sure how stable the new me is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't either but I need to stabilize it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I want to stay at this level.  Maybe my wife doesn't want me to stay at this level but I want to stay, let me put it this way, I want to stay in the same vicinity, let's put it that way, it may not be exactly this level—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But in the same kind of a plane anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Too good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gaining weight?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he's gained.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've gained some weight and I don't know whether it's the Zyprexa that's causing me to, it's not too much so my will power is not real great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been trying to cut back though and I'm going to start doing more exercising.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that you talk too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do your thoughts race?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My mind is always running, yep, it's always in gear right at the moment.  I'm always thinking about something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not, I don't have a lot of dead time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your self esteem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would say better than I've ever felt myself before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you've never seen him this way.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even when you married him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No and even when he was on ECT he wasn't at this level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my I say this, honestly, thank you for not going that route and trusting me with the medication—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was dicey.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it was and I thought two times, two weeks ago I was ready to be hauled off to the ECT.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you could barely move and you scared me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I found that you knew what you were doing with the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now before, through all the other depressions, you've never been manic, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Never even close to manic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've never felt this way coming out of, the other times that I came out of depression.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There were times after the ECT was finished, there were people that said, wow, he really has gotten so much better and, you know, may be we should go through ECT.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was better but now he's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not the same.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I came out the other times, it's not the way I feel right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well, listen, we're using rocket fuel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I realize that but if I need to stay on rocket fuel, I'm willing to stay on rocket fuel for the rest of my life if I can feel like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the problem is brains don't allow you stay with this state.  You know, you're really not getting in enough trouble for us to care about the state you're in, all we care about is that you not go into another depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And believe me, I do not wan tot do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The problem with being this high above normal is that it's setting up the next depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we have to bring you back, definitely above and we want you feeling good and engaged and even elated and, you know, confident but a little lower.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I trust whatever you say.  Believe me, I've gone from a point where I didn't trust you to whatever you say I'm going to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean it, I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're, are you sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not as good as I should be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many hours do you sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes not more than three, sometimes five, it's kind of sporadic.  I get on the computer and I'm doing things then before I know it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you doing on the computer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sort of jumping around with different web pages, some of it where we have our money involved, just trying to look at that and trying to think about how to really, more towards our future.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you buy and sell stocks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have gotten into it in a small way, a small way.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You see that's when he is arrogant when I say—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Believe me—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He gets a little arrogant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In a small way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right but your judgement may not be great, you might be too optimistic—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the state you're in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I could be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you need to be careful because people in this state—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Think everything is going to go their way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and they've gotten themselves in trouble.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't tend to see myself in trouble.  I don't think my wife is going to let me get in trouble, she's pretty, she's pretty smart.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He kinda does what he wants.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's not true.  She's a pretty strong woman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully you won't keep things from her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I haven't, I've not kept anything from her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And no suicidal thinking, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fabulous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that you're irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it is, it's a very small portion of my time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that he's irritable?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What percentage of the time do you think that I'm irritable?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	About maybe twenty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe twenty in what way?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Twenty percent of the time you're irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh okay, I see and I would say more like 10% but somewhere in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your fuse is shorter than it used to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My fuse always was short.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Short but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always did have a short fuse but it's quick, it passes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It does pass.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't carry it, I don't hold a grudge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't hold a grudge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unlike my wife who tends to hold it.  She's Italian from Sicilian heritage and tends to have a little bit more of a grudge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you find that you're getting pleasure normally, are you enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm enjoying things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now why are you only getting three to five hours sleep?  I'm giving you enough medicine to knock you out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I, there's just so many things I want to do that I just don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So I can't sleep because he's on the computer and I'm up at three o'clock, sometimes two, three o'clock in the morning, how come you're not in bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to be more diligent about getting to bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're not tired the next day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes you are, you said you were irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I was tired that one day when I got two hours of sleep with your mother.  I took her mother to [DEIDENTIFIED].  We got home at her place at two thirty in the morning, we talked for another hour, she and I, till three thirty in the morning, it was four o'clock when I got to bed and I got up at seven and went to church at nine o'clock.  You tell me who's going to be irritable that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That [INAUDIBLE] even with work though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think you need to get a little more sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can warm things down.  Now the higher dose of the Zyprexa hasn't slowed you down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it hasn't slowed me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, what it's done is make him eat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I don't know but it seems like my appetite has gotten a little more—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ravenous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ferocious, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He can't control lit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well the Nortriptyline also can do that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it's, partially it is my own willpower.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Lithium and the Parnate, everything you're on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But when he was depressed, he it did not have that effect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He had no appetite.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he didn't have much of an appetite, no, not much at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But now that I'm back to work, I've been snacking less because the cupboard that had all the snacks in it is at home, although I bring a few with me to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're moving okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, although a week or so ago I did something to my back where it's killing me.  I went to the doctor, my local doctor on Friday and he's going to read the x—rays tomorrow and give me an idea if I pulled something out of whack or not but that's, I mean it's because of, it was just I think I lifted something the wrong way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now in the past when you came out depression, the Nortriptyline and Lithium was enough to hold—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I never had Lithium when I came out, it was just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you didn't have the Lithium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was just Nortriptyline.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nortriptyline and Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that was enough to hold him until he stopped taking those meds?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or started to decline on them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that was at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  I think we should go towards—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I attribute it and it may be wrongly so but when you switched to adding the Parnate, that's when things started to, started to come around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Parnate made the difference for you but you also, well yeah, so, well Parnate is the strongest antidepressant that exists.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It seemed like it did anyway.  Let me tell you sort of the pinnacle moment.  I don't know if I did tell you this or not.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I really noticed, when I first noticed the change, I guess it was, it's probably, I forget exactly—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	About five weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When did you go to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The first weekend in May, March.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, she went off for a long weekend with all of her girlfriends and the husbands and I, you know, stayed back and we went, the husbands went out for dinner Friday night, Saturday night and [INAUDIBLE] and she was supposed to come back Sunday.  Well when she left, I really wasn't feeling very well and so when she left, the parting of ways was very weak, you know, I didn't even—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She accused me of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Somehow over the weekend, all I kept thinking is she ain't coming back and it got to be ten o'clock on Sunday night and she wasn't back, then she did show up and from that point, something clicked, I don't know what it was but everything started to fall into place at that point.  I recognized what I had and what I potentially was losing because I didn't come out of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Whether it was, that's the only turning point I could see and was it mediation induced, I don't know, probably, it got me to a level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you came here with your son, I mean, you know, you knew everyone was, you know, desperate for you to feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it just wasn't happening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It wasn't happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your brain just, you know, we even sent you to the neurologist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and I mean, I was unsure of myself with him, like when I look back it, I attribute to how I came across with him, I almost was a blithering idiot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you couldn't move back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But think about it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The question isn't neurologic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That doctor's wife happens to be a dermatologist who I went to this afternoon at three thirty and explained to her that I met her husband under these circumstances and she was very sympathetic and very understanding about it too.  Husband and wife, I guess they, they've been married twenty five years, I said we've been married thirty five years so I guess you can understand it, it was a good feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so clearly your depression is in remission and you're a bit above the line and so our challenges right here is to glide into normal mood safely without you crashing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One thing, you may not like this but you've got to hear it.  The higher you go and the longer you spend high, the more likely you're going to have to pay for it with depression—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so it's in all of our best interests to get you into the normal zone, out of the high zone.  Now we know you're in the high zone by your sleep, more than anything else by your sleep and it's not that you're not sleeping much, it's that you're not that tired the next day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] or not, I know you say I am but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you're probably not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm still functioning at a pretty high level and maybe I'm a little more tired than I should be.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And probably less, yeah, the fuse is probably shorter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's going on at work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's going very well, although that's what I have to ask you.  Right now, I'm back at work but they still have not lifted my security clearance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, it's off, I'm not aware of there being any serious problem with it but I would say this, if you do get a phone call from my employer, I'd appreciate you putting in some very positive words for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't I send a letter?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You did and I'm not saying that wasn't sufficient, I'm just saying there may be a possibility because it hasn't, it hasn't gone through the actual, it's gone through all of my organization but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well they're probably wanting to be careful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hasn't gone through the security.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's the work that you do?  What's the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the title is a computer engineer but really it's more project management of software development projects and you do a lot of reviews of contracts with government, you know, contracting organizations, doing work for the government and basically we're sitting there deciding whether they're doing the right thing and we monitor and keep track of them on a daily basis, how well they're spending against the teachers, the capabilities that they're supposed to be delivering.  So it requires a lot of involvement and that has not been an issue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And why does it require higher security?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because most of the stuff we work on his secret or top secret.  As a matter of fact, when I left, I had top secret clearance and I hate to lose that top secret clearance.  I don't know that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why, if you lose the top secret than you can't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you lose some of your job potential because it limits what you can do.  Some of our systems are rated at secret and others are top secret, so to be able to work on a system you've got to have the clearance to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But right now, not having the clearance, technically I can't even get in the building but I've been getting in the building because the people that I work for want me to work for them so they're escorting me around.  I hoping that will come to an end.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have to escort you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, if you don't have a secret clearance, yes, because there's all kind of stuff in the building, secret or top secret.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And who makes this decision?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well my management chain has already made the decision for me but it has to go to the security.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To be reinstated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] which is another totally separate organization where all these clearances come through so there could be a hang up there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the depression, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But to the best of my knowledge, there's a legal right that says you cannot be discriminated against whether it be physical or mental disability.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So if push comes to shove, I think we could fight it but I don't want to get to that point.  I want it to go its normal path, I don't want to force some issue that's going to really hurt me down the road.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.  This is a condition that affects many many people and so I imagine they've dealt with this before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I assume and if they come back to you, I know you would come through with a very positive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'd probably [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that will not be good—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I won't say that but we've got to rope you in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess, it's just be honest.  If they ask you a question, just to be honest with them about what your assessment of my abilities to do, you can't assess my ability to do the work but you can assess my ability from a character nature, whether it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  Okay, here's what we have to do.  First, has anyone checked his blood recently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm supposed to go for a blood test because I've been taking [INAUDIBLE] but my doctor says my testosterone level is very very low—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So he's been giving me medication, a gel that you rub on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've been trying that for about a month and I do need to go again for a blood test—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To check it again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Within the next week to do that, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually, that's my research, I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that's only for testosterone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  I have thousands of those little gels, do you pay out of pocket for them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have been, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it expensive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It seemed to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you a bunch of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't think that's a complete blood test that they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did you start that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About a month ago is when I've been doing it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well you, he—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He wanted me to do it before but I wasn't, I wouldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He wouldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then when I went to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's about when you started revving up too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true too, I never thought of that.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was after he was revved up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was already revved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah but that's true.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he was already, you had been to the doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true, it did follow that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I am doing that now too, that's the only difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, the reason I say the blood test—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's only 5 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 5 gm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	5 gm, yeah, not mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The issue about blood tests is that there's a small risk of diabetes with Zyprexa, however, most of us think that risk is related to the weight gain, so keep an eye on the weight gain.  It turns out that the weight gain with Zyprexa is a yes or no, it happens at any dose, you don't get more weight gain at a higher dose.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I was wondering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you either get it, you know, you get it or you don't get it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because I noticed that since he had upped it, I definitely have noticed a bigger increase in his appetite, so I was assuming that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The lack of control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You see, what you didn't know is when you were away, I was packing away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was binging.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's been binging since he started feeling better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's hungry, he spent a long time not eating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's probably, to be honest with you, that's probably [INAUDIBLE] food that I take pleasure in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Do you binge a little bit at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When she goes to bed I might get a little scoop of ice cream or something like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One little scoop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With caramel sauce on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, one scoop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What we want to do now is we're going to get, and the Nortriptyline makes you gain weight too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now the, so what I want the doctor to do, just make sure someone checks your, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could you write a script?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, they'll know to do it because you're on the Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, this doctor is not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always, always, the only script he's really put in for is the thyroid thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The thyroid level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he's taking the medication for his back and he never even asked him whatever medicine he was on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that was partly my fault.  I should have really said and he put pseudoephedrine and pseudoephedrine says not with MAOIs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Thank God I knew that because I took that medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She knows that, so I don't have, I don't have a high trust, plus he's not the guy that I only go to if my back is in trouble but he's the first line of defense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anyway, you know, the blood sugar thing is not something that's urgent, not something you need right away but whenever someone is drawing blood for another reason, make sure there's a blood sugar on there so we can see that you're not getting diabetic.  You're not going to get diabetic, it's a rare thing, don't worry about it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You want him to watch it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hasn't run in my family though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly, you have to watch your diet, you've got to stop eating so much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's snacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The sugary snacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you've got to exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I plan to, as soon as my back.  I was walking every day until this last week now when my back, it's just killing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now having said that, I want to raise the Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We've got to rope this thing in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's going to rope it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, it's a mood stabilizer, it'll help rope you in.  At the same time, we're going to stop the Nortriptyline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We taper down and stop.  Do you have only 75's or do you have 25's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No we have, I might have some 25's from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think it's old.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're probably old ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay, old is fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're going to be on it for just a day or two, you know, let's say two days at 50, two days at 25 and then stop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think we have 25's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have enough to cover—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Try to use that to taper down just over a few days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To 0?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To 0, off the Nortriptyline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are you writing this down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll write it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's one thing I do notice though, my short term memory at times, I don't, some things slip by.  It's not major but what I find myself doing is having to sit down and write down a list of things every day in the morning, what I want to accomplish that day, just so I don't forget to do something that day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I think it's a good practice but it's, you know, I'll start to do something, then I'll get distracted and do something else, it's a little trouble at times keeping totally on the same target.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so number one is taper Nortriptyline and it'll be 50 mg times, let's say, two days, 25 mg times two days then stop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that, that won't trigger—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if we do, I'll notice it real quick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I will notice it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh absolutely, I wouldn't hesitate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I suspect that it's the Parnate that's really mostly responsible for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think so too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Number two is we're going to increase Zyprexa to 50 mg every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now there's no generic for that, because that one is the one that tends to be expensive I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, do you pay out of pocket for that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, whatever my insurance doesn't cover.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then I pay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they cover it all eventually?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They cover eighty percent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's very expensive, very expensive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They come in 15's though, it's cheaper to get the bigger dose but for now you need that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's covered.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's a mood stabilizer?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like Lithium?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, it stabilizes mood in a different way than Lithium.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So four days—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean I've been trying to avoid adding another mood stabilizer but if this doesn't come down soon, say within the next few weeks, we'll have to add something else, something like Depakote but for now, you know, both Zyprexa and Lithium are really good mood stabilizers, they should work for us.  I'm not, you know, I'll pull back on the Nortriptyline and, hopefully, we'll be able to cover you.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So within four days, he'll be off of the Nortriptyline?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He'll be off the Nortriptyline.  Tonight, he'll be up on the Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we'll need a prescription for—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll maintain the Lithium at 900 every day.  When do you take that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take them at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You take two of the 450's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  In the morning, I've been taking the Parnate and my blood pressure medicine and in the evening I've been taking my cholesterol medication then with the Lithium, the Nortriptyline, and the Zyprexa, so I don't know, do I just get down to once a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has anyone checked on your Lithium level?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You did that early on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the beginning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, initially, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was on the six month—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought you had said that it was right in the right range or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was but that's when were using Lithium to lift your mood, it's 0.3, which is, that was November.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it hasn't been taken, it hasn't been checked since then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's low enough though that I can raise that a little bit too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Does it stay like that usually?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean we should check it, you're on the 450's, take the 450 mg, now you'll take one in the morning and two at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you're increasing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're increasing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, oh, okay, to 1200 or no, to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To 1350.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, 1350, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're increasing 450—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One in the morning—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In a.m., 900—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, if, if you get a bad tremor or nausea—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let me say, the two things that bother me now is my stuttering—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I really try to say too much too quickly and occasionally my hands do shake where I just can't quite hold that paper still and I have to really force myself to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But not as much as it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been better, it's been much better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The stuttering, some of that might be the Nortriptyline, hopefully, that will get better off the Nortriptyline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I find if I actually slow down and think about what I'm saying, I talk fine, it's when I get so excited that I want to get a thought across that I start to stutter and I never stuttered before, did I?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the Parnate, we'll come down to three of them, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three is a good dose still.  I have some people on even one of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So 30 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 30 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like the direction in what we're heading here to try and bring it down a little.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stabilize it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do realize that I can't stay at this level for an extended period of time.  It's good right now.  In the three months I've been back at work, I've gotten a lot done and I feel like I've gotten a lot done and I feel like [INAUDIBLE] at home but I don't know if I could keep operating at this level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And even worse than that is that we're afraid that this will set up the next depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and believe me, I don't want that to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What are the chances of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The one thing I remember you saying is once we find a solution we've got to stick with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Then the challenge is to keep you well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so whatever you say, I will do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so I don't know what the chances are but the fact that he's on very aggressive mood stabilizers minimize the chance and make it less likely that he'll crash.  You may go a little below the line for a short time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'll probably be all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But we won't let you crash, we won't let you crash.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's a chance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Between my wife and my friends, they won't let that happen either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We've also—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They want to see me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the other good part is we've discovered a cocktail that we know works for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll always have that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To fall back on, if things start to turn.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll always be able to put you back to these doses and this combination to get you out of a depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank God for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But does it take a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It took four months to get to it but, hopefully, it won't take four months if it happens again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But see you're the last one to see it, that's the problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right, that's right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're on top of this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you're not going to let it happen to me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, because you won't believe it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I'll believe it if you tell me we need to see [PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, here are some 15's of Zyprexa.  Now do you have a lot of 10's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No actually the prescription is going to run out in about three days.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, you have your list of what you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So actually I need a prescription for all of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so here are some 5's to go with the 10's that you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do need a prescription for the Lithium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's another 15's so that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] is 15.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three Zyprexa.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They do have 10's you can mix with the 5's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, so Zyprexa 15 and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the, and the Parnate is going to be 30, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He starts the Parnate 30 tonight?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tomorrow morning, you take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Morning, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, you'll have to redo all your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll fix up my, I have a weekly medicine box that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's a bunch of these.  These say placebo or the real thing, this is the real thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, these are testosterone, this is the AndroGel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, oh okay, very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that'll last you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure and then I can even give you more of those because I have the study that we get so much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe you should do some, huh.  I'm just kidding.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is over the top.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You created a monster.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just be careful with your judgement, we don't want you getting in trouble.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that is something that I take very serious, all the joking aside.  I don't think, I don't think I have done anything that would really be viewed as irrational in what I did.  I did things that I probably would never do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What prescriptions?  The Lithium 450, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right but I'm going to be taking it at three a day, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay and the Nortriptyline we're getting rid of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Zyprexa, I will need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I just gave you a bunch of that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think you'll have enough for the month, till I see you next?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] tablets, we need three of those, that's twenty one days, and then these are 5, I don't know how much you have at home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I only have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We'll probably run just a little bit short.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's a 10 and a 5 so that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that should last and if you have to, just call in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so we've got that, we've got the Lithium, the Zyprexa, what else?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Parnate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Parnate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Parnate, you need more of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We'll need, I guess, a little less, right, it's only going to be 30 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me write for the old dose just so you get a lot of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so you can stockpile it a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay because I do think that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your old dose was 7, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	7, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The old dose was 7, now we're down to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you're down to 4 and you're going to 3.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll write for 7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that'll be good.  Then that covers everything.  I'm saying, Lithium, Nortriptyline, Nortriptyline is the same as [INAUDIBLE], right, Zyprexa and Parnate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we've got to get you to sleep.  Now should I give you a sleeping pill or you'll shut the computer off and get into bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The best answer is to shut the computer off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and the Zyprexa should—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think I have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Should knock you out.  Most people, that dose of Zyprexa knocks them on their, you know—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well he takes it right before he goes to bed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I should take it—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I want him to take it earlier—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Earlier.  Should I take it like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eight or nine o'clock, give it an hour.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't have to be taken with food, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.  Okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mostly you're doing great, you're doing great, it's a delight to see you, it's a delight to see how nice—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's nice to see you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's really great but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's get—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We have to stabilize this thing, okay, good, I'll see you, let me see you in a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call me if things, you know, don't go well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I may call you just on a weekly basis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, whenever you want.</p>

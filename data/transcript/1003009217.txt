<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So fill me in.  What's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh come on, we're taping now.  You have got to tell me more stuff than that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, when, when's the last time we met?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's been a while, actually.  [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's longer than we had been meeting.  So, uh, did you finish your class?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just stopped going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You stopped going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I missed the test and I can't take, make that up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Couldn't you make it up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Boss got really gay about me going to school.  [INAUDIBLE] better for me to keep my job or go to class.  So, I just dropped class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  I know you were into that, keeping the job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I couldn't risk the job, no matter what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a bummer, because when we spoke you were doing well in it.  You had a, had a, a B+.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would pass, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a bummer.  How's the job going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, fill me in a little more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean?  I deliver stuff, pick up stuff, and that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  How many hours a week are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know whenever I feel like going.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, is it by hours or is it by salary?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh salary, by how many you get done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's how much per -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Minimum's 10.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The maximum's 20.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever comes through.  It all depends in what you pick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So why did that interfere so much with school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I had no time to go to school.  Usually if I go, if I take a full run, it'll take me all day to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I never got time for school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you go all over the state?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just north, I usually choose north.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's more money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not really that far, it's really an extra 40 miles and I was getting an extra $5 for each one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, that's not bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  You take your own car?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  But they reimburse you mileage and so forth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all, we're like our own business or whatever, we're like truckers almost.  Op, owner, operators, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, they don't reimburse you for gas or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you essentially got a raise when the gas prices came down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, we don't get any more money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, but I mean, gas is less than half of what it was in summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  We didn't essentially get a raise, but it still saves on gas anyway, now I don't spend as much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  And what else has been going, going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Nothing new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How are you feeling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you doing for fun?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nothing, really.  Trying to keep active.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] never do that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how do you keep active?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I find stuff to do.  My phone's broken, so I really don't talk to anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I did anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't get calls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you exercising?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] my New Year's resolution.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What are you going to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just work out downstairs in my basement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mean weights?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have anything that you can do aerobic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A treadmill or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was going to get a bike and take a bike ride around [DEIDENTIFIED], but it's too cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Way too cold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How are you getting along with the pope, with the folks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The pope?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know with the pope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I met the pope one?  I didn't actually talk to him, but I did see him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In Italy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wasn't he in the pope mobile?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was speaking.  This, I don't know, it was kind of like, this huge, I don't know, a huge alley way.  He came in through here, doors were like here.  Everything was packed.  There was hundreds in this side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He got in this, like, big courthouse.  It was weird.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like no seats, though.  Everything was, uh, it was like tan marble.  You know that famous fountain?  The big ass one in Italy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like, it's just a huge fountain with a whole bunch of sculptures.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess it's in [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  I don't think we did [DEIDENTIFIED], I forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We were in [DEIDENTIFIED].  [DEIDENTIFIED]'s dirty as shit.  [DEIDENTIFIED] has the coliseum, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s dirty as shit.  I don't think we were at [DEIDENTIFIED] for that, though.  The reason I said the fountain, the fountain's the same color as the stone.  It was at the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You just sat there is all.  It wasn't the new one.  This was in '03, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So it was the polish -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was Pope John Paul.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] talk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was cool, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did he speak, in what language did he speak?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember, [INAUDIBLE].  He spoke a whole bunch of different languages, didn't he?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, um-hum, I think so.  It's interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was fun.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are your parents religious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I guess everybody is religious, you know.  They don't go to church, they haven't been to church in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But did they go specifically to see him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no they didn't go.  It was just me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, who -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It just happened to be that he was going somewhere that we were going and everybody took a vote and we ended up going to see him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  Well, not many people have had that experience.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's one I would recommend.  It's no big deal.  It's not like, "Oh my God, I'm more holy now because I met the pope", because I didn't shake his hand or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The guy had so much security.  We went through something [INAUDIBLE] like snipers or something.  It was ridiculous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well.  Probably with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have pictures.  That's, that's what I have pictures of, I still have the digital camera, [INAUDIBLE].  I didn't process it yet.  Maybe or not it's still good.  You know, I've got pictures of so many different [INAUDIBLE], because there were so many different guys there, a whole bunch of like a freaking arsenal ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah, like, like the president, you know.  That's, it's pretty serious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who do you think is more important, the president of the United States or the pope?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's a loaded question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who do you think would win that argument?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, one's a very important religious leader, ones, uh, hard to believe, leader of the free world, isn't that what people say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One's the leader, represents the church completely, of the world, and other one's arguably the most powerful man in the world, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Who would you vote for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, uh po, let's put it this way, if, if, in other words we have to keep one, if it's Bush, I'd keep the pope.  If it is Obama, I'd keep him [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, he's the pope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm just telling you what I think.  Um, there was, uh, a legal issue going on.  What's happened with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh, nothing, they took court [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you had that um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, it was knocked down to like a se, or whatever, but nothing, uh, town ordinance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have a lawyer, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it paid, it was $200.  It paid for the prosecutor, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The ones from the court, it turned out to be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I didn't get in trouble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, like, the ju, the judge was a douche bag.  I owe the court $1,000.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I have to pay it, pay him $50 a month through, however long it's going to be until it's paid off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I didn't get in trouble for it, so it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't have a record from that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, that's good.  Okay and you're not going to do that anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how much money do you earn now, in a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It all depends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About, average.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Averaging, probably, uh, $350 maybe?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's all right.  After they take out taxes and I take out money for gas -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's [INAUDIBLE] left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] not even a lot, it's been slow.  It's 30, that, that, I know I didn't make 35 sto, stops during the week, I always do something, I just do something worth more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's usually, probably, maybe, 28 stops or something like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bu still it's not that many.  I don't work on Saturday's.  What, 6 days?  I mean, if I had at least 10 stops a day, I'd be making $1,200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The most I've ever made was, yeah, about $450 or $400, or $500, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're in good shape there, they like you, you're in good standing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, as close as you can, I mean, he's sort of a guy, he's kind of a user, a little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't think anybody did, because nobody's going to be home, it's New Year's Eve.  I'm not taking work, we're not giving any work in, so it doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you know what?  You got to be, if you're just responsible or you'll lose that job too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's not firing anybody.  He keeps saying he wants to, but nobody else is going to work for him, he wouldn't be able to find anybody else to do the work in time.  We all know it and he knows it, he just doesn't want to say it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So mood wise, you're doing okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really, that, that, I've never heard you say.  So you're doing well there.  How about as far as concentration goes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fine, I don't concentrate on much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and you're still taking the 2, first thing in the morning?  The 2 Adderall XR's and it lasts until -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, mid-day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mid-day.  So, um, would there be a role for taking 1 in the morning and 1 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because I'm out usually during the day, so I don't feel like carrying it a round with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You won't remember to do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it will be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But, what do you do for concentrating in the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't need to concentrate that much.  At all during the day, period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well, I think last time, we talked about that they have a similar medicine.  It's Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's, and it's made by the same company but it's linked to amino acid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, isn't that food?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, amino acid are the building blocks of protein.  So when you eat steak, or eggs or whatever, you're eating a lot of your protein, which is a lot of amino acids, so you know, it's a safe thing to put into your body, and, um, it seems that this formulation of Adderall lasts longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, since you're someone who doesn't want to take, I have some people who have taken a little bit of Adderall twice a day rather than 1 big dose, once a day and it allows it to extend their day.  But, but, um, you know, someone who has a long day, or goes to school and study at night, they need to have that benefit.  The whole, whole day, virtually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, I have them take it a little bit in the morning, a little bit, like, early afternoon and that allows them to concentrate the whole day.  Since you don't want to do that, I'd be interested to try this other medicine, because, I think it might last longer, and that way you'd have the, you know, pro -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it harmful or something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's not harmful.  It's basically a newer version of Adderall XR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What's the difference besides the fact that it's not, is it a stimulant?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's, you know the stimulant in Adderall XR is Adderall.  Before they had Adderall XR, they had Adderall.  And Adderall is a mixture of amphetamines, you know, which are stimulant, and the Adderall itself lasts about 4 to 6 hours, but someone like yourself, who might be metabolizing quickly and who is very, you know, experienced with it, might only last 4 hours, 3, 4 hours, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the regular Adderall is expected to last 4 to 6 hours, the XR is expected to last perhaps, um, 9 to 12 hours, I'd say or eight to 12 hours, so longer.  The newer version of Ivan seems to last yet a little bit longer.  So, may, maybe instead of 8 to 12 hours or 8 to 10 hours or, it might last 9 to 12 hours or, or, 12 to 14 , it seems to last a little, a little bit longer and what they seem to report and people who have switched also noticed that, that it seems to last, I, I saw someone earlier today where he really does find, and he, he goes to school, he finds that it, it works throughout the day, it doesn't feel like it's, it's dropping off, and he's getting moody or that, you know, he's less able to concentrate in the evening.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I, I was just interested in whether you wanted to try it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And see if it worked better.  Interested?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay one way or the other?  Well , uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  It won't make a difference, I don't think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it allows you to, do you notice it wearing off?  Do you notice the Adderall XR wearing off?  No?  But you do notice that you're better able to concentrate morning compared to afternoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, usually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So now it's 4:00, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Four?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now it's 4:20.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, do you find that you're, like, more patient or less able to concentrate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, usually about 8:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eight in the evening is when you notice that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, so the afternoon you're pretty good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is there ever a, a need for you to be able to concentrate better in the evening, like go to watch a movie or doing any reading or doing homework when you were going to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, it's your call.  I mean, I, I, I've found it to be a nice, uh, switch for some people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it more expensive?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I don't think so.  I, I think the co-payment would be the same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll try that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's like, uh, like a raise.  Like you're all over it, like you're very excited.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it might, it might not.  I'd be interested to try it.  It seems like it is an improvement with, you know, for some people.  All right.  Anything else I ought to know about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is your, is your mom, mother going to come in and tell me a bunch of stuff that you're in trouble about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No she wants to go home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's going to cook.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, for tonight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  So let, let's have her come in.</p>

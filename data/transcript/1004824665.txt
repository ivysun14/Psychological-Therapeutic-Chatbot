<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least you amuse me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Well, I'm glad to provide some entertainment value.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So in my crazy closing last Friday, I fucked up the payoff, and I was short $6200. And (pause) I had wired out the seller's proceeds, so it's not like I could stop payment on the check and pull the money out, you know. But they were very cooperative except that I wanted them to send the money to me, so I had control of sending it to the bank. And instead, this guy went into a branch and supposedly resolved it. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>Which I have no idea whether he's done that or not. And they're asking me for a day's interest back. Which (pause) it's only $100, it's a $560,000 mortgage. Which, if the check clears today, I guess I'll send the money back on Monday or Tuesday or someday. (pause) But kind of a nerve-wrecking fuck up. Not my biggest fuck up. That was $9,000, which I accidentally wired to a seller.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes I get in a bit of a rush and don't double check. [00:02:04]</p>

<p>I mean I know what I did wrong. There's the as of date, which is the date that the payoff is good through, so that's basically you know, they're going to get the payoff on the 23rd, the as of date of the 23rd is what's due on the 23rd. Instead of putting October 23rd, I put in December 23rd. So the computer automatically counts back to the 23rd, subtracting $6200 from the payoff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 62 days, 61 days, whatever, at a hundred bucks a day. So that's how that got fucked up. But I should be double checking before I even overnight these things out. I should be checking and making sure that I've got the right amount. [00:03:07]</p>

<p>That's why I hate wiring out seller's proceeds, because once it's gone, it's gone. Where I've got a little bit of time to stop payment on a check. And the only thing they can do is bitch and moan at me. They can't sue me. All they can do is yell. And I don't have to take their phone calls. Buyers, on the other hand, you've got to kind of take their phone calls. Because they'll complain the mortgage folks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got two tournaments this weekend. Should be nice weather. Oh, yeah, you've got a thing next Friday. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, two Fridays. Next Friday I'm around. Two Fridays.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Family breakfast at school? (pause) Why do you smile right away?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) You always assume it's something nice or as I imagine it a reflective of the way my life is together. You know, like (pause) they're opening a new Pilates gym and they asked—I don't know. I guess -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Your kid's having a family breakfast at school and you're going. You know, that's where I get that. That's what parents do. Well—what some parents do. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there's sort of my -</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's the 9th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 9th, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Should we try and reschedule that or no? [00:05:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's wait until we get closer, if that's okay. I think it's—I'm pretty booked up. I think it's unlikely I'll have something, but I'll know if I have an opening sooner, like closer to that date. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it seems like I have a lot of things to do. It's not like I'm sitting around doing nothing, blowing things off. But I'm not exactly being overly productive. (pause) Got a couple closings next week. (pause) One that I've done nothing on. It's a seller [inaudible [00:06:10] from Halloween. [00:06:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We better not be closing at the registry. I'm going to be pissed. That's like Realtor 101: don't schedule a closing for October 31. And this is a realtor who's been around for a long time. She's like one of the best realtors. It's like, she tells you what your house is worth, and you list it and that's what it sells for. She's that good. And I was kind of surprised when I saw the 31st. (pause) So hopefully it's on the early side or at the attorney's office. Because I don't really want to be in the city on October 31. [00:07:07]</p>

<p>It's bad enough if you went there today, you know? Freaks everywhere, just you know, traffic—I mean, traffic's always bad, save throw in, you know, a bunch of weirdo's.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a scary situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not exactly motivated to do any work on that today. I should do laundry. Socks and stuff for the tournament. (pause) Got to pick Ian up from school. Soccer practice. (pause) Need to get permissions for the tournament. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>(pause) So after this weekend, that'll be it. No more practice for -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: April. There's a tournament in the beginning of December, but I'm going to be in Florida.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) And that's the "Get Ho Ho Ho" tournament. Which is a pun or there's the—there's an offense called the horizontal offense, so it's the Ho [inaudible [00:09:07] and then laying out is going horizontal, and then it's Christmas tournament, so it's "Ho Ho Ho." People wearing little Santa outfits and do some pretty cold [inaudible [00:09:27] snowed before. I've never been there when it snowed. But (pause). [00:09:32]</p>

<p>So I won't be playing in that. This'll be my last weekend. (pause)</p>

<p>Ever have the feeling someone's looking at you, like you look over at them and they kind of look away? Like they were just looking at you? I had that feeling with Barbara Thursday night. Every time I'd look over, she—[00:10:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As though she had just been looking at you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then sort of looked away as soon as you noticed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's not going to be at the tournament tomorrow. She'll be at the one on -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Sunday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sunday, but it's such a big tournament, I don't think I'll probably see her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not playing on your usual team?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't be playing on the same team?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Sunday is a [inaudible [00:10:38] league, so they split teams together for a season.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Big games or whatever, for the tournament. I mean, it's possible. We could play against each other. But (pause)... [00:11:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you make of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (laughs) I don't know. (pause) I keep thinking at some point she's going to recognize the errors in her ways. Error in her way. You know, whatever. But that's probably not going to be the case. (pause) I'll just harass her over Words with Friends with how crappy her fantasy football team is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she's [inaudible [00:11:56].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Out of how many? [00:12:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten. Ten injuries you know, fantasy football's got a lot of luck involved. Part of the luck is not getting injuries.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Especially in this league, because we have big rosters, so there's not a lot of extra players to pick up who are any good, so [inaudible [00:12:39]. Could be in trouble. I'm not one to be talking. I'm in 7th place. Though I've got the second highest point total. I just had bad luck in match-ups.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you need to finish in the top 8 teams to go to the playoffs. So that's all that matters, is I finish in the top 8.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're currently 7th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I win this weekend, I'll be at least 6th. And 3 and 4 and all that. Eight of the teams are either 4 and 3 or 3 and 4.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: First place team is like—is it 5 and 2? Barbara's 1 and 6.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh, ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Someone wants me to play in a fantasy basketball league, which I've never done before. I don't even know where to start. I don't know, it's like if I had the first pick. (laughs) I don't know. [00:14:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:14:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know who you'd take. So. I really (pause) I guess I'm going to have to just go to the website and figure it out. There's no money involved, so it's just for fun. (pause) Which, if you ask me, I don't know how it could be for fun if there's no money involved. (laughs) But that's just the [inaudible [00:14:47] in me. (pause)</p>

<p>Kind of overwhelmed though, by having the tournament on both Saturday and Sunday. You know, it's like I just seem to be going down south. So I really don't want to do anything today. [00:15:16]</p>

<p>(pause) Finally got around to drafting this letter for a landlord. I sent it to him, just to review it and make sure the facts are right. That was like two days ago. People don't seem to be responding to my e-mails. I mean, I think they're getting them, they're just not responding to them. I'm that bad, too. I take days to respond to e-mails. [00:16:29]</p>

<p>(pause) I am in horrible shape to play two tournaments. [00:17:28]</p>

<p>(pause) Supposed to be nice tomorrow, though. Sunday it's supposed to be breezy. Which makes for long points. Lots of turnovers. Typically play zone defense, and (pause) which involves a lot of passing and a lot of wind, bad throws. Long points. [00:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You just hope you're on the sideline for those. At least I do. Very frustrating if you've been on a point what seems like forever, and you're dying. You can barely run. And your team's about to score, and someone drops the disc right in the end zone. Always happens, without fail, on long points.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just try and kill me. (pause) We've got a few people joining E&G, or E&G seems to be on an upswing now. [00:19:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All they had to do was get rid of me as president. But we've got a banker from a different bank. So there might be an opportunity to get on their list.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That'd be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She does small business lending, which, you know, lines of credit basically is what she does. But there's also a chance to maybe do that on the commercial side. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Young woman, really excited to be in E&G. She's never been to an E&G meeting, and put in an application without meeting anyone. But she's in the local branch. Did you lose something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. It's getting a little bright. I'm putting the shade down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You prepping your house for the hurricane?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I heard about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Frankenstorm? Though they say now that it's going to hit New Jersey, so (pause) I don't know. They don't know what the hell they're talking about [00:21:07]</p>

<p>(pause) I just hope it doesn't leak in the basement in my rental where all my boxes are, on the floor. (pause) In the spot where it leaks. I've already had one box collapse. Jess gets pissed at me and wants me to take home the box, but it's like, you've got this huge basement, which you're just using for storage, and you want me to take all my shit out of there. She's annoying sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you've told me.</p>

<p>(pause) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) So I'm wondering if my new regimen of meds are working. I seem to be in a better mood [inaudible [00:23:14]. [00:23:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll be off of the Trilafon this week. Which will just leave me with a little [inaudible [00:23:31] at night and a [inaudible [00:23:32] if I want one. And next will be trying to—I don't know if she totally wants me to be off the Wellbutrin, but we'll start weaning that down. (pause) It's nice to not be taking so many meds. Save some money on co-pays. [00:24:10]</p>

<p>(pause) I spent over a grand this year in just prescription co-pays. (pause) Got to recycle all this medication. You're not supposed to just pour it down the... It gets into the drinking water. (pause) But I guess with these pills, everybody can get happy with me. (pause) Or you stop having seizures, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:24:53] or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no reason they came out with these drugs. (pause) What's on your mind? [00:25:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) I've heard that question before. (pause) Is there anything you're wanting to work on in particular? [00:26:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. Cleaning my house. Cleaning my desk. That was one of the things I was supposed to do yesterday, was clean my desk. But that didn't happen.</p>

<p>(pause) [00:27:00]</p>

<p>Is there anything you think I need to work on? [00:28:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean by things to work on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything good?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Anything good?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thinking of things to work on is something I think you need to work on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahhh. Well what do you get paid for? (pause) Aren't you supposed to figure out what's wrong and then say "you need to fix this. Here's some ideas"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think one of the things—no, that is not the way it works. One of the things I think you have trouble with is—[00:29:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Criticism?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being motivated to work on stuff. You're very good at sort of shifting responsibility for things (pause) and (pause) putting the other person in the position of the responsible one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you saying this from personal experience?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Maybe I misunderstood our relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like I said, I thought you were the one who was supposed to diagnose the problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. This is the problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you're saying I'm doing exactly what you just said I do? [00:30:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) But how do I know when it's truly my responsibility versus someone else's responsibility? I mean, it could possibly -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:30:15] tell you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it quite possibly could be the other person's responsibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In theory, it could be. But in practice, it often isn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's your opinion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. (pause) That's what I get paid for providing. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well how do you work on something like that? Or am I supposed to figure that out?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind? [00:31:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, that's why I'm asking you. (pause) I feel—I mean, aren't I so hardwired in doing that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aren't I so... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really don't want to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm not saying that I want to, but that I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) See.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's become such a part of what I do, that you know (pause) it's almost as if I am hardwired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's very hard to approach things in a different way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you give me an example?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, of approaching something in a different way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I did though. That's an example. (pause) [00:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just want to blame you. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think that's exactly right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I take responsibility for not getting my work done. Having a messy house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I take responsibility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? I'm not disagreeing, I'm asking you if you agree.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I admit that I blow off doing work and procrastinate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. Yep. I agree.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't try and blame other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that's true. Absolutely. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what other things... [00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't tend to try to do much about it. (pause) But that is true, you don't blame somebody else or say that it's about the state of the world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I (pause) I try and you know, say "Okay, this is what I'm going to do today. This I what I'm going to do tomorrow." Or you know, it's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, this is a real problem. I know we're sort of talking about it lightly. But I think it's very difficult. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think making my bed would help?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, there was a study that just came out about people who make their beds, and that they (pause) tend to have (pause) it's a momentum thing. They clean their beds and they feel better about having a made bed, that they're going to want to clean up other parts of their lives and be productive. And it kind of makes sense to some degree. [00:34:29]</p>

<p>But I have like stuff on mine, like a box on my bed, and piles of clothes, and I don't know how I'm supposed to make my bed with all that shit there. I guess I can move that stuff. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Probably recycle the box. (pause) But I always would think "Why make your bed if you're just going to mess it up?" You know? (pause) Do you make your bed? (pause) The housekeeper does it? [00:35:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The housekeeper does it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. I think it's usually actually someone—I don't know which staff member does it. One of them does something, yeah. (pause) [00:36:06]</p>

<p>So there's probably two or three more examples right there, right? Or three. You think about (pause) making your bed. Your first question is to me, whether I think it's a good idea. Even though you just heard about a study that says it's a good idea. Then you think it through. Or, four. That's one.</p>

<p>Then you think it through and you think, "Oh, but I've got all kinds of stuff on my bed. What do I do about that, [inaudible [00:36:41]? Why don't you do the thinking on that one for me?" That's two.</p>

<p>And then the third one is [inaudible [00:36:51] you think it through, "Yeah, I guess I could move the stuff. I could recycle the box. And I'd be able to make my bed." Then number three's coming along. You say "Why do it if I'm just going to mess it up again later?" Even though you've just given me the reason, that there's this study, and that it's a good thing because it helps you get other things done. So that's gone. And you wonder what the point is, because you're going to mess it up later anyway, so you might as well not do it. That's number three. [00:37:19]</p>

<p>Then number four is "So [inaudible [00:37:23], I have a question. Do you make your bed?" I guess looking to me—I think mostly probably just like kind of a handing over the mike move.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm polling. I get that from my mom. My mom's a poller.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so like "We're done on the topic of whether I'm going to make my bed. [inaudible [00:37:48], over to you. Do you make your bed?" I think it's like that. Maybe you're sort of—well yeah, it is. It's a little bit of like because then it's not going to be about whether you think it's a good idea or what you know about it or what you've just been thinking about, or trying to think about for the last three minutes. It's going to be about whether I do it or not. [00:38:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that would affect—like if you said "Yeah, I make my bed," then I go "Well maybe I should make my bed." But if you said "No, I don't make my bed"...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, except for the fact first of all you know I'm not going to answer the question. And we're talking precisely about your taking responsibility for what you are not going to do. And I agree, it may be salient that one of the—maybe two things there. One is sort of looking outside of yourself rather than thinking it through yourself. I mean, it may be partly avoidance and partly looking for help with something that's difficult. That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>But I think the trend here, like those four things in the course of about three minutes, to do with how you're kind of moving away from something that you think would be a good idea. (pause) So like (pause) yeah. [00:39:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just don't want to do it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you kept coming back to it. It's not—I don't think it's [inaudible [00:39:31].</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:39:38]. Like (pause) walk around. (pause) I can talk to you [inaudible [00:39:49]. I still have Buddy's cage sitting there at the foot of the bed too. Which I would taken apart expect for it's a good place to just drop shit. So I would have to clean all that stuff up. Give me a lot more room. But you know I'm not going to do it. (pause) Not today. [00:40:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of us might [inaudible [00:40:15].</p>

<p>CLIENT: One day I'll do it. I'll get a divorce too. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you want to know what you're up against, this kind of stuff—I mean, now you're making light of the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I'm not trying to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you—I think you are unconsciously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unconsciously or subconsciously?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unconsciously? Subconscious isn't really a (pause) medical term.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But unconscious would mean that I'm just you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the term that's used. [00:41:02] (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in layman's terms, it's subconscious. In psycho jargon, it's unconscious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well how do you change unconsciousness?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're working on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are we? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that is the question, isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like, you know, there's one more thing I got to do. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want more stuff to do. I want less stuff to do. (pause) More effective way to do them. (pause) It's like today, I woke up at 5, 5:30. But on a day that I would need to go into the office, I don't wake up until like 8, 8:30. So that doesn't get me to the office till like 10:30, 11. Where if I got up at 5, I'd be out by 7, 8. (pause) After I finish coughing and puking all over the bathroom. That's what woke me up this morning. [00:42:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Did it yea]. (PH)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go home and make my bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:43:59] one point that I will be [inaudible [00:43:02]. [00:43:04]</p>

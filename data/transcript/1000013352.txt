<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've kind of got a runny nose here. (blowing her nose)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yuck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm doing much better that last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, its because of situa...its situational.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And but I've had, I find out that I get, when something, I get really paranoid. Let me just tell you about my last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I went out with a guy with tattoos.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really like him. I had a great time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that looks like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We had a great time. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about what was so great about being with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, we just like bond...just felt really comfortable with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just was very comfortable. I mean I hadn't felt that way since my ex-boyfriend Jack.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The only thing is, is that, and my girlfriend Laura who is the one who's getting married that whose fiancï¿½ is his best friend,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She knows that I have this whole thing about college education, there's this little tag on me. Its bothering me. And the tattoos and the earring. (blowing her nose)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I told him about, not the education I didn't tell him about that but she couldn't believe that I asked him, I mean I'm being I guess its very b - -hy but he took it well. I said I didn't know if he I said "I'm used to dating really wealthy men and I don't know if your going to be able to afford me". I'm so bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said well "I may never" and this is really sweet and he makes pretty good decent amount of money</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just being a snob.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said he said he might not ever be a millionaire but he'll make me happy. He could make me happy. So I said "Well why can't you be a millionaire?"</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 2:42)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. So I he's playing the stock market. But anyway...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) [There so funny] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's really sweet and he's cute and he sent me a dozen roses yesterday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. (2:55)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. Its just I don't know. We'll see. But then yesterday I called him and thanked him for the flowers and I said "I wish I could see you sooner" I'm seeing him on Friday night and he didn't say anything. So then that's sparked my mood because he didn't say anything. I thought "Oh God. He didn't like me. He's thinking I'm" I don't know. I thought well I shouldn't have said that I'm being too like I like him too much and I need to just say "Thank you. That's very sweet". I don't know. Anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But so it kind of freaked me out all day long. I mean I was just like paranoid and I talked to my friend Laura last night and she said "You always do this. You always do this. Every time a guy comes, a new guy you always get paranoid that they're not going to like you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah". So I said "Well I'll discuss it in therapy tomorrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here we are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before you got to that part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which part?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The thing about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: The roses?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: His not responding back...</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the rose, right, yeah, my "I can't wait to see you"?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. You were full of excitement in a way that I haven't seen before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. That's good. Yeah. Well its just comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think makes it easier with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess I feel more on his level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what makes me mad. Because Laura said she said "Why do you think you're so much better than everybody else? Everybody's the, everybody's the same." I guess I don't feel like, like when I'm with Jamie that, or really wealthy educated people sometimes I feel like I'm not enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I feel like and now I feel like "Well, am I lowering myself?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So its hard for you to just feel like you're equal with someone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's either your too good for them or your not enough for them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But then, and then, but then I'm thinking I feel guilty because "Well he's good enough he didn't have the money to go to school or whatever. And he works really hard and I shouldn't feel that way. Blah, blah, blah".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  It's ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. (5:25)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I'm saying its ok because there's a way that, you know like instead of seeing that you have a struggling with just being equal with someone that you either feel kind of superior or inferior to them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get so kind of punishing of yourself that you do this and it's more like ok you have. It's hard for you to do right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your not there yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh Uh (ph). And so I'm supposed to be working on feeling equal to everybody?</p>

<p>(laughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (inaudible at 6:08) Well I'm not where yet?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You said, "I'm not there yet".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I meant that your not at, there's a, I'm not sure how and why but for some reason you do have trouble just kind of staying with feeling on level with someone. And that's what I'm saying that your not there yet where you can either, where you can feel on level with someone instead of either of the choices of feeling superior or inferior.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And then I also find that with my wealthy girlfriends I think "Oh God well there going to give me s**t". Because last week I talked to my friend Isabelle and she said I told her about Jamie and who has, who called me last, he left a message and said "Oh well I'll call you next weekend and we'll get together" which he never did which is fine because this, I don't think its going to work even though he had a beautiful home which is hard to give up but. Oh I just got it, oh I'm going, Joey said, Joe some people call him Joey, I should probably just call him Joe because that's what he prefers but he said "So what can I do or how am I going to get you away from all those other guys?" He said that. That's just a thing is that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So what to your face?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No that was nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No one has ever said that so soon to me. I don't think anyone's ever really said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. And so his interest in you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is appealing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is very appealing and exciting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right. I don't know where I was before that. About Isabelle and introducing him to friends oh and yeah she said "Oh well I think you need to go for the older guy"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who said that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My friend Isabelle. (8:32)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know she's from a really wealthy family. She's (inaudible at 8:36) educated and she just said, she, I mean, I haven't talked to her since I went out with Joey so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she doesn't have all the information?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But that's what she said last week before I went out with him and you know how I was last week. "Oh. I don't know. You know bah, bah, bah".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wow, I'm getting, I thought, I lost a little bit of weight I think. I dieted and now I feel like I put it back on again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My stomach. Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. What is the thing about the doctor?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got to sneeze. (sneezing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bless you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me. I'm going to give you his name and phone number.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the one thing that I'm waiting to here is, I called, the one thing I'm waiting to here is from the, the people who are involved in the study, the, you know the brief therapy study.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To be sure that this is ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. OK. I understand that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That they, but they knew you were on medication right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I told them that. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I don't think that's going to be a problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm going to go ahead and give you the name and number and I told Dr. Blackwell, that's his name, all of this and so you can go ahead and schedule an appointment with him and if I find out that there's a problem I'm going to give you a call.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK. All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he knows that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now the thing is for you to know is that he is, you'll probably need to try to schedule it pretty quickly because the first week in July he's kind of shifting over for a month to another part of the hospital and there will be someone covering for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he will get to see you one or two times and then the person covering for him will get to see you and then he would start seeing you again in the beginning of August. Which is kind of a weird way to do it. But I think</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that you'll like him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So, so I thought it might be ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you like him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. He's a nice guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he understands. I thought it would be nice for you to be with a kind of you know nice, compassionate...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. (11:30)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Psychiatrist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're welcome. So I will give you his phone number and I will call again today just to be sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That this is ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because see like this week well I can, I'm thinking, "Oh well I don't need to change my medication because I'm doing fine" but then I know its just circumstantial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and that it might just be a good idea to have, to talk to a psychiatrist about your history and kind of, because he'll be able to say whether you know in the long run Zoloft is a good idea or some other medication.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Might be a good idea or whether whatever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Yeah I think its good too because I haven't spoken to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 12:15) are fine and obviously know a lot about you know physical health but don't know as much about psychiatric medication as a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Well we'll get on that path so I'll give you the phone number.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok we should. Now what number session is this? Do you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think its number, its either, I think its either 13 or 14.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh so we're half way done almost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost halfway done.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh that's so sad. (said in a sad voice)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what made you think about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've been, I've been thinking about it and it just popped into my head just now but. Well because I like coming now. I mean I think its good. I mean its like I've been, like I've been looking forward to it because like I've been talking to my girlfriend, "Well I'll work, I, that's a good thing. That's good now I'll talk about that in therapy".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My sense is that in the past few weeks there's been a difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the work that we've been doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think both of us feeling more comfortable with each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It takes a long time I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you just have to. Its like I don't see how these people like come to therapy, try to, I mean the HMO's will pay for however many, 10, 20 whatever, its like "Yeah right". You're not going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't see how people can do it. You know? You just can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I was just thinking back. It was interesting because there was also something in the beginning that you said which was that there was something very appealing to you about brief treatment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. To see if I could get it over with. But then I've always liked it, I've always thought that if I had it, somebody good, that I wouldn't mind going every week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I could afford it. (inaudible at 14:17) thought it was good. I felt like that before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was kind of a release.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you need to get somebody's unbiased opinion or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So, so now it doesn't feel so important to get it over with is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Uh uh not at all. (14:35)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of scary actually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To think about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like that I'm going to have to deal by myself. Its kind of, you know, its kind of scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you, telling yourself.</p>

<p>(knocking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I still have, I still have more sessions and hopefully by then I'll, I'll, I'll have the tools to deal with life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hopefully. And then, you know, I'll, I'll, I'm sure I'll live through it. (chuckle) But, well we'll see you know. After if I'm fine without it then fine but I might want to return to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Depending.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to always know that I have an option available, and I do but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And did you me on option available to me or in general?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you and in general. If your available or. But its like, I hate, you know how I am, I'm sure you've heard this. It's so hard to get to know somebody or get comfortable with somebody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So. 15 times, that's how many, that's, presuming I come every week that's a little, about 4 months.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you, you are skipping ahead a little bit because we actually have either 16 or 17 times, I mean including today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is today? June? We'll say July, August, September, October. Yeah. Waahh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's, and what's that part of you that goes....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Waahh? Crying. Pretending a fake cry. Pretending I'm sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But where is that coming from?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh well the sacred, the scaredness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. That's not a word but the fear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh speaking of me correcting my grammar all the time.</p>

<p>(chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I 'm like a big stickler with grammar and I, you know that's, not that Joey has bad grammar but I've heard him say, this is a typical one, everyone does this that pisses me off, not pisses me off but I want to correct them when I hear somebody..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It irritates you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it irritates me. Thank you.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I'm doing it to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine. You can do that. Yeah if you ever hear my, hear something, a faux pas, let me know and, because I need to be corrected. He said like "I did good" or "I did". I hate that. And I'm thinking "Oh well I'm, I'll be a, is that snobby?" I mean some people like to be corrected and some people I'm familiar, I mean I'm sure if I got that comfortable with him I'd correct him. Like I correct my friend Laura. (17:36)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, well she's Portuguese and she started speaking English when she was I don't know. So I still, she wants me to, she told me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. But there's a way that its like, it would be hard for you to stay with your irritation instead of going "Stop that!".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or like if he did that in front of somebody like, like Isabelle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isabelle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like. Uhhh! It would be embarrass. Cause I. Oh and also another thing that I said that was so, that Laura, she, Laura told me that Joe told me, told her that I asked him and then she bithched me out for saying that. I said "Well how are you, can you act, how are you when you're around really wealthy people? Are you in... can you, no, can you be around really wealthy people without being intimidated?" Because I had an ex-boyfriend that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) What, now what do you think I'm, you're making assumptions about what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That, yeah, well I think, well maybe your thinking "Well God, she's" I don't know what you're thinking. But maybe you're thinking what Laura's thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really interesting because they, you have so much energy and, about this, about talking about this. About kind of what this part of you that can kind of pick.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what other people think about it and....</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely concerned too much and I know with what other people think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Terribly so, terribly so. And.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's, but there's also a way that there's some kind of, some kind of kick that you get out of this part of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like your saying "I know I'm doing this and I know its like quirky" and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a way that you're kind of laughing about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're talking about me correcting people? What are we talking about? I've lost....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the whole thing about money and kind of testing him and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And well I think it might be more about kind of just saying that to him. That's that the part of you that you get the kick out of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe so. Well that's really... But know I feel bad for saying it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, so its like you've talked about before, so you kind of put things out there very quickly and then in part you get a kick out of it and you kind of like that part of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (20:33)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in part you feel kind of guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Its like "OH did I do something wrong".</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I like to shock people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I do that in, when I am in class sometimes. And sometimes I get in trouble for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. But you also kind of like this part of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well a lot of people like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean a lot of people think its funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah they think I'm funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I just need to know when to draw the line.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what's appropriate and what's not appropriate. I know I can get away with, I can, people have said I can get away with a lot, I think I've told you this, saying a lot more things than other people can. The way I say it I guess. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what, I don't what that means exactly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like whatever I say, like, I can't even think of an example, like me in class saying something to somebody like yelling at somebody "What are you doing?" that they know I'm kidding like in class if their relaxing or something and their not working in class. I can't think of a good example but I'm, that's kind of a half-assed help. If somebody else said that they would be perceived as being mean or bitchy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I say it its more funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they know I'm teasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's, I guess that's how I get a kick out of saying stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Yeah. And I bet a lot of people really do tell (ph) you that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But they like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going, this is bothering me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So I noticed that you got, you kind of said that thing about us being half way through and then you moved very quickly away from that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I did that on purpose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know that you did either. I guess I had a thought that, that when I asked you what was the kind of fake kind of cry thing like you did...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it wasn't just about being scared that it was kind of a thought that you would miss me and miss seeing me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I definitely would, yeah definitely. Yes (fake sniffling). Yeah because I'm really liking it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: They don't really watch these whole things do they?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It depends who you mean by they. (23:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: The whoever the people are. Who, what, your superiors or whoever's putting this on. I understand [not all works] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you want to know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A couple of ways. People who are being trained to do this kind, type of work watch the tapes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh right, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To understand how it works.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Oh ok so they're showing somebody else how to do it. Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But also there is a group of us, of psychologist who are being trained in doing this type of work and we do watch the tapes together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To get it right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we don't necessarily watch every single tape of yours and mine together but we have watched parts of the tapes of our sessions together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. You know its just funny to think about watching, people watching, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, well I think what was, trying to understand what it was that, it was like you wanted to share with whoever it is, my superiors or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now I know that their not really watching every single bit either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you wanted to share with them that we like each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly, exactly, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I was doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now I'm wondering kind of how that happened for you that your feeling much more comfortable and that you're liking me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think its been over a course of time. I don't, it just kind of, I don't know, just like any thing, any like friendship or any relationship, it just takes time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's nothing that kind of stands out in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing. Not one certain thing stands out. No. It's just, I mean I remember one breakthrough session where I had some kind of breakthrough and I felt like, we talked about that particular session and I don't know when it was, and then ever since then I felt better and it just gets better and better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Do you, I'm wondering, and you don't remember what it was that we talked about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it was a while back. I don't remember. It was a heavy session but breakthrough session kind of. Yeah. It was probably four or five or six ago. (26:22)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we talked about like two weeks later or the week later "Oh that was a good session".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We talked about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Talking about it sometime?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking about that but I'm not remembering what session that was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't either. I mean how do you, its like, its hard with therapy its like how do you classify a certain session "Oh the time that we talked about this".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its kind of hard to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum. It is hard.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kind of just blends in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So. What is that noise?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is the sound machine that I have now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. That's cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well they had it outside and then someone kept turning it off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it so you won't hear a noise or just so you'll be calm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both, so I won't hear but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you'll be calm, calming down. Well that's, that's a good thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckling) Its more so both the noise coming in but also the noise coming out that I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, people hear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think people generally do that but I protect against that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not that loud though. I mean I don't know how somebody's voice would carry over that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um um, um um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean you do think it would be effective or you don't think it would be effective?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it would be effective for calming but I don't think it would effective for somebody's crying or whaling sounds.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you can turn the volume up but then it gets too loud in here. That's why I really wanted to keep it outside and so I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah it would be good to keep it outside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it, does it, is it bothering you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I just want, no. I didn't even notice it until just now. Has it been on the whole time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't notice it. I like it.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Close your eyes. Its nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would be good in the hall, in the out there especially people waiting to go in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be really good for that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if you're like antsy-wantsy before you come into therapy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You could just let people, it'll calm them down, and they could close their eyes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let them relax. It's kind of like meditating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I need.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I am aware that sometimes you talk about being very antsy before coming in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like last week I guess. I don't know if I was so, I was antsy the whole time, not antsy but just uncomfortable and feeling bad. (29:32)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I need to learn how to totally relax. Sometimes I get really irritated, agitated. I need to get one. What are they, like 100 dollars or more?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 75.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they have different sounds right? I like that one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its really (inaudible at 29:56). What's your sign?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Taurus.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Taurus? Really? I have some Taurus friends (laughing). It's an Earth sign. That's why I said is it Earth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wanted to know what my sign was because?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because well (inaudible at 30:12) because I'm thinking that would be a good gift for me because I'm an Earth sign.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gemini.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and then I thought "Oh well" I just thought I'd ask you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is mine an Earth sign?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yours is a, I don't know, earth, fire.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess its earth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Earth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My sister's a Sagittarius and I know Sagittarius is headstrong usually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it must be hard for you to, to, not, I don't know. Its funny that your so patient and you can do what you do being an Taurus.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I'm thinking you can probably turn. Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that you, do you think of me as patient? Is that your experience with me or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you are...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or are you just assuming that from what I do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That. And I think your patient with me but I think that you definitely can, I mean I like the way you stop me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just never, this is silly, but I just never would think of an Taurus...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being a therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yeah. (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess I'm just wondering...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never asked any therapist that question. That's funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think your trying to get to know me a little bit as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But see then I know there's that line like when we were at the....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Giant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thing I thought "Oh well she's going to want her space. I'll just let her go".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wondered about that because you clearly said "So I'll see you soon".</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because, yeah because I didn't think, well you, I didn't know whether you wanted to keep your space. Well now which, I totally understand that because it would be uncomfortable walking with you...(32:23)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah because, because the way, the way you thought about it doesn't leave very much room for what you wanted to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't know what I wanted to do. I just didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So you felt more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Concern about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And then the, you know, your not even at work yet and you have to get your thing and I figured you needed your space and I needed mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But maybe as your feeling more kind of connected to me that you are kind of. Well I, I think what you have said all along is that you wanted, that when your in therapy you wanted to know your in therapy with a real person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that you want someone who responds not just as you know kind of a typical therapist.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Textbook response but really is responding to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is responding as a person (inaudible at 33:30).</p>

<p>(phone ringing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah exactly. Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's, so I think your, your kind of getting to know me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah definitely. Which is good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see I don't know when to draw the line and stuff either. I mean I do know, I feel like I have to draw a line because I've been stopped before by a therapist saying "Well, why do you want to know whatever?" so then I feel like I'm not entitled to stop.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and so its, I guess what is striking me is that there's a way that your, your kind of drawing the line before I can say that to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because for some reason I don't want to get stopped.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. What would that feel like if I said; I'm not going to answer that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would feel uncomfortable for me. I wasn't listening. It would just it's really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like it. I don't like it. I feel like "Oh God, sorry" but you know what, people, I've been told before that I ask too many questions but, I'm just trying to get to know people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I also make friends easy because of it I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I take a genuine interest but it's just a different thing because you're the therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't, you know, and I know it's unethical and all that. I had my friend...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's unethical?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To, I think to be friends with your therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had my friend John in Florida, he became, he realized he had so much in common with his psychiatrist that he stopped seeing him and they were just friends. Isn't that weird?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. But what about it is weird to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just don't think it could ever happen. I guess it could happen but. It's not weird, its kind of nice but its kind of I don't know how, I don't know. I don't, I can't express myself. What's weird about being friends outside?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess to me it's like your, your kind of exploring where, where is the boundary.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Between us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe you're beginning to think about that in some ways your beginning to like me as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so what does that mean? You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it means, well I like you as a person but I've got to stop. I can't get to know you totally. I've got to, because you can't. I mean you know? (36:44)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but I think there's something important about this because there's a way that your like pulling back the reigns. Its like your kind of enjoying yourself and enjoying me and then it feels like to me like your pulling back the reigns. And I'm not saying that, there are some genuine boundaries and there are some genuine limits.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And those are important for us to talk about. But its like there's a way that you'll go so far with it and then its like you don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well should I go over the line?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think, I think your just kind of drawing this arbitrary line instead of really talking about what, instead of us kind of really talking about what, what the line is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it scares me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So what scares you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the, (laughter) what time is it? Is it time?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You saw me looking at the clock.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's ok. Well you have to be on time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess, what did you think about me looking at the clock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought, I didn't think that you were thinking, "Oh I'm bored or anything or I wish she would shut up" I wasn't thinking that. I was genuinely thinking how much time do we have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is what I was thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. See. So how much time do we have?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About eight minutes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Ooooh. Now what were the questions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said that line scares you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Yeah and I thought of something in my head but I can't remember what it was. That line, going, ok going over the line scares me because I don't want to be rejected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like putting yourself out there your risking rejection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think this comes up in your other relationships.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. In male relationships probably not so much female.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I friends, girlfriends, I don't have any problems with girls; it's men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely just men. And so like you, since you have a boundary, I feel like I have a boundary with guys too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how would I, how would I reject you. I would say "You're going to far. I'm not going to answer that question"? (39:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you said "Why do you want to know" or yeah, you, or how would you reject me? Say, I guess you would say yeah or you would answer the question and move on but you wouldn't expand it and I could tell that your, that's the way I think, what you would do. I think some people would say "Why do you want to know?" I think you would answer the question because you have when I asked things but then you don't expand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I think is a good way to handle it for you, for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But its putting a limit on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you don't really get the question fully answered?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, I get some.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum. But then we also don't, don't really talk about how and why I'm putting a limit on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now we are. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So how and why are you putting a limit on it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm trying to think of a specific time, like when, like when you asked me what sign I was you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that. But that's not, that's just a, definitely one word answer. I'm trying to think of a question that I asked you. What, what did I ask you? Well I asked you about that thing, where did you get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I'll, you know, you, or I didn't ask you what, how much was it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like one time I remember I was with this stupid guy that Dr. Canton the one, the jerk that was, I had to testify against. I think I told you about him. The psychiatrist. Oh that's another story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told the other girl because I thought he was making a move on me. Well he was. But anyway he had a thing on, I'll get into that later, its in that, its in the tape, the, I think I told what's her name?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 41:37)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I love (ph) her. The, he had a, his diplomas on the wall, and they were in London or something and I said "Oh so you went to school in Europe?" and I said "What was that like?" or "What are you" you know I was trying to like talk about, well its because he was a man too and I needed something to talk about and I felt uncomfortable, I think I picked that subject. We're getting off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well wait a second. Is this the one who, who was kind of really withholding and didn't talk much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he made an advance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he, what, not, he didn't make a physical advance but the things that he said were leading and, and the girl that set me up with him, which she was freaking, I'm not friends with her anymore because she was too weird, but, but he made some moves on her and she wouldn't expand but she told me that and then we stopped being friends and then she gave my name to the authorities or whatever and they came over to my house and questioned me. (42:51)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what did he say to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He just said stuff like "Oh God" I'm saying, "My closet is such a mess. I need to clean out my closet" I mean and he goes "How would you like for me to come over and help you clean out your closet?" I go, stuff like, I mean weird things like that like him coming over and helping me. I thought that was a little bit bizarre. Is that weird? I mean I just felt a general uncomfortable ness. Like, I don't know. I didn't like him. He just makes me cringed and then sometimes, oh he called me up on the phone and or I'd call and say "I can't afford to come this week" and he'd say "You can't afford not to come" and then he'd, oh he was letting me come to therapy for free.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he said "Well you can pay me back when you become rich and famous" or something. This was when I was, my singing thing, days. And so I was going to therapy for free which I thought very strange and what else and then I think he, I think he called and hung up on me a few times to see if I was home. Anyway, so I don't like to (inaudible at 44:25). It scares me, the guy, the guy that, I mean even though I want to see the male psychiatrist I think I'm better to handle it but it still scares me a bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what scares you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About seeing a male psychiatrist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Oh! Huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is he cute or anything? Because if he's cute it's going to feel funny.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's, he's a handsome guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh God. Is he married?</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's important about that because now, ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that I'm interested in him being married but if he's married I'll have a safety.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll feel safe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now see now you're asking me a question about him, about I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [He can't get expand.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's different giving information about someone else</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh well I understand that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it is about myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right I understand that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I know my own limits and..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you married?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK. There see I'll ask that question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think its important for us to talk about what that means to you because I imagine that it means something to you. Whether...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it does mean that I like to know, well, well I feel like you probably have some maybe same struggles as me, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because your single and...Sometimes I feel, now this is nothing against you, but sometimes I feel like someone who's married might know more about relationships. (46:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could tell you how to get married.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not, I don't know, but then I don't know your whole thing and then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then the thing about you being single is like "Oh well lets go out" you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. All right. So there's a lot for us to talk about. A lot, lot, lot for us to talk about including this thing with this psychiatrist which I hadn't heard before and I think is actually very important because what I had heard from, about him so far is, you know, that he was this withholding guy and then its like there's this withholding guy who's making moves on you. So there's something that seems very important about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going to give you Dr. Blackwell's number.</p>

<p>(chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for you to call and make an appointment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll be ok. I'll be ok. I need to learn to be ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But that's the whole reason I wanted to see Dr. Canton in the first place was so I could get used to talking to a man but then it just kind of backfired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now, anyway, blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want? Listen Kerry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you don't, if you have more questions or concerns about this, your not being comfortable with doing this with a male psychiatrist, I can refer you to a female psychiatrist. Don't call and we'll talk more about it next week or you can call me and let me know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is he really that good looking? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know what your taste is.</p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is it time already?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Oh green thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Thank you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Rich?</p>

<p>(chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he's a doctor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing)</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right I'll see you later.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye. (48:07)</p>

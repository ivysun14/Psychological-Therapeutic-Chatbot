<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How have you been since I last saw you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been taking the medicine, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like you said, and I've still been doing impulsive things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, um, I've been spending money like crazy.  Like, I don't even know where it goes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just, like I, uh, I was pretty good at it for a while, like managing the money.  Now it just kind of just disappears.  It just, and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But what it, what are some of the things you're buying though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Crap, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Stuff that you don't need, or you don't open, you don't use, you don't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Stuff I don't need.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, I say I need it, but I don't need it.  I just spend it, like, on whatever.  Like I've bought like 20 different pairs of gloves just because, I don't know, because I just want to.  I'm -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Buying stuff for my house that I don't really even need.  I don't even have space for it.  The other day I bought like 2 sets of glasses, like drinking glasses -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I went to the discount and just spent a whole bunch of money on glasses when I already had a set, and I bought like 3 different sets of glasses that don't even match.  Um, I stole $100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From my job.  Something that I've never done before and I feel like crap for doing it.  I don't even know why I did it.  I don't even know.  That this has been killing me since I did it because I'm not that type of person.  [CRYING].  Like, I, I don't even know why I did it.  I just did it.  And then after I did it, I felt bad.  But I feel like I can't tell nobody because then I'm going to lose my job -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't want to, I don't want to, like, people just look at me like I'm a thief when I'm not.  And I've been drinking again.  I told my doctors this today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I just feel like, I feel like I'm going to split.  Like I feel like I want to be all these different people and I can't be.  I can't even be myself, you know, and I want to be this perfect wife and this perfect mother.  And at the same time, I want to be like this perfect person and at the same time, I want to go out and I want to have fun and I want to, I don't even know what I want.  I just, I just, I just feel like I'm going to just split.  I just, I don't know.  And I don't even, I don't even know where this is all coming from because I was feeling okay for a second, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What with the medicine, I was feeling okay, and then all of a sudden, I feel like I'm going back, you know?  I'm, people are telling me things and they're like, "Okay, we've told you this like 50,000 times.  You're not remembering things anymore."  You know, it's like you're doing things you don't remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're not focusing well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not focusing at all.  And now my doctor's like, oh you know, "I don't even know if you can handle going back to school right now."  I'm like, "Well then I'd rather be at work because I can't afford not to go to school."  You know, like, I have to finish my career.  But she's like, "You have way too many things on your plate and you can't even focus on one thing, let alone three different things."  You know?  And it's just, I don't, I don't know.  And my husband is like, I love him, I don't love him, I kick him out, he stays and he tells me he wants to work things out, but he doesn't understand me.  And I told him that I just, I need to, I don't know.  Like I told him I need to be free, like I need to, I need space, I need to just figure this stuff out, but he doesn't understand what I need to figure out.  He doesn't understand that I'm sick and he said, "Well what are you sick of?"  Like, "That's all mental.  You just don't know how to control your emotions."  You know?  And I've been having a lot of nightmares.  I don't know if the nightmares have to do with anything.  It's just all these things.  It's like one day I'm good, like yesterday I was fine.  I was just like cooking, baking, everything he wanted from me, you know, and then today I feel like crap.  I just, I don't want to be bothered.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  You're on, uh, 15 mg of Abilify, right?  And you, you're now on 200 mg of the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I was thinking if I could [INAUDIBLE] on if they give it to me at the emergency room because of the back pain because I stopped taking the Ultracet because I finished, but this whole thing because of my period and my back when I get my period, my muscles start contracting and my back hurts more.  Plus I stand at work like eight hours straight.  I just, my back can't take it.  And then I was drinking.  I've been drinking like the last week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You, you get intoxicated from it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.  Not like drunk where I pass out, but tipsy.  Enough to put me to, like enough to make me sleepy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  All right.  Because that's not helping your, your mood, you know?  The alcohol, it's making it worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what my doctor said, I have to stop drinking.  But I don't even know where -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Disturbed.  A lot of nightmares.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still take the Seroquel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't been taking it because I just, like I, I, I don't get, I don't have, like I haven't been able to sleep eight hours -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or like lay down for eight hours.  And since I've been having the baby, like, in the morning -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't want to be sleepy, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> While taking care of her, so I just haven't been taking it.  Maybe today if I can go to sleep early enough, I'll take one and see if I can get a good night's rest.  That's another thing, I haven't been sleeping.  I've just been stressing myself out.  [INAUDIBLE] was going to cut off my night.  My cell phone's about to get completely disconnected.  It's half-disconnected, and today at midnight it goes completely disconnected.  The rent is about to be due and we haven't even saved anything for it because I'm bad with money now, but he's worse -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With money.  And he gets paid pretty decent.  I don't understand.  Our money doesn't last.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  I'm going to increase the Abilify and, and the Lamictal.  So the Lamictal, you're going to take 300 mg a day now, and the Abilify, you're going to take 20, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why do I feel like I'm so many different people?  I want to,  like I want to be able to be this like, I don't feel like I can hate my daughter, and I want to be this perfect mother for her, [CRYING], but most of the time, I feel like I just can't deal with her.  I love her to death, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She just turned a year, but I don't feel like I have the energy or the patience to deal with her.  Like, there's sometimes, like, she's too needy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't feel like I can be there for her the way she needs me.  And I feel bad because, you know, she's just a baby.  She doesn't know.  If it wasn't because of my ma that helps me out so much, you know, and my sister, I think I'd probably be in worse condition.  She's, she's so cute.  She's so wonderful, and she hugs me and she kisses me, but she's needy and I can't, I can't even take care of myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the La, Lamictal, it's going to be 150 mg tablets and you're going to take 2 of them, all right, which is 300, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just discard the ones that I have at home, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, no.  You have 200 mg tablets at home, so you could take 1.5 of those -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would be 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Oh you have to call the thing for, um, the, the Medicaid.  Because I use -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, right, right, right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I have two insurances.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you have your Medicaid card on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.  I have the number.  I know it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What's, what's the number?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure there's not one more number?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?  And what's the sequence number?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  I think that should be it.  Is that it?  Is that how it should be?  [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or is it supposed to be five numbers?  I think it's supposed to be, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's more, there's more to that number than that.  It tells me it's missing a number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Oh, man.  I'm going to have to call you when I get to the pharmacy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  You don't, you don't have the, uh, Medicaid card?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I didn't bring my wallet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I left my wallet at home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So when I get to the pharmacy, I'll have them call you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], I, damn, I used to know my number by heart since I barely used it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old are you now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [AGE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In drinking the alcohol, what does it do for you, though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, it just makes me forget everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes me happy for a second.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you aware that when you do drink at least to get a, in, a little intoxicated, um, you'll, you're going to feel even worse the, the next time when you come down, come, when the alcohol is out of your system, you're going to feel even more depressed than you did before your drank?  Are you aware of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's the, uh, pretty much the vicious cycle and that so you, you drink more to believe that you're feeling happier or to forget and then you feel worse, so you drink even more, then you feel worse, you drink more, and the next thing, you're, you're addicted to it, alcoholic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is it really bad?  Like do you think I could handle work, school and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't believe you can at this time.  How would you, uh, pay for school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got financial aid this semester.  I don't know about next semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, see, so you couldn't add another stressor because if you don't, if you can't finish the semester, you still owe the money that you borrowed to pay the tuition, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I need to finish the semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I mean to continue to, to work, take care of the household, go to school, relationship stressors, managing your daughter; that's a lot of stress, and a lot of time.  So I'm going to see you again on, uh, either [DATE] or [DATE], Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If it's, um, on a Monday, it could be at night.  If it's on a Tuesday, then in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Morning is fine.  What, how early?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, if it's before, let me see, how about like, I could do it in the afternoon, just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 1:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, 1:00 is fine.  Even later actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> 3:00?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> 3:00 is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so I'll see you on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll have the pharmacy call you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

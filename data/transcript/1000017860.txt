<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whatever you feel like doing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not fair. Start me off. What do I do? Just start telling you what my problem is? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If that feels like the first thing to you. I mean it sounds like you want me to tell you what should be the first thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I thought maybe you would help lead me into something so that I could start talking about (inaudible at 0:00:25.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's hard to start. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I have a problem there talking about a problem. You know because there's so many answers. But I guess I should start from the beginning. The reason I came to therapy, I don't know you probably have read my background. But the reason I came to therapy was because I've got two hang-ups really that are bad. Well, actually one it centers around. Problems that I have with men. And the problem being that, I don't know whether it had to do with my father or my brother or what it is, but I can't stand to be rejected by a fellow. I don't care what he looks like, whether he's got a brain like a peanut or whatever, fine. But if he rejects me, oh my God, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd stand on my head for attention. That's another thing. It's like attention from men. I've got this, I can't, you know like, I kept telling myself I didn't know I was doing it, you know. And then I have a friend who is, well she's very intelligent, been through college and everything and I haven't yet. And she said you know, "Don't tell me you don't know." And then that kinda jarred me. What do you mean you don't know? You do know that you're doing these things. But you know I still don't really know why. I do know that I get the feeling. And then when I feel rejected I know that I'm doing you know like crazy things. Like practically standing on my head, you know, just to get attention. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really goofy. Flirting and things like this I know just comes out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just do anything. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, it's like weird. You know like I'll say things and it's just you know like body language type thing. And I say I don't realize what I'm doing which is true, you know, the specific things. But I do know that I have this feeling. 0:02:11.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That I have a craving for attention like, you know like, she's better than I am because he's not looking at me and he's not paying attention to me. Not that I care about the fellow. It's just the point of the thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. The point of being rejected. You feel there's something wrong with that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well it's almost like there's something wrong with me. Because you know what I mean? It's like my own opinion of myself that there's something wrong with me because he's not paying attention to me, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it doesn't, I don't feel that way. This is funny. If it's somebody else's boyfriend, I don't feel that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all I don't even bother talking to them that much. I've noticed that of myself. It's sort of like that's hands off, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like if there's a fellow and there's like, this happened. This is where it really got, it came out that I said I had to come. This was back in January when I had my birthday. My twenty-first birthday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my one friend invited over one fellow and invited a girlfriend. So there was three girls and one fellow. Well, you know we were all dancing together. And I had to separate myself from the crowd so that you know he would notice me. Me, me, you know, I'm here. Notice me. And it was silly because she had actually had him fixed up with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he was going to ask me out and everything. And I didn't know this until afterwards. And all sorts things. By the end of the night we had kissed and everything else. And finally my girlfriend, my other girlfriend left. And then my, the one girlfriend I live with she went in the other room for a while. And she came back and she was like, "Jesus, I don't know what's going to happen." Because I'd been drinking and that too. Nothing happened but you know like, I was afraid. Not that I think sex is wrong or anything. It's just the idea that, in the house with a friend that had been introduced by my girlfriend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know things like this. You just don't do that. So, you know it's just that goofy thing that I felt like, here I am. I'm the conqueror. And I remember when the other girl left I didn't even get up to walk her to the door. I just sat, like this is my friend. He's mine. Look, see? 0:04:00.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He liked me best. And it's goofy. And I don't know whether this came, my girlfriend's problem. She had also gone through therapy, the one girl that told me to come here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She had gone through that because her father, she felt that her father didn't know how to love a girl. And I thought, well this is very funny because she said father. And I said, "Yeah, gee I did have a father until I was eight years old. I lived at home but he worked at night. And I hardly ever saw him."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So you think that might be connected? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, partially. I said, "Gee, I remember only one time." And I told her this the other day, I said, "The only time I really remember my father was one time he brought candy home. And it wasn't the kind of candy I liked so I can remember I had a big tantrum over that. And it's the only time I can remember my father. Was like one time."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I remember once or twice my mother said, "Don't bother him. He's sleeping." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But otherwise, my father. I said like gee. He died a few years ago. I went to see him when he was in a coma and then when he died. And you know, I don't even remember him from my youth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's almost like he didn't exist. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, like I blocked him out of my mind because you know like I really didn't know him. Or something, or something like that. And then like my brother too. My mother, one time I went to see her. She's in the hospital. She's bedridden for, since I was eight. And I went to see her. And she said, "Yes, your brother always," my big brother is three years older than me. "Every time he got money he bought you something." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, "He did?" I couldn't remember that either. I remember when he protected me one time when somebody tried to beat me up. I was a tom boy and some boy tried to beat me up. So he went after him on his bicycle. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I got disappointed because I found out afterwards that he didn't really beat him up he just told him to leave me alone or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I said, "Gee, you're not going to beat him up." And then, and then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that this is like curious to you or something that you don't remember. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm wondering why I can't, you know I've got like a mental block against them and I'm wondering if that doesn't have something to do with it. Like I was rejected by either both my brother and my father or just my father. And then I took it, you know like this love of my brother and when we were separated. You know, no brother. 0:06:06.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I go back when I'm 17, this is where it started. I think it was 17. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a feeling about that? I mean does it seem intellectually like it should be that way or does it ....</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my brother I know I felt rejected for. Because when I went, I went to another, see we went to the same church shelter. I was in a shelter. Do you know the system of shelters? Ok. And I was at one church shelter with him for three years. He was a favorite. I was, you know I was there. I babysat. I washed floors. I was like nine to eleven. You know, like I was a young kid myself yet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were, it was sort of like he got everything and you were this (overlapping) 0:06:42.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I felt. He had a stepbrother his own age right there. You know I had nobody around my age to play with. You know all this type of thing. So I left there. So I didn't' even see him for a couple of years. Finally I went out, I think I saw him once or twice in between this time, but like when I was I think it was 18? Eighteen I guess. I went to my stepmother's. I finally went to see her. And he was there. And he, we were playing a game with the little stepsister who was now about 12. That was the age when I left, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was your age when?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's when I, when I left home she was 12 at that time. No she was 12 when I was 18. But I left that home when I was 12. So we were playing. And he called her by my name. And that's all I needed. I couldn't, I'll never forget that. I felt so hurt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because this is my brother. You know he's paying more attention to this kid who's not even related to him. And then he calls, the (corker.) He calls me Jane now because I don't like Jane Marie. That's my full name. But he called her Jane Marie. And that hurt even more. Because that was his pet name for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah, that was your middle name. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well he called her Sissy too I think, I'm pretty sure. And that was my nickname. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know it's just like, like, you know, I've got somebody to replace you. Forget it you know. So that was one problem. 0:08:03.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it leaves you pretty left out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know with my brother. Yeah that's how I felt with men. But see my mother still cared I think. But I know, another thing too. I didn't go see my mother for about a year or year and a half. And I think, when I sat down and thought about it I said you know, I think a lot of this is because you blame partially your mother. For not having a mother. Or possibly even to be taken away from my father too, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Maybe before that I did have some kind of relationship with my father and I just blanked it out of my mind because I didn't see him. I don't know, you know. And I just said, I said, "You know something. I don't really think that I have a feeling for my mother. Or a real deep feeling." Most of it was because I was Catholic at one time and I felt that I had to love my mother. Because this is what you do. You love your mother and father. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really think that. I think I felt when I needed her she wasn't around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: When I needed a mother. When I wanted to confide in people. Oh sure I could go to the hospital. My brother would be there or somebody else would be there most of the time. Or I'd go out there and have an hour because of the train schedule. I went by myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know, I just got to the point where I didn't really feel like she was my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I had stepparents here. Stepparents there. You know you're just boom, boom. Pushed from one place to another. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just, you I got the idea, well part of it is insecurity because I'm like that with girls in a way too. My two girlfriends. They're my girlfriends and they're nobody else's girlfriends and if you don't like me best then I, you know. It's almost the same thing but it's not quite as bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See those two girlfriends could be there and if there's a fellow involved forget it. You know, the fellow comes first. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you've got to hang on to every bit you've got. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, it's like yeah. Because if you don't, if you don't, even, even saying that you care. My girlfriend knows that she has to do that. She has to say you know like, "I care what happens to you." And things like this because I'm still insecure in that way. That I have to, that, if they, like the other two just go out like they do a lot of times. Because I have that hang-up and I'd act like a fool. And they were afraid for me. They'd have to watch me like a watch dog sometimes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Since? 0:10:02.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Since I've enrolled for therapy I've been careful. But see the hurt is still there. I can control myself now pretty well usually. Even under alcohol. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait. What did you say just now? That, what did you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, before when I got drunk like all the inhibitions went out the window. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. But since you enrolled for therapy something changed? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems funny. I think it's just about the time that I realized I needed therapy and I even enrolled for it, realized it, that I've gotten better as far as my actions go. And I've caught that feeling. You know like, mentally I'm pretty strong, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I catch the feeling coming up and I say, "Now this is ridiculous. You know, whatever happened, don't, you know you'll try to find it out with therapy and then it will be easier to fight. Because you know what it is."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. The hurt, you mean. When the hurt starts coming. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Where it started. And I can control it even under alcohol now usually. You know sometimes it starts slipping out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But there's still a feeling like I don't even want that feeling to start welling up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to be able to nip it, if I have to nip it in the bud, nip it in the bud. But you know like this way it's like a struggle. Every time I go to drink something I have to struggle and make sure now, don't act like a fool. And you know, and I have to be almost mean to a fellow to counteract the way I usually you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So if I get it, it's kind of you're always hurting somehow. And it's sort of an underlying thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like a real rejection feeling. And it's with a lot of people. And yet it's very, like my boss. I know I'll probably end up having an affair with him. Because he's nice to me. I don't like him. He's kind of sexy. He's old enough to be my grandfather practically. He's in his 50's. And that's because, my father was older too. My father was 65 when he died and I was 18. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you know, he was older than my mother by 13 years. But it's just very funny because I like when he comes up and he puts his arm around me or something. It's just like, oh gee. You know, I just want to go like this, but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's funny. On the one hand you don't really like him. On the other hand you want to really have that if he's going to give something to you. 0:12:05.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah. If he's going to give it and he's going to keep giving. You know like this has been going on for a couple of months. He still puts his arm around me. He still likes me, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I know it's partially my insecurity again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know like the security of the job is going to be a little bit bad if it gets around that you know like, we see each other once in a while at meetings. If I quit there I probably, I don't know. I told my girlfriend I might like having an affair with him. Because he's, you know, he's sexy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But as far as you know, anything like trying to break up his home or anything, I wouldn't have any interest in it because I'm not in love with him. You know and yet, she said, well then why don't you just tell him you know like right now if you're afraid for your job, that you're going to lose your job. Because I told her, I said that I'm kind of afraid of that. She said, "Why don't you just tell him to stop." And I sat down and I said, came back a little while later and said, "Because I don't want him to stop." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't want to lose him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want to lose that attention. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are several, three things. You really want that attention but it seems kind of crazy or not right to you that you should have, get just that when you don't really like him. On the other hand it's kind of fun to think of having an affair with your boss. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it sounds kind of sneaky, you know. Like you're getting away with something but, I don't know. I, like I met his one son and I've talked to his wife. And this is part of the reason. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like to mess people up and I think part of it is because I came from a messed up home. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean my mother got sick. It wasn't that she, of course then I got another thing on that. That's another reason I thought to myself that maybe I didn't you know care for, maybe I couldn't care for my mother, you know. Like I pushed that love on me because she has a disease that they said was supposed to be breast cancer. But like she'd go to, one doctor would come in and he'd say this. Another doctor would come in and he'd say it's undiagnosable. The other one would come in and say yeah, I think it's breast cancer. I think it was for want of a better concrete term they used breast cancer. But she has many different symptoms than that. So I was wondering, you know like maybe she had problems too. And that she just, maybe she just didn't want to be married or something like this. You know, inside. Not outside. Because she really loved us I think. 0:14:24.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But something like this and then she just got sick and then this way it's like an excuse. When you're sick, you can't do this you know. And it's, I think maybe I thought that way. Not necessarily meaning that she really did feel this way or that it wasn't just biological. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But this is the way I think I thought underneath it all. And I'm not really sure but I think that's what it was. I think there was like a feeling there that she didn't really care because if she did, nothing would have kept us away from her, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really needed somebody then. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like I did, yeah. Because I've always been, well I shouldn't say always. I don't know if I was before, was very insecure. You know I had to be like a feeling of you know. I don't think, I don't think my mother was very overly, how can I say it? Loving in the sense of doing, you know like holding me and things like this a lot. I don't think she did that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was, I know I was a darn tom boy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's kind of hard to be a tom boy type. You know you sort of think of a tom boy as being, I don't know if you'd say hard or rough and ready or what, you know. But not the type that you would cuddle. And I think, I don't think I got enough of that personally when I was young. And I know I didn't get enough of it from my father. And so that's another thing, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Be the thing that now I've got, you know I like people. I don't even you know care about kissing and things like this and even. I don't think, you know it doesn't bother me. I only went to bed once with one fellow. And he didn't know what he was doing and you know like, oh, it was unbelievably bad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:15:58.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: It almost ruined me for sex. Oh Jesus, if this is all it is, yuk. But I don't think my father was you know like really a lot, very affectionate because I can't remember it if he was, to me. And he also, he had a nervous breakdown when he was young. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like there's this big blank in your life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You never had anyone to hold you or hug you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That type of thing, yeah. And it's like, like with a fellow unless, unless I really can't stand him. Then I can't stand him touching me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I mean if it's just like, like he's sort of sexually attractive, and he's nice and he's gentle and he's sweet. Then I like him. You know, for that. Just holding me, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just like that feeling. It's like, it's like a very secure feeling. I feel very secure in that feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like that in all things. It's like, not even just with the physical. It's things like people would be saying. You know like my girlfriends. I like you. I care about you. Things like, oh good. Somebody cares you know, I'm not standing on my little island all by myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like that's hugging. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that type of thing, yeah. So I think that's part of it. You know just like a, it's like a feeling that I'm grabbing for somebody or something and I really shouldn't have to. You know, I know that I should be secure enough within myself to be open to other people. But not to be you know like latching on like a leach and saying, "Now, I've got you. And you care about me. And I've got to be best. And I've got to be this."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's almost like you're so desperate to have somebody that you want to clutch them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and hold on to them. And you know, my girlfriend brought this up too. And she said that, what did she tell me one time? And it really got me thinking. Oh she said, "The only way that you can have friendship last and stay there is by letting it go." You know, by sharing it with other people. You can't always be saying you know like, she. It started welling up one time when she started talking about a whole other girlfriend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:18:01.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said, "You know she's saying something very interesting. Now why do I feel funny, or left out, or hurt or something." I could feel like, you know like a negative feeling coming up in me. And then I said, "You know you're jealous because she's got other girlfriends that you know she's talking about." This one I hung around with for years and we spent (inaudible at 0:18:17.1) and all this. And you think to yourself, "Boy, you know, is that stupid. So she's got other girlfriends. I mean, Jesus, you've got other friends too. But it's all right for you to have other friends. But not for another friend to have one, you know"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When your own friend goes away from you in any way, it's like a sign to you that you're going to be left out again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Or if they, like the other two are going to Europe. My other two best, my two best girlfriends. So we went to Atlantic City for eight days. And the first few days I was really awful because, first of all I didn't know what to do. This was the first time I had been really out of town, you know with just girls and that. And I didn't know what to do. I was you know I was here and there. And they started talking about the trip. And I felt myself just being pushed out because I wasn't going on the trip. And they're talking about what they're going to do in this country. And oh, wait until you see this. And you know like, hey, I'm here. I can't talk about that because I've never seen it and I'm not really interested in it because I'm not going. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it makes me feel even worse because I'm not going you know and that I'm not included. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought to myself that's very inconsiderate for them to be talking about this where I'm not included. And then, you know we started talking about it. We got it out. And when I started thinking too, I said, "It's not really inconsiderate. If it bothered me, all I had to do was jump in and change the subject. Or if I wanted to know, if it was interesting, whatever they were saying, just ask about it. So what? So maybe you're not going there. But it's interesting to know, you know." But again it's not. You can't think. See, I have a problem getting the think machine to take over. The emotion rolls up and it just takes over. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's a problem. That's one of the big ones. And then I'm also a compulsive eater when I get you know any kind of anxiety. (chuckles) I'm reaching all over. Anything and everything, you know just pour it in. And I think that that's partly because I didn't, I don't know, this is, I'm just guessing at this because I don't know. And I was thinking that maybe it's because when I was a little kid, it was like a treat and things like why I know they way that when you're real little and your mother doesn't want you crying because we always lived in an apartment, they stick a bottle in your mouth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:20:28.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words it's food to keep you pacified. So anytime I have a problem it's food to keep me pacified. I also eat to celebrate and I know that when I was younger if I was real good I could go down for root beer or I could go down for something else, you know so. It was like, it's like a treat thing too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know. I also thought it was maybe because, I almost went into modeling one time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was down to like 15 pounds more than I am now. I was nice and thin, you know. And then I went through some kind of trauma over last Christmas. I liked this Asian fellow. He was engaged to a girl back in China. And again it was the same thing. Clutch, clutch, clutch. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like, throwing yourself all over him and then you wonder why you know he says, ah, you can get her anytime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So and then I went through that and I started gaining weight. And then I started this new job. I've been on it for six months. And I work for a fellow who I just, he just got me so (gasp). I couldn't stand him. There was just something about him that just nauseated me, you know. And I started gaining more weight. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: 15 pounds, boom, you know. But that's part of my problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and like Atlantic City too. I started losing some and then I went to Atlantic City. Like I gained, well I went up to 120 pounds from 112. Just boom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This might be wrong, but you are really grabbing for a lot of things. I mean not just food. But you want somebody to care about you. 0:21:58.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's sort of like, it's like a desperate feeling. It's like, but again, I'd love to get to the point like after therapy that I wouldn't have to grab to somebody or something. That I would know that I was good enough inside. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Personally I think it's like a self worth thing too. Because like when I was a kid and I was growing up with stepparents, there was things like, you would feel the difference between their own children. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you would feel, at least I would. Because maybe it's not even what they said. It's just the way I took it sometimes too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because maybe I had that opinion of myself in the first place, I don't know. That's possible. Probably is. Because they say they can't hurt you unless you know like you were messed up already. So I'm not sure. But I can remember things that used to hurt. Little things like this was Saturday it was said, "My granddaughter wouldn't lie." Insinuating like I would, you know. Thanks a lot. (chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it just, I don't know different things like that. And I remember my best girlfriend another time, but this was when I was younger. I met a fellow in summer school. And she started taking the bus with us because she was taking another class too. I was going to go into pre-med so I took chemistry. And so we were riding the bus and then he started to like her because I would get real clammy as soon as she talked to him. Well she also flirted a little. Her boyfriend was over in service so. And she was cute. She had a shape like this. You know that type of thing. And so I had a problem there with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt, I felt there was something wrong with me because he got to like her. Or I thought he did. And I would clam up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not realizing until afterwards that the more I clammed up, the more I drove him away. Because I mean, who wants to have a girls sit there and go, err, you know. And just be like a stone face. I mean, what kind of relationship can you have? So you know a part of it was my own fault. And then we had, we had a fight over that or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She called me some goofy name and I called her a dumb wop or something. And oh, I don't know. Some real goofy thing happened. And we had a fight like for about two weeks we wouldn't talk to each other. Oh, it was unbelievable. But it was all mostly, mainly because of fellows that I used to get myself into trouble. 0:24:13.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Goofy. You mean unpleasant and it shouldn't have happened and? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think of them now. I think a lot of the things I did were silly and I'm almost to the point right now because I've started thinking about some of these things already that it doesn't happen that much any more. And I'm getting fellows to like me. Like at work I always have fun. My boss kids around because he's, "All right, which one is that one?" Because they always come by my desk and talk to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's just the idea that now, I've discovered that you can't be nice to fellows. It's stupid but you can't be nice to fellows. You've got to be, you know, I can't care less about you. And then they're, you know. But as soon as, like you can't be the same with a fellow as you can with a girl. You know like a girl you can share with her. You can do things for her and usually she reciprocates. You know some of them don't. Some of them take advantage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I don't trust people. This is another thing. I don't trust people who are overly friendly and want to give too much it seems for nothing. You know like they're always giving you something when you don't even know them that well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kind of worry like, you know like what's going on? It's almost like I'm afraid she's going to stab me in the back. Or maybe it's just afraid that she's going to just take away her liking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know exactly what it is but there's you know like there's a problem there. And I'm not really sure how that works. But usually if it still keeps going on and they prove their, they prove them self. A girl can prove their self much more with me if she can do like, like I'm very naive in some areas. Like with people. And there's one woman who goes back to this boss all the time and says everything you say and any kind of an attitude you have. And doesn't like you and really turns around and you know. But in front of you she's so nice. You know it's like, it's like another thing of my insecurities that it bothers me. But if another friend, if another person, like one girl at work did tell me that this woman was you know, spreading rumors about me and all this. And I said that is, you know, I bet she doesn't really like you.0:26:10.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because of some of the things she said that if I would have been attuned to it, if I would wanted to pick it up, I would have picked it up and I would have been smart and not said anything in front of her. And just said, "Well, the heck with you. You know, everybody can't like you. If you don't like me, tough with you." But when she said that, all of a sudden I really wanted to do things for her and really wanted you know like. Because it was just the idea that she cared enough about me so that I wouldn't get myself hurt. And she told me about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: She told me, she says, "Come on, come on." And she sat me down and talked to me. So to me now this is a real friend. I mean you know like you don't have to give me gifts and things like this one girl always did. This is one of the reasons I didn't trust her. Because you know like things that are like material that are given. And that might be like the shelter too. You know like, here's my home and then they say oh, I love you and all this baloney. And three years later they ship you out, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: We're not getting along, you know. So it's sort of that type of thing I think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There's too much given for free. But if there's something like a caring. A real, you know like a real showing that there's something deep inside. That there's something, a real liking for you. Then I think, you know, then I like that idea even better. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So like this girl and I are getting to be pretty good friends. But it's very funny with me. You know like in that area and it just, it just bothered me so much that, when I started thinking about these things. Like I couldn't remember my father. I couldn't remember my brother except for certain instances. I said that this is ridiculous. I should have much more of a memory than that from my childhood. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The only things I can remember are like drastic things. Like when I fell off a, oh I hit my head with the back of a swing or something. I can remember things like that. But of course that's like an accident that's really out of the normal. But like little everyday things that a lot of people can remember, you know like little things. I can't remember anything. Except the night when I got in trouble or something like this. 0:28:04.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that seem odd to you or? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well it's not only odd to me. Before it just seemed like odd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought well, so what? Some people do remember, some people don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think the reason I'm thinking more of it now is that I know that there's something happened when I was younger that caused you know like what I'm having now. And for a while, because I sort of regressed into a shell for those three years that I was from nine to twelve, I was a complete shell. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I came out of it you know like a little bit. But it was still, you know like you have to like, that's my foster mother gets another girls about my age. She likes her better. She says she has a pretty face. So right away I'm ugly because she's got a pretty face and now (ma) likes her better than she likes me, you know. This type of thing. And it's just, it's just an idea. I think a lot of it comes back to self worth. And I never thought of myself as being anything much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I listen to other people. Same way with the church. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Boy I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even, oh God, until I was 19 boy. Went along with the church and everything. I thought a lot of the things when I sat down and thought about them, I said, "Well these are ridiculous, you know. How could anybody who is half way thinking believe in this?" And I said, "Well, then again there's always that hell down there, you know." And so it would be like a thing that I would sort of brainwash myself. Don't think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really that's what I was saying to myself, you know, "This is nice and easy. This is what they tell you. So you go along with what people tell you rather than trying to figure out what's going on yourself." So then I got through with that and about a couple of months later that was the end of the church, you know. But I don't regret it now. I did for a little while. I was kind of afraid. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I went to an (inaudible at 0:29:44.4) mass last Sunday which is very close to Catholic. And I had fun with it. And I started to feel like an emotion rising up and I said, "Is it fear? Is it, do you want to go back? Or is it just because it was a guitar mass and you're getting into it?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:29:59.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said to myself, "No, it's just a guitar mass and people are getting together and that's what you feel. The vibration in here." Because afterwards you know I talked to the priest and everything is very nice and he's very friendly. But you know, everything was very nice and very friendly but that's it. You're not going to get me into your church because I don't want it. So, I went with my stepsister. She wanted me to see the guitar mass. So, I don't know. I have problems in that area. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I used to live with my sister. With my stepsister and her brother and her husband. And this was like for a year and a half up until six months ago. And now when I went to see them, he didn't say anything but he kind of looked at me and he winked. And it wasn't just a wink where like you know when you're talking and you'll say something, you're really goofing around. It was a wink like a flirt wink. And I thought, "Oh Jesus Christ. She was right. My girlfriend was right again. She said, I bet when you were there that's why your sister was sort of jealous. Because you would do things and you would maybe not even realize you were doing them. You might have just wanted attention from him as attention, you know, to have him talk to you and things like this. And yet it was taken wrong by him." Or maybe it wasn't taken wrong. Maybe I really wanted him to care about me or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And there was, there was things starting to come up. You know like she started, because she was, she sort of let herself go. She wouldn't comb her hair. She wouldn't put on makeup. She wouldn't do anything, you know. And he's a good looking fellow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's an old 28 and he's a young 28 so, problems. So, I don't know. So now I'm much more careful and much more observant than I used to be too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I watch other people's reactions. I never used to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. That's what taught you to do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Partially, yeah. Partially him and I guess there was a few other things that I sort of watched and weighed a little bit before I said things. But I still think once I get this out and I find out what it was you know like when I was a little kid that started this whole ball rolling and this insecurity. I know like I said that part of it is because I was just thrown from home to home. That's part of it. 0:32:05.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like I feel like gee if I get close to somebody they're just going to take off. They're going to say, "I don't like you anymore." or you know "You can move out now." Like my first stepmother. And I know this is partially it. This is why I, well partly the father I felt really close to. And I know this, I had a feeling. And we had a big fight. His wife and I. And she, she was going through menopause at the same time right? So she was so sick. And she was bleeding so heavily like on New Year's Eve that she almost didn't make it. They were going to go out as Santa Clause. I guess it was Christmas Eve. Santa Clause and Mrs. Clause. And she was so sick she almost couldn't make it. So he cried and he got real mad at me. And he said you know like, "If you ever hurt her again, blah, blah, blah." Like you know like I don't care about you. I just care about her. You're doing it all. It's all your fault. You know and I go, oh, yeah. 0:32:58.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean all that was laid on you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that type of thing. Well, this is the way I felt. I don't even, I don't even remember exactly what he said. But I can remember, "If you ever hurt her again." You know it's like, like you're just, you know like an extra. Like you're a dog that wet on the floor too many times and she's getting angry with you. You know like she's very important but you're just, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt, see this is the way I felt very strongly attached to him. And I'm getting to the point where, you know like when I go out to see them and he's said some nice things. And he's been very nice to me. And now I can feel like almost a relationship, a father relationship starting with him again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But for a while there it was just like, like he didn't care. And then the next stepmother. When she was moving to Yonkers, she doesn't even say, "Do you want to come with?" Or whatever or, "The reason I can't take you with is because the house is too small." Or something like that, she says, "Well, you can move in with Jenny. She asked you already. " </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:33:58.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: She says, "Now I'm worried about Michelle." That was the other girl. "I'm worried about Michelle because I don't know where she's going to go." So here you are. Thanks a lot. You know like you're a piece of garbage. We just picked you up and we throw you out in the garbage can. Because we're moving. And you know we can't take any litter along with us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just this type of thing and this is the way I took it. You know like, "Shit, here it comes again. She doesn't care about me either." 0:34:17.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're really hurt but at the same time you're a little resentful and angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, there was resentment and anger in that too. Because I mean, well you know how, well I guess maybe you wouldn't. But I mean being a kid, I was no, I was about 18 back then. No, yeah about 18 or 19 then. See, I should have been over that. I should have been old enough that you know I should realize.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I didn't. It was just, partially the way she said things too. She was very blunt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't go around and soften things up. What she meant was simply, we didn't have enough room. And Jenny has asked you to live with her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you know like, you know, we don't want you to go but we can't take you with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no way. And it's also so far from work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like objectively that's the way it was, but you still felt differently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. But she didn't even bother to explain like this. She just said, well Jenny. This is how she put it down, "We're moving to Yonkers." And I said, "Yeah." And she said, "Well," she said something about, "Well it's a good thing Jenny has asked you to live with her. But I'm worried about Michelle." See? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not only was she rejecting me but she was saying she was worried about what was going to happen with the other one but you're, you can just go over there because she's asked you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where did that leave you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. I was still on the outside looking in. Now you can help me find out where to put the other one. Because we want to make sure the other one is comfortable and you know, has a good home and all this. Thanks, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like a feeling again. Like those two times I can remember that. And I can remember the day my mother,</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're so used to it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean people just hitting you and hitting you and hitting you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all you can say is, "Oh fuck. You know, it's happening again."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. What are you going to do? It's coming again. And this is why I'm like this. I know this is why I'm like this with girls, that I'm afraid that you know, they're just going to, somebody else is going to come along and they're just going to care about them. Even with fellows I guess basically. There's going to be another girl. She's going to be better than I am or prettier than I am. Or he might think she's nicer than I am. 0:36:13.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know. And again, if he doesn't like me best then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's just like you're something that can be passed off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. Like sort of a second, second best all the way around. And I don't want to be second best. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think, see, like with my boss. I still know I'm second best sometimes. Because he'll say something. Like he won't come right out and say my wife this and my wife that. But like he'll say something about, one time he said, "You know you're the only person in this whole office that can aggravate me." You know, he said, "In fact there's only one other person in this whole world that can aggravate me." Well, he probably means his wife, you know. Because it's sort of like an aggravation that's not really an aggravation, you know. It just means like you can get under my skin and like I don't care about anybody else. But you know like, you know when you like somebody that you can get angry with them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you really don't care about somebody you say, to hell with you. If you want to act like that then the heck with you. But if you care about somebody then it hurts. And that's when you go back. And this is when you get you know like angry, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So this is the way I feel towards him because, because he likes me. And again like I said it's not really that, and partially he's so old too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's probably more a father image than anything else. Because I sat down and I thought to myself, "Would you like to go to bed with him?" And I thought, "Yeah in a way I would. I think he's very sexy." Then he kissed me one day. This is another thing, he kissed me on the lips one day. And I didn't want him to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said to myself, "Why didn't you want him to do that?" And I said, and then I'm thinking to myself you know like sometimes, "Well, maybe he's not even like a boyfriend image to you at all. Maybe he's like a father image to you. He's there and he can hold you and he puts his arm around you. He likes to touch you and he likes to tell you how pretty you are." You know this and that. And maybe it's because I never got that from a father and I wanted it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:37:57.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was a girl and that the only way, maybe like I was thinking too, maybe I was a tom boy because I wanted his attention. Because I'd be more like a boy then. I don't know. It might have been partially...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But with your boss it is sort of you want to get sexually involved with him but maybe not. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe not. Because I did definitely want to have an affair with him before. And then he kissed me like just not too long ago. He kissed me on the lips and he, you know he kissed me rather, kind of hard too. That was part of it. Sort of like a passionate kiss. And I thought, I guess maybe it flashed through my mind, well if he's like this in bed, no. You know. And I don't know whether I really want to go to bed with him or if it's just, it's just that I really just like the attention. You know like I'm getting right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just have him put his arm around me and hold me and you know these things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I really like. Because he's very gentle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is another thing. I can't stand when a fellow grabs me. I can't stand to be grabbed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you don't want to go to bed with him if it is only that you care about him as a father. Someone who's warm and affectionate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The more I think about it the more I think maybe that's all I think of him as. Like a father image, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And what would it be to go to bed with somebody like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Because, this is why it shocked me when he kissed me. That I didn't get any reaction. Rather than having, I had a reaction but it was like, get away. Don't do that. And I was wondering whether it was, just because he was, he was kind of passionate and he kissed me too hard. Or if it was because I really didn't want him to kiss me on the lips. You like kissing on the cheek, and hold me and take my hand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep it that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. And that sort of thing that I really like. He can hold my hand sometimes when he's giving me, not dictation but he's explaining something. He's holding my hand and I like it. I can't say I don't. I may get fired for it but I still like it. And it's partly that with him. But with my brother it's very, very funny. You know he lives like six blocks from me now. Because we both moved north. And he lives about six or eight blocks away. And I never see him. And then the, like the, one time the janitor's wife said, "You know you're going to get spanked." And I said, "Why?" "Because he was over here again looking for you." And that made me feel so good that my brother had actually come over. 0:40:13.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It made me feel a little bit bad that he hadn't called first. He's got the number you know. He had to come up here by himself. But he's only six blocks. But that's ok. But I think now we're starting to get like a little bit of a relationship going again. I don't know. I've only seen him a couple of times since I moved up there. But, and this is part of the thing that hurts too, because I don't know how close I want to get to him. He's got like these old fashioned type ideas. You know like go to Viet Nam and kill all the dirty radicals and oh, my brother. You know like, he was never like that when he was younger, but. Those foster parents didn't have much education. I think they had like eighth grade. Or she had high school and he had eighth grade or something like this. And they had that type of you know like an opinion. That you know like a radical you know, America, love it or leave it. This type of thing. They were not prejudiced which was funny because they were like a German extract and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they were not prejudiced against black people. But they were very Catholic. And they were very hold the flag high. Like the country is right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More or less they were ignorant. They were just ignorant, period. So they just believed whatever anybody threw out to them. So my brother got the same way and this bothers me. It sort of repulses me in a way. And he's got a funny thing. We went to the, we went to the hospital to see my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And he says that hospitals nauseate him. He can't stand being inside them. He can't stay for more than half an hour to see her. And I thought to myself, "Well that's probably the same type of thing that I have." That I hate to get sick and I hate to be you know, I hate people to wait on me and things like this because then I feel like, I can't really explain it. Like I'm not, I'm not doing. And I'm letting other people you know do it all for me. And I'm all you know, "I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself." This and that. 0:42:04.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's kind of funny. So he, you know he's really got a hang up on hospitals. I said, Jesus. My brother, he's like this. Like I say, he's very (inaudible at 0:42:14.4) of hospitals. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't like going there. I don't like the hospital bit. And I just, you know I just, I don't know. I don't even like seeing my mother any more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I admit it. You know like, I didn't before. And my girlfriend was getting on to me. "Now come on. Go out to see your mother." "Yeah, I'll go out to see her." "Why haven't you been out to see her?" "Umm, well, I've been busy." And I know that's a big lie. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could have gotten out there on a Sunday somehow. And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe it is that you just don't want to go. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't want to go. I don't want to see her. And I don't know whether it's because, I don't really have a like a real feeling I don't think anymore, for her. And I don't know. Like I said part of it is because I feel she rejected me. I really do. I feel like she got sick and it, you know like it wasn't, it was almost planned that she didn't want us anymore so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And if not so much now it might have been that I actually felt that way when I was small. Like why isn't my mommy here? Why isn't she with me? She's in the hospital you know laying there and all this. And then my dad, my dad hardly ever came to see me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So you know like I never saw him either. And he, well he had had a nervous breakdown when he was twenty something. Before my mother even married him. He always stuttered quite badly. And he was very, he was very much of an introvert. He hardly ever spoke. He didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. It was this type of thing that, he was very, very quiet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe, I don't know. Maybe I just never knew a father. And I've been searching. It might be that too. Maybe I've been searching for a father. And I think I find one in Mr. Foley and you know he says, "You hurt her again..." You know, thanks. Well, so much for fathers. But it could be. Because like with the other job I work too, I like the 47 year old boss. And I thought I had a crush on him. But I just wanted him to say something to me you know like as me. And I wanted him to care. The 30 year old I didn't care two bits about, more or less you know. I liked him but I didn't, you know.0:44:20.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He was like a, he was like a brother to me almost.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He used to always ask me, "How are you doing?" He said that one time when we had a talk (inaudible at 0:44:30.5). He told me what he thought about my boyfriend and. Oh, it was really nice. He was really nice to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I can't. It's very, very funny how stuff is, there's nothing very, very funny all these things are coming to me like back and forth. I hope you're following because I'm going back here and I'm going. It just, it just feels like all these things just, boom, they come out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm..</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's, I don't know, when I think about it. When I sit down and I think about things like my childhood and I can't figure out why I can't remember anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It really bugs me. I can only remember things like I said, like when I got hurt this time or like when I lied to my mother. And I picked these flowers from this guy's yard. And she made me go back with them. And all this. And you know and I was wondering there too. I've always you know like I wondered about that thing. Why that would stick in my mind. Why a little incident like. I didn't, I don't think I got beat for it or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm wondering if it's not almost like another rejection. Like I brought her this beautiful flower. What does she say? "Go back and tell the fellow you did it and apologize." And this and that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and it's like I don't really care. You bring something to me and I don't care. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it really wasn't that way at all. It was that I picked this fellow's flowers from his yard and you don't do that. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like that. Those early memories have in them that nobody cared about you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it. I didn't really feel like somebody was really there that cared about me. Even my mother or my father. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:46:01.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess it's even worse with my father because I don't remember him at all. And it's so funny because my mother said, "Oh, your brother was already around you." My brother too. "Your brother was always around. He was always buying you things. He was spoiling you rotten." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think, "He was? When did he spoil me rotten? I don't remember that." Funny. I would think that I would remember something like that. That should stick with you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like my girlfriend can tell you things like, oh when her brother and her were like six and seven and even less than that. How she used to see if they had porridge for breakfast or whatever. You know all these little things. And I said her like I said, "How come I can't remember things like that?" Only when I got beat once or twice. I can remember that. But I can't remember the other. And I said, "That's not too kosher to me." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or my other girlfriend, "Oh this is a picture when I was five years old. Oh yeah, I was this in a play and I did that." And I went, "Oh did you?" Jesus, I can't remember anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like you're sort of embarrassed or you think that there's something wrong with that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah I really think there is. I think there's something like, like I've been blocking out and I don't, I don't know whether it's just because, you know like I left and I figure this is leaving behind. Because again like I said I'm very strong mentally. I can sort of like ward anything off that I want to. If I have to inside myself I can do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See like I was there, when I was at that church shelter. She could hit me. She could do anything. I would just stare at her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't cry. You know I keep myself pretty well and I won't cry. It's very hard for me to cry most of the time. Sometimes you know like at the drop of a hat I can cry. When I'm relaxed especially. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But like with her it was like, "If you're going to hurt me I'm just going to build a wall and you won't be able to get in."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's very important to you to to be able to build that wall because that happened to you so much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And that's what it was. I think it, you know after a while because I wasn't like that when I first went there. First I was in an orphanage for a year and a half. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know how you get, I don't know if you've ever been in one but you start getting like sneaky like the rest of the kids and things like this, you know. You learn lying and you learn how to get around the nuns. And you have to be nicey nice to them, you know. And then you take out your frustrations by making faces behind their back or things like this. And you know like when I went to, when I went to the Foleys I was expecting it to be more like (inaudible at 0:48:33.8) No more work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:48:33.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I could have real nice things and I could have, I'd still have friends but I could go out and play and could do, you know, this type of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And all of a sudden I was doing work. And I was watching a two and a half year old kid. And I, you know, and I was like, "Hey." You know no friends my age. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Wait a minute. I didn't get anything out of this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah right. What did I get myself into? And then she started going through menopause and then I started getting... I don't know which started first. You know like which one of us came out, probably me. And I started going you know like away from her. The more she yelled at me like the more I'd say, "I don't care." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know more or less. I'd get that kind of an attitude and I'd just be, oh, guiding myself through the days. And I'd expect to get yelled at. And she'd yell at me and I'd be like a, I had like a real stony face. I was very hard faced for a while. And I knew this you know. And again, like I said, she'd yell at me or she'd, I would never cry in front of her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'd really have to really hit me hard to make me cry. And that would be from the pain. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know like, a lot of kids are very sensitive. Which I was before, I'm sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I, you know like I said now. Things hurt me but I don't show it, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except for once in a while I can get myself out of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's very funny. It feels like a wall. I can feel. You stay on your side and I'll stay on my side. And you won't be able to hurt me anymore, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is what I'm starting to do in a way again. 0:50:01.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See it's almost like, it's almost like a wall. This way I can act flippant. And I can act. I think I put on a real good act like I couldn't care less. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But you're really hurting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Inside. You know like, and when somebody gets tired of the floppiness especially. They can say now you know, forget it. Then I feel again I feel a rejected feeling. But at least I can say, then I can stand up and say, "Yeah, but I didn't do anything stupid. Ha ha. I didn't do anything dumb. Nobody can say.."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You won sort of. You didn't show yourself. You made it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I made it, I made it go back. Whatever it is. You know it's down there and it's just going to stay way down there. Sort of like pushing it even further so that it's not going to come out. At least in action, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like one time I told my girlfriend, it just reminds me of that. Because I said, she said, "Why do you smoke?" You know I said, "Well I smoke because I'm dieting." And she says, "Yeah, but smoking is also bad for your insides." I said. "Yeah, but at least when I smoke it doesn't show." And it, part of this goes back again where you know like I'm using the cigarette because something for my hand, something for my mouth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I've got a, I've got a hang up on the oral bit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is you don't want the insides to show. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, partially. Yeah it's like, it's like I couldn't put it down. You know like, like when, when we were in Atlantic City. After I had been through that little trauma in the first few days. Towards the last couple of days we went out. And I was very good. Very smart. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I came out with a few flippy answers. And one of the fellows the next day told my girlfriend, "Boy is she, you know she's a nice kid. She's so darn serious though and in control. When she tells a joke it's like it's, you know it's like, like it's almost computed now. How will this be taken?" You know, choom! (chuckles) But it, it's because, and I told her, I said, "Yes I am controlling this because I don't want to make a fool out of myself anymore."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't care. Because I, I knew that afterwards that these were the kind of fellows that wouldn't call back. It's not because I was in bed with them or anything the first day. It's just that I was just too giving. 0:52:07.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I wanted, I wanted them. It was like saying, "Please like me. Please like me. Please like me." You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And maybe this is better this way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's almost better. So what? So maybe I only get one fellow talking to me. And like I did get a fellow. And I started to flirt a little bit with him and I could tell it. And I started to pull away again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. So there are these two ways that you've been. Kind of open and just letting everything hang out. And then the other way where you've locked the safe. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. And it's almost, it's almost like saying now which is better? You know to be open and not to be all so like up tight. But then you get hurt because you know like your still getting hurt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Both ways you're getting hurt. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't almost understand why. You say, "But why? What did I do?" You know who raised to be, "Why, what did I do? All I wanted was a little attention." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's funny. But in the block way it's almost as bad because you're seeing everything and you know like now what do I do? You know like what shouldn't I do? And it's almost, well I'm not bad, bad anymore. I'm more relaxed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But like the first few times I did it, Jesus I, should I say this or should I say that. Be sure you're sitting in the right position so you don't look sexy. And all of this goofy stuff. Oh Jesus, you know, let me out of here. I'd rather not go. You know don't go to a party period if you have to go through all of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Too much trouble. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. So I'm getting to the, like I said, now I'm getting to the point where I'm a little bit more open and yet I still have control even under a lot of alcohol. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I catch myself when I start that feeling like you know like they're leaving me out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know rather than saying, "Hey, I'm over here. I'm over here." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I either just ignore it or I try to get myself into it. You know whatever they're saying or doing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's hard, see? Because you've still got that hurt there that you don't know where in the heck it came from. 0:54:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're only guessing, you know. It's like I'm just like groping in the dark and saying maybe I'll find a passageway. I thought maybe with the therapy maybe I could you know get myself talking enough so that maybe it will just come out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know accidentally it will just sort of escape from me, my subconscious and get out of there so that I would know what I was fighting. It would be a heck of a lot easier to, you know. Because then I could say logically that, "Look, that was over with. You know why you have this problem and then you know just boom." It's a lot easier because if I can get my mind over what I'm doing because I know why, I can control it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I don't, I just go right with the urge, just like with eating. Sometimes I get like this, well this is usually when I'm irritated. I get like, like a real hunger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I haven't eaten in six days. And I can just sit down and I can just eat two meals. Just, whoom! Like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sweets all over the place and all sorts of things. And I know you know I'll get in trouble you know like I guess I'm letting my frustrations out on something, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it would probably be the same difference if I used it on sex or whatever. It would just be like too much of something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's got to, it usually has to do with the mouth too. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you kind of want to be filled up, or? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe that's it. Maybe I feel sort of empty like you know again, again that goes with the idea of, it probably goes right back to the idea that I feel like you know like nobody's there. So, you know like if nobody loves me, I love me. And I'll go out and show myself I love me or something. That's funny. I never, I didn't, I didn't, I knew I did both of them but I didn't realize how they fit together like that. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of like a similar problem. Let's see. What else is the problem of the day? It's very funny. I also when I came, I asked them. I asked them if I could have like a man. And they said there aren't any men in the program right now? Because I thought, you know like my problem is that I black out men mostly.0:56:03.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm wondering like, you know like, I seem like I feel like I'm doing something. I don't know. Besides talking your ear off. But you know like I thought the big problem was with men but now I'm kind of coming to the conclusion that it's not. It's just like a whole rejection period and it doesn't make any difference. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's what they found out from the test and that's why they did this, you know. I just tried to figure it out like this. "Yeah, I asked for a man but maybe they thought it was better that I talk to a woman because I can talk to a woman and I can't talk to a man."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There isn't any rational for it. Probably when they put you in the research there probably wasn't anybody, I mean that's probably true there wasn't any men taking research clients at that point. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. Yeah so that was a, you know I'm not saying this because you know like I got you but I just said you know because I got a girl. I said, "Oh Jesus. Now what am I going to do? I got to go into a girl and I was expecting a fellow."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was funny when I thought of that too. Like when I first came here. The first day I kept thinking I was going to confession. (chuckles) I just felt like, "I'm going to confession again. Oh Jesus, here we go again." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're going to bear your soul and..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and that type of thing. But I could never do it in confession. There was always something that I had to you know keep inside because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that the feeling that you came with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I probably had that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That now I have to keep something inside?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see but this is why I'm glad I didn't have a fellow because I think I would have had problem. You know before I thought you (inaudible at 0:57:33.0). Because, partially my girlfriend said you know like she had that problem with the rejection of her father. And it was better she had a man because then she could I guess, I don't know why, relate to him or something and then realize that you know her father didn't love her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't think he did. But you know I feel like when I talk to a man about a problem, all I can think of is the old priest going like this, you know. "Ok your sins are all forgiven." Oh here we go again. And I couldn't talk to them. There was always something I kept back. 0:58:04.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, well partially if I did like I'd say something like "I can't believe in the infallibility of the Pope." Ok, the answer to that would be, "Have faith sister. Have faith." Well I mean this is ridiculous. How can you tell somebody to have faith?</p>

<p> COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But nobody gave you an answer. Nobody helped you or told you anything. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Right. And you're sort of again it was like groping. I want somebody to help me. You know, "Please help me. Please tell me where I go wrong." Even if they would say, they would give me a logical reasoning. But they wouldn't. They'd just say some things are beyond us. Have faith. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You couldn't get anything from them and then when you're with men it's almost as if you expect the same thing to happen again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well with men I don't know what to expect because they're a funny animal. I, you know like I never really, that's another funny thing. I used to always treat fellows like I would treat girls. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the sense that, I mean like I always made sure I look cute and nice and that you know like I, I watched my slang and all of this baloney in front of fellows when I was younger. But with girls and fellows both I always used to think that you know like what you do is you give if you want somebody, you know, to give back. You have to be nice to them and everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But you can't do that like with a girl if she comes over to your house and you make her a drink or something like that. She appreciates it. She says oh thank you. You know all this. But with fellows well, not so much even making a drink. You should do that much. But I'm using that as an example of letting him put his head on your shoulder or something like this. Because they just get to the point where you know like they expect all of this. And then they just go, you know like I can step all over you so I will find somebody I can't step all over. You know it's a challenge to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And with a girl it's not like that, usually. Because usually the girl reciprocates, and like I say she reciprocates and you go over to her house and she's real nice to you or whatever. And you know like you have like a relationship like, you know like it's unbelievable. But like fellows, they're so ridiculous it's unbelievable the way they are. You keep them this far away and they're fine. And they're (panting) You know. You get them this close and they say, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's hard for me to be that way because, partially because I feel like I'm looking for a father or something. And I want somebody. Like I know with my boss I shouldn't be doing this. I keep telling myself, "You don't. Don't let him do that. You know like somebody's walking by. Don't let him hold your hand. You know what's going to happen. You're going to get canned." 1:00:26.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know the job market's kind of bad now. It's kind of hard to get a job. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well you think maybe you'd better stop that on the other hand you really like it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Logically. When I got, this is a mind change when I say, "This is ridiculous. The guy's old enough to be your father. You know you don't really like him that much. You're going to get fired if you don't watch this. Rumors are starting to spread about you." You know I keep, I say, "You're right on. You know you've got to do something about it. The next time." And I keep holding his hand. But because I really want to emotionally. I feel like I want to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's so funny because when I can sit down and logic, I can do it now. I can catch myself like that. Which is better I think. I think it's sort of a sign of improvement that I can say, "Now listen stop it. It's stupid. It's dumb to feel hurt. There's no reason to feel hurt." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if somebody says something, if you think they're meaning it in a slighting way as a friend, ask them what they meant by it. Just come right out and say it. "Well what did you mean by that? " </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't do that before. Just the idea like, they don't care about me. You know I felt, you know, it's not going to do any good. No matter what I do or say. This is why I start, I moved in with my girlfriend. No matter what I do or say it's wrong. So I used to, I used to like be her, sort of like her carbon copy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I wasn't satisfied with what I was you know, so I had to be somebody else or something else. And then I was happy. Not really happy because I was still, but people would say, "Oh you look great." or, oh great. I like this. Somebody you know, somebody thinks I'm great. Even though that wasn't me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know, who the heck needs it? You know if you're always play acting, who needs it? And so finally I got back to myself. You know pretty well to myself. But I said you know, "Well, sorry folks. This is me. If you don't like me there's nothing I can do because it's me." 1:02:18.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there are some changes you've made that have helped a lot. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just in the last few months though it's been mostly. It's been, you know like since I start and I realized, partially I think because I realized I need therapy. I never realized there was anything wrong with me before. I thought I was normal, you know. I just didn't figure out why I didn't have enough boyfriends. And I thought maybe it's because I'm not that good looking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've thought better looking girls get better looking fellows. Or get more fellows. And then my girlfriend said you're full of baloney. Because you know like there's girls around that are very plain looking. And they've got fellows you know like coming out of the ceiling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just because they, you know they've got like a magnetic personality. And they have fun with life but they're not you know like, if you don't like me, then heck with you, you know. But it's hard for me to get to that point. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's time to stop. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ooops, (chuckles) You still have any hair left?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Well, thank you. And where do, I pay downstairs, right? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I don't think you have to pay every time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think they might send you a bill. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this a good time for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually, it's not too good but you know, if I had to get it, I can do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm, let's see. Is 4:30 better? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 4:30 to 5:30?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Let's see. Then I could get back downtown. Let's see. I work two jobs. And the other one I start at six. I could get downtown. I guess I could talk to them and maybe make it later. See because in this job, I mean this thing is so much work. 1:04:11.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so much worse time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what's the best time? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well actually the best time would be about four. If you, if you had an appointment open at four. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today, on Wednesday? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Any day of during the week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any day at four? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Any day at four. That leaves, oh. I can't do until 4:30 then. And let's see. What's the second best? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the second best would be to come early in the morning. But that would probably be off for you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Umm, on Wednesdays say from nine to ten is all right. Is that too early? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No that would be probably better. Because then I could, you know I could get down here. Yeah, that would be good for me. And then I would only miss like an hour and a half of work or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that? Is that, that seems? I mean...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that would be the best I think. Would be from nine to ten. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the day's ok?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Wednesday? Fine. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I guess I should ask if you want to come once a week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I really didn't know because you know like I wanted to leave that up to you. Whether you thought that would be worth, you know advantageous just to come once or twice or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I always tell people it's up to them. Because I think people get a sense of their own way to pace themselves and to how much they feel like they work on in a week, or two weeks or twice a week or whatever. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I was thinking that this was, as far as a money standpoint goes, it would be much better you now like before Christmas at least just basically just once a week. And partially it's the, I don't have a great deal of time to spend with myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and like I'm working two jobs. And I also hole away another little bit because I want to go to Europe for a month next year. I'll meet the girls while they're there. Just a month. And you know like with inflation the way it is. (chuckles) Everything is in a bank. And then I try to squander next week. So I think it would be better just once a week for now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. Ok. This goes in the cardboard box downstairs in the office. There's a little slot where you just sort of dump it in. That way we know when you're coming in. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. (chuckles) Ok, thanks so much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. It was nice to meet you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I hope it, hope it works. (chuckles) Do I work on anything special or just start thinking again until next week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I guess just start thinking. I don't know how to say work on anything special. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's going to come out yet. I mean it's got to. (chuckles)</p>

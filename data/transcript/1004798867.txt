<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really concerned with my bus while trying to wait for the end of the announcement.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. Yea, it was the new product announcement that was kind of a surprise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, so. Well the exceptionally thin new laptop, literally the thinnest. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, so thinner than the last model?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a bulge but not much. There's this bulge where it gets a little bit bigger but that's—most parts are this thin then stand upright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. So it kind of looks just like a display, like the current one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a little bit different looking but very similar, but super, super thin, and twice the resolution of the top HD television market. [00:01:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is that like comparable to the new tablets resolution or is it a -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's higher than that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, no idea about pricing. (chuckling) Like yea, this is being sold specifically to photographers and videographers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have no idea. But, yea so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, it's been kind of interesting at work lately. And all kinds of—it's basically, I'm starting to wonder like, the kinds of things that are going on, like round my work day, I'm starting to wonder if I'm either, like—it's so bizarre. I don't even know how to explain this. It's starting to sound like improbable in terms of weirdness, so—(pause) Yea. [00:02:02] (chuckling) But—(pause) It's, yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're sorry (ph) about that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Well, I mean I might as well say it. I made the joke that I need to get out of the suburbs because they have too much vice for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Vice, yea. Not only do I regularly see my guy on the bus now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I think that because I put the police ahead of this, if I call in there, they met up like if she's on some sort of work release then someone would then leave her alone. He's kind of leaving me alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How, freaked out about it are you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Still a little bit, yea. I'm spending the entire time either on the phone, or in contact with people, or when I see him on the bus, just in case. So, I would like to not show that I'm afraid, but that take progress. On top of it—oh God, this is so screwed up—I don't know if you noticed that they have recently busted a number of houses of ill repute in the downtown area?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the downtown?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, northern area. There have been multiple prostitution houses that have been busted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Including one in nearby? Yea, they've set up shop in the bathroom at the mall. I cannot believe it. This is like, seriously, this sound like completely out of a movie or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there were several guys who were very upset about this because there are women set up shop in the men's bathroom. Not at the store but we have several remote locations in the mall, where one thing where people have stopped one of our business team. And all of the guys on the business team are very upset about it because they couldn't use the bathroom there. [00:04:03] They didn't want to go in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they've had some embarrassing situations. So basically, we got the cleaning lady who speaks almost no English to chase them out of the bathroom and out of the mall because we had contact the mall police. The mall police say something along the lines of, "I can't do anything about it. And I don't really understand. They don't want to have anything to—they don't have anything to get rid of them. And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so they didn't want to have anything to do with getting women out of the men's room?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the mall? Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't really understand why, but they really didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they were just talking about the fact that they have to walk across the mall to use the bathroom, all these guys. So a bunch of us went and talked to the cleaning lady who has no fear. She's about 80 years old. She speaks Portuguese at rapid fire. Quite a few of us [knows how to] (ph) speak it. I don't. And she basically—she went into the bathroom, the cleaning lady, with a mop and basically brandished it and chased them out of the mall yesterday. [00:05:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) My gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's quite a story. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. Supposedly it is undetermined whether or not they are back. But if something were to like, "This is getting to be kind of screwed up. I'm having customers come in all the day kind of drunk. Yea, this guy [is up] (ph) in the bathroom. This is kind of starting to seem not even shady. It's starting to seem like there is a serious lack of caring by the police, in that area about handling anything. And so it's making it weird for operations for our jobs. So yea, that was yesterday in terms of weirdness. So, and I don't know. </p>

<p>It's also getting strange to have the majority of our business not taking—well, not the majority, but probably 40 percent of our business tops taking place at our mall store. [00:06:06] So, because we have so much that happens behind the scenes in terms of the business—people getting stuff that never actually goes into the store. We do so much work with the school districts now and all this stuff. There's a lot of things happening where it's starting to feel a lot less like a store and a lot more like an office. So that's kind of weird and interesting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I think I mentioned to you our break room is in a completely different area in the mall. But I don't know if it's good or worse or what, just different. But it's been a pleasant distraction, yet sometimes it's been kind of stressful. [00:06:58] Lots of stuff going on. Lots of changes going that are—I'm not sure how I feel about the new product but we'll see. So, we're spending less and less time with individual people and trying to push people towards being in groups.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I do not always think is to the benefit of our customers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not because they're not getting the individualized attention, although that is (inaudible at 00:07:29) even an awful lot of people that, when they are in a group, they shut down and they don't learn as much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's just frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—and stuff going on. At home, lots of stuff going on. Mike's been—I don't know how to explain this. [00:08:00] (pause) Up and down a lot. He's been having illnesses that don't necessarily—I think they're stress related more than anything. Digestive stress related illnesses that are really frustrating, so—(pause) And—(pause) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has that been affecting you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we rented a car for the weekend and then all of a sudden he started getting like, hot, cold, hot, cold, tired, and OK well now you've got the flu. Yea, also my doctor back at home was indicted, yea, by the way. Yea, they have this huge federal case against him. [00:09:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, for what? You really like him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. He saved my life more than a few times [in the past] (ph). He's a part of the family. I grew up with his kids. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God, that's really stressful actually because my family is taking care of him. He is a highly—he is a very strong believer in human growth hormone, HGH, for certain types of getting you back to health. And therefore, there were—the federal government—had decided that he was helping the athletes that he's working with that are professional, dope, which is not true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Amongst many other things. And he's open about it the whole. Amongst other kind of things like that and they are trying to make it seem like he has been writing prescriptions without need for all kinds of stuff that he shouldn't be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:09:58] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly, steroid related but it's not—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. They're wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're wrong. They're completely wrong. When I used to go in there, if I didn't get the blood work and all of my stats, then I would not get my refill, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Amongst many other things like that. It is true that I could—we found this out because we tried to call that Friday —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to see if we could get some flu stuff. You can call and get flu related stuff, but not like, I couldn't call and say, "I need Vicodin." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was apparently indicted that day. Yea so, it's just completely untrue. And it looks more and more like he was set up. And it's very upsetting because they actually had to get the FBI in a different city to investigate because he has touched that many people's lives in Cincinnati. Everybody —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —has a family member (inaudible at 00:10:57) and because he deals in diagnostic medicine which about a third of the people in the industry think that it's fake. They don't like the way that they deal with it, the concept of—you've seen "House" haven't you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like once.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, but you know the concept. He's a diagnostic. They think of everyone as being like "House".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just being a jerk, but like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it really isn't like that. They take the symptoms, they figure out what this is, they do definitive tests to eliminate certain things. But they do a lot of things to find out what's wrong with you more than just guess. And a lot of doctors don't like that, amongst many other things like that. And so I think he's made lots of enemies. </p>

<p>And so like you said, it's very, very upsetting to read the stuff. It's patently not true. They say things like he was doing—what's it called, fraud? Insurance fraud, by claiming that a person who is almost seven feet tall had—what was it—pituitary dwarfism, so that he could get HGH or whatever. It's like, "No." It may be that something happened in which somebody—but no. If you were given these things—he worked with a compounding pharmacy. It was always done by your body weight, by all these things. It was compounded just for you. And it was never put through your insurance because your insurance—he explained it, this is not completely proven. So you had to pay for it out of pocket. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you paid the pharmacy and every dose was re-compounded based upon how you're doing. And the reason why my elbows are in exceptionally great shape after the (inaudible at 00:12:53) there is because I did have some HGH injections. So that when I went through the healing cycle that there weren't as many problems that they have with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —replacements. One of my replacements is more than ten years old and they look—they do MRIs to see how they're doing too—if they need to be replaced. And I was told that they've never seen anyone that looked like it was brand new. It looked like it was less than a year old.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My body isn't near—it's fused perfectly. There's no breakdown.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So that's very upsetting to hear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he was the kind of doctor that when I had mono—he wouldn't actually give me anything to treat the symptoms because he knew who I was, I was in college at the time. He said, "If I give something to you to treat the symptoms, you're going to get out of bed and you're going to go to class and you're going to make yourself sicker. I need you—there's nothing I can do to—you're just going to have to sweat it out for this. I can do things to make sure you don't have liver problems because that happens with mono, but —"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "— I won't treat your symptoms because I know that you're in college and you're going to push yourself."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Which you probably would have done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And it's because he knew me since I was growing up. [00:14:07] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea, he was an athlete. He competed in the Olympics once. All kinds of—yea. Big, big.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was his sport?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was in Olympic swimming. He went to medical school while on the Olympic swimming team.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, big achiever not looking for an easy way out. This is not the kind of guy who sells pills for money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just makes me so upset because there's nothing I can do. And—(pause) On top of it, I've always felt like if something really, really went wrong with my health, I could just drive all night, get to Cincinnati, and I knew that I could get seen. Not necessarily immediately, but I could get seen. Knowing that is not like that right now is really kind of distressing. Even though I didn't need it, knowing that could happen, it's, like I said, it's really distressing. [00:15:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It also makes me very frustrated because I know that it may be very difficult to get medical care in certain situations because of his name being attached to some of my records. I already had the problem once when I talked with a rheumatologist that they didn't like the way he handled things. They made it seem like he was like a [long dime on] (ph) in this kind of stuff. But here it is not as much, but right now, he's in the news.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So, my mom actually has a bunch of—it's a biologic that was ordered that was supposed to be injected into her knee that we have no idea where it is. She has 1,600 dollars' worth of [metal thin discs] (ph) which is kind of like, it helps you regenerate the cartilage in your knee. Nobody knows where it is because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. So—[00:16:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so she's actually on the—I have a hilarious—because she's more the type of a person who goes to the top. She called the State Attorney General's office first instead of calling anybody else. But it's—(pause) </p>

<p>It makes me feel like that the people in my life, who have been able to really think outside the box and make the quality of my life better, are being punished and will not be that anymore. And that's really distressing. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really distressing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I already had a really frustrating—(pause) [00:17:05] I ran a really frustrating attitude towards the medical system up here and this makes it even worse. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that also at work were a variety of changes. (inaudible at 00:17:21) The morale, the focus on —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Career versus individualistic training, yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yea. I mean, I was going to say on sort of relationship of customers and morale. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The culture's changed a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In a bad way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. My managers have been really going out of their way to make sure that they can keep the morale up. It's just, the morale is better but it's not necessarily because of that. It's because someone went out and bought Wii and a bunch of games so that we can play video games on it, take a break, or this or that. [00:18:02] There—it is on a low level, the store level management that is keeping us —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —going. It is not coming from above. And that is actually—you have to wonder what they're going to stop them from doing those kind of things that are -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the things that one of my managers did was they worked on making corporate to give us the ability to buy something that wasn't on the market, yet that's going to our stores, at a substantial discount so that we can figure it all out. See I'm wearing one right now. This is coming out in November.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fitness bracelets?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not just that. It actually gets your oxygen intake as well. It's not just a fitness bracelet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It Bluetooth connects to any device there. It gets your oxygen intake. It does a bunch of other things as well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why is it good to have your oxygen intake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, if you're oxygen and your blood, oxy pulse oxygen (ph), when you are working out, that's how you can tell if you're getting aerobic respiration versus not aerobic respiration. [00:19:10] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Amongst many, many other things. This is basically a biostatistics device. This metal piece has to be pushing against your skin and all this stuff. And we all got the opportunity that came out. And we'll buy them with one or two at a quarter of the price.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, so that kind of stuff. That doesn't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it fun?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just bought it. I didn't even charge it up yet but the concept of me having to do that and having us being able to —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —play some—it isn't just like the normal rinky-dink (ph) in terms of seeing distance and all that kind of stuff. And supposedly, because you can plug it into a USB, you can have upgrades in terms of all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:19:52) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It can have (inaudible at 00:19:55) pushed out to it. But that was a manager who said, "Hey, I just met the executive. Let's just see if you can do this as a one store thing."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is not a normal -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not the company doing that and—(pause) It's nice, but at the same time, it's like we know that corporate's pushing for (inaudible at 00:20:19) too. These are pleasant distractions but they are not the core of my job. And that's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's upsetting. It is really frustrating because when I had first moved out here, I was very, very cranky about how things were not the way I that I wanted them to be. And I had really been pushing to try and find a way to accept it or to see that it really wasn't as bad as I thought it was in terms of differences. And now all these differences are sort of reasserting themselves back in. [00:21:03] And, it's just making me very (pause) -how do I explain it? Displeased really isn't the word but disenchanted with my life in general, that kind of thing. So, it is what it is but—(pause) It's just very frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:37) [part of the issue was] (ph) Mike, you know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not feeling well -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not feeling well. He's going to get a neck MRI tomorrow. That's not part of anything to do with this, but he's not feeling well. But I am pretty darn certain that is the stress of work plus many, many other things that are starting to make him not feel so well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and about which there's probably also about little that he can do. [00:22:06] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It's psychosomatic the same way. It's not just gullible psychosomatic kind of things. I'm pretty sure it's stress—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that's making him sick but it's not something where he can easily de-stress and just be okay with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, to have that kind of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it's not the stress of associated with one big presentation at work but then you get it done and then you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I mean—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm going with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. And having digestive problems myself in the past due to stress, I realize that being told to just relax doesn't really work, it's—Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a more fundamental level than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, it's frustrating. I know he's acting out. We had a conversation about the fact that until he finds some substantial way to find out how to get this under control, I really don't feel comfortable—not just comfortable, I feel like it's not right to fill out any forms for adoption. Because we going to try and do all the adoption steps, banking of the fact that by the time it went through, that we can afford this. [00:23:12] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like that's negotiating in bad faith. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because if he's acting out because he's stressed out, because he's sick or stressed out, because there's noise around the house, how the heck is going to cope if there's a baby crying in the house if he's home by himself. I just—(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really wonderful, but certainly a source (ph) of stress as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. But I really feel like that is—knowing that he doesn't have any real—more (ph) control, that's really not the right word—but there isn't (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he doesn't have a lot of control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's (inaudible at 00:23:57) all over it and the S.A. (ph) model says you'll never will but doesn't have any sobriety. [00:24:03] I feel like it's just wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's irrelevant. I mean, I can't agree (ph) to that model but there's still range.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To say that somebody who's in the throes of it. I guess it sounds like he is —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —in the same place as somebody who's been sober with it for a long time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Accurate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't necessarily believe entirely in that particular model.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that it works for some people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that he went to ten years' worth of S.A. (ph) meetings without anything—like, any progress at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Though he had lots of insight and lots of knowledge about these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a sense of how much he's acting out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honestly, I don't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All I know is that when he picked me up on Sunday, he was an hour late. He seemed all over the place and many other things. And, yep. And he forgot that we were supposed to [our plan] (ph) to just look into the forms and see how much we needed to get. We could potentially sit down and do it now, sort of gambling on the fact that we would be able to at some point soon. [00:25:12] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, how big of a disappointment is that for you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Very. It's really, really upsetting because he acted out on the day that we were supposed to figure out forms and stuff like that. The fact that he forgot that we're supposed to do it is actually less upsetting. I mean, it is but it isn't. (pause) If he had just forgotten and I had reminded him, it wouldn't be as big of a deal, if that makes sense?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: True.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We all forget.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then, they're both kind of big deals actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, forgetting though, that you're going to do that, and you are reminded by saying, "Hey, we're going to dinner and we are going to be doing this." That's just—I mean, you make it—you see where it's Sunday and forget about it and then you go, "Oh yea, I remember now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That, to me, really isn't a big deal breaker because it's—(pause) But the fact is, he acted out on that day too and it was the really big one. The fact that I knew that if he hadn't forgotten that it might not necessarily had played a point part in that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he had not forgotten that we were supposed to go on a date and acted out on the same day. You know what I mean? I don't think it's like he forgot and therefore, that made it OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't think that it would be a barrier (crying) in any way and that's—(pause) I have a lot of ethics that I hold myself to and my family to that I wouldn't hold anybody else to. I feel like, at least to me, that it is—I cannot—because in theory I could keep trying to get pregnant and there would be a possibility of liability. [00:27:06] I think that knowing that, because I want to be a parent, is the most selfish, destructive thing I could do. In terms of having children that would—knowing that I could go through hundreds of miscarriages and maybe have one viable child (inaudible at 00:27:19), to me, seems it's on the level of cruelty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think everyone else has to have a different—they have to find their own truth. But to me, wanting a child and then knowing that there's a potential for pain or something like that just seems like a ridiculous thing to me. I would never judge anybody else otherwise. Because there is a possibility I could carry to term, it would just take a long time. That, to me, seems like against the spirit of wanting to become a parent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The same thing about that, I feel it's dealing in bad faith knowing that my husband doesn't have any control whatsoever and saying, "We're going to be good parents. Look at us." [00:27:59] (pause) If I knew of someone close to me who had somebody who was acting out around the house nearby a child, I would feel compelled to call the police. If I knew if somebody who was close to me who had the same problem, who had an infant, or even a young child and the child was exposed to this, I would want the police to handle it. Therefore, how could I—(pause) How could I want to start the process knowing that that could happen right now. Not just "could happen" but there's a—if things all—if they said tomorrow, "Here's a free baby, no cost involved," that it would happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long does the process take from the paperwork to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends on lots and lots of factors. [00:29:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're of like, one to three years, that kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, but every once in a while, these weird flukes happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of things happening immediately, if you can. Sometimes it's much longer than that. Back when Stars first hit, they closed all the adoptions for quite a long time. And then, therefore, everyone who's been on the waiting list, waited longer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so there were people who waited on the list for five years because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —there was this back queue of people. You have to know that, in theory, something could happen and it could happen tomorrow. It's not true, but it could. You have to be prepared enough to be able to do so. And for a home visit, even for international adoptions, you have to get a home visit translated and brought over too. You need to be able to have a house that is not dangerous, that kind of stuff. [00:30:04] Not baby-proof, but you need to have things in order to show that you are qualified to be a parent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just feel very strongly, knowing that it's out of control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Disqualifies you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not just disqualifies me but it would be horribly wrong. Horribly wrong to try and become a parent when that can happen. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your concern? I can imagine if you are wondering which one —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that Mike—part of the reason why he has a lot of issues is related to being exposed to pornography or something, some sort of sexual related thing, being exposed or not exposed to, at a very, very precocious age. That's just something I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he has no memories before the age of 14. He has snippets of memories. [00:31:05] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it, then, that gives you... gives you that impression (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the very, very early memories he has is of pornography being available in his house when his dad just got divorced. We don't really know the age. But also wasn't in a drawer. It was out and about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For him—not even hidden. It was right next to "Treasure Island" kind of thing. But that's one of the few memories he has of that. And so, that really makes me think, "Wow." Working through these issues, kids are super precocious. They figure something is wrong. I want our children to be raised in a way that I don't want them to feel shame about sex. I don't. And I feel like—(pause) </p>

<p>If, for some reason, we were able to become parents very quickly, it would not necessarily be the kind of emotionally positive environment. [00:32:18] They have many books out there for how to raise a non-depressed child if you are depressed. Like how to handle this kind of stuff, how to talk about these things with your kids. They have lots of things for how do—I feel like if you didn't have money, it wouldn't be that bad. You know what I mean? It wouldn't be ideal but that's not a deal breaker. I feel like this could cause terrible trauma potentially, and therefore, that is wrong. (pause) </p>

<p>I feel that's kind of like saying that a kid that is in a household where there is alcoholism, like someone actively drinking, maybe they may not necessarily understand what's going on but it would be ever so different. [00:33:10] Kids are going to see that there's something wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. Yea, I know. I mean, I also (inaudible at 00:33:19) but I was child trained to see kids and on my research in private school on interaction between mothers and infants and how they [were affected themselves] (ph) and stuff like that and so these are (inaudible at 00:33:32) but... Sure, of the explicit and sort of implicit but very powerful ways in which parents kind of train the things with their kids -</p>

<p>CLIENT: They may not know the exact details but they can usually figure out that something is up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the things that I know—and I'm not entirely sure if I've mentioned it here—my grandparents on my dad's side of the family don't get along with my mom. [00:34:05] There's never any hard words that is entirely—if you read the transcript of what happened, you would never think that there was anything wrong. But they just don't get along. And there's never been any incident that did this. It's just very different personalities. </p>

<p>Apparently, from a very, very young age, I would tell other family members this, that I could tell that there was something wrong. As soon as I could vocalize sentences, I would say something along the lines, "I can't figure out why my grandmother doesn't like my mom." I would normally think that I was eschewing (ph) at myself the wrong age, except for the fact that I talked to other family members—and including an aunt that's not in that family—who has said something along the lines of, "I like going to this grandmother's house because this one makes me feel less comfortable, because I can't feel emotional friction." [00:35:02] I said that in Toddler-ese kind of thing. I believe that I possessed a great intellect at a young age but I don't believe that I necessarily had anymore powers of observation like that, more than any other kid. And maybe I'm just basing off my own instinct but I really feel like they -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it's really quite true. I mean, there's a lot that I sort of deal with in doing this kind that very much bears that—(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Body language I think that—(crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Often times, it's the things that are in the air, but not spoken about that cause the kids the most harm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they don't understand it and can't vocalize what they're noticing, like there nothing specifically said about it but (crosstalk) [00:36:05] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Just like we were] (ph) talking about, they don't know what they are dealing with. And usually that's what people don't want to deal with it or can't bear it very well. Sometimes it's other things that everybody's aware of that are very (inaudible at 00:36:22) but a lot of times it's the stuff that kind of in the air, but nobody is talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. I mean, if I want to become a parent, I have to be able to be selfless enough to say that I would rather have it raised by somebody else who potentially doesn't have this issue right now because there isn't any control on it. I'm a believer that if there's a parent who's in recovery and suffers (ph) from alcoholism should not have kids. [00:36:57] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea, this is fine if Mike were sober for five years. Five years ago, I don't think this would be such an issue for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or a year even, or something. And especially because it's such a deep mystery as to what the hell is going on with childhood, I don't want to raise another generation of kids like this. (crying) (pause) It's not just shame and embarrassment over sex, it's over relationships.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And being dependent on things. It's—(pause) It's really profound how much, from the few things that I've heard, (crying) and I just don't want any of that ever to be passed on because it's so—(pause) [00:38:11] It's so painful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know, I'm sure it breaks your heart to see it happen, to see how it affects Mike. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just—(pause) It's really, like I said, it's just something that I feel really passionate about. And I don't necessarily believe I would judge anybody for particularly how they make choices in their lives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It means they have to love their kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. It's the same way, like I said, for the same reasons that I—(pause) It's not—(pause) For the same reasons I don't elect to force nature to necessarily happen in ways that it can't. [00:39:21] It's the same reason. Just like if—honestly-if today, if for some reason I could end up having somebody in my life become a gestational carrier for me and that kind of thing. I'm not necessarily certain if I really want to pass my genes on either. Any person in my life that I would want to love and cherish, I wouldn't necessarily want to, knowing that I have certain diseases that are direct dominant. And people say, "And well, let them make that—you know what, how about just get another kid, a kid that is already alive and needs a home? [00:40:00] Why elect that, for I my own vanity, to have my own genes? (crying) I have so many problems and some of them—(pause) I mean, some of them are just probabilities but some of them are certain. (pause) </p>

<p>Why do that? Same thing, why expose a kid to a situation right now where it's completely out of control. It just seems selfish and against the spirit of why I want to be a parent. (pause) </p>

<p>And it's really hard to talk about these things with most people because almost everybody I talked about it, they assume that I'm going to judge them for their own choices. And—(pause) I would never do that. [00:41:06] Everyone has to make their own decisions at the end of the day. So, when I was in Ohio with the funeral—and I don't know if I mentioned to you—that there's some disturbingly large number of us that are unable to have children?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That none of us would really have noticed or even talked about it at all except for the fact that it came up because the person who killed themselves had problems with fertility. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we sort of talked about the fact that we need to make sure that we stop not talking about it. It doesn't perpetuate someone killing themselves, but it perpetuates the feeling of being alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one of the people that I was talking to about it—I really felt when I told them that I was unwilling to go through another miscarriage because I thought it was cruel—(pause) They immediately felt judged because she was willing to go through it. [00:42:10] And I said, "No, no, no. I would not think it for you. I just say it for me."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saying it, "I can't do this again because I can't handle the emotional anguish," (pause) is OK in that world. Like talking to women who are infertile, saying that I don't want to do it because it potentially could cause pain to a life that I cared enough about that I wanted to conceive makes it very, very edgy. And that's something that I didn't expect. But—(pause) And it made it kind of hard to talk about even. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. It's just really too bad because then you're [a moral woman]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. But also, I mean, I realize that if I say it because I can't deal with it, but that's to me, feels like I'm lying. [00:43:07] Because not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's not the whole truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yea. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure the emotional anguish—honestly, if I was told, "You will go through 25 miscarriages but the 26th with be a healthy baby," I would totally do it, totally. (pause) But I won't necessarily, for myself. But I would have to know also that there was no pain involved for the other entity.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's partially because of the fact that I'm not entirely comfortable admitting to this that I feel that way because it like—[00:44:01] (pause) I don't know, it's just like I said, it's just—it's a—(pause) (crying) Knowing that it could be painful as a death then, and that kind of thing, it's alarming. (pause) And I feel really stupid in talking about this. I don't know why. I feel really awkward talking about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why? I mean, you want to. Why is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because—(crying) I have now gotten the feeling—from talking to women that I know—that there's this underlying belief that smart women, smart people—but because I'm talking to the women about this—smart women don't believe that life starts at conception. It's like, "Well, I don't know, but I'm willing to. I have to pick one or the other." And I feel like that... that I'm being ridiculous and dumb for feeling that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not judging anybody else or nothing (inaudible at 00:45:46) It's like, I am life agnostic and therefore, I am going to default on the side of yes, possibly. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just very—(pause) It makes an already difficult situation more hard to talk about because I have to worry about hurting someone else's feelings, or being judged, or making somebody else feel like they are being judged. [00:46:14] It's just, it's too—(pause) It's too much of a landmine. So basically I, when speaking—and I still feel I still need to talk about it with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when talking about it, I basically make it seem like it is a nil scenario.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that way, it's like they'll think of it, "OK, so I close that door. This is the door that I'm going with."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't feel like a complete lie to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it also doesn't feel like it's—makes it all so I can't talk to people because, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think we will (ph) stop for now. I guess we are not meeting tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're not meeting tomorrow because you're out of town, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, OK, I will see you next week, same day, yea. OK. [00:47:03] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care. </p>

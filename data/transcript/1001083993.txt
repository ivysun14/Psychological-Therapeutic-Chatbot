<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So this shoulder pain, how's it different from before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's always been sore.  I go to raise it up, by the time I get the shoulder level it's hurting.  When they did the surgery, they had to cut all the muscles and tendons.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To replace it and then sew it back together and I don't think they took.  Of course, I couldn't go to therapy because I couldn't afford it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's probably part of the reason.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They wanted me to go three times a week and I couldn't afford it.  Even with the Medicare it still cost me twenty five bucks a visit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I don't think that anything can eat through titanium, that's why they select it because of the -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What I'm trying to figure is why they only put like a half ball.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If part of the bone is still intact.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like an umbrella.  No, well they took that out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The ball.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because the ball had a rebreak in it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And every time we got my arm working right again, but every time I raised it up and brought it down, it would click and I mean you could put your hand on there and feel it pop and what happened was that piece of bone was catching every time I moved it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why they had to replace it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I went through hell that year.  I mean, I'm not even sure what my complete diagnosis is, but I went and I put in, applied for a part time job with a [DEIDENTIFIED] store.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But, you know, people don't want to hire you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, because of the, because of my shoulder and, yknow, other things and they ask, yknow, what, yknow, your diagnosis is through your disability and I can't put it all down because I don't know exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For the psychiatric or the physical?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For the psychiatric.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, your psychiatric diagnosis is major depression and you've got social anxiety and you've got attention deficit disorder so I'd just put down depression, anxiety, and attention deficit.  Do you want me to write those down for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think I can remember them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't go anywhere.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now the other possibility that we've talked about that's not real clear, you may be bipolar, but looking at your treatment, it's almost always been depression.  So a case could be made for saying this is bipolar disorder, depressed type or major depression, recurrent.  I think it's a moot point.  I'm going to treat them the same either way.  The Lamictal has helped stabilize the depression which has been good.  The Trazodone has helped with your sleep.  The Ritalin has helped, I think, with the attention and concentration. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, that's the, um - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Methylphenidate.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Diazepam.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No Ritalin is Methylphenidate ER.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the one, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I had to come back and have my prescription rewrote.  You wrote me the three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you dated them all the same date.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At the top.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but they won't take it after sixty days so when I took the third one in, it was dated for [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I took it in the beginning of May, they wouldn't fill it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it was over sixty days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now do you know which day you filled the last one?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It had to be the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The [DATE], okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get my check on the [DATE], so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you filled that one on -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have them filled the day I get my check because I go to Wal-Mart and cash my check so that's when I have them filled.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have another one left on that do you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No and my Lamictal has three more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Three more refills on that, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and the Diazepam still has some refills but it says by [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've only been taking one in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  I'll refill that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I don't do anything.  Like I said, I'm down to where I may cook a meal once every two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.   So you've got enough Lamictal, you've got enough Trazodone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I checked the bottles before I came in but I've got some good news. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My oldest son was transferred to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know if you know the facility down there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, you know, very minimum, like what a six foot chain link fence around it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Is he in the [DEIDENTIFIED] detention center?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he got there two weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's already got a job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for him.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's working for some pool company and he told me he works Monday through Friday and then Sunday and I said so you work Sunday through Friday and you're off Saturdays, he says yeah.  I said so do they pay you overtime.  He said yeah, they pay him over time, so he's getting eight hours overtime a week and they started him at nine bucks an hour.  My other son, [NAME OTHER] hasn't worked since November.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So my son, [NAME OTHER] called some guys he knows at [DEIDENTIFIED] and the one guy, he trains the people and he said for [NAME OTHER] to get over there and put in an application and he would, yknow, push for that one to get through.  Well, he starts orientation Monday, but it's only going to be part time to start, but it's better than nothing, at least he'll be able to help me out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I've been having to pay all the bills, the rent, the electric.  Where I moved into, they pay the heat and they pay the cable TV which before I moved in there, I had the same cable which is the extended basic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that went up to fifty three dollars and thirty cents a month, you know, with the taxes and all that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that went up to fifty three dollars and thirty cents a month, but they pay that, they pay for the cable and the heat so all I have, I have the rent, the electric and then phone but then by the time I do the grocery shopping and that, I'm lucky if I've got sixty bucks left for the month and this has gotten so hard and like I said, the only time I leave to go anywhere - I stay in my bedroom unless I hear the front door.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Here's your scripts.  And this, so none of them have more than sixty days between the top and the bottom, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you won't run into that problem again. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What was the other one?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then you need the Valium.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.  Now on those, I know you want me to take them four times a day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the Valium I wrote up to twice a day on the last script, maybe it was four before.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It was four on the previous script.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because they cost me, they're not covered under, with the insurance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're pretty cheap though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Four times a day, that's 120.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It costs me twenty two bucks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me tell you what the recommended price is on that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You did I think before, you said it was supposed to be like eight dollars or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tell them to give you a different brand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I even checked, it is, it's the Diazepam, it's the generic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  There's a lot of different companies that make the generic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I even check with Walgreens on that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they're thirty four dollars and something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how many a day can you take and afford it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like I said, I've only been taking one. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that adequate for you for the anxiety?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know because like during the middle of the day it's like I need to find something to do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't have anything to do.  I've got a little poker game and that got boring because I wanted to get it to a million, a million dollars and it won't hit a million dollars, it'll hit nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you can keep playing it, but it won't give you any more and it starts at two thousand, you start with two thousand dollars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the thing is when you set it down, when you quit playing, if you don't shut it off, you set it down, it shuts itself off and then when you go to play it again, you hit the on button, it comes back on in the same spot that you quit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What I'll do is I'll write the Valium for twice a day then, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bring the price of it down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Either way, you can take it, you know whatever you can afford I guess, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just been -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it sounds like you're on a horribly tight budget.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, definitely, I just, you know, like I said, he hasn't worked since November and I've been paying all the bills.  Then last year he was just kind of on and off work and that's when we were living in the other house so it was ending up, we were each supposed to be putting in four hundred a month, that would cover the rent, the bills, and a hundred bucks a month each for the groceries.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is cheap, but I ended up, it broke down to where it came to each of us put in four hundred dollars a month but I ended up having to cover his also.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then my truck, I had that little Blazer when we were still living at the other house.  It always had trouble starting when it was raining and snowing and, you know, cold and it would always have trouble starting and half the time you'd have to push start it. Well, I put a new sensor in for the temperature in that and that sensor has two wires, well one wire goes to the dash for your gauge.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the other wire is supposed to go to a cold start unit but I could never find the cold start unit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then the guy had already paid me everything but fifty bucks, he was supposed to pay me that on Friday to finish paying it off and I got out there and I was just going through it, checking it out and I pulled the number one plug to make sure they were clean and burning right and they were, it was, so I brought it up to drop dead center, then I opened up the distributor because I had put a new distributor cap and all that on the year before and I checked the rotor and everything and it was fine.  I made sure it was pointed number one so while I've got all that apart, I happen to bump, my hand happened to bump the oil pressure sending unit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when I did I was checking the wire, making sure it was plugged in, you know, nice and tight, well then I bumped another piece that was clipped on to the back of the oil pressure sending unit -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it was about this long and it had a plug-in on the end.  Well I just checked it out and I pushed the plug-in in and I put the plugs back in and the cap back on, walked around, hit the key and it fired right up.  I went back out, I shut it down, I went back out and I got to looking, I looked down under there at the plug-in, well on the sensor there was a green wire and a yellow wire.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, on that plug in, there was a yellow wire so I followed it and it went right to that sensor so the piece that was clipped on there was the cold start unit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And what it did, what it does is when it's cold or wet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It tells the, it was a throttle body, and it tells the throttle body when to choke it and not choke it, you know, when to give it more gas and less air in that.  But when I pushed that, the plug in, it wasn't all the way plugged in because I could hear it click.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I talked to the guy that I had sold it to and he said he hadn't had a problem with it starting.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Even during the winter and everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well then I had bought a little pickup truck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that got, just before we were ready to move, right when we were ready to move, it wouldn't start.  It was getting fuel and would fire up and run for a few seconds and die.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it was either the fuel filter or the fuel pump.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I couldn't get - it was in winter, so I couldn't crawl underneath it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know and try to replace the filter.  Well [NAME OTHER], the guy I used to help out has another shop behind [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I called him and I called him and I talked to him and I told him what the problem was and asked him, you know, for help with it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I couldn't get nobody to give me a hand, yknow and help me out with it and so I just finally, I called the junkyard and sent it to the junkyard.  Then I was without a vehicle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So after we got moved over on to [DEIDENTIFIED], a friend of mine, his son is real good friends with my son.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In fact they're the ones that took me to, when my son was, my [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To see him and he, his wife got sick.  Well, he had took her to the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> While he was at the hospital, his boss' wife brought his boss in because he was sick, he'd gotten sick and they didn't, you know, what it was, what he had or anything, so she brought him in.  Well they admitted him in the hospital, as well as my buddy's wife.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So when my buddy went the next morning to see his wife, he found out his boss died overnight.  At that point, they didn't know why, but anyway he helped the guy's wife out because he worked for the guy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The guy had a whole bunch of properties, and some vehicles and that, you know, they used for hauling stuff to the properties for doing work on them and that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, so he got with the guy's wife and helped her with all the funeral arrangements and everything else and then the vehicles that they had she was going to get rid of but she had to change everything over into her name.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Along with the properties and everything.  She couldn't handle them so she was selling them off.  Well he, she let him pick out one house that he wanted and buy it from her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then she sold all the rest of the properties in one lump sum, one lump shot to another guy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, then the vehicles, he had two pickup trucks.  Well the one my buddy wanted and it was a smaller Chevy but they had a four cylinder with a five speed stick.  Well he wanted that one so he bought that one from here.   Then she had this other truck.  It was a ninety five Dodge Dakota with the extended cab and it has a short but full backseat, the bottoms fold up and underneath that is storages.  Well he talked her into selling me that one for two hundred and fifty bucks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it only has, it's got, right now it's got I think seventy six thousand, eight hundred miles on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You fell into a sweet deal didn't you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean, I could, if I wanted to sell it right now, if I clean it up and everything, I could get between twelve and eighteen hundred dollars for it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just because of the low mileage.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know and then, now I found out that the truck he bought, the frame broke and he had to junk it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I talked to him the other day and I said oh man, I said you know I feel like crap.  I said you know you could have had this truck.  He said don't feel that way.  You said I took the one I wanted.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Plus he got the house he wanted.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But he said I bought the one that I wanted.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I got you the other one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He feels good that you've got a vehicle, too. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I feel bad because the one he got ended up, the frame broke and he had to junk it, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm glad -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He wasn't getting a lot of work at the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I'm glad you got a vehicle and I'm glad your son is now here. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went and saw him a week ago last Saturday but I haven't had any money for gas to go see him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's been a real problem. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He only gets two visitation days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And one is Saturday from eleven to four and the other one is on Tuesday from six to ten.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and he's out on [DEIDENTIFIED], out in there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which one is he at?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's at the one on, you're thinking of [DEIDENTIFIED]?  This is [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No the [DEIDENTIFIED] one is on [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED], there's a detention center out there that's real nice.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No this is a smaller one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's over on [DEIDENTIFIED], right off of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Downtown.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it's a different one then, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But this one's been there for a long time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  The other one I've never been actually in the detention center.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The year after my wife died, I was working [DEIDENTIFIED], it used to be [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Over on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I worked for them for a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I used to [DEIDENTIFIED] there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, we have to stop now but it looks like your mood is holding up.  You've got a lot -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I get, sometimes I sit and I think.  I got so down one day after arguing with my other son that I took all the titles because his truck is titled in my name.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the motorcycle I have, I'm keeping for my oldest son, he wanted me to keep it for him but that was always titled in his mother's name and she, before she passed away, she had signed the title.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel you need any change in medication now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  I got in an argument with him about him, you know, getting a job instead of laying around all day, get out and look for a job and find one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But is he too depressed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He screams and hollers at me.  No, he's not depressed.  He's just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He won't do anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At that age and then he hollers at me when I'm an adult and I says well fine, you're an adult, act like one, get your ass, get your butt out and find a job.  I says I don't care what you find.  I says, you know, work at a gas station, work anywhere, but he don't want to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  We have to stop now because I'm running a bit behind but you've got your prescriptions.  If your mood takes a real major dip -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That day it did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took even the title for my truck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took and signed it and then I wrote a letter with it and I was just going to leave them on the table and disappear and -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it's like that, you've got to call me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just and, you know, just sat there for a while, you know, after I wrote the letter and everything, I sat there for a while and I don't know, I took it all and I stuck it in my dresser drawer then a couple days later I took it and I tore the letter up but I was just going to, you know, give up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But most days, are most days like that or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just sit in my room.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because you're depressed or because you've got nothing to do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to go nowhere.  Like my truck, I put, at the beginning of last month I put fifteen dollars in my truck.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but how, on a scale of one to ten on an average day, if ten is a normal mood for you and one is the worst it's ever been, where are you averaging right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, I don't know, maybe four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to add in a little something else for the depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, I don't want to do nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's add in a little something for the depression like, have you been on Prozac before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, I don't know if it's even covered with the insurance.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah it is, Prozac is covered on all insurances.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You see how I am.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, let's add in some Prozac.  The dose will be 20 mg dose per day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, my oldest son, he can apply for eighty five percent out on [DATE] and they have sixty days whether to approve it or not.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But he's always worried about me.  When I talk to him on the phone, sometimes I sit and I cry.  He always asks me what's wrong, you know, I lie to him and I tell him nothing but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead then, we'll add the Prozac, just take one every morning, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take my pills in the morning.  I drink one to two pots of coffee every morning, but I use the non-dairy creamer and I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I want you to promise me that you'll call if you're suicidal, okay?  Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will. </p>

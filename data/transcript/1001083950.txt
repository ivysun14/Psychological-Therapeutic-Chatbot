<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Health is okay all around?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I'm good. Last week we went to the hospital for special surgery to a doctor that, has all my X-rays.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he pulled out my [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Multiple [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how did he rule that out?  Where did they think it was?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was under my spine, MRIs and... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The MRIs were suggestive?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, they showed a shadow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what do they think it is? What's pounding on it? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He thinks that it's [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p>CG: [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And also that I may have a [INAUDIBLE] injury, fracture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Fracture, compression?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Compression fracture.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you having a lot of pain now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On and off, you know, if I sit too long or stand too long or walk too long, like right now I'm okay but yesterday wasn't a good day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you get shooting pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not shooting, it's just terrible pain that goes...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right in one spot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It doesn't shoot down your legs?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, it does go down your leg?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes it does.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so it's nerve.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Nerves [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] go down.  All right, um, I saw you [DATE], you're doing well but you're anxious states with the pain. Getting a bit obsessed and you thought your husband you're irritable, I don't know if he was irritable. You were having trouble sleeping, you were [INAUDIBLE], you're obsessed with your husband's health and the future, getting very bad [INAUDIBLE] and low energy so we were, I don't know what, it sounds like you weren't doing well and in that context we decided to stop the Abilify, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did and [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Remind me, you always have to remind me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what did we say on the Klonopin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To go back on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Go back on it.  So this is about the third time this has happened, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, with antipsychotics, now remember what happened with the Neurontin once, and it happened with Zyprexa, it happened with Geodon, I think it was?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't remember.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, maybe not but it's a shame, you know, you stay so well for so long and we think the meds aren't doing anything and whenever we try to pull away, it's like a house of cards.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I can feel it by the second or third day, I begin feeling something, [INAUDIBLE] for almost two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You did? So you tried to tolerate it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it just wasn't happening.  And, so, off the Abilify, your mood dropped, was it anxiety or sadness?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was sad and I started crying and I really didn't want to do much, you know, we would go to the shore and I didn't want to be there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you agree she was in a bad place?</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you were encouraging her?  What was your hope, that she could just ride it out?</p>

<p>CG: I thought it was [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you felt, you also agreed that this is too much?  This is not turning around?  And she was as bad as she used to be?</p>

<p>CG: No, I wouldn't say that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, but she wasn't good. </p>

<p>CG: She was sad, she was easily tearful, she was I guess dependent and needy and all of those, she was starting to get bad [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't know if I should stay off this and hope that I would make that turn around.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that was our hope.  We knew that you would have something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I was afraid if I let it go too far.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We wouldn't get it back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We wouldn't get it.  It took me a while to get back on some track, I can still feel...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you called me and then we restarted the Abilify at what dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A whole pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A whole, 2.5 or 5?</p>

<p>CG: 5.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The 5.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 5.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B>   So, before you were on 2.5.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  The suggestion was that we start with the...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So right up to 5. I stayed and was [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For a couple of days which I did for three days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and then you went down to the 2.5?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then I went down to the 2.5.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how long did it take till you felt normal again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I would say about a week, maybe a little bit longer. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like waves, a wave of anxiety, almost like a panic attack?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How frequently do you get them?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It seems when I have to do something, I....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do something like what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Go somewhere, preparing to go somewhere, like I have to be very prepared to go out.  I have to start getting my clothes ready.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So any change destabilizes you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, if I have to go out to dinner or to a party, I have to start like two days ahead of time, take my clothes out of the closet, do a little bit at a time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two days in advance?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Get my clothes out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You set your clothes out two days before the party?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.  I have to know what my [INAUDIBLE] about it constantly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So this is the way you kind of contain and manage your tendency to...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I've got my clothes there set up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I know what.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Everything's clean and pressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it works for you or you find something else to...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it works, that works, as long as I'm prepared, I'm better and then I wait till the very last minute to go up and start getting dressed, like when I absolutely know I'm just about going to make it and then without, with very little thought about anything, then I go.  If I have a lot of time, I kind of get that panicky feeling so without a lot of time, I know I have to rush and everything's ready and I can just move in a normal progression of how I get dressed.  I mean you think this will pass?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, you know, you're too old to be worried about nonsense. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's nonsense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's nonsense and you know it's nonsense but that's classic for OCD.  You know, OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> People just get these ideas stuck in their brain and they know that they're stupid or they're irrelevant or they're not important and yet they can't shake them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They can't shake them, they get stuck in a loop.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And yet, we're doing work on a house down the shore and I picked out a color from a color chart, usually I would have to be there, look at it and make sure it's okay, it's like I don't want to think about it, let it happen, whatever it is, it is because I can't deal with it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I handle it one way or another.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why are you able to do it so easily there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you think?  You think she's not able to do it so easily.</p>

<p>CG: She can do it, she thought it was easy, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she put in far more mental energy...</p>

<p>CG: She picked out two colors, then she said well I'm not sure of these and went back and looked at some others, then finally my two daughters were around over the weekend and between the three of them, they selected the colors.  They said those are the colors.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but usually I would have to be there to make sure he's doing a good job.</p>

<p>CG: I know but we convinced you that it's a shore house.  It's not nothing major, not a big, what's the worst that could happen?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The worst thing about OCD is just the waste of time, just the mental energy.  Do you feel that sometimes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're wasting so much time and energy on such nonsense and yet that's the nature of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, it's the way. Have you ever read the book [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Did we talk about that ever?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think you once suggested it.  Let me write it down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean, you know, the best treatment for OCD is what we call bibliotherapy, reading a book and learning techniques for breaking the cycle.   What you have to do is kind of recognize that you're in this loop, the OCD loop and there are techniques in that book for breaking out of it, you know.  There are a lot of different techniques.  You're not classic OCD.  You know, classic OCD is like contamination fears, like when someone touches the doorknob and they think they got contaminated and then they have to go wash their hands fifty times.  You're not classic OCD but you have a variant of OCD and I think you would benefit a lot by just learning techniques and what you have to do is, if you want to write the name of the book, it's called [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I wrote it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] by [NAME OTHER].  The first thing to do is to identify that you're in a loop, you're in one of those loops that, you know, your anxiety reaction to some things is a bit beyond the reality of it and then you have to work on breaking it.  You know, just think of something else, you know, you can't try to get the issue settled because it will never settle, you're too wrapped into an OCD mood.  You've got to just break it and do something else and it can be learned.  People do really nicely when they can just learn those techniques so, you know, it's probably a good thing for you to turn some of those.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's good, you know, the fact, I don't overeat yet I've gained so much weight, you know, coming off that Prednisone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I just, this [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] you know told me I have to lose 25 pounds at least.  I gained 25 pounds on Prednisone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I just.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's water, that's mostly water weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's real weight.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's real weight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sleeping okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some nights I do, some nights I don't.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about on average, how many hours do you get most nights?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh gosh, I'd say I sleep at least 8 hours a night, maybe more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, so you get solid sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And is your energy decent during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not what I would like it to be.  I wish I could do more.  I know that there are things that I should be doing.  I used to be very fanatical in my house, not anything out of place or anything.  Now I see things that I should take care of and I don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For someone like you that's probably healthy, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you agree?</p>

<p>CG: I agree.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That you don't have to, you know, cover all bases.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In covering all bases, is a bit of your obsessional spot. That's probably not good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you know, I wouldn't get too worked up over having a little, a little disarray in the household.  Obviously, you're not going to allow it to...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Become a mess.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, there was a time when nothing was out of place and everything was put away and, you know, I still have Christmas boxes that have to go downstairs but they're neatly piled up in a sun room. I just have to...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the least of your problems. You don't need to worry about that.  Any suicidal thinking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes I feel helpless, you know, like...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I wish I could just do more, I wish I wasn't like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's not an all or nothing. I mean you do more than you used to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, not as much as you'd like to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're somewhere in the middle.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The middle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And hopefully with, as you get a better sense of yourself, you'll be able to do more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you think stops you from doing what you want to do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know.  You know, like one day I said to myself, you know, am I just lazy, did I become lazy, I was never lazy, I mean I worked, I kept a nice house, I raised three children who were always well dressed and, it's like a physical thing that stops me, it's almost like I hate saying the word I can't, but I think about it and know I have to do it and yet I don't.  There are certain things that I've come to do in an orderly fashion, like in the morning I have a routine now and I keep up with, you know, I do the breakfast, get rid of all the breakfast things, the coffee pot, the cups and whatnot, and then I will put a load of wash in, like it's in order, then I'll go upstairs and get dressed, yet I know I should be ironing, doing some ironing, I don't do that.  We send most of our clothes out now because I can't deal with it, I can't, I can't deal with the extra things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Regular laundry, you send out regular laundry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, regular laundry I do but like anything that has to be pressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a lot of work, pressing.  I mean, you used to do that at home?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pressing a T-shirt is a lot of work, there are T-shits that I could manage to do but the shirts I always sent out but like some of my cotton T-shirts, things that you should be able to do yourself but then I say to myself, I'm better off just sending them out instead of agonizing over pressing them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that sounds like a pretty good solution to me. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just sending them out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know if you have the money, just send it, you know, it kind of stops you from...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Agonizing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Agonizing and making yourself crazy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but I don't know what...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you feel guilty about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About sending it out.  That's the real issue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because I think, you know, we have such a high laundry bill as it is, why should I send something that is so easy to do but then like I joined a bible study class for [DEIDENTIFIED]. I thought that's what I would do for [DEIDENTIFIED] and every Tuesday I agonize over going to this bible study, should I go, shouldn't I.  I joined an exercise program and every Friday I agonized over going to this, I'd make excuses, it's too early, I don't feel good, yet...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Making moves is tough for you isn't it?  You know, decision making and...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Once I do it, once I make the decision to go, last minute, I make that decision, I do it, you know, but I don't know what...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It reminds me a little bit about Parkinson's patients who, you know, have trouble initiating motion, once they're going they're fine. You know, they can walk, they can do everything, it's getting over the hump, it's what is trouble for them.  And they, by the way, have a dopamine problem just like you do and so I suspect, even though there's all this psychology to it, there's a neurologic basis for this difficulty you have getting over the hump.  I really think it's part of how you're put together.  You know, we're giving you rocket fuel at this point, right?  You're on 100 of Parnate.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 80 of Ritalin.  I mean, we're really doing as much as we can for this dopamine problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you think there's anything better than Parnate now with all the new medications that are out?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Parnate is far better than anything else.  Far better than them. 90? Probably went down, too.  No, Parnate is the king of all antidepressants, nothing comes close.  What we sometimes do is, we add some Wellbutrin to the Parnate to give a little extra oomph.  Have you ever used Wellbutrin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It never helped me.  I mean they didn't use it with Parnate.  I was on Wellbutrin and it really didn't help me at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you see you have the industrial strength mood disorder, you really have and, you know, lightweight medicines, all of the modern ones, everything you've heard about, Cymbalta, Effexor, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, all of that, that's baby stuff for you.  You're brain laughs at that.  You're brain laughs at that.  You know, I don't even think we'd get much more by adding Wellbutrin.  If you were very depressed, we'd have a little number of things we could do.  I'd probably add Wellbutrin just to get some more but you're not that depressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> These challenges you're talking about, you've struggled with this for years and years and, you know, you're just going to have to...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was better for a while. I thought I was better than I am now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When were you better and what changed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know when I think I was better, I try to think about it, I think I was better when I took the Topamax, I don't know.  I take the Topamax now about 5 o'clock because you said maybe it would curb my appetite.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think to a certain degree it has but I think when I took it at night, for some reason, I think I did better. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know why I think that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well it's, the only mood stabilizer, oh no, no, you're back on the Abilify.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Abilify.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's a mood stabilizer and, you know, we can make a case that having a mood stabilizer on at night could help your system so if you think that was helpful, let's go back.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So now you take...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You take 75 but when do you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About 5 o'clock right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you think things were doing better when you took it later?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah but that shouldn't be.  I mean that's the only thing I can think of that we changed other than stopping the Abilify and then going back on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But your brain may want to see some mood stabilizer during the day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's true because I don't like, start wearing out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When the Topamax is wearing off, that may be when you're not doing as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So why don't we put you up to 100 of Topamax at night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At night?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With the Abilify?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> With the Abilify and then you have enough mood stabilizer on board through the day.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You mean at night before I go to bed?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Before you go to bed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Later, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, I could try that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean the way you're doing it now, it seems that it's worn out by the time you need it in the morning and afternoon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so let me, let's go through this.  Topamax 100 at night, Abilify 2.5 at night, Parnate, you take nine all at once?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<p>CG:   Three, three, and three.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Parnate 30 three times a day.  Ritalin long acting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take one in the morning about 8, 7, no 8 o'clock.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, 40 and 40.  And Neurontin 400 three times a day.</p>

<p>CG: 800, 400, 400.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And we've had trouble trying to get you off that too, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That seems to be the...</p>

<p>CG: We were at 400, 400, 400, but then the decision was to go back up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And did it help at the higher dose?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It did?  It calmed things down?  Do you agree?</p>

<p>CG: I agree.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you think has helped?  I've appeared to raise the nighttime dose for the pain.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Neurontin?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And raise the morning dose.  Neurontin is good for pain.  Do you think it might be helping the pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Maybe, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been revved up in any way, manic?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No high energy, racing thoughts, talking too much, not eating or sleeping? Nothing? Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no. </p>

<p>CG: Should we switch it?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, but it's working.  It sounds like the higher...  So the question would be should we raise more but the pain, we haven't even talked much about the pain.  It sounds like pain is not a big player right now, correct?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well it is, I struggle, I struggle, you know with...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Does it keep you up at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The pain?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The pain does not. When I'm laying down, I'm okay.  It doesn't keep me up.  It's when I'm either sitting too long or walking.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So then maybe the morning Neurontin is the best way to do it.  I mean, the reason I was pushing at night is to make sure it didn't wake you up from sleep.  I wouldn't want the pain interfering with your sleep.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if you're sleeping okay then the extra Neurontin in the morning could help reduce the pain and let you function better and also, as you know, Neurontin calms down anxiety, it's good for nerves.  Which prescriptions do you need?</p>

<p>CG: No, your secretary gave me two.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did she do it correctly?</p>

<p>CG: I think she did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] did it?</p>

<p>CG: Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were here when [NAME OTHER] was here?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  That's fine and she gave you the one month later. </p>

<p>CG: Right, yeah.  Now do you need the Topamax?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, let me write 100 of Topamax.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so just take one pill at night and, hopefully, that will stay on board through the night.  Do you think it helps with your appetite? Do you think it helps reduce the appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought it did.  I thought I eat less at night, don't you?  With the Topamax, taking it at night, don't you think I eat less at night?</p>

<p>CG: Well, you haven't done it in a while, so I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm taking the Topamax at night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I saw a guy here who lost 28 pounds.  He said, you know, he cut out all the junk and everything, ate a lot of fruit and vegetables, but he said he has orange juice all day long to keep his blood sugar up which prevents the hunger, keeping your blood sugar up, it's when your blood sugar goes down that you get more hungry so you can try that, just drink a lot of orange juice.  Just keep your blood sugar up all the time and see if that will suppress the appetite.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So right now, by taking three Topamax, what am I taking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> 75 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 75 mg.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we're going up now to 100 mg all at night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay? You know, I mean we talk all the time about things going bad, you're doing okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're doing fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, really you're in a decent place.  You still have these struggles but you're in the game. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's the family?  How's your son?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's with us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's still living with you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, still living with us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that going to be changing anytime soon or?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's always a sore subject.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that a sore subject?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ask my husband?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's looking. It's a sore subject between you two?  Your husband is not booting him out so fast and you are?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My husband is very defensive about his son.</p>

<p>CG: He's been very very busy work wise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's happier right now.</p>

<p>CG: He's trying to make a lot of money so he can, you know, he's really happy.  He's got a nice position.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He just got a full time position. </p>

<p>CG: Plus, he's still working a couple of, another part time position plus he's, he took over my [DEIDENTIFIED] clients.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, so you helped him out, you helped him, so that's good, so he's in [INAUDIBLE] shape.</p>

<p>CG: Trying to make as much money as he can so he can leave. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I need you to sign this thing. </p>

<p>CG: You mean both of us?  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, just her. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Know what I should ask you? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At the X.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Both of us?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I saw this in the drugstore yesterday.  You know, I run out of energy about 3:30-4 o'clock.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You should always avoid over the counter energy things.  This is, I mean, you know what this is?  This is caffeine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh it's caffeine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a cup of coffee.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it probably doesn't even have much. It doesn't even give the milligram strength but this is caffeine.  It's fine but, you know, it's gimmicky, it's cute, it's gimmicky and you're on 80 mg of Ritalin. I mean this is, you know...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't need this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> This is like a Heroin addict or someone on Morphine saying should I take Aspirin for this headache? You know, you're on way way past anything that could do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if you are having, you know, drops in your energy then you should try to vary the dosing of your stimulant till you get it just right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Of the Ritalin?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Take it a little...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or the Parnate, both of them are stimulating.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Take, you know....</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Separate them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right and just graph out your day.  Try, make a graph of your energy through the day and then try to move the meds, you know, you have to assume that you'll get the effect of the meds about an hour later and so just move the dosing time till it comes out just right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, take care of yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye-bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Take care.</p>

<p>CG: Nice seeing you. Bye.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We made an appointment already.</p>

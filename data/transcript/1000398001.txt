<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I feel as if I'm I don't know, sort of well, indecisive but I'm not sure exactly what about because, uhm, I, it's, ah, uhm, not a definite thing.  But I, I, I don't like the word, sort of, but that's almost the way it, it is right now of, uhm, thinking back to yesterday and then having this feeling that I've had thoughts since then, in connection with what we were talking about yesterday, mainly my fantasy over your wanting me to want to divorce MSCZ so then I'd be free for you and then what that really means, of my wanting to get power over you.</p>

<p>But, uhm, and on the other hand I keep thinking, uhm, something has come up that I have to make a decision over — or MSCZ and I, I haven't had a chance to speak to him — connected with FMC.  Ah, because she said today to me that she needs to have more money than we've offered her and it's something I had anticipated and had, I had brought it up twice with her, once in a letter I wrote and then once that time I met her initially.  And she had kept assuring me everything was fine.  But I had known when she started hearing about other possible jobs or, I don't know, different situations here that she would then find she really did need more.  And, anyway, just to live on, they probably do.  
Uhm, so she mentioned it today.  Uhm, so there's various choices that we might be able to take.  And so everything will work out.  But, uh, I don't know, it's almost as if I'm thinking, well, that's a problem and I could think about that rather than thinking about, uhm, what I was thinking about yesterday.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think, I, I guess the main thing that, uhm, well, the only thing I can recall, uhm, that came to my mind that would have, I'm sure it came out of thinking about having that fantasy yesterday, was, uhm, probably more questions about sort of where you live and what you do when you're not here with me at this particular hour.  But, also, I don't know, uhm, it seemed like, uhm, when I was on the subway, at some point, I don't, I guess what I was thinking is, uhm, what if you got on the subway.  But I don't know quite what I was doing with thinking that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Because it doesn't seem to me — I mean, I used to think that other times.  Uhm, there was a particular period, I don't remember when, but quite a long time ago, when I think I used to well, uhm, sometimes I think imagine when I'd seen you or somebody might have been fairly similar in looks to you or, uhm, I would just suddenly think what if I ran into you at some place, anyway, outside of here.  And, and it, it would always frighten me.  Or, uhm, anyway I didn't, I don't think I had the same feeling that I did when I was thinking about it today.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How did you feel today?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, it just seemed like it must have been a continuation of that kind of thinking I had yesterday of, uhm, well, wanting you to appear on the subway even though I knew you wouldn't.  And, uhm, I don't know, I keep thinking that, that, I can't recall it right now but it seems to me I keep thinking that at the time I was thinking it would be amusing.  I don't know quite what I mean by that but, uhm, it certainly did not seem like a threatening thought to me, anyway.  And, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, uh, what do you imagine, uh, happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I think the way I saw it was, I don't know, it doesn't seem like I could have done, now that I'm here because now that I'm here I'm inclined to think of something like that the way I always used to, uhm, that we have only this relationship here and it would be very strange to see you any place else.  But, uhm, I think this morning when I was thinking of it, it was almost as if our relationship was entirely different and so it would be sort of like, uhm, well, not exactly 2 friends meeting but anyway a, having an intimate relationship that, uhm, was easy and, and friendly and, uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I ju—, I just got the feeling that I'm doing something, then when I thought of that, it seemed like I'm doing it doubly.  But, uhm, thinking about how you pointed out yesterday that in effect I'd done to you what I'd done to MSCZ, uhm, well, specifically you used the example of when I told him things to manipulate him that time when he wanted to make love and then got mad.  And, uhm, I don't know, just now, I, I had this feeling, which, I don't know, maybe it's a way to sort of detour around where I was going, but that I was making something more out of — I mean, I know I did think something but it's almost as if now I'm creating it on the spot, uhm, to manipulate you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And the reason I think I said it seemed like I was doing it doubly is because I was not only feeling as if that's what I was doing but then I wanted to, uhm, tie you.  And, and I don't know, it amused me when I first thought that just then.  And, uhm, so, so I mean, it's 2 sources of power: one of just manipulati—, feeling that I'm manipulating you and the other is, uhm, telling you that what you think is happening isn't, or something like that.  (Pause) Of course the other thing is I really did have that fantasy this morning so I don't know quite, uhm, why I'm looking at it like this now.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So if we had an intimate, friendly relationship, how do you imagine it would go, how, eh, how, eh, how would we live and so on, what would come of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I don't know because I just kept us on the subway.  (Laughs) 
(Silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, finally I was thinking about, uhm, people at school and, and it was sort of a series of relationships.  Uhm, because I was thin—, well, I, I was doing something today that was sort of reorganizing something that had been organized and I thought it was better.  And it conn—, it was connected with my things but it was also, uhm, possibly involving other people's too, or what really belongs to the whole school.  And, but it just seemed to me to make more sense.  And I just happened to say something like I hope Mrs. BBF, uhm, the director, will not be upset by this, because they had had everything listed according to shelf, although at this point things were off shelves so I didn't see where it would really matter if it were reorganized.  And, uhm, my assistant, FLMZ, said, "Oh, she'll, she gets annoyed at a lot of things."</p>

<p>And I had thought earlier, at other meetings, I had, at, at different meetings, that I had noticed in all the sort of little looks that you can pick up to indicate some of the people who'd been there before and had been there under the previous director, uhm, weren't really all that pleased with, ah, Mrs. BBF even though they appeared face to face to be.  And, uhm, so I just said, "Well, what do you mean?"  And then she just went on about how Mrs. BBF was much more demanding than the other director and had, uhm, the other director had let them sort of go as they wished and she was, she had all these things she wanted to have done by certain methods.  And she'd gotten worse as the year went on, not better, which they had kind of hoped after she had started new.  And, uhm, I was thinking to myself privately that from what I've seen of Mrs. BBF I essentially agree with what she does.  I'm sure there will be some things I don't but, uhm, I thought, so far, she is a fairly easy person to work with and professional.  And it sounded to me like the woman before had not been very professional.</p>

<p>And, uhm, then — and also because of the way I've come in, through FHYZ, who's a friend of Mrs. BBF, I felt sort of funny.  Uhm, because I could understand also why this girl might have been bothered by it because she's not even really trained as a professional teacher.  She just is, her experience is all thorough the number of years she's been an assistant.  And, so anyway, I was feeling sort of like I could see where I could really get kind of caught between sort of the administration, or Mrs. BBF anyway and then some of these older teachers.  And, uhm, and then I just was thinking about FHYZ and how I'd found her when I had first started.  And I don't know how much harder I think FHYZ was to work with than Mrs. BBF ever would be.  Uhm, and th—, oh, and then I, and then I was thinking about how FLMZ does not yet really know me, uhm, because I have been quite agreeable and there have been a number of things that I really have to know what was done before and what there is so I've been, she's been given a lot of leeway that later on I might get much more wanting things to be done a certain way than she realizes.</p>

<p>And, uhm, you know, I was kind of thinking that, well, she's going to get hostile, I guess that's what I was anticipating when I was thinking about it just now.  And I was thinking about the last thing when I left — she stays all day and so I'd — and she can't work in the room that she's supposed to go to in the afternoon.  So she'd said she could more in our room.  And I had one or two things I'd asked her to do.  And one was to strip a basket of crayons that I had gathered together.  And she looked at me, shocked, and said, "Strip them?"  And, uhm, and I really want, I really knew what I was doing but on the other hand, it made me feel like well, maybe I didn't because of the, her reaction.</p>

<p>And I almost felt, I don't know, I almost felt my confidence going, even though I really did know what I was about.  Uhm, but I don't know, I was thinking of it just now, I think, because I was feeling well, that's just going to be a small example of all the ways we won't see eye to eye and, and, uhm, well, I don't know —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And this is your answer to my question.  See, I asked you, ah, to think about and imagine what would happen if you and I were on intimate, friendly terms and what do you tell me?  What do you think about?  You think about a woman that you, eh, you know, you place yourself in her corner, you agree with her, Mrs. BBF.  But other people see her as demanding and rigid.  And then you go on to talk about FLMZ and you and how you're sure it'll end up there'd be quarrels and you won't see eye to eye.  So this is your answer to my question about what would happen to us: we'd end up not seeing eye to eye.  You'd end up being demanding and bossy.  I think that's what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I even had the feeling that in this fantasy about meeting you on the subway, uhm, one reason why it was not threatening to me as other times it's been is because I was feeling well, I'd be in charge or sort of I'd be greeting you as if the subway were my home (laughs) and you were coming into it.  And I was in charge there, or something like that.  Yesterday, uhm, well, I can't remember the way that the thoughts went but — (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, but this also makes me think of, it seems to me I, I think it was yesterday that I was thinking about being competitive with the other teacher FHYZ.  And I went from thinking about something, uhm, — whether it was what I do to you and MSCZ or what, I can't remember except I th—, I'm quite sure it must have had something to do with you and MSCZ — to thinking about being competitive with this girl.  And I didn't understand exactly what, what goes on that I transfer from thinking about what I want to do to you to thinking about being competitive with another woman.  And, I don't know, now I've — well, maybe it's very different now but it did make me think of that.  Well, except this time I was expressing my real thoughts through my relationships with other women so maybe that's really — well, it did seem like that's what I was doing yesterday, too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I guess what I'm think—, thinking is some—, seems pretty obvious, I, I suppose but, uhm, I've always, I don't know if I've ever, well, I don't even know if it's right and I certainly never have thought it before — uhm, but it seems like I use the women that I come across in my life as an indirect means, or, I don't know, not exactly an indirect means but, uhm, I can't express these feelings toward men and I dare to toward women.  And it's not really the women I'm feeling it toward.  They're the substitute.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know, then I was just thinking that the thing, well at least one thing that has always remained a question to me about that, uhm, — it's not as clearly a question to me right now because this always seems to be, make more sense, at least in terms of what I've been thinking about the last day or two — but, uhm, somehow, anyway, I've always tried to see all this in terms of my relationship with my mother and, uhm, there being a real issue between my and my mother that has led me to be competitive with women and to feel the things I feel about women who are in charge and, uhm, sort of strong personalities and that kind of thing.  And, well, maybe there is but, I don't know, somehow I've always seemed to, to have, keep it, make it very simple.  And then, I, and then things don't make sense.  And, uhm, because maybe I use my mother as I didn't dare do some things, express some feelings that I had toward my father.  But, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What's really striking to me is what a strait jacket you've got your mind in.  You really don't dare imagine what would happen between us.  And I have to infer it from, indirectly, from what you're saying but you don't dare directly even think about it.  You prefer not to, you know, sort of intellectualize about —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   These things.  You're not letting your imagination go.  You don't even dare do that.  It's unthinkable.  But I think in the process of this intellectualizing you are doing to me exactly what you would do if, in fact, we were on, eh, intimate, friendly terms.  Because by not thinking about it, by not imagining it, you are, in effect, telling me to go to hell.  I ask you a question about it and you don't think about it.  And that's your answer.  You will do what you want.  So, you know, even in the way you indirectly express it you implicitly defy, you don't answer my question.  You turn it aside, you ignore it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, my reaction, the, the way I started reacting, I think, was to feel very angry.  Then, partly, I suppose, because I can see you're probably, probably I am doing just that, but, uhm, I, I think my first reaction was, "Alright, I'll show you.  I'll think about whatever you ask me about, but then I won't be, uhm, I'll be doing it in a very controlled way.  And, and so in that sense I'll be defying you." (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, because it doesn't seem like it's the same thing, but it seems to me I, I get the same feeling that I used to get whenever my father would get really mad over some attitude on my part or behavior, too, but mainly, I guess, it was attitude and he'd call me a bitch.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I guess maybe I could, I could have the same feeling, I suppose.  At first I didn't see why I would because you were describing what must have been what my father was feeling I was doing that made him use that word.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I don't know I, I was just thinking of something else, too that what you said made me think of.  Because I know I've, I've, sometimes thought I'd been doing this before and, uhm, I don't know, somehow twisting something that I should be doing here around so it benefits me in a way that I shouldn't be doing it here.  Uhm, because when I didn't answ—, when I didn't think what you asked I could tell myself well, I didn't think about it because that's not the way my thoughts went after you asked it and I'm supposed to let my thoughts go.  And it, uhm, and I don't know, I don't deal with the aspect of it of whether or not, what it means that I didn't want to or, or just that whole question so much as just simply in my thoughts, in, I don't know, it's almost like I excuse myself or something: "Well, my thoughts didn't go that way, so —"  (Silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, ah, I was just thinking of something that — uhm, when I didn't answer your question about what I imagined we'd be like together as intimate friends (laughs) or whatever, uhm, I kept thinking about, uhm, well, I mean, I, I, at some point — I don't remember just when — I began to think about, uhm, MLWZ and FTPZ (a psychiatrist married to P's friend), and then I just was, now.  And I'm not sure exactly how except I was over there today.  I had planned to take MVE to the park while I was home this afternoon, so that she would be able to p—, to, uhm, pack more boxes — they're moving tomorrow — and, uhm, I don't know help her out.  But apparently this morning, FLO, the girl who lives under me and who is very good friends with FTPZ and knows MVE very well and they've seen a lot of each other, much more regularly than MVE has seen me.  Well, anyway he was not happy being down there with her at the park this morning.  So that FTPZ had thought it would be, be—, I'd be more helpful if I just stayed in their apartment and watched the two of them and just sort of, of pre—, with FSO, gave MVE a distraction.  And it did work that way but, uhm, just as I was leaving MLWZ came in and I felt very, uhm, awkward as if I shouldn't be there.</p>

<p>And this happened once before, uhm, the night that FTPZ took care of, or the late afternoon when, that first time, I guess when it was when I came here and FTPZ watched FSO.  When I was leaving after picking her up, he was coming in and I felt, again, that I was intruding and, uhm, it's just very awkward that I was still there when he came home or that I hadn't already gotten out by the time he got home.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I'm, I'm still thinking about FTPZ, uhm, but —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But why to yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  I don't know because I, I certainly stopped thinking about FTPZ and her husband.  Uhm, (pause) I don't, I don't know why.  I can't al—, I don't know, I mean, I, I must not want to think about FTPZ and her husband too because of his being a psychiatrist and so then the parallel between the two of you is there.  And, uhm, (pause) well, I don't I just don't know, uhm, because it almost seems to me I don't want to, I didn't like being there because I don't like to see them together.  And, and it's almost as if I don't want to think of FTPZ really having this husband.  I don't think it's any, it's, it's, I don't think it's FTPZ so much as because he is a psychiatrist and yet I am very curious sometimes.  She also z,,,, me pictures of the house they're moving to or ones I took of MVE different places.  And sometimes MLWZ is in them.  And I'm always curious then about what is MLWZ like and, uhm, what would relationships be in the family.  But then when he's really there, I, I feel, uhm, that I don't want to see it.</p>

<p>And so I ended up thinking about FTPZ packing when I was quiet.  But I don't think I was keeping that from you.  It seems like I don't know.  The thing I'm reminded of is getting the same kind of feeling when I was there, uhm, when he came home, somehow — because it just sounds crazy, I don't know — uhm, that it seems to me I've, I used to sometimes feel if I were in my parents' bedroom when both of them were there.  Or maybe particularly — I don't know how much I was ever in the bedroom with my mother and then my father coming in — but, uhm, I don't know, that seems like it's kind of getting too far away.  Because really it seems like the thing that bothers me is, here I'm having these fantasies about you and then here is FTPZ with a psychiatrist for a husband.  I don't want to see their relationship or I want to imagine it but I don't want to know it's really their relationship. (Pause)</p>

<p>But I don't, I don't know, thinking back to, uhm, what you had to assume was what my thoughts would have been if I'd thought them directly and that is that I would take charge of you or, uhm, have fights with you, or disagree with you, or whatever, uhm, I don't see why I couldn't think that directly.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking about FLMZ again and how, uhm, how I might take control (laughs) of the situation, in effect, I think.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.

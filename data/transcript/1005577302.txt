<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: January 15th I start classes for my dad's business, and they're every Tuesday, Thursday from 6:00 to 9:30. Then I got to get to Hamden. So I don't know, I'm in a dilemma because I still have soccer too, and it goes till May. And I don't really want to terminate treatment, but I don't know if there's any other time we can meet, because I have soccer Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and occasionally on Friday. So I just-I'm at an imbalance there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what are your regular work hours?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I work-well, I just came from a job interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So depending on if I change jobs, my hours right now are 7:30 to 3:00. They'd be 7:30 to 2:45, 3:00, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the only time you have is Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I could do Monday afternoon at like 4:00. You know, I could do Wednesday, anywhere up to 5:30, 6:00 would be the absolute latest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In between what? Starting when?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Starting when I do those-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm saying but when-so you'd be here between 3:00 and 6:00?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, 3:00 and 7:00. I can't do anything at 7:00 because I have soccer at 8:20.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So basically Monday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday, Wednesday, because Tuesdays and Thursdays will be eliminated. And Fridays I can't commit depending-because I get my schedule monthly for soccer and I don't know if I have a game on Friday or not. [2:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have earlier in the day on Tuesday free? Like earlier in the afternoon I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I don't have-basically I'm teaching this course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, yeah, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's just till the end of January.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's what I'm saying, I could go back to our old time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See, but I don't know if I can get there, because I have to get to Hamden for class by 6:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So you basically do this straight from work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to go from work to here to class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but I'm saying-so basically we're looking for something Monday or Wednesday afternoon it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday, Wednesday right now. Potentially Friday, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do later on Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, I'm pretty booked right now Wednesdays, I don't have any openings.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, you don't have anything on Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Mondays-I may have something Monday afternoons in Amherst.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I may have something in the early afternoon-you know, middle afternoon in Amherst that I might be able to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I'm going to Foxboro Monday night at 7:40. So even if I left Amherst by 7:00 I could probably do like 5:30, 6:00 if that's available.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you couldn't do earlier?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I probably could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let me take a look at my schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want to throw that out there to you now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. So this will be starting, I'm sorry, when?</p>

<p>CLIENT: January 15th is my first week of classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the Tuesday, Thursdays will be totally eliminated. And Thursday is completely out, Tuesday is-I mean, if I can fit it in. See, the only time I can think I'd fit it in is 3:00, because I think 4:00 would be too late. 4:00 or 4:45, then have an hour to get from Darien to Hamden. I'm just trying to figure out with traffic and stuff like that. [4:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So let me- So we're not going to also-I'm happy to meet with you next Tuesday, and I don't know if you want that. So then a few Tuesdays are holidays too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I was thinking the same thing, if we can meet next Tuesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to meet next Tuesday. And then we're off two Tuesdays.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then the following Tuesday-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is the 8th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you can do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do the 8th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's after that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's after that where-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I know that I can certainly do the 3:00 on Tuesdays during February, for your 3:15. It doesn't sound like that's ideal though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know when I can. I mean, because I get out of work now at 3:00, and then my other job I'll be getting out at 2:45. Potentially that could be in Wallingford, so I maybe could do the 3:15, but I don't-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm going to take-you know, I have your schedule in mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's going to be a little tight, but I'm going to see-</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, yeah, I just wanted to throw that out before we started.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, and I appreciate it. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, again, I am just-I had a major blowout last week with my mom. And it wasn't at her, it was just in general. Again, it's regarding my cousins and my aunt for the guest list. She told me that, you know, after my grandmother passed there was coins that were valuable, this, that and the other thing. And my dad has all my grandmother's jewelry and they were going to exchange them. And I don't know why my mother tells me this, I think she likes getting me all worked up and knows that it makes me really mad and angry. But she told me when they went to meet with my aunt and my uncle regarding the coins he just showed up with money, no coins, and said, "Here, this is what they were worth." And that's that. And that really set me over the edge, where I was, "Bullshit!" And told them now they definitely not invited, none of them are coming to my wedding, I don't want that. And my mother was like, "Well, I shouldn't have told you," this, that and the other thing. And I'm like, "No, obviously you wanted to tell me. You wanted to get me. Because I'm not having this anymore." I'm not putting up with their bullshit anymore. I don't want them doing this. Every time it's like they're sneaking stuff. You know, "Well, I went and did this," without me or my dad seeing anything. Same thing with the jewelry, my dad just puts up the jewelry with them. How is that-why is it that you have to be the nice guy buy he just takes all the stuff and sells it and just gives you a portion? We don't know how much he really got for it. We don't know how truly valuable they were. And it really pissed me off. And I hate to say it but I got the rage, I felt it in here and it built all the way up and it just exploded. And to be honest, even talking about it now I feel that sensation becoming in my stomach. [7:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like anger. It feels like my stomach is boiling. And it's just like-I take it back to like lava. I can just feel it rumbling and bumbling and it's just working its way up, to the point where it's just so uncomfortable that boom, I just explode. And I already feel like my head's starting to shake a little bit, my hands are starting to shake a little bit, because I'm just getting extremely, extremely angry and extremely worked up about it. And it really pisses me off, to the point where I can't even look or think about my aunt and uncle because there's this garbage that goes on over and over and over, and it's not going to change. And no matter how much I avoid or try to avoid it, whenever I hear about them I lose it, I get very, very angry. Because there's no positives coming out of it. There's nothing that I have to gain or nothing I want to gain out of a relationship with them. I want to move on from a relationship with them, I want them completely out of my life. And it just angers me I think because I can't. As long as I still have my dad I know I can't just eliminate them from my life, because he gets extremely upset. He gets very defensive, and he's the one who gets really mad. My sister and my uncle told me the other day that my dad was crying about the fact that I don't want his sister or her family out of my life. Crying, and why I don't understand.</p>

<p>And it's to the point where now I feel guilty. I do feel, you know, empathetic towards him, I do feel like I want to make him happy. But when I hear garbage like that that just happened, when I see how much they keep hurting us, and see how they keep going behind our back and keep pushing the envelope and there's no repercussions for it, that's when I get extremely angry. That's when I get frustrated. That's where I get to the point where there's no coming back. And I just yell and yell and I can't take it anymore, I really can't. You know, it's to the point where the thought of them pisses me off. I just have this, I don't know what it is, vengeance or whatever towards them where I want whatever came to me to happen to them. And I say this all the time, I say it to my fianc�, I say it to my mother. I go, "I pray to god something happens to my aunt before my father, because I will not show up to their funeral." I said, "I want to do it to my grandmothers," and I did. That was for my dad. But now I really truly will not go to her wake, to her funeral. I really am losing a lot and a lot and a lot of respect for them. [10:50]</p>

<p>And I'm tired of the excuses. I'm tired of the excuses, "Well, we'll talk to our- Let's just wait-" And this is another thing that pisses me off beyond being pissed off, is when they say, "Well, let's just get through the weddings then we'll address it." No, I'm not waiting. Here we go again making excuses not to confront the situation now. It's always let's wait for this to happen, it's always an excuse to not address the situation now. And I told them, I said, "I don't care, I'm gonna make it uncomfortable for you. You're gonna have to face it. You can't keep running away from this." Because the more they run away I feel the more angry I get. I get extremely angry when they just-when they said that to me, my mom and my dad, "Well, let's just get through your wedding, your cousin's wedding, and then we'll discuss." No, there is no discussion. You get through this now, you get to the bottom line of this now. Because if not I'm going to make it extremely uncomfortable. I am, I can't take it anymore. I can't take this hostility that's going on between my family and still have them putting on a smiley face like everything is 100% okay. I can tell their frustration. They're as frustrated as I am. But yet there's still something about them that is fearful of addressing the situation. And this is where I get pissed off, because unless there's money involved that can solve an issue I don't think my mom and dad know how to solve it. I really don't. I don't think they know how to have a discussion. And it's becoming more and more clear to me that they can't. Because unless they can buy something they don't have an answer, they don't have a solution, they don't have a way of getting to a solution. [13:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you like them to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With your aunt and uncle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everybody, all of us. Explain to me why you're not doing this, instead of avoiding me. Give me answers. Give me answers. I mean, it's to the point where why do I have to hear third person that my dad's upset that I'm not inviting his sister or our family. Why can't he have a conversation with me? That's the frustrating part. Why can't he and I talk one on one? When I have an issue with my mother's family why can't we talk one on one? I do have a problem that my parents do avoid a lot, a lot of issues that I feel-and this is me personally, I can't speak for my siblings-if we're addressed I would feel better about it. I would feel better about myself. However, I don't feel that. I don't feel that way. And I think that's what makes me so much more angry, so much more uncomfortable with myself and being associated with these people. I do feel that I'm looking for answers and I have nothing. I've asked the questions thousands of times and I've been avoided. I've never really gotten the concrete answer, I've never even gotten a concrete response. Or any type of response. All the response is, "Here, what can this buy? What can this buy to keep your mouth quiet for a little longer? What can this buy to get you to see things my way? What can this buy to get you to help you see things my way?" I don't like it, I don't want that. [15:10]</p>

<p>If something isn't monetary or value my parents cannot have a conversation. They choose not to have a conversation. And it drives me up a wall, I just get infuriated by it. I do, I get really, really pissed off, and I can't have a conversation with them, and I guess that's when I get frustrated. That's when I get pissed off. Is because I'm trying to have a conversation, and I can't have a conversation because my mother gets upset and she just starts yelling and screaming. And then my dad tunes out, and I try to talk to him about it, and he doesn't like what I say, and then he tunes out again. I just constantly feel like I'm being tuned out. Nothing I say has any value, nothing I say has any cement to it, has any emotion or feeling, or any meaning to them in my feelings. I feel like my thoughts are just words. Nothing sinks in, because it's not their way. It's not their way.</p>

<p>Perfect example, I gave them their list back, I told them they can invite a total of 80 to 85 people. Mind you, my parents are picking up the bill for the catering and bar. And I get a list back that's 98 people. What's going on here? Why is this list so high? Because they feel that they're putting the monetary value they have more of a say. They feel they can dominate over because they have that power over me. And I wouldn't let it happen, I gave them the list back, cut it down to 80. Cut it down. And they were both mad at me. [17:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like they were provoking you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were just ignoring you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not ignoring me, it's just the way they are. They don't see the hurt that they're doing. They don't see- Put it this way, I feel like they're doing things that they normally do but don't understand the meanings of it towards me. You know? I feel like they just go through-honestly, they have a good heart, their hearts in the right place, they just do things out of the ordinary and don't think they're- To be honest, I feel 100% in my heart they feel they're not doing anything wrong. They're really not. "Oh, who cares, we're paying for it, he's not gonna mind." I honestly feel that. And then when I confront them on it they don't process it. They don't, you know, see the end that I'm coming from. And that really pisses me off, because when I want to have a conversation about it I can't, because that's when I feel ignored. That's when I feel truly that they're not listening. Because when they talk to me they go, "Okay, we're doing this and this is fine." And I say, "No, we're not. This is not how we're doing things. You need to cut it down to what I told you you need to do." Because as far as directions go they're not very good at following them. They're really not. And then, you know, that shows me that they're not truly listening to what I'm saying. </p>

<p>That frustrates me that they don't truly understand what I'm saying. That infuriates me, you know, moving forward, that they don't understand what I'm saying. I feel that my feelings do not matter. My point of view does not matter. And me rebelling and not doing things and going to the extreme I feel is the only way they understand it. I feel it's the only way that I can communicate with them without using words. Is it the best way of communicating? Absolutely not. But I feel it's what I've been forced to do. I feel it's what I need to do to be effective. To get my words heard. To get my emotions heard, felt, to get my feelings felt. I hate doing that, I hate going to the extreme, I hate hurting my parents. But I have to do it in order to please myself, to let myself know that I am doing this for the benefit of us, to getting us to communicate. [20:20]</p>

<p>Because like I mentioned earlier, I never felt that there's been that communication of empathy, of feeling what I'm feeling, of truly, truly understanding what your child is going through. Again I go back to when I was sick. That was a cry for help. I cried and cried and cried, and I thought I opened their eyes, but all they did was say, "Here, here's the money, get yourself some treatment." That was a-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They were deaf to your pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. They were. I feel that 100%. And it's very difficult to express that to them. It's very difficult to accept that. Because you don't want to-you always want-you know, you always want your parents to support you in whatever you do. You always want your parents to be involved in a lot of the things that you like, and hopefully they'll like. But unfortunately I didn't get it to the satisfaction that I was craving, to the satisfaction that I needed. And that was very, very hurtful. And it still is hurtful, because the mentality is still the same. Their mentality has not changed. [22:00]</p>

<p>And it's even more difficult because I feel my mom is powerless, because she bows down to everything my dad wants to make him happy. She's the one who makes a lot of sacrifices to make him happy. And she's the one pleading with me to make the sacrifices to make him happy. And I won't do it. I'm not gonna do it. I am going to make things worse if that, because I do need him to understand how I'm feeling. I do. And again, it comes down to the drastic measures that I have to do. You think I don't want to invite my cousins? I don't, but I need to get through. I need to get his attention. I need to make him listen to what I'm saying, what I need. And I don't want to completely ignore him, because in the past that's exactly what I did. Because I just eliminate him, "Okay, whatever. Do what you're going to do, you go live your life, I'll live mine." I can't do that. Because there is that, you know, father/son when you want your father to be proud of you. [23:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. You look sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel it. I do, I feel sad. I feel like everything that I've done has not been good enough. You know, everything I've done I've been part of a competition to be someone who just gets bragged about. I mean, it was my education. You know, me and my sister and my brothers, "My kids graduated college. Two of my kids have master's. My daughter's going for her Ph.D. My son's getting married." All these happy families [unclear 24:07]. My dad is gloating. To say, "Hey, see, this is how good my kids are, this is how happy my family is." And I just-I don't understand it. I don't understand it. Is my dad proud of me? Maybe, probably, I don't know. Is he ecstatic that I'm getting in his business and my [noise] are all getting in the business? Absolutely. But who does that make happy? Who really approves? I mean, I'm happy [unclear] going into work and working with my brothers and my dad, but there's that other part of me that I've already worked with family. I already see what can happen. [25:00]</p>

<p>However, it's a totally different circumstance because essentially we're all working for ourselves, just under a company name. I do have lot of fear in going back into working with families and seeing the different opinions. Seeing how it can all seem like a good idea and then it turns negative. I just feel like over the past ten years I've lost a lot of trust in people that I love. And that's extremely difficult for me to swallow, for me to digest. For me to come to the reality that the people that I once loved and that I love and I used to trust I feel like I can't. And I feel like I have only one person to turn to, and it's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your girlfriend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have two, you have me too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You may have more than that, but you have at least two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Because that is comforting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's comforting to know that I do have the support of [inaudible]. That I'm still searching for with the people that I've been so close to. And it's just-it's frustrating. It's just frustrating, because all my life I've felt like an outcast, I've felt beaten up and survived it, gotten back up. Beat down again, survived it, gotten back up. And I just don't know why I keep getting beat down. And the crazier question is why I keep getting back up and fighting. When most normal people would already have just given up and moved on. End of this fight. I mean, I don't know if it is a fight. I don't think it's a fight, but it's just hard to digest, it's hard to put into words. The feeling that I'm feeling when-to express myself through anger. But what I'm looking for is love. And it's not a monetary love, it's not an unconditional love, it's an empathetic love. It's a love that they can actually stand in my shoes and just a little bit feel what I'm feeling, just a little bit. And I don't feel that they even feel that love. I really don't. The love part is there, the unconditional love is there, but the empathetic, the putting yourself in my shoes for a little bit I feel that there's not. And... It's frustrating. Because after all this time that's the one thing that I've been looking for, is the empathy piece. Is the support, knowing that they can relate to the situation that I'm in, they can see my side of things, they can see where all this anger and all this abuse came from. And I don't-I guess that's why I'm there, I'm still searching for it. I guess that's why I keep fighting. I guess that's why I keep doing the best I can to have these conversations with them. To try to crack open the shell, to get in there, to make them feel that, you know, it is-this is how I feel, just listen to me. Just listen to me. And they don't get it. And they don't get it. [30:30]</p>

<p>I mean, it was to the point where last week-remember I talked about wanting to smoke? I ended up smoking. I ended up because I just couldn't take it anymore. I was so angry and so upset, and I turned to the one thing that I hate turning to, but it comforted me. It gave me the feeling that I was looking for.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which feeling was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Relaxation, calm. Clear in my head, the comfort of knowing that I was okay. The comfort of -basically it comes down to this. I was rejected again, and the best way I deal with rejection is turning to either food or drugs, because they will never reject me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt like your parents reject you in what they do? [32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm, I do. They just reject my feelings. It's not that they reject me, they reject my feelings. Consistently reject my feelings. And this whole wedding process has solidified that, has made it more difficult, because everything that I'm doing and having them involved in, if I don't like it they get upset and they don't understand way. And again, it goes to my feelings of being rejected, my wants, my needs being rejected. Everything that me and my fianc� want, it's heard but it's not, all that they hear are the words. They don't hear the feeling behind it, they don't hear the emotion behind it, whether it be positive or anger. And that's what's frustrating to me. It's what's extremely frustrating to me, is because I do want them to empathize with me, to be in the shoes that I'm in. To walk in the feelings that I've walked through for all these years.</p>

<p>And I guess that's why I have a short temper when it comes to my aunt. Because I don't empathize with him about her. I don't have that feeling for her. The only feeling I have is negative. The only relationship I have with her is negative. Everything I want with my aunt is nothing, I don't want anything. And I want to say this to them but it's extremely difficult, but I want to tell my parents, my only gift, or tell my dad it's your gift for me is to let me not invite your sister [unclear]. And I know that's an extreme, I know that's very difficult for him to process, but I feel that's the only way I can get him to empathize with me. To finally feel rejected, to feel that rejection and the left out piece that I felt for so many years. Do I think it's a good tactic? No. But I'm sick of the bullshit. I'm sick of it, I can't take it anymore. I can't be getting angry and enraged over something that I want to have control over but I have none. This wedding I have control over. This is the only time I feel like I can use my power that I have to get through. Use the resources that I have to get them to understand what I'm- And I'm hesitant to use it. Because when I talk with my fianc� she always plays the devil's advocate. And that's when I get [unclear 35:46] again because everything comes down to my dad's feeling. Think about how your dad would feel. [You aren't?] celebrating his sister. Think about this, think about that, it's only one day. You're really going to make a big issue over this? And this is what I've been fed my whole life. "You're really going to do this? You're not going to put on a fake smile and deal with this? You're not going to put on the happy face that everything's all right, that you truly are happy to see those people there?" I can't do it. I'm ready to explode, I really am. [36:40]</p>

<p>And I don't want to, that's the thing, I just want to have a conversation. I want to just talk and get to that, get through to them and feel like it's affecting the conversation, feel like the communication was worth it. Feel like what I talked about, what we talked about, actually meant something. And to be honest every conversation I have with them about the wedding I feel like I'm getting [unclear 37:15]. I told them I don't want the high end stuff. "Well, you're getting it." I don't want it. I only want this many hors d'oeuvre. "Well, we're getting six." Why? "We're going to pay extra for an extra entr�e." Why? Whose wedding is it? This is the questions that I ask myself. These are the questions that I don't get an answer from because don't want to-I ask them, I go, "It's a waste of money." "Don't worry about cost." I just feel rejected to the point where unless we're talking about a money issue I can't get through to them. I really can't. Unless I go up to them and tell them, "Hey, I need $30,000 for a wedding, can you give it to me?" Yes, absolutely they'll listen. However, the details for it, no. No way. They'll just give me a thing and say, "Okay, well, this is what you have to spend it on." And that's how I feel. I feel that unless I'm asking them for money, unless they can provide for me, I feel like it's a lose, lose situation, because I feel our conversations mean nothing. Because they just listen to my words but they don't process them. They don't process them. [39:00]</p>

<p>And it's frustrating, it's really frustrating. Because I see my brothers and then I see my sister, and they kind of have the viewpoint that I have, but they don't say anything, and that's to appease my father. It's to try and keep the peace. My days of keeping peace are over. There's an outstanding issue that's been going on for a long, long period of time. And this is where-I just realized it, it's not a money problem, it's a communication problem. And that's where a weakness lies between me and my dad and my mom, is there is a communication problem. And when I bring it up and want to discuss it it's rejected. Almost 90 percent-98 percent of the time it's rejected. Because when I think I'm being accepted, the end of the conversation it's an attack on me, an attack on why I can think like this and why I'm doing this. And that kills me inside. It just eats away at me, that once again I feel like I failed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have you failed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I failed because I haven't gotten them to talk to me. That's how I feel I failed. I feel every conversation I had has not been effective. It hasn't. I failed, you know, multiple times trying to communicate with them. I've tried tons and tons of ways of crying out. Tons of ways of just trying to initiate it, initiate the conversation, and every way has been rejected. I feel like [unclear 41:27], you know, you have a project for your boss or whatever it is and he rejects. Or you have a school project and they say, "No, you've got to fix this, this, this and this." Well, I feel like I've tried to fix all this stuff, but it still comes back rejected because I didn't do a good enough job. I didn't do an effective job, I didn't do a more detailed job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're then attributing the job to how you communicate, not how they listen. [42:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That can be it too, I do have communication issues.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're locating the fault in you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe it is me. I don't know. That's the one thing I'm trying to figure out, is if it is me or them. Am I the one who's being unreasonable? Am I the one who's being unrealistic? I don't know. I feel I'm not. I'm sure they feel I'm being unrealistic, they feel I'm being unreasonable. I kind of feel like I am alone because right now I don't have anybody that supports me. Yourself and my fianc�. Those are the only two. But at times when people try to rationally talk to me that's when I get confused, that's when I get the guilt. That's when I get the uneasiness, like, yeah, you're right, maybe I should just smile and let it me. But it's not the person I am. It's not the person I want to be. If I have an issue I want to confront it. I don't want to let it get out of control. I don't want to make excuses to not tackle it, to not address it now. I want to be that person that gets on it now, that makes the stand, that tries to find a way to get it done. Because unfortunately I have been that person that put it on the backburner and waited and waited and waited. And when it finally came time to address it it's too late. It's too late, it's already ran its course, it's already infected everybody. And there's no turning back, there's no taking back what happened in the past. It could have been nipped in the bud 25 years ago. Instead it was chose-it wasn't chose, it was decided to look past it, and to let it continue to infect and infect and infect and infect. And then when we're suddenly trying to treat it and get rid of the virus, now the virus is pushing in [the heart? 44:40]. And it's frustrating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're not sure what to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'd like to help you figure it out. I think talking about it is a really good step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do need to go for today, Jordan. So I'll see you-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome, thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, good bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

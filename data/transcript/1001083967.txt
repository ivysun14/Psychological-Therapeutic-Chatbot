<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, um, kinda, sort of a little dichotomy goin' on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm feeling a lot better about myself in general and my self esteem has gone up because I have this job opportunity with [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And as I had mentioned to you previously, I was really feeling very down only because with selling real estate and being one hundred percent commission, that I just didn't have any feeling of support or structure or security and just, I had more expenses going out than income coming in, so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I have a pretty good shot at it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of job is it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, in sales with [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, so I had my phone interview last Friday and then this past Thursday, they invited me back for an in person interview coming up this coming Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.  And would there be a lot of travel involved?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  What they do is they start you out on the inside.  I would kinda be underemployed for a while and then you move up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hm.  Have you ever done anything like that before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've never worked at an inside sales position before.  It's always been outside.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my wife is trying to convince me, don't worry about the pay, just do a good job and you'll move up because in the past, I've always been too concerned about my salary and I've always sorta tied that into my self esteem and, uh, and I think this'll be good for me just because I've always been in jobs that have been very isolative.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I want to get involved in a job where I'm gonna be around people more often.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] would this be, inside sales, does that mean you're on the phone, as opposed to traveling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll be on the phone, um, and basically what they do first off, is they put you through a six week training course.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is good because a lot of companies don't invest that much time in their people.  I mean, they just skip over the training and throw you out to the wolves.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I think that's a real good sign that, yknow, they have systems in place and they want, they support you and they want you to succeed and, and, uh, so I think that's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And is it straight salary or is it salary and commission?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, it's base salary plus commission.  I think, I have a friend who works there who actually got my resume on this guy's desk, and I think he said it's like a sixty, forty split.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, there's opportunities to make more -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Once you get the hang of it and do well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Great.  And what would you be selling?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, primarily, uh, this group called [DEIDENTIFIED], it's their state, local and education group, so the education part would be K through 12.  State and local government would be like police stations, fire stations, state level, could be college, universities, um, yknow, state universities and so forth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you selling hardware packages basically or software?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, hardware primarily and some software.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.  Well, that sounds interesting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And since you'd be local, you would not be traveling so it would be less stress.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah.  It's a pretty low stress job.  I think my buddy, [NAME OTHER], does it because one time we were at my son's birthday party, and, uh, like my wife, his wife's a nurse and, uh, she was saying that, uh, her husband isn't good at handling stress at work and so he is taking this job that's lower paying than what she would like and so she has to kind of carry the ball to bridge the gap, which she's not so crazy about doing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, well, it sounds like a great opportunity, though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And like you said, once you get into a company like [DEIDENTIFIED] there's a lot of opportunity to move around.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, cool, good.  Well, good luck.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, and how's your mood been overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, very up and down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I had run out of medication and I had gone, in retrospect, I thought this morning I actually should've just called you, but I, I had run out of medication, it was my own fault.  I waited too long to reorder and I went to Walgreen's to get like an emergency supply, because before they'd give me like ten pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But because I waited too long, I think the last time I had ordered from them was [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so they said well, we can't do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I missed one day and it was my fault and, um, so any how, um, I've been getting, I picked up my prescription at, yesterday, faithfully, early on in the morning, at [DEIDENTIFIED] because they can provide a ninety day supply.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, um, also, I was hearing that Wal-mart is offering a lot of, a thirty day supply of prescriptions, is that just, um, primarily for generic drugs?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just some generics.  Not all generics, even.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  Now, what about, is there a generic for Depakote?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, I don't know.  I think so, but I'm not positive.  I used to have a list.  I don't know if I still do, of the generics that they had.  Let me see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not sure I'd want to risk it because Depakote's worked well for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, you asked about Trazodone.  Trazodone is generic.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see if it's on their list.  Um, it is on the list.  100 mg tablets.  The 150s and the 50s.  So, we could get, get -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Trazodone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Trazodone, get through them, it looks like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, yeah, up to a thirty day supply.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then, and then, the uh, for depression, the generic for Wellbutrin is the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is Bupropion.  I presume they have that one.  Oh, they don't have that on the list, unfortunately.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They only have a few antidepressants.  They have Trazodone, Doxepin, Amitriptyline.  Um, selected, the generic selected, generic Nortriptyline and generic Paxill.  Excuse me, they don't have very many, but we can certainly use the Trazodone there and maybe save you some money. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the others, you can get the ninety day supply - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean before a co pay, what does that typically sell for?  Do you have any idea?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Trazodone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um, yknow, it depends on the strength and the quantity, but I think like twenty, thirty dollars at the most.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would be the cash price, probably.  But if you can get it for five, or something -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm just saving five dollars on the co pay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because usually I pay ten dollars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah so it save you a little bit.  So, it depends on whether it's worth a trip to Wal-mart or you go to [DEIDENTIIFED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now, is ten dollars the copay if you get a ninety day supply, or just a thirty day supply?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, yesterday the Depakote was very expensive.  Um, it was a fifty dollar copay and the price before the submission to the, um, insurance was like five hundred and ninety dollars.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For thirty days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, for a ninety day supply.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ninety days, oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's about two hundred a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Which one did you run out of?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Depakote.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Depakote, okay.  So, you've got it again now, you said.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I guess my question is, if you have enough in your system from day to day, so is just missing one, I take it at night, so is missing one night, is that gonna have much of an affect on you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not usually.  Some people can feel a difference.  That means they're just on the border of having a therapeutic level and missing a day kind of drops them below.  But, for most folks, if you miss a day now and then, they don't notice a big difference.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well, I don't know if, I, I, here's what happened.  I ran out for Sunday night, so I went and got it Monday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know if it's just coincidental or what, but Monday night, Sunday night and Monday night, last night, I woke up ten to fifteen times a night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was like, I just couldn't sleep and I just feel like I'm rapid cycling again and, um, and I'm not quite sure, you know, what's causing it and I don't know if the increased level of the, uh, bupro, bu what?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bupropion or Wellbutrin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bupropion is causing me to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you actually cut down the dose, right for the tremor, did you go to 200?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I increased it, the Wellbutrin from 150 to 300.  That was too much.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So then we reduced it to 200, but with the generic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  Has that gotten rid of the tremor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About eighty percent.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Almost, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But, it could be -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just concerned if it's causing me to rapid cycle because I just, once I start not getting enough sleep, I get so overwhelmed that I have trouble functioning then I'm getting really scared because on Friday, I have the interview and I don't want to mess that up because - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have to, I mean, I really feel like I have to get this job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  Well, it's a possibility that the combination of antidepressants, um, the Trazodone has a little bit of antidepressant effect too, but usually it doesn't cause rapid cycling.  And Wellbutrin could be contributing.  Um, it could also be the Depakote isn't ideal.  Let's see, your last level was, I think 101.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I was seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I was taking 1250.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I think, once I moved it up to 1500, it was better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And see, I, I'm, I'm really scared about playing around too much with my medicine because, um, yknow, last summer was really a big problem for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  And your level's not bad, [PATIENT NAME].  Last time we checked, it was 100.  Heck, we could probably check it again.  It's been, hasn't quite been six months yet.  It's been five months, but, uh, it was 101 with the range of this lab being 50 to 120, so it's in the therapeutic range, going up might or might not help you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to go up, really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Yknow, I -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just more concerned with the interaction between the three drugs.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, and yknow, the Trazodone doesn't seem to have affected me, I think what I've noticed the difference has been is when we changed, and that was because I asked about, yknow, seeing if it would be wiser to, um, move it up because I was feeling depressed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, we did try the 300, but that didn't work because I had the hand tremors.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know, part of me is wondering if I should just, yknow, stick it out with times when I have a little depression.  I think a lot of it was also tied to my environment, just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Could be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not living in the house and, yknow, your job has so much to do with your self esteem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, yknow, my real sickness is not going well, I think I'm always thinking maybe I just would be better off going back to the 150 because I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had me on that for a year, as a stabilizer, between that and the Depakote and it seemed to work pretty well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It'd be reasonable to try it again if you want.  I think you're right, the circumstances probably contribute to the depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I, I, I just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't blame you not wanting to mess around with it too much, [PATIENT NAME], how much of the Trazodone are you using at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, let's see, I thought I had run out and I found it this morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just a few pills left, but I missed that for a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, that was during the time you weren't sleeping as well.  You didn't have Trazodone, then?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, last week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, you think getting back on the Trazodone will help with the sleep, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's, like you said, critical.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, that would be reasonable.  If you want to try to backing off to the 150, give it a, maybe a few weeks even, see how the job interview goes, hopefully you get the job, that will give you a boost.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, uh, just see if that helps.  I think that would be reasonable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, cause I, I, I know, like, tonight, Wednesday and Thursday, I really want to be fresh and the other thing is I have a lot of research to do and I just want to be able to think clearly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My whole organizational skills go out the window when I don't, when I don't get enough sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  How's your concentration right now?  Are you able to focus okay, or is it difficult?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, on a scale of one to ten, it's like a seven.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How's your energy during the day?  Do you have enough?  Are you tired?  Or too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, now I've been tired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Cause of the not sleeping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How's your appetite been?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Low, actually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know if your weight's dropping or if it's stable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I think I had a few pounds in my mid area to lose anyhow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, you're not concerned about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Are you worrying to a degree, do you it's obsessive about circumstances or not obsessively?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Ah, I think, um, I think I've been a little obsessive about a couple of different topics.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What about, are you getting some enjoyment out of the activities, or do you kinda feel like you're going through the motions?  Okay.  Any suicidal thoughts recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Any racing thoughts, where your mind's going a hundred miles an hour?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Uh, and the mood swings, how long are they lasting?  Is it minutes, hours, days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you can be down for a few days and you'll kind of be up for a few days.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, when I'm up, it's still barely keeping my head above water.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, it's not going into a manic state where you just -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So you feel depressed for a few days and kind of get back up to where you're just getting by and then kind of seem back down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Yeah, I think it's reasonable, I want to be careful, I don't want to cut back too much on the antidepressants.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, and yesterday, too, for an example, I was driving downtown and I noticed how short tempered I was with people cutting me off and saying words I normally don't say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just yourself in the car or - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, and I'm like wow, I'm really irritable and so I don't have a lot of tolerance for stuff right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Irritability also sometimes can be a side effect of the Wellbutrin and the depression and sleep depravation will make us irritable, too.  That's sometime else, if we go down to 150, it might take a little bit of the edge off of the irritability.  And if you feel like you're still depressed, uh, and irritable on the 150, maybe after this interview process, we might look at making a change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, yknow, the other thing, too, I'm really trying to change the way - I mean, I'm really trying to change the way I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> About what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just, like, um, day to day stuff.  I'm just trying to be a lot more positive because I just had this lifelong struggle of just kinda being negative.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My mom was very negative.  My dad was the opposite, he was very positive and I think I got a lot of that negativity grooved into my mind just because of the way my mom operated.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I don't know how to get out of that, but it's definitely, yknow, I kind of beat up myself and I'm very hard on myself, so it's, it's really hard to get a lot of joy out of life when you're so down on yourself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  Are you still seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because sometimes in counseling people can help or be supportive of changing those thought patterns because you're right,  when we're exposed to it when we're young, it's like they get recorded in our brains and that just keeps playing back like a tape recorder until we go in and change those tapes, so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I need to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I, yknow, just between you and I, I don't know the progress with [NAME OTHER], and please don't repeat this to her, of course, is it's way too slow.  I mean we've been seeing her for a year and I see some improvement, but the thing that's really frustrating is like I feel like my wife is leaving it up to her to change our marriage, as opposed to [NAME OTHER] and I taking more ownership.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the other thing is, I mean, she is more new age and my wife and I are Christians.  I don't really buy into a lot of her belief system and even though she's an excellent counselor, it bothers me and I have a strong friend I've known for twenty years back east and he goes, I think you really need to see a Christian counselor only because, not that they're gonna be the be all end all, but the fact is that you have shared values and, yknow, that's important.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, have you talked with [NAME OTHER] about that, about maybe making a change?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She doesn't seem willing to do it.  I may just start to go see a counselor on my own.  Um, and maybe we could just use her for like marital counseling, but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I, I feel like, yknow, I feel like, yknow, leaving God out of the picture has been a big problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, I think it is important to, yknow, be comfortable with whoever you're working with and if it's not a good fit for you, it is kind of reasonable to find someone and I think, I mean, I would hope that [NAME OTHER] would understand that if you said yknow, I think I want to find someone else to work with individually and, uh, do you know of a good Christian counselor that you would feel comfortable working with?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got a couple of referrals, um, and I need to follow up on them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I'd encourage you to do what feels right to you because I think that's important.  Well, so it sounds like, um, still having those low dips.  Not as severe as in the past, it sounds like.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the worst point was this past summer when I could barely function.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I'm just concerned because I don't want to get anywhere near that again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.  Well, it sounds like getting back on the Trazodone will definitely help you sleep.  If you want to cut back to 150 Wellbutrin, I'm certainly okay with that and see how that feels and again, hopefully your circumstances improve.  That'll give you a boost, too.  And if it doesn't, [PATIENT NAME], we have lots of other options.  So, should we try going back to 150s of the Wellbutrin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, and do you still have some, or do you need -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Let me, well actually, I think there are a couple of refills on there.  Do you want me to -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, what we did was, I didn't pick up, oh there is refills on -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On the 150.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where did you get those filled, do you remember?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Walgreens's.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that where you'd go back to get them again, or you gonna go to [DEIDENTIFIED]?  I can write you a new prescription if you need a new one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Write the new prescription for [DEIDENTIFIED] for ninety days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I can get that at [DEIDENTIFIED], that's the main pharmacy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, these are two prescriptions.  One for the generic Wellbutrin 150s and then one for the, um, Trazodone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Trazodone, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  I'm just thinking, the Wellbutrin, um, the 150s, I don't think, they're supposed to be generic, but they've had trouble getting them in the XL form.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, maybe the, maybe the, I mean, is the chemical make up exactly the same?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Between generic and brand name?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Between the generic and the brand.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's supposed to be, but there can be a little variability.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, and you see maybe the Wellbutrin was just a better fit for me and I was wondering about that because the generic, so far for the depression medication, really doesn't seem to be working as effectively, but that could just be because I'm cycling.  And I don't know, I mean, I have, I go through it so often, I don't know how often I'm cycling these days.  I mean, when [NAME OTHER] and I were in the same household, uh, she could recognize it, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, I'll write it for the Wellbutrin XL 150, um, and if they do have a generic available, you can ask, if you do want that, or just the brand name.  They have the XL like 300 generic available, but for some reason, they have trouble getting the 150s, so.  Yeah, the, the generics are supposed to be the exact same as the brand name, but the FDA guidelines say that they have to be within 85 to 115 percent of the same potency, so there is some variability in there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I didn't realize it could be that much of a difference.  I thought it was exactly the same.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what is usually said, but it's not accurate in terms of the guidelines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because, yknow, so they could be off by thirty percent?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yknow, there could be some wiggle room in there and for some medicines, especially like heart medicines or blood thinners, that could be, or seizure medicines, that could be very serious.  Or even thyroid.  But the antidepressants, if they're a little less or more potent, we just adjust the dose a little bit and compensate for it, but it's still not ideal.  So, I'll write a ninety day supply for each with three refills then and you're good for a year.  And then, um, you're okay with the Xanax, still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I really don't take that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You haven't needed it for weeks or months?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess I don't even think about taking that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine, then, if you don't need it.  Let's cross it off.  Okay.  And the Depakote.  Do you know if you have refills left, [PATIENT NAME], on the Depakote?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I just got it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just got it.  A ninety day supply you said?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So, we're good for a while.  All right.  Here are those two prescriptions.  Any other questions or anything else you want to talk about before we set up the appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Why don't we check back in a month and also it will be time to check blood levels again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, if you like, I can give you a slip and you can just have it checked a week or so before the appointment and we'll have the results.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What I'd like to do is get you to check the Depakote level, it's called a valproic acid level.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had one before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And then check your liver, too, just to make sure everything's fine with that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just can't believe it's April already.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know.  Finally got out of winter.  I thought it would never end.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  And we've barely got a spring.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> How about [DATE], is that open for you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me check for you.  I have to get a diagnosis code for the lab here.  Here's the lab slip.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're welcome.  Okay, you said [DATE].  Let's see, that day, I have a time either, um, at eleven, or one thirty or three o'clock.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anything like, either [DATE] or [DATE], like at eight or eight thirty?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, on the [DATE], I have an eight thirty time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you like a card too, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, that's okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I almost put it for p.m. and not a.m.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you need anything in the meantime, give me a holler.  Hopefully, things will kind of level off a little bit and especially get some sleep and the job opportunity, that sounds real encouraging.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  I won't shake your hand today because I have a little cold.  I don't want to give it to ya.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, all right.  Have a good day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, [PATIENT NAME].  Thanks.  You, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, bye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, don't forget your glasses there, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  All right take it easy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, bye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PATIENT NAME] how have you been doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME], today is my birthday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Happy Birthday to you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not really enjoying my birthday. I really don’t enjoy holidays and birthdays like that but today was just one of those days I wish it would just go away. Most of the family call and e-mail today saying Happy Birthday and they thought I was feeling sorry for myself but I told them, you know, I just want to do my regular routine, walk or do something. I don’t want to be treated special or anything of that nature because I just didn’t. My aunt passed away and knew I couldn’t hear her voice again so this birthday has been one of the worst birthdays I’ve ever had because I know she wasn’t gonna call to say happy birthday cause she’s dead. My mother had a stroke last week, my aunt had a stroke last week, last year I had four immediate deaths in the family and six other deaths that I knew the people.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I feel, you know, most of the time I feel depressed. I try to do things to counteract that depression like exercising, doing something like that. I used to be able to do that, they used to take the depression away but he doesn’t do it like he used to. Most of the time I have suicidal thoughts. The only reason I haven’t committed suicide was because I was always afraid by reading in the Bible that you’ll go to Hell, that’s the ultimate sin by committing suicide but if I wouldn’t have read any of the Bible I probably would have been dead a long time ago. I live like, I live like a robot, I just go through the motions. I don’t get excited. I thought by going to the Super Bowl I would get excited but things that I never experienced before I thought that I would be excited, but I really wasn’t excited, you know. In the year 2000 I finally wrote and told my family that I’ve been suffering depression, I’ve been hiding it. It exacerbated by working on a job with the government so I went and filed EEO complaints trying to do the right thing and trying to go through the positive, to act positive you know, and do the right thing but it -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me some more about that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What happened at work?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you know, being a lieutenant working at the [DEIDENTIFIED], each lieutenant is supposed to rotate quarterly and what I mean by rotate quarterly you know, you go to day shift, midnight, eight to four. Most other white folk tend to have opportunity to go eight to four with weekends off and enjoy their family. I was on four to twelve for like 12 straight months and I was supposed to be rotated and I complained about that, I complained that my chest was hurting, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Was that a good idea to complain?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah it was a good idea to complain based on the fact that my chest had started hurting, I was supposed to have a certain amount of staff on my shift and when I work I’m always short of staff, and four to twelve, that’s when the inmates are out and about, twelve to eight they sleep, eight to four they’re working and then four to twelve they’re out and about doing regular activities like getting in trouble and things of that nature and trying to control that with short staff, it became very stressful and I started complaining, you know my chest started hurting so you know, I went to the doctor and I told the doctor that my chest was hurting and he said I suggest that your job try to accommodate you and put you on the shift or put you whatever they can do to help your situation by taking down the stressful situation I suggest that they do that, so when I was working at [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED], we have a federal detention center that holds the males and a federal correction institute that holds the females. So most of the time working at the federal detention center it’s laid back, working at the federal correction institution, that’s when you gotta do all the work, people going out, [INAUDIBLE] you got to get staff to make sure, you gotta talk to staff and make sure they have the training to take people out with a weapon and all that stuff and when you don’t have that help you know, people got to give me, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You had a lot of responsibility.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I had a lot of responsibility, so when I did complain, you know, it got worse. They kept me on four to twelve but when they had this white lieutenant, he was having chest problems and pain, they put him in the detention center where we’re less stressed.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you feel like there’s racism?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was a racism thing. The accommodated him, but they didn’t accommodate me. So when I filed the EEO, they came after me. They retaliated against me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, a case of retaliation.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they really retaliated against me. Everything that I did was scrutinized so like when I come to work it was sort of like I was under so much pressure because I knew I couldn’t make a mistake. I knew if I made a mistake I was gonna be scrutinized and written up just by some minor things but when someone else in my position made the same mistake, it’s overlooked. So every day, you know, I was kind of stressed out in trying to ensure that if I did make a mistake would follow the responsibility that I did have I was trying to make sure whether to make no mistakes cause I knew they were coming after me but thank God that I kind of knew policy you know, so when I did that they retaliated again and what happened then in that situation, when you do an evaluation for the officers and things of that nature, how they work, how their progress is going, you know, I usually rate the officers, you know if they’re doing a pretty good job, you know I give them ‘exceeds’ you know, and if they’re not, you know and if they’re not, they just get ‘satisfaction.’ So by the fact that I didn’t have the staff to help me work that means the officers had to do more work.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So you know, I increased their evaluation cause they had to do more work. When you don’t have the staff they got to do what it takes to do two people, one person they have the job that takes to do one person two people had to do it, but they only did with one person so the captain, you know, I tell him, I feel like you over-evaluated them, I said to the captain well you know, you’re not out here supervising, I’m out here supervising.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You told the captain?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I told the captain that because it was true, you know, you tell me, you know that I over-rated them but you’re not here to see the work that they’re doing. I’m here. You left me in charge.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now what did the captain say?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The captain said well I want you to change the evaluations, and I said well what’s the use of changing the evaluation? I wasn’t gonna change no evaluation.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> He asked you to.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he asked me you know, what’s the use of re-writing the evaluation when I wrote the evaluation, that’s what I meant and that’s what I said on the evaluation so what’s the use of re-writing it? But the bottom line was the warden stated that day she wasn’t gonna give these people -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Female warden?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, states that this year she wasn’t gonna give these people the QSI’s, the quality staff increases, you know, they’re trying to cut back on the budget.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So what it was, I had like, I had maybe six to eight staff and they did a hell of a job for me and I gave them, recommended that they, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Gave them the credit.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, credit, but what it was in my opinion, I felt like he wanted me to downgrade their evaluations because he can make sure that the white guys get their regular outstanding stuff like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So they can get their raises.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So what happened was I said well captain, you know, the policy states that you have authority as a captain if you don’t agree with my evaluation you have the authority to change it and I told him that, I told him I’m not gonna change it, I said you don’t want them to have this evaluation, just cross out what I wrote and change their evaluation and put your initials by it, that’s what policy states, once you turn it over to the captain the captain can do that but you know, he said no, I want you to do it, and I said no, this is what I felt like these people should have gotten so if you want to change it, you do it. He said well you’re costing the bureau too much money, if we give them outstanding and stuff they’re gonna get a lot of money and we can’t afford it. I said well I’m just going according to the way they work for me and I got retaliated against that so it got to the point where, you know, I was going to see a psychiatrist, I started [DATE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So it’s the psychiatrist’s telling me, you know, me and the captain, we had a run in and so he called me in the office and said you better change these evaluations, are you afraid? And I said no, I’m not afraid to change the evaluation. I’m not afraid of the officer or anything. He said well you better do what I tell you to do, I said you’re not gonna talk to me in that manner, I’m not gonna do what you tell me to do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The captain said that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yes. I said oh yes you will, I said no captain, I’m not gonna do that you know, you might as well forget that, you know and I said well, I told him that you know, this conversation’s over with. He said no it’s not and that’s that, that was on my four to twelve shift, I had just left my psychiatrist at two o’clock.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and he said yes you are. I said look man, I’m not gonna do that man, I tell you what, I said you’re irritating me, I told you what I’m not gonna do, I told you I was a man of my word and I’m not changing anything. Well we can write you up, I said well you can write me up and do whatever you want me to do, I stand by my word and he kept running off at the mouth and then I just snapped. And I told him, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You snapped?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What happened?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I told him that you know, I’d break his neck, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You told him that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I told him that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So you got pretty angry.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you know, he got me to the point, you know</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he pushed you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> He kept on pushing me, I said I’ll break your neck and not think nothing of it, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What happened next?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Then I got on the phone, I called my doctor, you know and I said this captain is pushing me, and he said well just leave the institution immediately, I said I can’t do that till they get the proper staff to relieve me so you know, I said look, my doctor told me I need to go ahead on leave. You’re not going nowhere. I said look, and I told him, my doctor told me I need to leave and I’m getting ready to hurt you and hurt anybody else that gets in my way if I don’t leave this institution, you know. So finally he got me a relief.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How long did it take?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It took about an hour.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That long?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. You know, the time and stuff like that. So I said well give me the doctor number and stuff like that and I said well you don’t need my doctor’s number and stuff, you know, I’ll have the doctor write you a letter of what he said and he said well what’s wrong with you and I said I don’t have to reveal my medical condition to you anyway and stuff like that. I’m telling you that my doctor told me to go ahead on leave. So you know, that’s when, any time I get real angry that’s when I fall into that, I go into that depression situation for about a month or two and it’s kind hard to get out of it even with taking the medication.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did you go into the hospital?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, the doctor put me, he said [PATIENT NAME], I’m going to have to put you in the hospital but you can check yourself out anytime you want to but I feel that you’re either gonna have a nervous breakdown. I feel that you’re having a nervous breakdown. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You feel that depressed.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I feel like I’ll end up hurting someone, you can wind up losing your job and I really want you to retire. And I told him that I didn’t want to retire, you know, I’m too young to retire. You know, I want to fight what was right. So after I got out of the hospital, I was a GS-11 lieutenant, meaning that was the senior lieutenant, so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In the whole facility? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. We had several senior lieutenants, GS-9 lieutenants under us. Initial supervisors as well, so he could change my assignment to a GS-9 lieutenant to embarrass me, the same lieutenants that I’m supervising that, you know, embarrass me and prance me around and stuff like that and so you know, I wrote it up and the warden put me back on my position, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right, he didn’t have any right to do what he’d done, you know so I filed him on that, so either have me to redo modules that I have done in the past were all A’s to qualify to be a lieutenant. He wanted me to do that over again, that’s against policy. I had already did that, that’s on my record that I passed, you know. I got correction officer of the year. I received several awards. I saved people’s lives and got awards for saving people’s lives and stuff like that so then the doctor kept on trying to make me retire and I don’t want to retire, I really don’t, you know, I can’t do that, you know. I got to fight for what’s right. So in 2003 the doctor told me -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Excuse me, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I got to get [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> The doctor said, [PATIENT NAME], it’s getting to the point now where I’m afraid you would do something to hurt somebody and by me being your doctor, I know your mental condition and so if you go out there and hurt someone and by being in your state of mind and that’s gonna cause me to get in trouble so I’m hoping you retire and he said well they just have to pay you a pension [INAUDIBLE], and I don’t want to retire, you know, I’m too young. He wrote the letter and they made me retire anyway. So that’s just the short version of what has happened to me in the last couple years.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well I really appreciate you sharing that with me. What about medication?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well the medication he was giving me I was taking at the time I was taking, I went through all them, Prozac, he was giving me Ativan to calm my nerves. I was on every, Zoloft, every new medication, not new medication but Cymbalta was the newest one that had came out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How is the Cymbalta working?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well it agitates you at first, you know. You get agitated and you become restless, you know, at a point of time where I had to go to sleep. The Ativan basically calmed my nerves, I think he put me on Zyprexa one time because I had gotten real bad then, you know he had to put me on Zyprexa, that’s a psychotropic medication if I’m not mistaken, he put me on Zyprexa to make me calm all the way down so that kind of made me lethargic.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They really tried everything.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah they tried everything then at the end he said [PATIENT NAME], I need you to go to some type of group, I said no, I don’t wanna go to no type of group, you know and be sitting there. I said you can’t help me out, tell them my business and stuff, you know, I may have, you know, other people can’t help me, I mean they can’t make me feel better, I mean and I still believe people can’t help me feel better, I mean when you’re depressed people say all the right things but it doesn’t make you feel better. So he said with the combination of the medication and going through counseling, I think it would be a good idea you know, instead of you coming back to [DEIDENTIFIED] all the time you know, for me to treat you, but he never told me I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He never told me that, you know, just always major depression. My retirement was from major depression, stress and irritable bowel syndrome and that’s why I had to retire. He told me to find a doctor in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I went to the doctor and I heard about [PHYSICIAN NAME], he’s a pretty good psychiatrist and he said maybe you should try him. I can’t think of her name. [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. And she said I heard his name, I heard he’s pretty good with people and I said well I guess I’ll go so that’s when I came here, met you and I had to do the tests and all of that and that’s when he asked me, you know, you told me that they didn’t have a cure for traumatic stress disorder which I never knew I even had that and you know, I thought it was normal. I used to tell my doctor, I said well you know, when I dream, that’s all I dream about mostly every night that’s why I don’t like to go to sleep, about going to work. It’s not a good dream cause the dream is that when I go to work I’m actually dreaming about them retaliating against me so the dream is not good. So what’s the use of going to sleep if you could dream about them and I never had a good dream about the job, every time I dream it’s about them coming after me and I got to continue to watch myself and those are the dreams I had and the doctor said that wasn’t normal. I said well, I don’t know what’s normal or not, that’s what I dream, I thought it was normal. A dream is a dream, I didn’t know that dream could be abnormal or normal. I mean, you can’t control your dreams so you know, I never looked at it in that way. I guess what he had written up in my paperwork and stuff, I guess it was a post traumatic stress disorder, I didn’t know. I just thought the dreams were normal. Then the fact that 22 years ago I got shot at a club trying to break up a fight between one of my friends and because someone attacked his girlfriend, you know, the gluteus maximus, and he got mad and I tried to break it up and stuff. I got shot two times in the lower hip and you know, and I had severe nerve damage, what do you call it, sciatic nerve damage.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So you know I had a couple operations to get the bullet out, they cleaned the area and I kept on having you know, it would burn a lot and sometimes, and one time my feet get kind of hot, so after that happened I had to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and they had, I had about five or six [INAUDIBLE] where they shoot that dye in your back to try to block the nerves and stuff and they got it to a point where I can just [INAUDIBLE] the pain, because at one time I, you know, drinking trying to get rid of the pain before they told me they had to wean me off of the heavy medication and when they wean you off of that, I was just in pain and crying every day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And they said well there ain’t too much we can do now you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So they gave, managed, I hurt everyday, burn everyday but it’s managed, I can live with so that bothers me a lot but I got almost kind of used to it. Everything is almost like normal, what I think is the normal, most people thing is abnormal. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because I don’t live with that for so long, I live with depression for so long and as a kid I was depressed, I didn’t know what it was, I just lived with it. I used to cry all the time, go somewhere and cry and didn’t know what I was crying about, I never told anybody till 1981, I was told I needed to go see a psychiatrist. At that time it was embarrassing to go see a shrink so I never did, you know I was playing football, basketball and track, but I played those things, not because I really enjoyed those things but it was because I was good at what I was doing. I may have been better if I was really into it but it was just natural talent that I had you know, so I never really enjoy life. Never really enjoyed life at all. It was like the smile on my face was, that was the natural smile that I was just born with, people see me smiling and they think I’m happy but you know, that’s not the case.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, okay. Now we’ll be talking some more about these things and see about getting you medications. Any questions you wanna ask me?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, just that I’m learning now, I’m beginning to find out now that if I get upset about something inside, I go into a deep depression for a long period of time.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. It helps to talk too, get these things out. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it may help to talk, but when you’re going through that depression it’ll make you feel better when you talk but sometimes you don’t feel like talking.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don’t mind being here this long because my sister is at the house waiting to take me out for my birthday and I don’t want to be treated on my birthday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I really don’t want, I’ve been avoiding people all day because you know, I’ve been depressed all day so I didn’t want to enjoy the birthday. I’ll be glad when the birthday, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Just go and do a little celebrating for [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but see you know, that’s the thing, I’ve been living my whole life for other people’s benefit.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Trying to make them happy, you know. The only reason I’m still living because my aunt [NAME OTHER] taught me to [INAUDIBLE] the kids, try to stay strong for your kids but I’m tired of doing things that other people want me to do. I want to live for me for a change.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m tired of other people. If I don’t wanna celebrate I just don’t wanna celebrate and people are just gonna have to understand that I don’t want to do it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cause you know, forcing me to do things that I really don’t wanna do to satisfy you, I should be very appreciative and I am very appreciative.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, but if I keep telling you I don’t want to do this, it just keeps getting me madder and madder then I fall back into that state of depression.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We don’t want to do that.Okay, alright. Well happy birthday to you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Alright [PHYSICIAN NAME].</P>

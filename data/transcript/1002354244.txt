<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well—known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy. 
The following transcript is from a session with Dr. Carl Whitaker and a patient.  It is preceded by a brief discussion with another therapist who provides a brief history. (That initial discussion begins here already in progress.) At the conclusion of the session with the patient and Dr. Whitaker is a discussion among several therapists and a follow—up interview with Dr. Whitaker.</p>

<p>Carl Whitaker, MD (1912—1995) was a pioneer in the field of family therapy. He viewed the family as an integrated whole and not simply a group of separate individuals. He believed family togetherness could bring personal growth and stressed the importance of including extended family members, especially children, in treatment. He also was an early champion of the concept of "co—therapy," where therapists work together in pairs, and of live supervision, in which a master therapist watches a student at work with a family and teaches by intervening in the session. Dr. Whitaker's innovations have become standard procedures among family therapists. </p>

<p>In the late 1940's, Dr. Whitaker was Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University, where he primarily worked with schizophrenics and their families.  In 1955, Dr. Whitaker went into private practice as co—founder of the Atlanta Psychiatric Clinic.  He became a professor of Psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in 1965 and remained there until his retirement in 1982. He continued to teach and lecture frequently after his retirement.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Excuse me.</p>

<p>DR. MEAD: �following episode of acute excitement, which he could not explain the reason for, except to say that he had become concerned over approaching final exam... </p>

<p>And he gave a history of mental hospitalization running back to 1955, when he was in the service in Japan, when he was hospitalized at the naval hospital there. He could not describe exactly what had happened, but papers received from the V.A. hospital diagnosed him as having had a catatonic schizophrenic reaction, where it should have been manifested by a confusion in thinking, bizarre ideation, withdrawal, mutism. </p>

<p>And he was transferred from Japan to the Oakland Naval Hospital, where in 1956 he appeared to be convalescing, when he jumped out of a first floor window from the ward room and fractured several cervical vertebrae and had to have a laminectomy; essentially (ph) that he was in a Striker frame, and during this time he again went into a catatonic stupor. But prior to this he had not had any EST and he appeared to have been recovering spontaneously with the tranquilizers. [0:01:25.3]</p>

<p>He was kept on a Striker frame, tube fed, and remained in this state of withdrawal for about six months and was transferred in that condition to the Tomah V.A. Hospital, here in Wisconsin. And during that time his cast was removed and they decided to go ahead with EST and insulin coma therapy. And following this he made a social recovery and then was able to be discharged about six months after coming back to Wisconsin, which is his home. [0:02:01.9]</p>

<p>History seen from his brother indicates that he was one of three children. He had an older brother and sister, now married, and he was the smallest, the least accomplished of the children. He always felt that he was trying to prove himself to his family, and particularly to his father, who was a very domineering and authoritarian man, whereas his mother was a very passive sort of woman who the brother describes as having had the patient in a perfect double bind, continuously exhorting him to go off and do things and accomplish things and be somebody, but keeping him in his childish dependence, tied to her. He did not do well in school, but got passing grades in high school, graduated, went to work in New York until he was 19, and then joined the service. And he was hospitalized from about age 22 to 24, discharged in �56 and — no, age 23. [0:03:19.3]</p>

<p>Since the discharge from Tomah in 1956, he has been readmitted there on two occasions. They were usually associated with failure in school. He was trying on nine different occasions to make it in school. He has passed somewhere along the line and accumulated credits, you know, so that he got back into the university here in sophomore level courses. </p>

<p>He has also attended to go into a nursing course in Racine, Wisconsin as a male nurse and he compensated toward the end of one semester there and had to be hospitalized on their psychiatric ward. So this is an over—determined thing with him to, again, prove that he can get ahead, get an education, go off, and accomplish as has his older brother who has finished college and married and successful in an office position. </p>

<p>DR. CARL WHITAKER: Can you stay with us?</p>

<p>DR. MEAD: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: Swell. (inaudible at 0:04:18.5).</p>

<p>DR. MEAD: Want me to go get him? [0:04:17.9]</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: You know, oh, it would be very nice, but let him sit beside the patient. Leave him over here, huh. Yes�</p>

<p>(inaudible at 0:04:51.2)</p>

<p>DR. MEAD: Why don't you sit here, Bob? This is Dr. Whitaker.</p>

<p>(inaudible at 0:05:18.8)</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: Dr. Mead (sp?) has just been telling us something about all the hell you have been going through. I want you to know also we have a recorder going. Anything you say we will (ph) use against you I am sure. You have been sitting (ph) enough of this, so I suspect you know of something or what we are up to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not exactly. I am not entirely sure. I do not know anything.</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: Well, I figure we will probably have about half an hour and I would like to see if somehow it can be useful to you. I would like to figure out some way that we can add one more ounce to the struggle you are in so that you can have a little more strength, cut your throat a little more effectively, one or the other. [0:06:08.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know that I have accused anyone of that ever.</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: What doctor told us, you find a way to fuck things up easy and often and thoroughly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not intentionally.</p>

<p>DR. WHITAKER: Oh, well, I am not accusing you of doing it on purpose. God knows nobody wants to suffer that way just deliberately, but apparently you do not even have to decide to; you do it automatically, sort of, efficiently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if this is any desire to be — to give me added strength, it would — for my benefit, I am curious myself; then I will just put a — as to what my role in this is to be� I mean just here what I have� If you are interested in what my goals are or — I am a little overwhelmed by the�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do not blame you for being scared. I am scared too, because we are both on the spot. But I learned a long time ago that being on the spot sometimes helps to get you something, as well as scaring the hell out of you. [0:07:31.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I won't be scared. I am a little nervous is all I am. I feel as — ridiculous (inaudible at 0:07:42.8) or something. I feel that I apparently achieved that, hadn't I?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: How do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not being sarcastic I hope. It is just that this is — I do not see that — this is nothing reasonable for someone to lay on (ph). It is a rather grandiose something, I mean what it is gravitating towards. But I was told once that my writing was grandiose grandiloquence gravitating towards gobbledygook, and I hope it is still�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: This looks like the gobbledygook part, huh? Well, you ought know, or I guess maybe I should tell you. We have motives of our own. I am trying to see if I can show them what I think of as my method or my hope of being useful to you. And I am in hopes that the whole group of us will have an experience in how to help people that will be worth something to us. So I am not just (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel well.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (Crosstalk) me and I am interested in these guys. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel well. I do not feel ill. I just feel rather locked up and under supervision, under a strong (inaudible at 0:08:52.6).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: As far as I am concerned, from the story we heard and as far as we heard about you in the four or five minutes that the doctor talked about it, you have proven your capacity to cut your throat often enough. So you ought to be thoroughly convinced by now that you are not to be trusted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you believe that? I am not to be trusted? [0:09:12.1]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Do you trust yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am gaining this ability, much more.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Good Lord.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good Lord.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You failed, what, 15 times? Is nine times an effort to get an education, suicide attempts, one hospitalization?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I actually intend to, I think I would have succeeded in (inaudible at 0:09:33.7) attempted suicide.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Almost succeeded without attempting; how about that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have been (inaudible at 0:09:39.3), yes, I believe that.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Do you still feel suicidal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am good.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Had it ever occurred to you to not trust yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. That period of my life has been where I felt that I was not capable of thinking clearly in a given situation, quite often, so there was no solution for me to (inaudible at 0:10:15.5).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I guess I was suggesting the same thing may be true of your overall living process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I would not think that I was that ignorant of the rules and regulations of society. I think that I have not — I have no (crosstalk).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I do not know about society; I am talking about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I am less interested in the rules and regulations of society. It seems to me that you are the one who has beaten yourself down in so many ways. How can we help you with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am attempting to help myself already, I think. [0:11:07.2]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Do you think maybe that is one of your problems?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know that my problems are [so real] (ph) and now perhaps I am being more of a problem to you than I realize that I was being because of this meeting.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, it can make you more of a problem to me. You won't become a problem to me if I think I can help you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What would you suggest them doing, anyway (ph). I do not know just exactly what I could� I still have hopes of one day getting through college and then having a stable job that I am enjoying doing and that I would be qualified to perform. I do not know just what that is yet.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I saw nothing in what doctor told us that would indicate that you did not have what it took. Just you cannot use what you have. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You make it sound easy. The question of why, I mean I do not even want to know why actually but�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I do not care why either, as long as you can stop it. [0:12:19.5] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Stop what?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Cutting your throat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have not been, I do not believe, in the last few weeks that I have all. In fact, since the school started I have not been doing any of my own throat cutting I do not think. I do not think my throat has been cut actually, except that I have cutting — nervous and I have required a hospitalization for a temporary� But that does not mean that I — from hospitalization, that this is a suicide attempt or a complete withdrawal from the problems of society. I still would like to become more into the point where I was able to study and get through it with what was required, the curriculum. [0:13:05.4] </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I have a feeling you are pulling my leg.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: But you knew I was talking about symbolically cutting your throat. I was not talking about actually cutting your throat. I was talking about the way you screw yourself up. How can we help you with it? And it sounds from what you have been saying that the way we could help you would be to help you get more desperate about it. It sounds like you are sort of making believe it does not happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I am able to distinguish reality when I see it.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: To me, you cut yourself when you cut yourself in the hospital.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I had that feeling too, because nothing is being resolved apparently by my being here.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, at least we got that much together; that you cut your throat and cut yourself in the hospital, now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the fact is that I was somehow unable to control it by myself. Why this was, I do not know.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, maybe this is what you said a few minutes ago, when you said you were trying to help yourself. Do you think that may be a mistake? [0:14:07.7] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that depends on just what it is going to lead to. I hope it has not been a mistake so far.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: What I heard you mean when you said you were trying to help yourself was that you were trying to help yourself and keep everybody else out of the helping process, like you are trying to keep me out now. You want to know how much you are keeping me out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know that I am, but if I am (inaudible at 0:14:39.0). </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Feel my palm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Warm? </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Try the other one.</p>

<p>RESPDENT: They are both warm.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: They are wet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They are wet.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You feel the wet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Define (ph) it that way in some cases. I do not know exactly what that is, why.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I know why.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I see emotional problems that bring on sweat. I have never been able to define this exactly so that I could distinguish when one is in fear or what the emotion (inaudible at 0:15:00.5).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I know what it is to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I recognize anger when I am confronted with it. I recognize discipline. I recognize authority.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You want to know what it is to me, why I am sweating? [0:15:11.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can guess, but I would not want to be so gullible as to think that it is true that I was� I am appreciative if (inaudible at 0:15:28.3), this is one of them, but I would not know just exactly how to do�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I told you that was not true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that was not? (Crosstalk)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (Crosstalk) ourselves. I am the most important person in the world to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have that feeling.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: My basic interest is in me, but I am also here to help you. But that is not why I am sweating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I would guess — you want me to guess what I might think that you are sweating?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The men that are right now in Tomah, the V.A. hospital that there is a possibility that I may become, being and realizing that these men are there in the condition they are in I think would be enough to make any intelligent man sweat as far as the problems of society, the fact that this place is in existence. I do not know. Maybe this is just one� [0:16:14.1]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do not give a shit about (inaudible at 0:16:14.7) people in the hospital.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: The problems I got right here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um—hmm, your own position.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think I am sweating because I would like to make some sort of contact with you here [me out] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: With what type of handshake are� With a handshake or what type of relationship are you struggling for with me for your own benefit? [0:17:10.2]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I will tell you. A some sort of warmth between us, some sort of contact, some sort of feeling that we are together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Quite convince] (ph) me, huh?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, I am sure enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I still believe you are sticking with that statement you made, that you are trying to help yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: True. I very much almost to get out of this situation, so it is a little�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Okay. But all I hear is the other half of that: �I am trying to help myself and I do not give a damn who else tries; I am not letting them have any part of it.� That leaves me out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish I was capable of saying that, but I am not in a position right now so�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, I think you say it very well. You do not put it in words, but that is what I hear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this does not mean that I am merely a clutching and grasping individual. It would mean that I would want these — initially we all want points of control so that we govern what little world we do find ourselves in. [0:18:05.8]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: That is what I am talking about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:18:10.6).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You can never get to be a clutching, grasping individual you may get to know. As long as you are trying to be this self—sacrificial</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I do not think so.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Unselfish character, you are going to fail time after time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not sure I understand then.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, let me tell you real clear. You have tried to live your own life and you have fucked it up time after time after time, and you are still trying to keep everybody else out of it. </p>

<p>I just had a fantasy. Do you know what a fantasy is? The fantasy I had was wouldn't it be wonderful if you and I could cry together before the end of this half hour? [0:19:05.5] </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not if you know the tricks of emotions enough to be able to bring this about.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, I cannot do it alone; I am damn sure of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I can be made to cry, I am sure, very easily.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: There you go again. Did you hear what you said? You have cut me completely out of it. Now we are talking about our time together and you flip it so that you are (crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I would rather if it was possible be able to laugh together at this (ph) — I wish if I had the choice of two emotions, I would choose laughter before I would choose tears.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, to me any laughter in this place would be just plain (inaudible at 0:19:46.7). </p>

<p>PATIENT: It would not.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do not see anything funny about anything you are presenting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not want to be funny. As I say, [sublimination is the finer ridiculousness can reach] (ph). And I am sorry, but I do not know how (inaudible at 0:20:00.7) any more. I was brought — I came here in good faith I think and I came to school in good faith, but I was having difficulty acquiring the right to be — perhaps I did not study as hard as I should. Perhaps I studied as hard as I was able. I think I did — I had other problems that I thought I could also help myself with so that I would be a stronger, more independent individual. [0:20:22.7]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Do you think there is any of those other problems that we could be any help?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I have succeeded to a certain extent.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: In keeping everybody out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are some problems that I feel could be left in the background if possible.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: So they will help you fail again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not suicide; [I won] (ph). </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I mean you think keeping something in the background is a way of solving it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I honestly do not know. There is something that is not satisfactory and I have a feeling it is me. But what I should do, to what extent I should act or — and what is the word, emulate or emote or — what I should be feeling other than I am being watched right by a variety of people who are all I am sure very intelligent and qualified people and yet I�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I suspect�</p>

<p>PATIENT: True, I may be defending myself, but I am not sure what I am defending myself from or for other than my own self, actually, but why I am under this stress other than — but it would be helpful. I do not know. </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Want me to tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Because you think you are not worth shit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. I feel a little more like Li'l Abner than anyone else this morning. I feel like I am in the Rocky Mountains of Tennessee somehow and that this is a fantasy suddenly, but I do not even know what�. [0:22:25.1]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Do you carry any burden?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nope. I do not know. I do not know. I am trying�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Where are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am trying to reach what you are thinking and I do not know.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Are you — top of a mountain, or down at the bottom?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Preferably [Deena Valley] (ph) looking up over the horizons, yes.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Is there snow on top of the mountains?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. This it is the Tennessee Mountains. Perhaps I have been living in Tennessee for so long that when I get in reality it is a little hard — I do not know what the immediate problem is, what actions I should be taking here. [0:23:01.4]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: What is the surrounding?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:23:04.9) exactly like this before. Huh?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Where is this territory where you are standing in? Trees around you, or lake?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sorry. Early in the morning and I am looking over these Smoky Mountains in (inaudible at 0:23:15.0) and Tennessee.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Is there anybody with you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: There was not (inaudible at 0:23:22.1) moment of fantasy I would wish there were.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Can you bring the fantasy back again and look around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can bring it back around. It is a picture of (inaudible at 0:23:30.5).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Can you see all around? Dick (ph), can you see me there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are we there? I can see you there. I see�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Can you see me there now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: In your mind's eye?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind's eye.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: How am I dressed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Similarly to the way you are dressed right now. In fact, you are sitting on this rock halfway down (ph). I am guessing maybe about either [a mile or three feet away] (ph).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (inaudible at 0:23:55.8). Can you get me down where you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know. It is almost amusing, watching you sit there, actually. And this is not meant as sarcasm. In the fantasy, that is the way it is.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I am right (ph) with you. Can you holler to me and call me down or get a hold of my foot and pull me down? [0:24:10.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would just as soon get on my horse and go out of the valley and remember it as (crosstalk).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Shit. I am not satisfied with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: How about getting me down off that damn rock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:24:24.3)?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I would like to, but it is your fantasy and I cannot get in. I can only hope you will do something about me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I wave hello before I ride off.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, do not do that. Call me and see if you cannot get me out, down. I would like to. (inaudible at 0:24:48.6) mountain.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is fantasy, this is not real situations.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It is fantasy, go ahead. [0:25:01.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not a fantastic [vision of health] (ph). </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I like fantasy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoy it.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I enjoy being with somebody�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it is difficult just to distinguish just what is fantasy and what is real (inaudible at 0:25:12.8).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Am I still on the rock?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you are down, wandering around in different (inaudible at 0:25:18.5), flipping cigarettes and not giving a damn about anything. You are just sort of walking in circles.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: What are you doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am sitting here just watching you.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Why don't you take a hold of my hand and let us see if we cannot get together? What do you want to do in the fantasy? Do you have some�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Doctor (inaudible at 0:25:46.8), what I should do and what would be the wisest action — and I have been living in myself is all. </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Shit. Do I have a horse?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I did not picture you on (ph) one. You may have one if you wish.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: All right, no, you said you had one and you are going to ride off on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It does not matter because they are horses, they are not men (ph). A car or whatever means of transportation (inaudible at 0:26:05.4).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (Crosstalk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have visions of these Rocky Mountains in Tennessee now that I seem to be staying with.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Can you see the horse that you are going to ride off on, or is it just fear (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can bring it back as orderly as well.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Or no? Can you and I get on horses and various — ride along with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Are we any closer together, or am I still wandering around in different�</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you were getting somewhere. I do not know just exactly what our destination is, but we are definitely on the same road and in some direction.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Going up the side of the mountain or�</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, we are going down the valley or up the side; we can change the direction at any time we will it. </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, why don't you take charge of where we go and let me know how it is coming?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not sure how to (inaudible at 0:26:54.9).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I do not feel it.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Your past (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: My fantasy.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: We have gone to your house, and I go into mine. [0:27:03.4]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You will do it every time when we are together, and I do not like that. I am glad to go to your house or I am glad to have you and I go to my house. I want us to go together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel as though I am being annoyed, persecuted�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: No, you are not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a little bit.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I am persecuting you on purpose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, I am — I just do not want it to get so ridiculous that (inaudible at 0:27:34.6).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do want you to go out of here feeling like a dope. I mean if it helps you feel better, you can feel as horrible as you want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel well. I feel very well.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think you are lying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My difficulty — my difficulty — I do feel well. </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think you are lying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am not lying. I do not lie.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel well except that I have these social problems that are dealing with some grades and they are dealing with what I have to do and to meet requirements and my inability to make these requirements and the question of my own life, what to do with it. [0:28:03.1]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: They are a lie. They are a lie. You believe that, it is just a goddamn lie.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a lie, huh?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It is time you quit feeding yourself that kind of gobbledygook.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You would suggest (inaudible at 0:28:20.0) and perhaps you will be (inaudible at 0:28:21.5).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Yes, I am very concerned. What are we going to do on these two horses? Where are we going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, we are just enjoying the fresh air.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Wonderful, sounds marvelous. How about lunch? Have we got some food with us?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Can we stop and have lunch?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You have corn (ph) with me in your saddlebag?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I left it at home.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (inaudible at 0:28:53.7). I think we can look through my saddlebag; there might be some in there. Hmm. I have a fantasy that I looked through my saddlebag and I found a whole box of cigars. Do you like cigars? [0:29:18.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not particularly (inaudible at 0:29:20.5).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (inaudible at 0:29:21.9) expensive cigar.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it feels like I am being observed. I do not know if this is really what I should do at this� I would like to apologize and beat out the door quietly if this would be permissible, go back to the room (ph) now.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I think you ought to be proud as hell of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Let us talk about defense (ph), can we?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The Tennessee Mountains?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Because I have the feeling your fantasy tells you something about yourself that is very important to know. You know how hard I had to fight to get down off that rock and how much you wanted to ride away on that horse and leave me there and just keep me a memory? Remember that? [0:30:34.4] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Now, I think that is the way your entire life works. I think fantasies are a secret way of finding out what kind of a guy you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: On a self—contained individual, biologically as well as perhaps psychologically�.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Geez. Goddamn this mistake that you ever made. Just because you got screwed up in your initial effort to grasp, when your mother or father or whoever it was, there is no reason you will always fail when you try to be grasping. Sometime if you find somebody worthwhile you can grasp and get what you want. [0:31:17.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I did not have these folks (ph) so I do not (inaudible at 0:31:19.2)..</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I enjoyed this fantasy. I am sweating with my palms, the coldness and the chilliness that I had feeling inside of me has gone away. I did not like being on the rock; it was lonesome up there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, perhaps (ph).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I want you to take another feel (ph). You want to know about it? [0:32:24.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? I have noticed that (inaudible at 0:32:28.9).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: (inaudible at 0:32:29.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:32:36.7)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, I sure am, and I enjoy it. See, this time you were on the rock. I asked you if you wanted to know what my feelings were, and you said, �Go to hell.�</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not recall using those words.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, you did use those words. You said it so much last year. You said, �If I wish.�</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not pretending to be in control of myself in society. I am not — I do not — I do not believe there are too many of the laws of society that I� [0:33:19.2]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Yes. I am saying you cut me off again you see, you kicked me out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not entirely indifferent to environmental conditions versus�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: But if I say I have a feeling about you, do you want to know about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it might be helpful, yes. I assume that I know of�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I like that. I am satisfied with that. Now, the feeling was one of sudden regret that I would not be able to go on seeing you again and again; that I would like to continue this battle and I just feel that you are worth something. [0:34:00.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it so evident that I am not obviously or something or another�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I enjoy it. Not only that you want [but apply] (ph). You are just scared to death to be selfish. I think if I could get you day after day, maybe you could learn after a while to be grasping of me and I think that would be exciting.</p>

<p>I just had another feel (ph). Because I wondered around the campus during the day I had looked forward to the hour when I was going to come over and see you. [0:35:13.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is this true? This is true?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do not know if it is true or not. It depends. I suspect I would get mad as hell at you. You turn me down all the time. Why would you turn me on today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it is — I am turning anyone down that I am aware of. I have one thing in the back of my mind and that is — although it is not that strong, but I am not particularly desire to return to this veteran's hospital in Tomah. In fact, I would very much like not to go there.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: All right. So I do not doubt (inaudible at 0:36:01.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I certainly do myself. If no one has to (inaudible at 0:36:04.4).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I tell you what it is going to take. You are going to have to take all the guts you have and be grasping or you are going to be back in that goddamn hospital every so often for the rest of your life. This is life and death stuff you are fooling around with. This is not just studying or talking to somebody. [0:36:27.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I believe I am aware of that, I think.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: If you ride off on that damn horse all by yourself you are going to be back in the hospital.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What should I say? I will try not to do it any more, or what? I feel totally incapable of�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Only for another minute. Want me to tell you something about yourself? You want to know something about how people work in their guts? I said a half an hour. When you turned to him, adding (ph) almost within the second of a half an hour.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do (inaudible at 0:37:22.4). I hope that I am (inaudible at 0:37:26.1).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I hope you felt it (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: [I will gladly] (ph).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Bye. [0:37:33.2]</p>

<p>END OF SESSION</p>

<p>BEGIN DISCUSSION</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Want to record our discussion, too? (inaudible at 0:37:56.2). Hard work.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I guess more than one person has sweaty palms.</p>

<p>(Chuckling)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Did he have tears in his eyes when he left?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: No, that was [Donald H] (ph). [0:38:12.3]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I was aware of Tuesday night.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: His got red.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: That poor bastard. Jesus Christ, is he suffering. But the way he is reaching out, isn't that something, that fantasy? That took some real guts to tear that out of the gambling (ph) side. Could you see yourself in the fantasy? I could see the tree. I had a stream� The one right along, while we were riding on the side of this stream. Difficult (inaudible at 0:39:17.8) valley. The valley was all covered with grass in spite of all the trees. This probably is not true in reality. His horse was brown, (crosstalk) brown [0:39:33.6].</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: It was white.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It was white. Good for you. I think did it for me being on a rock, three foot up. Or what was the other — quarter mile?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Quarter mile.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (inaudible at 0:39:44.8)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I think that probably did more to bring me in.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (inaudible at 0:39:59.1)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: No, I thought he was calling me on my partial relationship to him and partial relationship to the group and to my own professional assumptions. And him calling me was saying, in effect, that you have what it takes to get off your goddamn isolation and get down where other people are. [0:40:29.6]</p>

<p>And one impulse I did not express; when he said Rocky Mountains of Tennessee, but at that (inaudible at 0:40:56.6) I was close to comment in a hurry on that one. The Rocky Mountains are not in Tennessee, you know. I was tempted, and I think if it would have been other than the first interview I would probably have called that crazy. I would say, �Jesus Christ, man, that is crazy as hell. Make up your mind. Are you in the Rocky Mountains or are you in Tennessee Mountains?� [0:41:20.1]</p>

<p>The other impulse was to take off my shoes. In Tennessee (inaudible at 0:41:27.7). And had we been (inaudible at 0:41:34.5) I would have done it I guess (ph).</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Could you give us some terms that you would use to describing (inaudible at 0:41:47.8)? </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: In the beginning?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Well, actually probably the middle.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: You mean the fantasy part?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes, when you are trying to be what his fantasy is.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: There were a lot of times it seemed (inaudible at 0:42:01.7).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, now, in the fantasy thing I was so very deliberate. The question of how I was dressed, and frequently I pushed that a lot. If I had some fantasy along with it, I may even argue with him; of a fantasy, not overall. And high boots. I gave him my fantasy; not deny his, but tell him that I had a fantasy that I was dressed in it and that�. Or push the fantasy did I have a pack on my bag, did he have a pack on his back? [0:42:40.9]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes. I guess what I am�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I am helping reality into the fantasy so that he knows that I respect it; that I do not think of him as having a crazier experience than me, looking at it, me up on the rock.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Why did you pick the cigars? </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: This is my fantasy. See, he was (inaudible at 0:43:07.2) and I (inaudible at 0:43:07.3). And he did not apparently do it. And all of a sudden I had this fantasy with a box of cigars. And I do not have a box of cigars; it is not a reality thing. I like cigars, but I do not go ahead and buy them. If we had more time I might have pushed for reality in the lunch. [0:43:36.3]</p>

<p>FEMALE SPEAKER: It is not clear to me what you mean by �pushed for reality in the lunch.�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: When you start a fantasy like this they think of it as something that no one else can participate in. Nobody can participate in any of the things [a lot] (ph) according to him. You know, he just takes a glance at it and rides off. And I forced myself into the fantasy. Now, sometimes you cannot get in, and then I spend five, ten minutes saying, �Will you look behind the tree? Maybe I am hiding behind the tree.� Or, �If you turn around maybe I am behind you.� Or, �If you will call to me maybe I will come from wherever it is I am hiding or wherever it is I am away.� [0:44:35.4]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: It just does not seem as (inaudible at 0:44:39.1).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, he went in and out of it, you see, in the beginning. He started the fantasy and then he said, �Oh—oh, he will think I am crazy.� So he stopped it. Then I pushed him back into it and forced him to bring me in as a way of showing him that I respect his fantasy. I think of it as just like a dream. You can let it go, or you can work at it for weeks. And when it is conjoint this way, to me, my temptation is to want to be with it; I like it. [0:45:28.1]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Well, it seemed as far as that part goes, it is probably — the first part is picking up on it. It is going to (inaudible at 0:45:34.6) and then thereby encouraging him to feel it more to bring it out. That is what it seemed. But it seemed that many times you were trying to inject elements of your own into it. You push them too forcefully without being with him.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Um—hmm.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (inaudible at 0:45:51.3) bringing him in.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: But they did ride off together. Do you think that he did not really feel that and riding off together is just a PATIENT (ph) then trying to discredit and, let's say, �Okay, you pushed me, now get off my back now,� or �We are going down a trail together�?</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: They could not (inaudible at 0:46:13.9)</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: This is what you are kind of hinting at I feel, but I do not know, whether how he really felt. [0:46:21.2]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I do not know either. My own feeling is that if he had just been trying to get me out of the way by this, he would not have agreed to stop for lunch. He would have bypassed the question of the cigars instead of hearing it.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I had a feeling that he was riding back on the road (inaudible at 0:46:52.7).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I felt that — interestingly, I could not see my own horse in terms of color or anything else.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (inaudible at 0:47:02.0) the same horse. I have wondered why you are riding two horses.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I attempted to say that and then somehow or another felt it was incongruous, homosexual panicking. For some reason, I took it out; I thought of it. And it may have been what I was saying when I said I could not see my horse. My initial fantasy and my continued fantasy was that there was not another horse; that that was my fantasy and I just did not force it. [0:47:31.9]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I felt there was a moment of truth or reality around midway through the fantasy, when he had moved out of the fantasy and you were asking him about it and he says about the mountains or — as though he really had accepted your interest in his fantasy and admitted it. And then I think the latter half he was — you were quite involved in his fantasy and you — it touched you on more of a reality level. [0:48:01.8]</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It would be interesting to know whether the fantasy disappeared for him. Sometimes patients all of a sudden lose it; it is just completely gone, I cannot see it any more. With him I had the feeling that he was suddenly aware of the group, which may have been the same thing; I did not question him to find out.</p>

<p>Now, the words and the experiences of the fantasy I would now use as part of our secret communication from now on out; the riding off on his horse and just remembering me on the rock I would haunt him with. Boy, I doubt if there would be an interview for some time that I did not call him on trying this again. �There you go off on your damn horse again.� Because I think of this as something that is now — he is stuck with. This is his and mine. And this kind of maneuver he can handle a lot better than he can the maneuver of, say, �I will be glad to hear your feeling about me if you want to tell me.� That is the same thing, but that is in a reality framework that I would assume would be where we would get six months from now if we met once a week. [0:49:33.7]</p>

<p>FEMALE SPEAKER: I have a strong wish and we are going to be here, too.</p>

<p>(Chuckling)</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: He is a real challenge. There is plenty (ph) you have to work with.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: When you called him on the meaning of throat cutting, were you sure that he was interpreting it correctly or were you just�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Oh, shit, yes. Oh, no, hell, that is — bells (ph). He was just (inaudible at 0:50:00.8) all hell. [0:50:07.3] </p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: But what if fantasy came up? You shared a fantasy with him. Can you use this� I forgot which one it was, but I remember you sharing the fantasy with him before he ever started having fantasies. Wonder what — is this something you use or whether it just happened or you used�</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: No, I think of that as the content. �Hey, we kind of left you in a corner.�</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: (inaudible at 0:50:36.7) the [open ward will just have to do] (ph).</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, I think though this has the — as maybe one of the real things that I would do. I would push this guy to face his horrible sense of fatalism. He used the word once and I apparently was scared (ph) to pick it up. [0:51:10.4]</p>

<p>I was just telling, if I went on, I would use the words of the fantasy and the pictures of the fantasy every time I found anything in reality that seemed like a (inaudible at 0:51:23.6). And I take this word — there were three words he used: Grasping, clutching� There was another one that I really locked and lost right off.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Was it snitch (ph)?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Might have been. Something happened to me at that point so I did not recall it. And the grasping was the one that I heard, because I immediately conceived of a baby hanging onto the breast, because that was not a fantasy, that was a conception of grasping to me. Yes, I try to share any fantasy I can. [0:52:14.7]</p>

<p>Now, back up a bit. With a psychotic, where it is clinically appropriate where the neurotic — that is given an ordinary neurotic, if I had a fantasy of going to bed with her in the first interview, I am not going to bring it up. I am going to have to use some sort of glitch. And many times with fantasies which are unacceptable socially, like this, you can allude to them in a socially acceptable manner. You know, �I like the way you are dressed today.� �You seem prettier than your hairdo� means I am sexually interested, but means in the social framework cannot be quoted, and you can really develop trouble. [0:53:21.5]</p>

<p>One day many years ago it was kind of a little more open then. And that afternoon the patient who was an old frock (ph) showed up with her brother who is a policeman. She had told him about this and he was hell—bent to do something about her right off. So one learns with these kind of experiences how to be adroit. </p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: I had an experience during the fantasy that you were sharing. And I do not know where I was, but I was looking at all this and I was feeling this tension and the nerves, trying to get off and get closer to him. But pretty soon, I had to pull out. First I could not discover where, so I do not know where I was looking (inaudible at 0:54:29.1), but I had to pull out of it so I could get a dispassionate view. And I am wondering, although we will try to deliver it, how involved can you get? [0:54:43.7] </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: There is a point, and I think you have to trust just what you did. You have to trust the fact that there comes a point where you have to pull out. I think my point a lot farther along now than it was 15, 20 years ago. And I think part of that had to do with multiple therapy, free (ph) by the fact that there was someone else there who would function as a reality anchor for him and for me. [0:55:18.4] </p>

<p>But I think when you do pull out, you ought to tell him that, because if you can tell him that you failed, you can admit your impotence, then you at least have a common ground in that, because he is struggling with his impotence all the time. I mean give him the chance to accept the fact that you are not — he was endlessly being apologetic about the fact that all of us are super—duper people. I started to say at one point we have all suffered, too and somehow stopped it; I do not know why. Maybe I did not feel I knew him that well or maybe I was not willing to admit it to him. I do not know. [0:56:21.5]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: A few minutes of your prefatory remarks about yourself being selfish and uninterested in myself (ph); personally, is this a routine, opening (inaudible at 0:56:34.2)?</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: Well, if I get any feeling that he is either making believe that I am just as interested in him or is calling me on the fact that I am not really interested in him, in either case.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: It is pretty often the case.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It is true. It is a biological fact. I am in a complete world of my own and I am interested in me more than I am in anybody else or everybody else. And it is one of the facts of life that he needs to face it by himself.</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: Yes, especially true.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: It is part of his grasping. I told him I was grasping, too. [0:57:15.0]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: So I think that would be a good thing to start out with. </p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: I, years ago, set up 14 things to accomplish in the first interview and lost the list, thank God, but I am entirely careful. My deliberate formulation of this is that I want never to say the same thing the same way twice. Now, it is a wonderful fantasy, you know; I am sure it is not true. But I think of anything that becomes stereotyped would be losing feeling. In fact, the patient says, �Will you say that again?� I would never say it again, or almost never. I never would, or with a long—term patient I have been seeing for a long time can I accept it as a reality. </p>

<p>But ordinarily I think of this as a way of deperfecting (ph) what has been said. Because if I have to say it the second time, I am not in it. Then they firm their suspicions or their fear, their fear that this is real feeling. So they want me to help them deperfect (ph) it or their suspicion that it is not real feeling. So when I say it again, they say, �Hey, [this is what it is all about].� [0:58:50.6]</p>

<p>MALE SPEAKER: If you see a patient on an outpatient basis, it then comes to the same thing.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: No. I used to — now I start out with as much more reality—organized [discover your] (ph) situation. First interview is with a member of the family, never alone, or like (inaudible at 0:59:29.8). And if you are taking — first usually I start out with a history from the family member, saying that we do not know it as well as he does. This is how we see it from the outside; why don't you tell us what gives, what you are here for, and what — tell us what this is all about, what is he up to, where have you been, and I take notes. And then the second interview — and then I give the patient a chance to confirm, deny, amplify, et cetera. [1:00:04.7]</p>

<p>And then the second interview is with a colleague (inaudible at 1:00:08.1) first. Then when the colleague comes in, I do pretty much what you did; I review it. I had it with a family member and you (ph), plus some of my impressions. I felt mother was more interested; she wanted him to have some help, but she was scared and she was guilty and she was afraid to be honest about it and she does not trust doctors. This kind of summary. </p>

<p>Then the second — the colleague then takes up the question and I take notes for the rest of the period. And then assuming we have gotten enough admission to do, we are going to — all detail (ph), we, the two of us, staff it then. </p>

<p>One of the really fascinating things about this is that over the years — and we have been doing this now routinely for five, six years anyway — the initial therapist, initial person who the patient was referred, will sit through this staff meeting and not say a damn thing. And it is amazing. I will sit there and write what the other guy says time after time after time and will have the feeling that I just cannot disagree; it is almost outside of me and almost repeating what I — I cannot even think, really. And if I go to his office — just for the second, maybe it would be sad (ph) actually if the same thing happened to him. He takes notes and I formulate them. [1:02:02.5]</p>

<p>END DISCUSSION</p>

<p>FOLLOW—UP INTERVIEW WITH THERAPIST</p>

<p>ANNOUNCER: This ends the recorded portion of the original interview and discussion. What follows is a discussion of the interview by Dr. Whitaker recorded in Atlanta sometime after the interview took place.</p>

<p>DR.  WHITAKER: In our reviewing the tape, we decided that there were two possible titles for it. One would be rather academic, but might be, quote, what sort of relationship are you struggling for? Or, are you out for your own benefit? And the second, title would be more dynamic and more significant of what went on with the relationship and might be, quote, if it were possible for us to laugh together... It seems that this interview in review contains much more teaching than is usual in our interviews, but that essentially I was offering to get together with the patient on the basis of crying with him and he was suggesting that we could get together on the basis of laughing together. This I was not able to accept. Probably he picked this up very nicely when he talked about gobbledygook. He was indicating his perception of my grandiosity; that I was not able to be facetious, light, and casual in relating to him, and he may be right that that would have been more effective. [1:04:45.5] </p>

<p>Another point in the interview, the patient said that my sweaty palms were due to my anger, and I missed the chance to get together with him by accepting this since it was probably true. And he made another try, saying that I was sweating about the problems of society, thus contacting my grandiosity again. [1:05:27.8]</p>

<p>In an overview of the interview it is probably wise to realize that the interview began through a double—door entrance and we left the interview in the same kind of two—stage move. I miss the end of the first interview and went on for a kind of second interview until we were forced into an administrative type of ending, this again having to do with my own emotional involvement with the patient so that when he was ready to leave the first time I was not ready to let him go. [1:06:21.1]</p>

<p>In the final administrative ending, it was based on time. The previous one was at the time when the patient turned to face the resident, as though indicating that he was ready to go back to his real life.</p>

<p>We are convinced that the early stage of the interview is a process of setting things for the continuing relationship; in this case, the therapist charged the patient with responsibility for himself. [1:07:02.0]</p>

<p>And simultaneously, the therapist assumed responsibility for his own failure in the interview, setting the situation so that the patient would not be responsible for the interview in its entirety. This enabled the patient to feel somewhat more free to move into the interview since he was not fully responsible for it.</p>

<p>I would not like to make a comprehensive review of the interview but merely point out some of the details that seemed significant. One of the most obvious is that the therapist was able to contact the patient mainly in reference to the paranoid part of his sickness, utilizing the homosexual relationship between them as a way to get at this. [1:08:40.0]</p>

<p>For example, the therapist invited the patient to, quote, get him down off the rock, a pretty homosexual invitation, and indicated at another point that he, quote, was not satisfied. Simultaneously, the therapist missed an opportunity for a further homosexual togetherness, probably because of some panic in himself, when he denied an impulse within himself to ride on the same horse with the patient. It is also possible that he was reflecting the homosexual panic of the group as a hole. That is H—O—L—E in case you missed it. [1:09:50.2]</p>

<p>The catatonic contact with the patient was activated by way of the pursing. This is probably not the best way, but it is the one which is available to this therapist. The obscene or off—the—scene words in the doctor—patient relationship are related to that in each of them which is not available in the social relating that is possible on the outside. There was also an effort on the part of the therapist to relate to the catatonic part in his return to the patient's use of a secret meaning in the word �grasping.� [1:10:59.6]</p>

<p>As the relationship moved past the sexual area and into a more significant layer, the second long silence is probably related to the patient's sense of the therapist as a lonesome person. It was at this point that the therapist accepted the fact that he was more interested in himself and more important to himself than anyone else was to him. And this made it possible for the patient to acknowledge that he had some things that he himself felt he could do about himself. [1:12:19.1]</p>

<p>It is probable that this acknowledgment on the part of the therapist, of his being a separate person more important to himself than the patient was to him, that made the patient feel that he had gotten something from the interview and led the therapist to acknowledge the possibility that he would like to go on seeing this patient if it were feasible. [1:13:15.4]</p>

<p>They then returned to talk about the social structure, indicating the end of the interview. The therapist then was free also to acknowledge that the repeated interviews would have been for his own benefit, not just for the patient's.</p>

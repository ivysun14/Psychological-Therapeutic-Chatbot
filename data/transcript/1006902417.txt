<p><b>Jon Carlson Interview Regarding Client GH</b></p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> I use an integrative approach to helping based upon the theory of Alfred Adler’s Individual Psychology. These theoretical ideas allow me to focus on the strengths of each client and to help them to develop the courage needed to bring more satisfaction into their lives. I often find myself helping the client or giving permission to the client to continue to do the types of things they are already doing. This often involves helping the client become more present and aware of what they are doing, thinking and feeling. I place a premium on satisfying relationships especially with the key people in the client’s life.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Will you provide a brief description of your training and background? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> My formal education includes two earned doctoral degrees. One degree was in counseling and the other in clinical psychology. I also have a Certificate in Psychotherapy which is the Adlerian equivalent of psychoanalytic training. My informal training comes from developing over 300 training tapes with the leading psychotherapists where they worked live with actual clients. By watching and discussing the multiple sessions that each expert conducted I was able to indirectly hone my own skills in assessment and intervention.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The client began treatment when he was separated from his wife and children. He is 41 years old and indicated that he and his wife (33) had previously divorced and remarried and now they were talking about reconciling. The couple has two children together and his wife has two children from different relationships. A big issue seems to be that he treats her children differently than their children. She had one child prior to their first marriage and the other while they were apart before marrying the second time. All the children see him as their father and her children have had no contact with their birth fathers. Another big problem seems to be his work hours. He works as a custodian in the local public schools. The couple seemed to get along when he worked days at the elementary school however has problems when he was forced to switch to the high school and work evenings. He has just transferred back the elementary school and feels less stressed.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  What was your goal or hope for the sessions? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> To help the couple to reconcile and to understand what each partners role is in their marital unhappiness.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> Success comes in many packages for me. Therapy can be successful if I feel a collaborative relationship with the client. Sometimes I feel success when I help the client achieve a goal that they have set. While other times therapy is successful if I just honor and accept the client and their story. In this case both seem to like one another and want to learn how to reconcile and recreate a successful marriage and family life. Both felt powerless and need to be empowered to realize what they could do to create the type of marriage they both wanted. I felt very good to be able to spend the time talking with them about their marriage. Neither had anyone for support and found this contact invaluable.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> A breakthrough occurred when he learned that “her” children missed him and saw him as their father. He realized just how much he meant to the children and his wife. He decided to stop calling them his “step” children and now he calls all of them his “children.” She had not realized how important she was to him and how much he wanted to be with her. He had never made time to be along together and to go on dates showing her he enjoyed her company. He would tell her loved her but had not known that he also needed to show it in ways that had meaning for her.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The sessions took place in an outpatient mental health clinic in southern Wisconsin. He originally wanted help going through divorce although he wanted to be back with his family.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> I enjoyed being with people who genuinely appreciated therapy and the help and caring offered. Both had been raised in poverty both financial and emotional and although had hoped for more in their relationship with each other and their children did not know how to do it. Psychoeducation and relationship skill building was valuable to both.</p>

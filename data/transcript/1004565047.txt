<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So tell me what's been happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So actually a few hours later Sydney and I got back together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically he came to his senses because we were both so, so upset and we were both crying and stuff and I had gotten home and we had talked to each other on the phone a couple times that day and I had called him and he had called me. The reason why he broke up with me was because he (pause) was...he was stressed out in general and then he was also stressed out by the fact that he wasn't able to be a good boyfriend to me. Even if I were to lower my standards up to his standards too (pause) and he couldn't deal with that even though I was like, "I'm willing to support you and stuff. It's fine." But I also told him that if this was the way that he thought he was going to be able to be happy then (pause)... [00:01:08]</p>

<p>Especially because we were discussing that like once he got better if we were both single then we could get back together but I was like, "I have no clue how long that would be." He's been in therapy and is on medication and stuff but he hasn't gotten...he's still working on getting better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does this compare to his typical history of depression and anxiety? Has he gone through this before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think he's ever like...yeah he hasn't gone through this. This is a different kind of depression. He was depressed when he broke up with Laura and then he got through that but that was her breaking up with him and (pause) he's never had to deal with this before, especially because is was like...it wasn't because we weren't good for each other. It was because he wasn't in a place that he could deal with being in a relationship. And he realized that he didn't want to lose me and that he had made a mistake and we would both have to work hard and compromise but he thought that we could work out and that he wanted to be with me — if not forever — for a very long time. And I believed him because if I hadn't I wouldn't have gotten back together with him. [00:02:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling okay today. Yesterday I was feeling a little bit on edge. I spent the day over at Lucy's (inaudible) place and Lucy and I were knitting and stuff. I was a little bit worried that maybe he had changed his mind for the wrong reasons or something but (pause)...that it could happen again but (pause) he didn't and now I think everything is okay. I think it's just also that I didn't really have a chance to do much to distress.</p>

<p>I realize how I actually can take a bath in my bathtub. When I was living on the other side of the house that bathtub was like A — the shower is weird, that you take this thingy off the bottom and it turns it into a bath and the old side is broken and the tub is kind of disgusting but on this side I could have actually taken a bath to relax but never did and it was happening too fast and I didn't have time to get a little massage or anything else so I wasn't really doing anything to distress but I think getting sleep and stuff made it better. [00:03:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's a big up and down to go through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was. I wasn't mad at him when we broke up. I just felt really, really sad because it was for a good reason. It wasn't like he was being a jerk. He still loved me. I still love him and he was hurting just as much as I was. So he changed his mind, we got back together, I still wasn't mad at him for putting me through that because he had been thinking about it for a while so it sort of needed to come out anyways so...(pause) Yeah, so now I'm pretty much better. I've also only been up since 7:45.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There hasn't been a lot to the day yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) And this is my breakfast. (pause) Though we were thinking about possibly doing a session or two of couples therapy to figure out...like I guess, it's not like we're arguing with each other or anything. It's like...I guess we both know that this is going to be hard and take some compromise and if we're missing underlying issues or something like that. I was wondering if you did that at all or if you knew someone else who did. [00:05:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it depends really on what you want. I do work with couples. Because I've been seeing you for so long as an individual, if he wants to do ongoing couple therapy I would refer you to someone else so that you could be sort of starting with someone on even ground. If he wants to just do a couple sessions as a consultation then you could do that either with me, I'd be happy to do that, or if he'd be more comfortable you could check and see if his therapist would do a couple of sessions. So if you want a consultation, that's appropriate for me to step in and act as your therapist for that. If you think you want to do sort of more ongoing work then we'd work to get you hooked up with someone else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I think we were just saying a consultation or like a couple of sessions. I'll talk to him and ask him because when I asked him about it at first he was like really, really tired because it had been that night and (pause) so I'll ask him. (pause) I guess I could give you a heads up but then if he was up to it [I figured we could Monday's appointment] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah just e-mail me and let me know so I can be prepared, set up the chairs the right way, complicated stuff like that. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I will do that definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if he wants to come in Monday you can just e-mail me or leave me a message and let me know. No big deal. [00:06:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, because I figure it's probably a good idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it seems like you guys have been struggling a little bit, both with what are the appropriate expectations for you to have, for him to have, how do you make that work, and also we're compromising around some stuff that had come up earlier — money, and how often you like to go out and he likes to go out, and trying to find ways to compromise on things like that so that you both feel satisfied.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I'm so worried that his depression isn't going to...like he's been okay for the past few days and stuff and...because his depression definitely isn't as bad as it was a month ago or something but like his libido isn't back yet and he's sort of right now in more a (inaudible). He's starting to do things like his (pause)...I don't know if I told you he lives with passive aggressive roommates. [00:07:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I knew he...you had mentioned that he doesn't really get along very well with his roommates.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're kind of passive aggressive. So Crystal, who is the one who owns the apartment, told him a couple weeks ago that he had to move out by the beginning of...he was told at the beginning that he had two months because her boyfriend was going to move in and he was going to take that room. So Sydney has been finding places, looking online, and so now he's actually going onto Craigslist and looking at places and writing e-mails and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that might be a good change actually if he could find a place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well he kind of has to find a place but...and there's one that he's actually going to meet with them on Sunday evening. The thing is when he moved into this place he hadn't met his roommates ahead of time. So I guess one meeting isn't necessarily enough to know whether or not you'll truly get along but at least he can find out if they're super duper crazy or something. [00:08:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He can get a vibe at least. He can get a sense if it's going to be a horrible match probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so I think that like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long has he lived at his current place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's lived there since he's lived in the area which was I think since last July or something so he's at this point lived there almost a year. But yeah...it got a little bit better when...since he realized that he wasn't even eating dinner them often anyways. He took himself out of the cooking rotation so which meant he was also out of the dish rotation, because they have this weird system. They don't share food but they do like each person...they have nights that they make dinner so they make dinner, the leftovers belong to whoever made the dinner and also the dishes are done by the person who made dinner. So not having to do that...especially because part of it was his roommates would do...they would fill up the dishwasher and there might be space for one glass or something and they wouldn't run it. And then he was the only one who would run in and it's supposed to be whoever's job who ran the dishwasher to have to empty it out and people weren't emptying it out and putting dishes, if he had a couple dishes, they would put tons of dishes on top of his and expecting him to do all of the dishes and not just his dishes, which is really passive aggressive. [00:10:12]</p>

<p>Actually last night we stopped by his place to get some stuff and he also had to do some dishes because Crystal had e-mailed him about it and there was on the chair a bunch of dishes and half of them were his and half of them were other people's dishes. And also at that point in the dishwasher there was space for all of them so he just put them in the dishwasher and I was like, "Really?" I guess I understand if it's hand wash pots and pans and stuff that you can't put in the dishwasher but if I see people's dishes in the sink and the dishwasher is currently in a mode to collect dirty dishes I will usually just put them in and I won't grumble about it. I'll grumble about it if people leave pots unwashed or something, especially if I need them for cooking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's these kind of little things that when you're unhappy make a big difference and sort of get a lot bigger than they really are. [00:11:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and so he feels uncomfortable. Actually last night we watched an episode of Deep Space Nine and we were going to go over and then he was like, "Actually can we watch a second episode so I can make sure that they're all asleep by the time I come in." I was like, "Ok," so we ended up going there pretty late because he needed to avoid his housemates. He doesn't feel comfortable there. So it's good but we have been looking for a little bit though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like he can hopefully move into a much better situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the problem is finding a place. There was one apartment that was actually a couple of blocks from where I live and not that...it was like I guess toward the higher end, middle end of his range and seemed really awesome but then they gave the room to someone else before he actually had a chance to meet. So he was disappointed about that. So he's mostly looking for places in the area. The one he's doing outside is in [inaudible] so it's about a half hour walk from my house, if even. [00:12:19]</p>

<p>(pause) But...yeah. I was also worried because neither of us had gotten that much sleep on Tuesday night. I had gotten more sleep than he had because he couldn't fall asleep and then he had woken me up (pause) and then he had taken a nap on Wednesday but didn't sleep. So Wednesday night he went to bed at...I guess he went to bed at 3:00 but he slept for 14 hours, or like 15. He woke up at 5:30 pm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of sleep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He needed it though. Of course it meant that he didn't go to sleep...I woke up this morning at 7:45 and didn't see him next to me and I was like, "Wait! What?" and then I went into the TV room and he was still there on the Internet, which is where I figured he would be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He had been up all night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He had been up all night. I only went to bed at 1:30, 1:45 so it had only been six hours but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But still, that's really an altered sleep schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he knew he was going to do that but he is going to try for a nap now. Yeah it's crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's one of the signs of depression is having such a disturbed sleep schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, except it's really hard to fix it if you...you have to either force yourself to go to bed when you're not tired, which some people just can't do, or you have to stay up when you're really, really tired. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's the piece you have more control over and trying to regulate it again...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is staying up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not sleeping till 5:30 pm makes it a lot easier to try and go to sleep at a more typical hour. But if you do sleep all day it's very hard to fall asleep at night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then if you try and stay up all day, like if you go to sleep and you kind of wake up at a normal hour but then you want to sleep for another four hours or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even when I was at my craziest sleep schedule, which was after I had broken up with Jonas, it hadn't gotten quite that bad. And I didn't have anything going on during the day that I needed to be awake for anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but you were able to keep to a more...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was up to maybe like 3 am. There was one night that I really, really couldn't go to sleep which had been because I had forgotten to take my Seroquel. I realized after the fact. Other than that...and that was only really for a couple of weeks and eventually I fixed it because I was I was like, "I should probably fix this." [00:15:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it does help you to feel better if you can get that back on a regular track and hopefully that's something that he can move towards that can probably be helpful for him, and also for you because you're clearly worried about him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, especially because he woke up at 5:30 he didn't take the Wellbutrin and I was like, "Okay, I hope that you're going to be okay." And he was okay but I was just so worried that he was going to have another breakdown or something. At least that's what happened the last time that he managed to take his Wellbutrin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which might be correlated but it's not causation, especially with medications like that. One pill does not (pause)... does not have that much of an affect on its own. That's the kind of medication that you need to take every day for it to work consistently. So not taking it doesn't allow you to get the full benefit but missing one pill does not lead to a crisis. [00:16:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what about if you're at the very beginning and you haven't had that much of a chance to let it build up which was the case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not having that much of an effect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that's good to know because yeah I was worried but then he was fine and I was like, "Okay I'm glad that nothing happened other than you ended up not sleeping anyways," which I could have expected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be ideal if he could get on a schedule where he's remembering to take all his meds consistently because that's when they'll start to work for him, is when he can do that. And being on a regular sleep schedule helps with that because if you're going to bed at the same time every day and taking your meds right before bed or waking up at the same time and taking them when you wake up, having some consistency makes it a lot easier to remember to do that. When your sleep schedule is all over, your entire schedule is all over the place. [00:17:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause) he could just be nocturnal, and take the medicine when he wakes up at four in the afternoon and stay up all night and go to bed at...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That won't match very well with your schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It won't match very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or the fact that he's a human being and we're not nocturnal, not by nature.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what if you got a sun lamp and [within the front of the] (ph) sun lamp and got sun and then it would be like he was awake during the day, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would help, I mean, shift workers who do that (chuckle) find that that alleviates some of the effects of being on an altered pattern but there's a lot of cues out there that our circadian rhythms pick up on that it would be hard to completely avoid. And human beings are mean to be diurnal (ph). [00:17:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause) I don't know how to help him with that other than being like, "You're waking up now." Yesterday we were originally going to go out to lunch before I went off to Lucy's place and I set an alarm for 9:30 (pause) realizing I could have always told Lucy, "Okay, I'll be an hour late," so I set an alarm again for 10:30 and then at 10:30 I was like, "We should wake up," and he was like, "I need another hour." And I was like, "Okay, have another hour of sleep and I'll go do things." At 11:30 he was still sleeping and I was like, "Okay, we can go out for dinner. I'll eat lunch here. Get more sleep." (chuckle) But then he sleeps till 5:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's important to find a balance between being supportive — you want to be a supportive partner and care about him — but it's also important for you to take care of yourself and he can't do some of the things that you want him to do, it doesn't mean that you need to break up but you need to do them for yourself. [00:19:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is what I end up doing because I was like we should get meat (ph) at some point so I was like, "I'll make myself lunch/breakfast and we'll go out for dinner," which ended up working out okay other than that he didn't sleep at all last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But what you did is you kind of decided, "Okay, now I'm going to focus on what I need," and you're going to need to do that because in order to not...while he is working through this and hopefully getting this help he needs from his therapist, you want to make sure that you don't set aside so many of your own needs that you become resentful. And you can't fix it for him. You can't make it better. You can't be his therapist. You can be his girlfriend and you can be supportive but you can't control his choices and you can't fix it for him. (pause) It's a hard balance to strike, how to be supportive and also make sure that you're taking care of yourself and getting what you need. [00:20:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try and that's why I got together with Lucy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's great. Like if you can't get some of the things you need from him, making sure you get time with your friends and support from your friends and doing fun things with your friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We do things when he's awake and stuff, we'll hang out (pause) or if he's Interneting then doing my own Interneting or stuff that [doesn't bother him] (ph) I read or something else. (pause) I realized that I needed to become more independent and I'm trying to work towards that because I think it would also take a big deal of stress off of him because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then he can focus more on himself and doing what he needs to do to feel better for himself rather than...because it sounds like he was starting to feel very badly that he wasn't able to meet some of your needs, either from pressure from you or pressure from himself, of what he expected to be able to do as a boyfriend. [00:21:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and especially right now we don't have music anyways and so we might have it over the summer. They actually asked, "What time would you want to rehearse? What days?" And so I had in all caps, "NOT LATE AT NIGHT!" because I was like I don't want to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and that makes things more complicated for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If it ends up living near me then I could walk to his place, steal a car from him, go to rehearsal, drive back to his place, and stay there sort of thing and not have to worry about him being able to pick me up if it turns out that we have late night rehearsals next semester. Although I'm going to push for it. Especially...I'm the only alto. They (pause) damn (pause) better well accommodate me better if they want me to stay in the group and they really want me to stay in the group because they need me. They can't do a concert without me as it stands. If we get more women next semester then that would no longer be the case but like right now they need me. They can't not have me. [00:22:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be really nice if you could meet at a more convenient time which would allow you not to be dependent upon him or working (inaudible) the car.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, also, if I got a job in the mean time then either I could get my own car or I could...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things might change over the coming months.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or not feel bad about taking cabs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just speaking of jobs how is the application process going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I applied for two jobs on Monday afternoon. I haven't done anything since then but maybe I'll do some today. (pause) One of them I was very over qualified for and one I was almost qualified for. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So did you finish...I knew you were working on applications in the waiting room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, whichever one I was working on out there I think I finished. Yeah that was probably the one that I was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it was a good plan to use the quiet space, no distractions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that was the almost qualified for and the other one was the (pause)...okay $17.20 and hour, 23 hours a week, with benefits but it was just like library clerk working the circulation desk position that you needed a high school diploma for. So I'm very, very over qualified but I was like for that much money, with only 23 hours a week, and with benefits, I'm applying for this even though the work would be kind of boring. Maybe it would allow me to move up or something. [00:23:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah, move into the system. See what happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I don't know whether or not I'll have a chance of getting it. I even filled out the application form and I printed it out and put it in an envelope and mailed it. Turned out the mailman hadn't even come yet that day so he took the letter and it's probably in their hands by now. It probably was by Tuesday morning or Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we'll see what happens. But good for you for getting them out and seeing if you could...(pause) do you know if there's anything else worth applying for if you were to spend some time doing that today or have you looked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's one that I was qualified for that was like (pause) out back home. It's about an hour and ten minute drive but it would be a reverse commute since most people will be going from not to so it wouldn't be as bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is a long ride.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. It's sort of at the limits of what I would do but I probably will apply for it anyways. (pause) I'm not moving back home though because that would be very, very silly and annoying. Still even if I got a job there I'd rather do the commute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you could move closer. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I want to stay because at that point there's nothing in between here and there that is a place that I'd want to live. (pause) I could in theory live in between or something like that where there's lots of Jews but there are mostly families and stuff and I don't know that there would be affordable housing and I don't have any friends there. Yeah, I'd probably just end up doing the ridiculous commute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well at some point you may be at the place where you have a family and if this was a great job that you're going to be at for the next 40 years, the commute could be cut down at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or if I decide that I really, really like it and would stay there even if I have a family.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we're both jumping ahead though right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so if I got that job...I still think I should apply for it, even if it would be a commute of death. And maybe I'd be able to find someone at my workplace who also lived in the area that we could have a carpool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, but the first step is to apply and then if you hear back and you interview and you get it, then you make decisions about (pause) how you make the commute more manageable, whether that's ride sharing or seeing if you can do a four day work week. But first you send out the application and see what you hear back. [00:26:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that one was like...I think there might have been a couple of others. There's one that I've... [been most of the previous] (ph) that I hadn't applied for yet that was like (pause)...and I was definitely qualified for because the position was called archivist and I was like, "This would be good for an archive student." It's like 14 dollars an hour, 15 hours a week or something. And I'm like okay, it's (pause) within (pause) sort of the low end but it would also be part time so I could do something else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, if you could do that plus the 23 hours a week, then that's a full time job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if I got the 23 hours a week one it has the benefits and it's (pause)...I did the math and it would be about twenty thousand dollars a year pre taxes. I can live off of that so I would probably just end up taking the 23 hour a week job and then volunteering at the historical society for a couple of hours a week or something like that rather than having two part time jobs, because I wouldn't need to work a second job to make ends meet. I would have more time for me. So I think just 20 to 25 or 30 hours a week with benefits is my ideal. [00:28:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah if you have benefits that's...that's one of your...that's a main concern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah when it said benefits I was like, "Holy crap. I'm applying for this. I can't believe they're paying this much for someone who only needs a high school degree." It would be like if I needed a college degree then I'd only be sort of...wouldn't be that over qualified for but I have two masters degrees. Maybe I should have taken one of them off of my resume, probably like my Masters of Theological Studies but I decided not to, which actually meant I had to alter the application form because I was filling it out on the computer and it says high school, college, graduate degree (pause) and then I added another graduate degree on there so I could put them both. In retrospect I'm like, "Maybe I shouldn't have done that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you can't go back and change that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I probably would have figured out...I don't think having a Masters of Theological Studies makes me that much more over qualified than I'd already be. [00:29:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You already have a graduate degree for a job that they're asking for a high school diploma. It's something that appeals to you for a lot of reasons so it's worth doing the follow up phone call so that they know that you are really interested in that position even though that you realize that you're over...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, follow up phone call?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought (pause) you really weren't supposed to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it would be one thing if I had gotten an interview and then they had told me they would get back by x date and I'd be like, "Hey, could I have an update on the status of my application?" But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to pester, so you wouldn't want to place a lot of phone calls, but because you're an applicant that's probably a little different than what they were looking for, I don't think it's...there aren't really hard and fast rules. You're just placing a phone call to say like, "Hey, I sent in an application. I wanted to let you know that I'm really interested in the position. You may have noticed that my application...I know notice that I appear over qualified but the position appeals to me for a number of reasons." You're not asking them to do anything for you. So there's a difference between, "Hi, can you tell me what the status is?" calling back a week later to find out why you haven't heard back. Then I'd feel like you're pestering them. But giving somebody some information to make your application more robust, it doesn't carry that same tone of "I want something back from you." So I think if you call and be able to express the message that you're really interested, you realize that you're over qualified, but you're interested, that leaves a different feeling. I think you can do that without...as long as your not sending a message that you're putting pressure on them to hear back, that feels so different. [00:31:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, then maybe I'll do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just mention it because on paper it looks like why is this girl applying for this position? Yet, you know you have personal reasons for why that would be a good fit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if only hours and...hours and pay and still being able to also do archiving stuff in my free time. And I think if I had got...if I had tried to...there was the one that I was not as over qualified for, a student job at the library, if I were to get that then I probably would have to take a second part time job because it would add up to a little bit less than eleven thousand pre taxes and I can't quite live off of that I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really not very much money when it comes down to it. [00:32:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, if I calculated it it might be equal to barely cover rent and stuff. (pause) But I think even if I had a part time job that was eleven thousand a year I think my parents would be willing to help out more because A — they're not helping out as much as it would have been before, B — because it's in the field. So I did end up writing the person that (pause) Tara knew and she wrote me back and we're going to meet next Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wonderful! Good for you!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not sure what to say to her when I meet her next Wednesday but I'm still going to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, would you like to spend some time maybe thinking about what you want to get out of that conversation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, yeah. She's not on the...if she's on the hiring committee, maybe she didn't tell me. She was like, "Sure, I'd love to meet you." [00:33:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She may not be able to disclose that to a potential applicant. What is her role at the library?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's one of the archivists but I think she's (pause) head of something else. The whole library is really an archive because it's a non-circulating collection and stuff so (pause)...I forget what her actual position is but it was something that was sort of tangential, some sort of archivist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But she's in the field you want to be in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's in the field I want to be in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's a really nice message to send to somebody like, "So happy to have the opportunity to talk with you because you're doing...you're really in the field that I want to be in." So you're already sending this message, one that you appreciate her time and you appreciate what she does and you're really interested in that. [00:34:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess I should treat it as an informational interview but I've never done an informational interview so I don't know really how they go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think part...I guess I think about it also...this is a potential mentor for you and she may not want to take on that role officially but she's someone from whom you can learn kind of how she got in to the field and inviting her to talk about that, you know, "I'm so interested in what you do at the library. How did you...can you tell me what your path was like?" That's a way for her...it's a nice open ended question, she can go lots of different ways with that, and it can just open up the conversation to a lot of things that might be interesting and useful to you, kind of figuring out where she started, how did she decide, what other things — she might talk about what other things she's done on her way to where she is now or what else...Just a way to maybe open up some ideas and opportunities. [00:35:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And according to Tara, she's very laid back and stuff so. I made the mistake of e-mailing from my yellow hobbit and not switching it to the Georgia post-Yale one. I didn't make that mistake when I e-mailed in the application so I think it's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Okay, oops, but whatever." (chuckle) At that point I was like, "Okay."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you feel like that's a mistake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because in theory I should have used my professional one (pause) and I guess...I don't know why I forgot. I always remember with sending job applications and I always put that as my e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just felt a little bit more personal because it was a connection through a friend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I still probably should have used my Yale one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean it lends a little bit of cache (sp?) to have the Yale one and it is a little bit more professional but I don't think it's...give her both, now that she already has your personal one. And since you are making a...it does give her a little bit of insight to your personality which you want to show a little personality. People remember that more than they remember bullet points on a resume. [00:36:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. And I mean, especially if she doesn't even end up being on the hiring committee and she's like, "Oh I met this person, she's really nice. Keep an eye out for her application," or something like that. I guess that's what I ideally want to get out of it/oh, if someone else is looking for someone somewhere and they talk to her and she talks to me and then I find out about this other opportunity or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah so a chance to make a personal impression. Let her know the types of things you're interested in case she does know of other opportunities or something crosses her desk, and also getting from her a sense of what her path has been in order for you to maybe think about if there are other things that you haven't thought about that might be (pause) avenues or opportunities for you. [00:37:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I haven't done that much looking in the terms of the non-archive jobs. I've looked a little bit off Jewishjobs.com a couple of days a go but didn't get that far.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so that could be a goal. I know there's no time today so maybe if you did that one application that you thought was a possibility and then scan some of the other sites and then that could be a pretty productive week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll have gotten three job applications out! But now it's like, "Okay, three doesn't sound like that much anymore."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's way more than what you did two weeks ago, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true! (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's look at what you've done and (pause)...so with that if you could do three each week, they add up and we just need one to stick. [00:38:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That's why the ones that were posted not this past Monday but the Monday before, should I bother (pause) applying for them? None of them were ones that I was like super duper like, 'Oh my God, I must apply for them," or I would have but they were ones that I was just like, "This might be okay."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If they're still up (pause)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could always send a...well I guess if the cover letter is one that's easy to write — which I think the one I hadn't done yet was going to be pretty easy to write — I guess the worst I could do is send it in and they could be like, 'Oh, we already found someone."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right, but it's potential that they're still accepting applications and if it's something that fits your criteria...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like the ones with deadlines better because I know whether or not if I've missed the deadline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is nice to have it clear cut so then you don't fee like...you're wondering if it's a waste of time. But you don't have a job and you want a job so applying is what you do. [00:39:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, especially with the whole (pause)...especially with the ones that I applied to and then never heard anything back from. After a while I realized that (inaudible) they didn't want me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They don't always take the time to do those...to let you know that they're not interested. They get so many applications from the online thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's some that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm checking time for us because I know my battery is low on my clock. We're good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Yeah. I looked...there weren't that many that were posted this week so the one I just ended up applying to was one that was like about barely qualified for and I'm like, "Should I? Should I not?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay to stretch and really when you sit down and do it, it doesn't take that much time to get it done. When you think about it for a really long time, the time that it takes to get it done can extend but if you put your mind to it, sit there, and get it done, you can probably get one out in less than two hours. [00:40:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably less than two hours, sometimes even less than one hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So reduce some of the thinking about it time and you can get a bunch out. (pause) Are there other things we should be catching up on or thinking about today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I noticed those thoughts happened again like...so on Monday evening I had another performance. It was this...it was only a couple of songs. It was this going away party for this person who had worked at Harvard for a really long time and they wanted us to come in and we actually wrote a song for him. And when we were like in the cafeteria and the student center and were working on the song I noticed that the thoughts were happening there. There I was just like, "Okay, this is happening now. Why is this happening now?" Like it wasn't something super anxious. It was a super easy song that we were learning. (pause) And I guess we are all close proximity and stuff. [00:41:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Close proximity and it wasn't challenging enough material to really require all your focus. Sometimes when you're not fully engaged in something that's been a time when the thoughts sort of have more opportunity to pop up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's the chorus and then there were like these two measures that repeated over and over again. Do you know a song "Give Peace a Chance"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we did a parody of it called "Give Chippies a Chance" because the person runs this homeless event every year so we wrote the song and it was really, really easy and I was like, "Why can't all of our arrangements be like this?" because that would be awesome.</p>

<p>But (pause) yeah I guess...being close proximity to people who are like...to a large group of people while the material isn't challenging.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible — overlapping voices)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How bothersome were the thoughts to you when they were occurring? [00:42:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were like a little bit bothersome. That's why I think I was able to push them away pretty quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think I went back to the (inaudible) of the music and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you made yourself more present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think when you're really present with what you're doing, there's not as much opportunity for the thoughts to enter in, just like any random thought. When we're really focused on what we're doing in the moment other thoughts, whether they're what you may label exclusively as intrusive thoughts and other thoughts that goes through your list, has less time to commence. So if you can channel your energy...it's easier for you to do that...it sort of happens automatically when you're working on something really challenging because it requires all your energy not just to think about being present with it, just the challenging material forces you to be present with it and when it's less challenging you need to consciously think about being present with what you're doing. Paying attention to the lyrics of the song, the melody, you know, if you're in rehearsal or if you're knitting. Even though you might be able to do it — if you're doing an easier pattern — you might be able to do it by row (ph) without thinking much about it. Really focusing on each stitch is something that won't leave as much space for the thoughts to come up. [00:44:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it is really hard at this point. Like it's very unlikely that I will be doing anything that would actually require much thought, like I'd have to be doing lace or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't mean that you can't focus on it. You don't have to but knitting isn't a time when the thoughts usually bother you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I just use that as an example of when you're consciously focusing your thought rather than having your thought focused for you. If you were working on lace you wouldn't have to think about, "I should be paying attention to what I'm doing," because you just would be because it's a harder thing to work on. But if you're doing something...if you're knitting a sweater and that's really easy for you, you don't have to think about it but you could. You could pull your attention to that so as to not have room for the other things. It would be intentional and that's...having intentional thoughts is one strategy for not leaving room for intrusive thoughts. They're opposites. [00:45:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) But then why don't they happen when I'm like at my house in my room by myself? It's usually only when I wouldn't want them to be there like when I'm surrounded by other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think part of it is that they're triggered by those people, because usually there's a person that's a focus of the thought. So when you're alone or when you're with people with whom you're having a very specific interaction, they don't usually come up. But when you're in a situation where you're surrounded by a lot of people it seems like there is something that is triggered by the presence of those people that set off these thoughts for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish there was a way to make that not happen but there isn't really other than never interact with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not a healthy choice so figuring out ways to redirect allows you to do the things you want to do and minimize the discomfort that you have with the thoughts.</p>

<p>Well why don't we stop there for today? Do you still want to do Monday as planned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so just if you're going to come as a couple shoot me an e-mail letting me know. If I don't hear from you I'll assume it's just your regular individual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay that works. [00:46:31]</p>

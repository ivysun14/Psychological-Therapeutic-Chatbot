<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Wednesday, February 3rd. Wednesday February 3rd.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I had a talk with my girlfriend this morning, because if I didn't I would have been no good for nothing. We had a talk last Sunday and she said what I'm doing again is that I'm starting to get into things that she is into because you know like she says I'm interested in things like she's not really interested in but I'm following her, you know. And so, I don't know (inaudible) because I'm giving up, I'm giving up aerobics, but it's mostly because of her. You know, it's because she says this irritates me but I'm doing this for you and this other bullshit, but, which is exactly what it is. You know, because like, you don't get angry with somebody or you don't start getting crabby with someone unless it hurts you. You know, it's not the idea that you're hurting the other person or it's hurting themselves. That's a bunch of baloney. I used to think that way, think "geez, she's a saint" but she's not. You know. 0:00:58.5</p>

<p> And so, you know, like I'm giving up aerobics and it's really bugging me because, like, I do like this one fellow there that's not, he's not my teacher, he retired, but he's there. And where he's there, he always helps me. You know, he says something about how I'm doing, you know "put your foot here, now this one". 0:01:13.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're giving it because of  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm giving it up mostly because of her, partly because of my back bothers me a little bit, but like so what, I went into yoga and my back bothered me at first too. You know, so it's not really that, that much. Mostly it's because of her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she doesn't want you to [inaudible - talking over]</p>

<p>PATIENT: She doesn't really want me there, I don't think. I think it's more than just liking things that she likes. I think it's partly because now the teacher is giving me compliments that I'm good. And, like she is like his pet star pupil. You know and it's like maybe she feels as if what I'm trying to do is outdo her or I'm trying, you know what I mean. And it's like she feels like I'm crowding her. So I said hell, alright I like aerobics, but I also was very interested in running, since I've been a kid. And I did start aerobics; I started aerobics because she introduced me to it. So I mean, in that way she's right. But the thing is she invited me to join, you know, like. I just don't know why I am with this girl. She's been my best friend and I'm going, you know, I don't know where to do or how to react to her and- 0:02:10.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's confusing because partly she's telling you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's telling me "come on", yeah in the beginning she was the one who introduced me to it and it's as if she wanted me to start and then she maybe wanted me to think it was my idea. But really I knew she wanted me to start. I had wanted to take some type of self defense, but not really judo because my doctor told me I really shouldn't take it. I mean my real doc; you know one for the back. Because he said that I could never really do it. If I did it for a couple of years the chance of falling would be bad for my back. 0:02:40.2</p>

<p> And I know I wouldn't go past green belt because then you go into competitions. Jesus, like 26 people got hurt the last time there was a competition. And that's ridiculous, I can't see being in a sport that's that rough. You know, so I mean part of it was my own thought, like I would only go so far, so I may as well just quit and go into something that I could become black belt, or whatever, just keep going at, in running I could do that. But it, you know, part of it was the reason that I stop now was partly because of her. And I just don't know where to go and like I'm afraid to be home, because I came home Monday night and you could tell there was, like, she really didn't want me to be there because she wanted to be alone. Well I didn't want her to be there, because I wanted to be alone. But I mean we were like in the same room with this far apart. 0:03:17.3</p>

<p> And I can't understand, you know, I felt rejected at first. You know, like I felt like she doesn't care and I don't know why and all this other baloney. And she was like this for two week, like she said she was. And it was because she said I feel like she feels like I'm crowding her. You know like, I really, I really just don't know where to go with this girl. Because like one time she says "you're not taking care of our friendship" you know. So then I put myself out and I made sure I did little things and I was, you know what I mean. 0:03:42.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you're crowding her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I'm crowding her and then so I have to go the other way and I got to make sure that I'm not any place she is and I'm not doing anything she's doing and you know, it's like, Jesus I don't know where I am going. I can't wait to get out of that house. And it's like - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, it's sort of like you have to treat her so gingerly, because you never know what you can do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I thought it was me all the time. But now I'm kind of wondering. Because this one fellow she's seeing and he was a good friend of mine too. He talk to me the other night and he said "look, is she been saying something about you, that you've been taking too much of her time?" And I said "well something like that, she said that I was getting into too many things that she was into". And he said "well she did say had a [inaudible at 0:04:20.0]. Well one or two things it is it was either the problem we had and then it just sort of fell over on other people and she was kind of crabby with other people cause she didn't just want to talk to me. </p>

<p> And or it was the idea like she feels like everybody crowding in on her. It's not me, it's her. I don't know. Or it's both of us. You know. It's like, she did come up with a point though. She said it's almost like married people, you know they live together for a while and then little things get on their mind and little things get on the other persons mind and nobody talks. You know, they start getting sarcastic back and forth. Because I didn't know it was wrong and I would just react to her and I get sarcastic, and say Jesus Christ, I want to go home - [laughing] and I don't want to see her and it's like. It's really bad. I mean it is an experience because in it's self it is something like that. When she said that, it reminded me of something, you know, like I've seen people that are married that are like this too, they can't talk and they can't communicate. 0:05:08.5</p>

<p> And I said this is really bad. So I don't know, I think we've got it pretty well set up. Because I asked her. I was for two days I didn't know whether I should be there Sunday, because her brother is coming over and her sister-in-law and the baby. And I didn't know if I was crowding her with family too. Because Daniel when he called, said something about there was a problem with her mother too. Which I kind of surmised, because one time she was talking on the phone with her mother and hung up and then she said something snotty to me. I just walked in the door and she went tooom [ph], you know. I said "okay, okay". So I think, part of this, you know, is her mother and her having a little tiff too.</p>

<p> But it's like, you know, like Jesus, what, what am I supposed to do. And so I finally, this morning, I said "look, do you want me there Sunday or not, you did invite me, but like if I feel, if I'm making you feel like I'm crowding you, I don't want to crowd you out with your family too" and she says "no, no, no, I'm doing it for you mostly, it just irritates me and I just don't like you getting into things that I do." You know. 0:06:02.2</p>

<p> And I, in some ways I can see her point, but like I don't think it's justified all the time. You know, it's like, like she was buying vegetables, well like I'm getting hesitation from her for vegetables. It was the simple fact that I was eating too much protein and nothing else. And so I went out and bought vegetables and I happen to be unpacking them and she looked at me and I thought, oh shit, you know. She's going to think that I'm doing it because she's doing it, and now, you know. And it has nothing to do with her, you know. 0:06:26.9</p>

<p> But I don't know, it just gets to the point where like I'm walking on eggs and I've have to remember. I think she went through it with me, you know, because she was afraid of my rejection and now, now I still feel the rejection, but I understand it a little better, so it's not so bad. But now I'm afraid to do anything. It's maybe kind of poetic justice and now I'm on the other end of the stick and I don't know what the hell to do. 0:06:52.5</p>

<p> And it's really bad. Because, you know, I do feel that. I do feel like, I get that feeling like she doesn't care about me any more. And like, she's trying, almost like she's trying to break our friendship off. That's the way I almost feel. But, you know, at the same time, like, I don't think it's just me this time. I think there's something, I don't think it's just with me anyway. I think maybe everybody's just try to, like Dan I know is love with her, so like naturally he's going to want to be with her more. And he said that, one time she said "well, we need to do more things together" and now I do it and then she says "no", you know. And it's like, it's like you go overboard or something. And it just, I don't know, it's just getting to the point where I don't know whether I'm going to go anywhere with her, you know, living there. 0:07:33.9</p>

<p> And yet I really care about her. She's like my best friend. I don't know, I just, um. It's too sticky or something, I don't think I'm going to be doing much progressing while I'm running around like, always thinking now don't do this and don't do that and don't do the other thing. Jesus, it's like a religion, where I couldn't do this and I couldn't do that. You know, and it's very confining for me. It's, you know, like now I'll do things like, I'll figure out what day she's not home and I come home. And days she's home I don't come home. And oh Christ.</p>

<p> Last night I went to a movie and stayed through like a time and half, but it wasn't all that great of a movie, so I wouldn't go home because she was there. And that's pretty bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're both walking on egg shells, I mean its like you're sort of tip toeing around each other. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And every once in a while you kind of - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't know what to do. You know, like I'm afraid - Like she said she went to see this play last night and she said there was a New York Company, and I went WOW a play, New York Company. But the she's like "but their only here one night" so in other words it's like "haha, I went but now you can't go because their only here for one night and their gone". And it's like, you know, so what I did back was just say, what did I say to her. Oh I said "Oh, that's nice. I hope you had fun". Like, not like I was really excited to go to it, or anything and I really was. But I had to hide it because, you know, well then she'll think "well Jesus next time this thing comes to town, she'll make sure she goes". </p>

<p>All of this baloney, you know, and it's like, ugh. [chuckling] You just don't know what to do. I get a little more perceptive and then you catch things like this and now it's even worse because you know what's going on. I don't know, Jesus. 0:09:06.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So on the one hand, it sounds like you want to be friends with her. But on the other you're so fed up with this walking on egg shells business thing. You just want to get out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like, it's like. Fine, I think we'd be very good friends if we didn't live together. You know, but like you know one thing it does teach, one thing it did teach me though, I probably would never get along in a marriage situation. Never, ever, ever. Because, like, I couldn't go there really. If the man or something was moody at all. Or if he was high strung at all. And decided to go through this bit. I would go crazy. You know, because I, I mean I couldn't take that for any length of time. You figure, you know, this way I can just pick up and move out. You know, we're just girlfriends and there's no like you know. But like, Jesus, if you're married or something to a fellow and you got kids and you get like this and you can't communicate. Jesus, that's bad.</p>

<p> You know again, I say part of this it's my fault I guess. But, you know, before I used to think it was all my fault. I'd say "oh Christ, I did something wrong again" and it was - and I don't think it's all my fault this time. You know, it's just like, I'm just to the point where like, I am starting to develop a little bit. I am starting to recognize some of my hang ups and that. So that their a lot easier to take, I mean they still hurt, Jesus. 0:10:12.1</p>

<p> But you know, and like when I went to go see my Mother and I didn't anything, any satisfaction there. Which, I suppose I shouldn't, you know because she doesn't, she can't tell me what's wrong with me. Oh that reminds me something else that came out when Jodie and I were talking Sunday. And that was, I realized rejection again that I felt and it was partly like a shutting out feeling I know. And it was like the way I felt it that I remember I started crying when someone had told me about this dog. And I remember too that at times when I was little, I used to cry for movies and things and most people would say "ah come on, that's so stupid." You know. They cry about one thing and I cried about something else and I didn't even know why I was crying, because I didn't recognize the hurt, you know.</p>

<p> And it was like there, this friend of mine was telling me about this dog. And this dog was so cute and I used to always play with it when I went. It was just like a real loveable dog, you know. And it would like, it was just like little baby, you know. And then I found out how the dog died. And this was got me, because they had locked the dog out accidentally in the cold, it was like subzero weather that night. And they got up in the morning and they didn't, and they were looking for the dog, you know, and it wasn't there. And they looked and then here the dog had circled the house a couple of times and he had gone to each window and you could see underneath where, you know. Like he was like saying like here was this dog crying to get in, crying and crying and he couldn't understand. Because like the dog was nine years old, had been with this family for nine years. And all of the sudden, like, I just try and feel for the dog and afterwards I realized what, all these things were going through my mind really quick and all I though was it was terrible that he froze to death. And that's why I'm crying, but then when I thought about it, that wasn't why I was crying, you know. 0:11:55.0</p>

<p>It was because I could picture and all things went through so fast that, you know, consciously I didn't even pull apart. And it was like I could see the dog just going around the house and you know coming to each one of those windows and crying and saying "why did you lock me out? What did I do?" You know it's like here this dog is, it never did anything, it was such a sweet dog. You know, the mother used to say "oh god that dog never does anything wrong, it's a perfect dog" you know, and here's the dog sitting outside the door, outside the windows and it's crying and crying and finally they said they didn't understand why it went away, but I did. You know, it was like you can only cry so much and you can only ask to get back in so much, you know. And like you can only understand like they just don't want me, you know, after a while. Because the dog can't understand that the people are sleeping and they couldn't hear her, all she understands is, I cried and I cried and they wouldn't let me in, you know. And then it's like, and then the dog went away and lived a couple of days in the field. And then they couldn't understand either why the dog was scared and didn't want to come back when they finally picked it up. Well you know you know it's like saying, "you're dying now I guess we'll take you home, you know it's like we didn't want you when you were still alive and still moving and everything. 0:12:59.3</p>

<p>So then they brought the dog home and it dies. But it's just the idea that all I could think of was those, you know like, those big brown eyes that she had, she was looking at me saying "please let me in, please let me in" and nobody would let her in. And you know, she's saying "well what did I do", you know. And I thought that was, you know, I told that to Jodie and I said "I guess it's because like I felt rejected". And she said well "that not only do I feel rejected but that's probably just about the circumstances." You know 0:13:22.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she's asking to be let in, and then she-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, or it's like somebody had taken me in when I was a little kid or whatever or for a while. And it was like I love you, I love you, I love you, you're a good kid, you're a good kid, you're a good kid. And just all the sudden like it just like creeps up and you're like you didn't know what you did and all of the sudden, shoom [ph] and the door shut. And you keep crying and you want to get back in and nobody lets you in, you know. And like I don't even know if that's like I left someplace or it's just that maybe there was like, you know, like you don't have to leave somebody not to be with them. You know, it's like you can be in same house or where ever. 0:14:00.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's your experience of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and it's like, it's like there's no communication at all with that person. And I guess maybe that reminds me too like what's going, what's going between Jodie and I don't understand it, now. And like it probably happened before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like again it's that feeling of being shut out and you don't why or what's going to happen. And you know maybe she could send you away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that, that's part of it. Or it's just like, I get the funny feeling when I went to tell Jodie, she was going to slug me or something. Which is a weird thing, because I guess, well it's not really that weird. I get, like when I was at Foley's every time I turned around I was getting slugged for something. And that could be it. It's just like, you know, it's like a paranoia. That you say something wrong and somebody's going to hit you. Like nobody gets violent physically, you know, unless, like, you're a kid. But I still get that, you know, that feeling like somebody's going to hit me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you say something to them that has to do with your relationship -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right something like I feel</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you're going to get clobbered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I let them talk and talk and tell me what they feel and tell me what think is wrong with me and then I'll just oh I did something wrong now I can't do it anymore, I've got to change, you know because something is wrong with me, and that's it. You know, but it's like I never, I never realized my own reactions and if I did I wouldn't say anything because I was afraid that they were going to reject me or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you would get hit. 0:15:17.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would get hit almost, which is weird because I've had that feeling before, like somebody is going to hit me if I say this. And it's weird, I don't know where I got that from. Like I said, probably because when I was little that's what happened when I said something I got, I got hit. And I don't know. And then finally it came out and it was so easy because she said "oh no, it has nothing to do with [inaudible at 0:15:38.1]. You know, [laughing] you're still in one piece.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like there's all that pressure on you not to say what you feel, that something, you know, pretty bad could happen. And then when you get it out it's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so when I came here I felt like ten pounds had just been lifted off me, it was a weird feeling. But like ah, I was really worried about it for like two days and then - But I got a good feeling about like changing. And now once I talked to her this morning, it changed my ideas a little bit too. And I realized that like I have been using her somewhat as a crutch. You know, it's like, I've done this so now I introduced you to this, now you do this, you know. But it's like I've never really looked into anything on my own that I have wanted to do, like aikido. I wanted to do, four years ago a friend of mine took it. Started it I should say. And you know she said it was like lots of mind control, you know. And well it's like this sounds interesting. And this is more like what I want. Because I don't just to be able to flip something or whatever. It's not just self defense I want, it's like a mental discipline more, you know. That's why I'm going into to try judo. 0:16:43.3</p>

<p>I don't know, it's just - I went through that period and I just, oh when they told me about that dog and I could just, like, I guess put it into so many different situations that I've gone through or am going through, you know. And I know how that dog felt. And like, that's how I could identify with it, because, you know. I know, I know that dog's feel too and thought Jesus and that dog is dead. You know, part of the thing was too, was that the dog probably never realized that they loved it and it died. I mean even though they took it back home. It was almost like they were making up, you know. It's was like we should at least let you die at home, you know what I mean, you were born here, you may as well die here. 0:17:23.6</p>

<p>But it was like, you she could never know that they really loved her. Because how can you tell somebody, you know. When you do something and then you say something that's opposite, who can believe you. Like my stepparents used to tell me "I love you, I love you" and then ah that was such a bunch of bull, I thought at the time. And now, it's not I don't think, because like she's, she would say I wish I knew more, I wish I knew how to take care of you. And you know, what to do. She's like I just didn't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's like you too, all alone, always not being able, isolated kind of. Cut off. 0:17:57.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it was like, but see it was like for six or seven years she never told me she loves me. Like I never heard from her. And so it was very hard for me to realize that she really did love me. And like, how could I, I guess I'm kind of funny, I think I'd say something like "Well if you love me, first of all, you wouldn't shut me out, that's one thing. And then you wouldn't, if you couldn't take care of me, if there really was a big problem, just like nothing you could do. The least you could do would be is to send me a birthday card or say call me up once in while and see if I was still living, you know. Or whatever. At least ask about me through my mother, but like nothing. No communication." But the catholic charities don't allow it, that was they thing. They do allow it for like three or four, five years or something I guess afterwards. After you leave a stepparents' home. They think it's upsetting or something to the child. Which I see in a way, you know like logically I see it, in a way. Like, if you leave stepparents' home, and you're into another stepparents home, you shouldn't have any relationship with the one that you were at before. </p>

<p> You know, so like I, but I mean, I just, I just said to myself and I thought, how could she love me if she did that. And how could she love me. You know the way she used to be to me, like I don't know, like I was there to be a babysitter. And I was there to clean the house and I was there. You know, it was like I always felt that way, I guess maybe that was how it was hard for me to give again. I always felt like I was always giving for her. And like, how can I say it, I was always giving to her and I never got anything back. It's was like a constant, you know, like I doing my work and everything for her and everything and like I never got anything back form her, really. My brother did I think, but I didn't. And it was like I felt real cheated, because her I was and I was doing all this stuff for this woman, like I didn't get anything back from her at all. And I just - 0:19:56.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're trying so hard and she just doesn't give you anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and this is why it's so funny when Jodie's mother said this to her, and she said this to me, she said "you know, my mother always says that you try so hard". You know. And, and I said "well I don't mean to" it's just like she's been so open to me and like, you don't want, you want to make sure that she knows that you care, you know, so like whatever you can do, oh can I do dishes, can I help you can I do this, can I do that, you know. And you try to be, you almost put on a little bit. And I know I do, but it's only because I'm trying to say, "I really care, I really care, I really care" you know, like and it's really hard to do, because like I never had somebody that I could have like a relationship with .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: it was never easy with you, you always had to try.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had to work for it, yeah I had to really work for any kind of a compliment or any kind of show of affection or whatever, and like here I didn't have, like with my mother, I used to have to stand on my head for her to say something about me or to me or whatever. It was like otherwise I just wasn't there. And so like, I just, I just don't know what to do with it. It's like I try to explain that to Jodie too, I said "look, I mean maybe I can handle a kid, you can't because like you haven't been around kids, I have, you know like babies and things like this. But like as far as other things go, like, you know what to do and I don't, so don't, like you say, don't do this and don't do that, but like I just don't know. You know, there are lots of things I'm very ignorant about, and I know it. And like, so what can you do? You know, if you don't know, then it's up to a friend to tell you. 0:21:36.0</p>

<p>And it's not, you know, they shouldn't do it in such a way, like she does things like, I make mistakes with my boss or whatever, and I've done it already. And she go like, "boy that was a dumb thing to do" well you know like how could I know, I never, I haven't been in this situation before. It's something that I don't know. She understands Jewish men, I don't. That's the first Jewish man I ever worked for, I don't understand them. And so, you know like there are things, certain things that they do and things that she says that's dumb you should have noticed this right away and this and that. And I go well thanks, now you tell me. You know like, what can I do. But, I don't know, it's just like. But like with her mother and everything. This is another thing I was afraid of, I thought well maybe because there's some kind of problem between her mother and her. And maybe I'm involved in that too and maybe it's because her mother cares lots about me. Because she says lots of times, she'll go over there and they'll talk about me, not bad, they'll just discuss like what I doing or a problem I have or whatever to try to, you know. And so I got her something for her birthday and she sent me this really beautiful card and it said, I was looking at myself and I just thought all the thought you've put behind it and everything. And I was so happy that she would, you know, that she would, it said something about you thought of me and the beautiful part and then she signed it. And when I thought of it, your adopted mother. And I just I know I just felt so good when I read that card and then, but the thing that made, but like a mixed feeling because when I read that card I was thinking about what I was going to say to Jodie. You know, like, do you want me with your family, oh Jesus, you know like I don't want to loose her. 0:23:12.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was just like she's going be there too Sunday. And I thought oh and when she put that down like she's never, she never told me anything, you know like it's always been you know thank you for caring and things like this when I've written a card. But when she put that down, like your adoptive mother, you know. And it was just like, it was like saying, like, now - well it sounds funny, but now it's like Now you're not the one that just like, I can't really explain it, it's like, I'm not the step child, she's the stepmother. You know what I mean, and it's like I picked her or and it's like, and she was like she wanted to be picked as somebody special to me. And it was like a two way thing that I haven't experienced with to many people. And it's like, now I'm not trying to take my girlfriends mother away from her, you know, and I'm not even trying to adopt her as my real mother or anything. But you know like I really do love my mother, but it's like, it's like something came together for once in my life. You know, like I'm like people and they've turned around and they've you know and they've just walked away from me. And then I know, they just walked away from me. And I know I've done the same thing to other people that like me. 0:24:24.0</p>

<p>But for once, like I like somebody, like somebody in a mother position, somebody I can go to and somebody, you know like, I don't know. She calls up and she'll say, she might even say like "is Jodie there?" and I'll say "no, this is the other brat" or something and she say "oh okay". Then we sit and talk for a while, you know. It's like, it's not like I can't explain it, it's like you know, she wants to share with me and I want to share with and I was so afraid that Jodie would come between that. Because like, like, as much as, you know, I have a love for her mother. I would soon loose her mothers love then Jodie's. Because Jodie is done like lots for me and she's done so much for me, I don't want to loose her. But, you know it would be like, it would like taking and saying well which one do you want to loose, your brother or your mother? You know and then you have to take your pick one that you love and not the other one. It's so hard to do and you know I thought, if she would have done that, I told myself, it wouldn't bother me. But if she would have done that I don't know what I have done. If she said you can't be there Sunday because I don't want to share my family with you. I thought, oh crap, because she says that, it was just such a beautiful thing like somebody really cares of a change. 0:25:42.3</p>

<p>And I don't know it just, it just really struck me and I felt so - I can't explain the warm feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a really good feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah for once in my life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what was happening with Jodie. All of the sudden it was, you see that person that is so important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See but it was, I guess it was almost like my father, in a way. I know that sounds funny in way, it's a little bit different relationship but it's not all that different. I think, you know when I start talking about. The other thing that I think about is like my mother and I think I felt like my mother did the same thing. That she, came between my father and me. And it was like saying, oh well like which one do you want? Well I didn't see my father very much, I guess I pick my mother. You know, well I said okay, if I could only have one I'll take my mother. But its just, you know, I don't know. 0:26:42.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's like why should you have to pick.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you have both of them and why can't you have both of them. What's so terrible about two people that you care about and they care about you. You know. But see like I'm always afraid that that's going to happen. I'm always afraid like Jodie's going to think, like I'm trying to take her mother way from her. And I'm not. You know like, I know it's her mother, you know. But it's like her mother's this type of person that she can share with lots of people. And there's no reason why she can't. You know Jodie's going to be away for two years or three years. And so is Yolanda. I'm going to be here. So it's it nice to know that there's somebody around that, you know, can share almost like a daughter mother relationship, you know. </p>

<p> And like I can't with my own mother, because like, I don't know. I love my mother, I love my mother lots more than like anybody else that's been my mother. But I just don't, I can't talk to her, I can't. If I could talk to her, I feel like I'm in the same room as she is, she just doesn't listen. You know, and it's like, and I know that's, I feel that way and I think there's reason for it. Because when she, I don't know. It's just like, I can't understand why my own mother would do that. What, like. When you start to talk about something, and she just takes and turns the subject like you not important enough to talk about. That's what she was telling me. You got a problem, so what. 0:28:08.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She turns you away. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's what it is. You know, it's just like, you know, like my own mother does that to me. I'm just, I don't know, I just can't understand that, I don't know why. And I don't why, why we can't come together at all. And we've been like that ever since I've been a little kid and I never realized it, but we have been. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it really hurts and it's confusing too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like, I just don't, I don't know why is what it is. Like I don't know why I can't talk to my mother I don't know why she won't listen. Oh you know Jodie says alright, so now you're going to therapy, she's not. You're understanding that there are, and she can't face it that she's part of the reason that you. You know, because I guess parents have a tendency to do that. Because something is wrong with the kid, they blame them selves and then don't want to help. You know, not only want to help, they don't want to face that there's a problem. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: and I guess you feel you should be able to talk to her. She's your mother, you should be able to talk to her. 0:29:08.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know, just like, I don't know. It seems to me like a natural thing. If you've got a woman that you live with, well I lived with her till I was eight years old anyway and then you I went to see her. I went to see her almost every month when I was younger. And it's like, you feel like there should be something there. And it's just like nothing. She remembers like the same things I remember. A couple of little incidents. And that's it. I still feel, I feel like I was never there. I said I was with you for eight years, can't you remember anything else about me? Anything that I did that was abnormal? Anything that I could maybe work on. She says no, you know. 0:29:48.6</p>

<p>Alright, so I know part of it is in my mind and I've locked it away, but, she could help to open that door. She could and I know she could. If she would just let go and say there must have been some times when I was screaming moody or something, because I am that way. I don't show my emotion usually my crying or anything like this except for now, you know, like lately. But like I would get very, I would get very, like cold and hard. And I was like I hated myself that way. But it was like I wouldn't let anybody come near me, really near me. And, and it was, you know. It was an awful feeling. It was like I had to make up fantasy people. Because like I guess maybe was because of the people that I cared about didn't care about me. 0:30:45.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was with your mother still, you're talking about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I don't know if it went that far back or not. It probably did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I heard you saying that you wanted to her to give you something or tell you something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To help me open a door, like when I was, she said I was like lots of time when this was little, this is one thing she did say. She said, when you didn't want to talk to anybody, you wouldn't. And I just kind of looked at her and said what do you mean by that? You know, it's like, I guess I would probably do that. I probably was in a dream world even then, when I was a kid. Because I didn't like what I was living in and you know, whatever. I know when, little kids always do pretend though. When I was a little, I used to always play with the little boys. I don't think there was little girls around in my neighborhood. I would play with little boys, I would play cowboys and Indians all the time. And then watch TV when that was on. 0:31:36.8</p>

<p> But I don't know maybe that went all the way back to there. Because I know it was like an escapism. It's just like I hate the world the way it is, and I hate the people the way the, you know, the way I am with people and the way that people are with me. And so in my dream world everybody loves me. So why not, you know. And it's like, I guess it was like, otherwise I probably would have gone completely out of my mind. Because, like how can a little kid live with out any kind of love. I shouldn't say, well I think that I have love when I was a little baby. But I mean, you know, after that like when I got older, I just felt like nobody cared. And you know it's just I don't know and I can't understand why I went into that. But like I went into that period, like. I was just, I was really funny, like I'd be in school and I'd be reading novels and I'd be. You know, I just I don't really remember, like, lots of my life. And such, because of that. You know like, I had the dreams like through, it's be like I shut out lots of things that I know of. And I can remember certain instances when things really hurt me, that I can remember. 0:32:54.6</p>

<p> But like, I don't remember lots of things about, you know, everyday life and things like this. Like it was just to me a big bore. And so I, I mean, the first year out high school, I was saying was a big bore. I'd go home and I'd watch TV and I'd escape into the boob tube. And I don't know I just, I can't understand. Maybe it's because I can understand why I did it. And that's why everything bugs me. And I know that there must have been something when I was real little that I just, like, not just something. But lots of things that I just couldn't take. 0:33:25.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what you want to find out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like, like there must have been some kind of routine, you know that my mother was bed ridden, and like, I don't know. You know and like maybe I felt like I didn't have a mother or father, so I had to make up these people that did love me. My brother loved me, at least that's what they say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're trying to understand it, you're trying to find where it started.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, figure it out where it started. I never realized that about this dream world. That I know I did it when I was eight and nine. Like when I was at the orphanage. But that's when I started and I remember, I did that there. I can't remember when I was like a little kid, what I did. It's almost like I don't know, except with this little instances, like I didn't even exist before I was eight. I mean, that's a weird thing, you know and you say, well, I think I've been around, I can remember a couple of times when I got hurt and one time when my brother would beat me up. And you know that's about it. When I wasn't in the hospital. 0:34:23.8</p>

<p> I don't know, it's just like, it just, it's very frustrating for me. Because if I knew where it started and knew how it started I could maybe get rid of it. You know, in some way shape or form. Like, I had, I started having one of those dreams again and I remember that I was, I was with this one fellow and he was one of my guards. And he took me and he shook me. And I was going to have - I was being tortured or something. Oh you can't do that to me, you know and all this bullshit. And this is the first time I got really violent that I was no it wasn't me, you know. That's the first thing I do I say no it's wasn't me because I don't do anything that is violent. I said, yes it was me and all of the sudden I could see her saying you're hurting me because he hurt you. And you can't get back at him, so now you're hurting me. And I go, wait, wait a minute, you know. This was like something I hadn't told that. And so now all of the sudden I'm thinking wait a minute. And then I said wait, wait, analyze what you were saying. 0:35:32.3</p>

<p>And so, what I feel is like whatever it is, like if I get back at some fellows lots of times. And sometimes I do, like I like to be mean to certain people. And I guess it's partly because it's like somebody hurt me and I couldn't get back a them and I couldn't get back at the person that hurt me. You know, like my, well I guess my father he's dead, hoping to get back at him. Or my brother because he doesn't like communicating with me. And it's like, maybe that's one of the reasons I do have a problem with fellows. Because at one, in one hand I want them, but then like where did this come from then. You know like whatever he's. Unless it's like one of the men in my life hurt. Like my father and I try to back at my brother, by saying my brother doesn't love me or, you know it might be just that. Because like, usually in my relationships with boyfriends I'm not that way. 0:36:22.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you're trying to get back, just to get back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it it's, to just person, but it might just be, like I feel like I want to get back at somebody because somebody hurt me. You know just taking it really broadly. That's a possibility too. But I just, it's just like, it was weird because it just came up and it was like usually I can take control over these things. You know like, what's going to happen, is what I'm going to make happen. You know. Like this thing wasn't like that, and now I'm going wait a minute. Hold it. Yeah, like the subconscious was coming out, you know, and it wasn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's telling you something that you didn't plan on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. And then I go ooops. You know. So that came out there. And I thought oh my god, you know. So, I don't know, I don't know where this, you know like, where the hurt, I don't know where the hurts coming from in that sense, and who I'm trying to get back at. But I, there is something there, now I feel like I trying to rebel. You know, for some reason or at some person, I don't even know who. Alive or what. But I don't know, I just. 0:37:29.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could stop now and just be angry. Like just be angry, like make your face be angry. And be it. What would really come to your mind?</p>

<p>0</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I could be angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, be angry. Be it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All I could think of was you god damn son of a bitch. [laughing] that doesn't tell much to whom or what. But, when I think of anger that's all that I can think of is coming back with something like, you know like an angry inclination and then that's it. I'm done that's my anger. It's spent. But, I don't know. I can't, you know the first thing of when anger was I thought of Jodie. I guess maybe I'm kind of mad at her. Because she's trying to orient, take me life again and turn it around and I just want to turn it around again. Maybe that it. That part of it's that I'm kind of angry with her. 0:39:08.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is she turning it around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: See like, I'm starting to get a little bit</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you see it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all the people that you know that I was starting to get to like. I was starting to get to like some of the people and their started to get to accept me. It's taken like five long months. Now if I start in another dojo it's going to take a long time again. You know like it takes a long time for people to start.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now she's telling you to get out of something that good for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For me it is. I feel it is anyway. And like I don't know like I'll probably finish up a two more classes. And I'll finish up and then it I really feel like this is really be a trauma for me, I just won't quit for a while. 0:39:43.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're in a real bind because you want to keep that but you also want to keep her friendship and you can't be angry at her and keep your friendship. </p>

<p>PATIENT: True. And that's very true and like. But like I don't even know how -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: it's so much that is necessarily true . </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that's it either. But you know, I think it's like I am angry with her in certain ways. I don't know if it's just of Judo or what. Maybe it's just because I feel like. I feel like, well aerobics for one thing. It's just taking that is one. She invited me into that and again, it's like saying, it's like a rejection in it's self. Because it's like saying I wanted you here, oh no, no, no never mind you're here and I don't want you here anymore. Maybe you're getting well and I'm kind of mad because other people are starting to notice you and like the teacher wanted me to do a demonstration with her. And then another girl. 0:40:37.3 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like she's kind of playing with you or something. Like all of the sudden, [overlapping talking]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like I'm putty and she thinks she can keep turning me this way and that way. So I figured maybe in this way it's going to be good then. Just to get out of her life, completely. Out of anything she does. And this is why I came to the conclusion I should be running. Because I do want to stay fit, I do want disciple, I do want the exercise. And I don't want any of that frustration. Because it's just, it's not worth it. And then she came out with something like, [inaudible], her teacher, he can teach you judo. And I says, ah that's nice. But then I'm not going then. 0:41:13.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell her what you just said about her, that you feel like she's just turning you around and all of the sudden</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know maybe it would be better thing if I did, because I do feel that. I feel like, you know like, alright so care lots about this person. But like Jesus, I'm a person too. I'm an adult person and I'm not a child that you can mold in this way and that way, you know. And it's like, so I do follow lots of things that she does and I admit it. Because well partly, because like I thought well if she does the things that are in and she does the things are good. So let me try it. Nine time outs of ten I like them. I don't stay in them, because she does them, I'm only introduced to them because she does them. And then lots of times I like them. If I don't like them, then I don't do them. It's as simple as that. 0:41:56.8</p>

<p> Like there are things that she said that she's liked. There is movie stars, all sort of things that she's liked and I don't. And I'll say it, I'll say sorry I just don't feel that way. Like my reading course, she shifted it on purpose. You're going to take that, it's more money then going to Roosevelt. And she said "it's more money there." And I said "yeah but it's also college credit, it's like two things at once. I'm getting comprehension, which I need more than speed and I'm getting my three hours, you know, that starts me off in college." She says "well you should go to Evelyn Woods, they've got, they'll get you up to 800 word a minute." Well what's the use if I don't know what I've read, you know like if I'm going to read over something five times and still not get the main points. And you know like what the author is trying to say underneath. I said that's what I need right now. I have to learn to think. I said, like if I can't think why read at 800 words a minute or 2000 words a minute or whatever. </p>

<p> So she said "okay" you know and she did it real snotty like. Which she says "this is testing you" you know I wanted to make sure you wanted to go into what you wanted to go into and that you couldn't change. I said something like "this was okay for somebody else, but not for me" And she says I was very proud of you. And I think to myself, why do you have to play these games with me. You know, I'm went into the reading course because I wanted to go into the reading course. And why do you have to play these, this is one of the things that bug me. Why does she have to play these games with me? And then she says "why I'm so afraid." She doesn't have to be afraid anymore. You know, about what she says and how she says it. If she feels something, say it. Come right out and say it, don't be coming around and, and being snide and sarcastic and things. This hurts me lots more than just coming out and telling me something. She says I'm so afraid. And I thought. 0:43:41.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what it sounds like, you know, like you just want things to be direct and out in the open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't. Alright at one time maybe I did need it. Because like maybe every time I said something I said oh Jesus, like I'm doing something wrong, which is true. I did. But like I don't feel that way anymore. I just want people to be honest with me. The thing that bugs me right now are people who are nice and funny and who turn around, you know like, they're someone else behind your back. And I can't stand that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're half of it though, is that it's hard for you to be out in the open too. It's like it's hard for you to tell her that you're angry at her or that, you know that it hurts that she would want to, to shut you out from her mother and like those things are really hard for you to say. 0:44:23.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's hard for me to say, because I don't know how she's going to take them. You know, and it's like it's funny because I shouldn't feel that way because she's says she's so honest in her relationships with people and yet she says things like this one fellow that she talks to and they are very honest with each other. She says we always end up hanging up on each other. We can never have a relationship. So see at the same time, I'm afraid to say something to her, because then I'm afraid that we're going to get on that kind of a relationship. If I'm really honest with her, she's going to come out with "oh god" you know and then, you know. And so, again it's like I don't know what to do, she doesn't know what to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm realizing that. Say I'm afraid to be honest with you, because you told me that you have relationship with him and it was too honest and I'm afraid if I'm honest with you that, you know, it will make you go away or whatever. 0:45:11.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess that's the best thing to do is just get it out with her, but I, crying. I just don't know what to do, because I don't know how she's going to take it. I don't' know how I'm going to take it. And yet like I do say one things is, this is very true. I have friend at work now and this girl is so honest with me. You know like, she, she'll say look don't say anything to this person because this person goes back and says everything all around, just toomp [ph] right on the line. And I know she seems like she liked you, but she's done it to others and she just does not like you and you know. Alright it hurt, but it was a lot better for me to know that this person was they way they are and then I just shut that out, I just said the hell with you, because I don't need you. It's a lot easier to say to somebody you don't care about. You know. But it's like this girl is very honest with me. She says trume [ph]. She just drops it, if you don't like it, I'm sorry but it's dropped. You know. 0:46:07.8</p>

<p>And like alright, I do admit, like at one time she had to be so careful how she said something. She had to build me because like, I was so low. That if you didn't do that to me, I would run to pieces. You know, but I still have lots of problems. But at least now I want to, I want to be in a real worlds. Not in one that looks nice and is rose colored and everything. Because I know it's not. I know it's a shitty world and that's what it is. And were in it. But I just, I don't know, I just want people to be honest with me. I want somebody. I guess maybe that's part of it too, like I felt like my parents didn't really love me. And they said they did. And all this other baloney. And all their actions were something that were against what, you know. And it's like saying, I don't know, it's like saying, you know be honest with me. Tell me what you [overlapping talking] 0:47:00.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what's important to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess, I guess maybe that's one of the reasons that I, that the dream world was kind of real to me to. Because, like I didn't know where in the heck I was with anybody. You know, people were real nice to me and then when you turned around and walked away they were talking behind your back. And all this boloney. Like I've been through that. Like from little one at least from 13 on. I know that for sure. And like, I can't stand that kind of relationship with somebody and like this was were getting into. She's afraid to say certain things to me and I'm afraid to say certain things to her. And it's, it's not right. And I know it's not right and I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I guess I'm going to come right out and tell her. It's going to be hard because see, again like it's very hard for me. It took me two days to get up the nerve to just say what I said this morning. And that wasn't all of it. You know. And it's just, I don't know. I guess I'm partly to blame too then. Because like I won't come out and tell my feelings either. But, it's just such a big mess. 0:47:59.0</p>

<p>And I don't want I want to be cut off her mother. Because it would be, you know like, I have had enough of that rejection bit. And like, if I haven't done anything. And this is the way I feel, you know like. I didn't do anything I might have done something before. Maybe it was partly my fault when my mother got sick. I don't know. You know. But I know that I haven't done anything to her mother and that there's no reason why she should keep me from somebody that I care about and who cares about me. You know. You know I don't know what I did when I was a kid. I must of done something, because you know like things just don't happen like that if you didn't. You know. But I just I don't think I could take loosing her too now. Because I don't have my brother, I don't have my mother, my fathers dead, my grandfathers dead. And you know like who do I go when I want somebody. And you know like she can give me love. It's like when she says good bye or when she says hello, we both kiss her hi. And you know like, I don't call her mom yet. But if she asked me to, I would. But it's just like, I've got somebody there that I know cares. And she's cared right from the beginning. You know. 0:49:08.8</p>

<p>It's not like right, my foster mother [inaudible at 0:49:12.5] says she cares and I can talk to her. But like, for six years she didn't care and that just keeps coming up to me. You know she says she cried and she thought about me all the time and oh this baloney. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you didn't know that. 0:49:24.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know that and like it's hard for me even to believe it now. But it's like, it like with her, she's just like. The first time I met her, it was always like, this and that. At first she was a little pushy too. It was like, pushy because like I couldn't take it. You know, I understood how her sister in law is. You know my girlfriend's sister in law's like that. She was for a long time, she didn't like my girlfriend's mother. Because my girlfriends mother, just, she is that way. She wants you to go with them. She wants you to have fun. She wants to be with you. She wants to, you know. And like, Janie couldn't understand it. And like I couldn't understand it either. I felt like, oh Jesus, stay away. Not so fast. You know, like do I trust you, or don't I trust you. 0:50:10.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: this is continued on tape one through five. Tape one through five. This is February 3rd continued. Continued from the last tape. </p>

<p>PATIENT: - black girls, and I thought well maybe it's because I felt rejected lots and I was from a broken home and one of the other black girls was too and you know just because like they're black they felt second rate, you know. Because that they way people made them feel. And I was a foster kid, I was made to feel second rate. And I felt second rate. I thought maybe that's what kind of brought us together. But now when I think about it it's not just that. It's like well the one girl, more than the other, I think. Well maybe not, maybe it's, maybe it is the way it was. Because like there were raised as blacks mostly. Well one was a woman of the streets, she told me, she told me that. And now she's been more or less like a sophistic. She goes and buys $100 suites, $150 suites and things like this. And the other one, she's starting to get very hard towards people because like too many people have hurt her. 0:51:18.6</p>

<p> And like, I don't' know, I think I was closer to her a little while ago, when she started like floundering and didn't know you know, like what to do, but she wanted this one fellow to really love her. And I like I think I felt close to her because like I can feel love and like there's of people who can't. There is lots of people that are so hard that don't care. You know. Or it's like are so mixed up they don't care or they never learned to love or whatever it is. It made me feel good that at least I knew that I had love at one time. Because like my heart went out to her and I kept think, okay you know like what can I do to help. What can I do, you know. It was just a natural thing. Like I didn't want her to feel that way, because I knew I felt like that, I know how awful it feels. 0:51:55.6</p>

<p> And yet it's like, now she's starting to get so hard. She says she is, I don't kind of believe it, because like, like I know she, her nature. She might be doing like I did and out a shell around herself for a while. But I don't even want her to do that. But it's just like, she could do that, and you know Tanya to was. She was like, she had like a, I don't know. Like a natural giving for people. But see like I didn't trust her either. I was paranoid as hell when she started doing things like leaving me little treated and things she baked and things and you know giving of herself. And I thought oh my god, you know, what does she want. You know. She's got to want something. And it was that I was going out with the boss and she's going to butter me up and it was like I found myself being so paranoid that she was just doing that because she didn't really care about me. 0:52:46.4</p>

<p> See this is the way I've always felt. They don't really care about me as a person. That's definite, you know when I meet somebody, like definitely, they don't care about me as person. They always want to use me. It's not right, it's not even one thought of mine. I either have to act like somebody else or I have to I don't know I really can't explain it. Or I have to be, I have to be the sophistic to the fellow and then maybe they'll be, lets see how can I say this. They'll be interest in, but they'll never know what I'm really like, see. I'll always out on this big front that I'm sophisticated or I'm somebody else or I'm working to be somebody else. </p>

<p> And it's like I really, really did, that she didn't like for that and she doesn't like me for this or for that or the other thing. It's not really liking. It's like she needed me for this or for that or the other thing. And I said to myself, I said she calls me, like what reason would she possibly have, She might she say well how is. Is he done this. She's telling me all these things she's been doing and I'm going oh my god she really likes me, you know. Like you don't know. With Jodie I could see it because it was like almost like I could say it like this way. That I used to think and I don't know maybe it really is a feeling that you really has for me now. But like that was the thing it was like an ego thing. Because she said like I was lots like her before I was in therapy and everything. You know. Like she says like, you're floundering around and that's why I when I met you, that's why I wanted to help you. Because you were a fish and n water. 0:54:16.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so even when it is real, it's hard for you to believe that people care about you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, see but I guess it's because I never realized that it was, real in just about every situation I was in. But I just like there's only so much you can do and sometimes, like with my stepmother. Now I realize it. She must of loved me a hell of lot. Because otherwise she would have kept me there, kept the money in and kept me working and you know doing her work. And watching her kid and not really caring two bits about me. But she realized she couldn't do anything for me. And so like in a way, she did a hell of a lot right there for me, by just saying well, sorry I can't do it, I love you, but I can't do it and let me give you to somebody who can help you. 0:54:58.0</p>

<p>But again, like how do you tell a kid like that, who was twelve years old and just starting, just needs a mother. Just like somebody like, you know her I am with a 70 some years old woman when I'm in my teens. How in the heck is she supposed to be able to relate to a teenager now a days. You and like here you are and you go to talk to somebody who is younger like her real daughter lived up stairs. She was like maybe thirty something when I came, late thirties. Alright, now you try to confide in her. And then you find out that you're stepmothers finding out everything that is going on. And here you're talking to her as a mother and you know when you talk to your mother you don't expect your mother to go tell everybody else in the house what your doing. What your feeling you what your thinking, or whatever. 0:55:46.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you found someone you could trust and then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you turn around and you say oh my god here she talking to everybody and their uncle. She tells her kids, she tells all sorts of people. You think ah, here I am with trust misplaced.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look at what the work has done to me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know, here I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like what can I do about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah I don't mind, I didn't feel I had to hide lots of things from my stepmother, but the reason I didn't tell her was that I didn't think she'd understand. And then when you get it from somebody else, it's like a story. You know how stories get when they are, first of all, they are going to be different. And you think, oh crap, and then there is things like I went to see this fellow once on the sly and she had told me to do. She said look the only way you're get [Monic ph] to let you go is like do it on the sly a couple of times and she'll kind of of get an idea that you're doing it and then you'll be able to do it. So I knew it, she goes down tells my mother that I was doing it. I was with my girlfriend who was her daughter, my stepmother's granddaughter and her boyfriend. And then my boyfriend was a friend of her boyfriends. So like, you know like, this was the way it was. And I went out with her and then they came out and said I was the one that it, it was all my idea, I'm a rotten dirty little kid because I'm taking off and seeing this fellow. And my mother got really mad at me. She finally let me, but she was mad, see because the story came out that I started the whole thing, I made up the whole thing. I asked my girlfriend to go along with me to do and it was like all the other way around. They were almost forcing me to, saying like if you like the guy, come out with us and we'll. You know. And I said to myself Christ, how do you trust somebody's that's like this? So I got cold towards her. I got real cold towards her. I wouldn't do anything for her, I wouldn't talk o her, I wouldn't go up and see her. And you know like, what do you do then. And then you're pulling away from one friend and that hurt her daughter. Took my boyfriend away from me and then it was like wait a minute you're friend. Friends don't do that. I wouldn't do that to you're boyfriend. I don't play up to your boyfriend. And here you are playing up to mine. You can't understand why he likes you. I mean like, monopolizing the conversation, flirting with him with the eyes, the whole baloney going with us out on a date. I mean lets face it, if it's a friend that's one thing, if it's a boyfriend you just don't do that. Unless you really want something. 0:58:01.8</p>

<p> And I just got to the point, like I said well now this person doesn't like me. Who likes me? Who do I have that, you know, like I can turn around to and say. See this is why I got to the point like I thought that there must be something wrong with me. Because people don't do that. You don't use anything like a dishrag or a mop or something. You don't use another person. Unless there is something really wrong with you or there's something wrong with the person. One of the two. And because like it happened, it happened to me so much. And then sometimes when it didn't happen to me I thought it happened to me. I thought it was all me. I thought it was some kind of world's worst villain. You know. You know like again when you're a little kid and when you're like a teenager and you really haven't done anything bad. You tried to follow all the rules, you tried to mostly. And you just feel like, you almost feel like you whole existence is rotten. I mean like your rotten right done to the core. Because like otherwise there must be the real inside you. You must be really rotten, because nobody loves you. Nobody cares about you. You know. And you sit and say well thanks a lot, you know. Like almost like, a couple of times I just thought well why was I ever born? 0:59:07.7 </p>

<p> You know like, I felt myself it wasn't just because people didn't love me, but it was like when they didn't love me it was like a showing of like what was inside like I wasn't anything. And it really was, it was like, like a real awful feeling. I went around and said what am I good for and look what so and so was doing and look what this is doing. It was always like I was comparing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you had to believe that, so many people used you. 0:59:37.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was like, Like what was I good for. And like who wants, who wants to have a feeling, like the only good for is for people to use you and when they're done with you, they can throw you out. And get somebody else and use them. You now what I mean, like you don't realize that people that use other people, you know again when you're small, like the ones that did use me. I look back at them now and I think oh my god, how could I possibly feel inferior to them? And really now even. I can say that now. But they, they helped make me feel I already started to feel myself. I had already felt like I was, you know, like not as good as other people. I guess maybe that came from the feeling that I felt like I did something that hurt my mother and that's why my mother went away. 1:00:26.4</p>

<p> And you know, I don't think I felt like that with my grandfather, but I did feel that way about my father and my mother. That they went away because I did something and I guess it just. It just grew that I felt like, you know like anybody could make me feel inferior. They can still do it a little bit, if they are very intimidating. And then I'll get, and then I'll catch hold of myself. It's like to hell with you Charlie. You know, but the first initial thing is to say oh you know okay. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh poor me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right, right and it's like this young punk kid at work does this. And she's like oh, you know like I see lots of things like she like a child with most ways. She's my age, but she's like a child. And yet, she'd come up and say smart alecy to me and I'm huh. You know wait a minute, why am I letting this kid say something like this to me for. Then I'm felling like you know like I'll in the mirror and I'll say Jesus, I'm getting fat or something, something stupid that had nothing to do with what she said. But it's like, it's like my reaction to her is like saying almost like yeah I guess your right, I guess I've just. 1:01:31.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, and that's really frustrating, I mean why do you keep doing that to yourself you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet, like I'm getting a little better now, I think, because like the men in the back when I work for then, they make me feel so good. I mean just like, they still come by my desk. One comes by almost every day and it's like oh hi, they treating me terrible, when are you coming back, you know, we want you back. All of this and it's like, it's like saying like they really cared. I don't - the funny thing is that I don't know why. I sit down and say why do they care. You know. What did I do for them? Well okay so I emptied a couple of ashtrays. They said they wanted coffee a few times and I did their work pretty well I talked to them and when they wanted to talk to me I was there to listen. But I thought, ah so what I've done this for these men too. I've done this like almost all my life to people and people haven't reacted. You know and all of the sudden a whole body of eight men, I say oh geez well what's going on. 1:02:27.4</p>

<p> But these men are men like I could, like the first couple of days I was there. You know, went into their heart. I mean and they went into mine too. Because alright you said the small partners. But these are the partners they get you to the back to basics. They're not the ones that money is the only thing that's in their life. Like my other bosses are. And they're so, I don't know, there just so gentlemanly, they were so, I don't know so feeling for another person, you know. And like these other people, this one, oh this one I got now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It time to stop. 1:03:01.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I'm not getting any place today anyway, it's one of those days. One thing I noticed though I am starting to go back a little further. Like it's correlating all the way through my life. Things that are coming out, you know. Its like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: it sounds like that, like things keep falling in patterns, you keep seeing parallels.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that go all the way back, like even. But before they used to go back to like just when I left home. And now, like that really shocked me, you know when you said well how old were you started, and I though wait a minute. You know, I think maybe I started when I was a little kid and I never realized it. I always blamed it on my foster homes. I think it went back further than that. 1:03:51.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 9:15 next week right, </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. 1:04:04.6</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is (inaudible), right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like an online personality quiz or -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm going to set you up with someone right after. (Laughter) Right, match.com, don't they have stuff like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh well, I (laughter), yeah. I think some have longer ones than others, but, yeah, they're good...the MCMIs actually are really good too. That's more of a personality type than like their ones that are more for like diagnosis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of the first one that you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could tell when they were sort of like throwing out a little sinker (ph) like, oh, maybe you are suffering from this problem -</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - that problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - the MCMI I don't think is as...some of the tests are more like predictive of lying and things like that that they use for people who are in jail who are trying to pretend they're insane or things like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I like them. Anyway, how was your test this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There were two actually on the same day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a psychology on - [0:00:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they were the same day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they were the same day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't tell me that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I guess I didn't (inaudible at 0:01:02) but, yeah, they were the same day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did they go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They went pretty well, they went better than I was expecting before I went into them, but I probably could have done better if I had stuck more consistently to the plan that I had made that we talked about making -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - so I went home and made a plan for the rest of my weekend and then I sort of followed it, but not really, I sort of left everything until the last day and a half and then packed in as much as I could then, but it was hard to do everything in that amount of time because it was easy to feel like I just worked for like a few hours. Because I did do enough work on it then to be prepared, but it would have been better if I had started earlier and I didn't get like sick of it after however much time I was working on it and I would have gotten more hours of studying in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What...I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then when I went in and took the tests, it didn't feel like I had failed to prepare either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you felt like you did okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I felt like I did okay but that I could have been a little bit more consistent to my plan overall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the past has your goal been to just get by like I borrowed -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:02:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that it was kind of like you weren't like I hope I get a 95 -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I wasn't really shooting for like a specific -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's your goal now at Chicago State?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My goal now at Chicago State, I haven't been 100 percent clear about what it is, but I've just been thinking that I want to get like at least a B plus, you know, in my classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what kind of a grade...well I guess they were lower -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but what kind of grades were you getting at Oberlin (sp?) like C pluses generally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It varied from semester to semester, in the last semester, the one before this one that happened in the spring before I got asked to take a semester off, I got a D in one class, which was why I had to take a semester off. And let me see if I can remember all my other grades...I got a B+, a B-, and I can't remember if it was a B or another B- but pretty average aside from the one class where I believe messed everything up.[0:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is the workload, or like the work, I guess, quality more like compared to Oberlin, did you find it's easier at Chicago State?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's definitely easier at Chicago State in terms of what's expected. There's like the same amount of work, but at Chicago State there's a lot more reading in your textbook, which is something that is discussed amply in class; whereas at Oberlin it was more likely to be something where there'd be the same amount of reading but it would be supplementary to what was going on in class and it was harder to catch up on everything if you hadn't done the reading.</p>

<p>And in general there's a lot less paper writing, which is also something that's been hard for me to do, I have a lot more -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Less at Chicago State?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less at Chicago State, Chicago State's way more about tests comparatively speaking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do have question of why did you decide Chicago State after all this? I never really even asked you that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I went through a lot of different choices basically and it was the best one that still hadn't gotten up to its application deadlines over the summer, that was basically the consideration, the - [0:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, did you look at ones closer to home -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did, I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - in Indiana and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - looked at some other ones, and a community college and a ton in Indiana and I -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you just missed the deadlines of all those?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't miss the deadlines with those, those I also had a chance at. I also looked at like other private universities, which it would have been a much bigger stretch to get into and also most of them, their application deadlines had passed and those why those were disqualified for me. But I basically decided that I felt like I would have a little bit more in common with the average Chicago State student somehow than I would at a community college or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did your parents feel about shelling out more after all this happened -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - how did they feel about the money situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The money situation isn't really the biggest concern for them, I think it's more seeing me appearing so directionless and unsure of where I'm going because I think that, compared to how much Oberlin costs, Chicago State isn't really that much of a consideration for them, it's like astronomically less. And because I hadn't paid for the next semester or anything, I'm spending the same amount at Oberlin and there's just this one semester sort of tacked onto the bill, I don't think it affected them that much. [0:05:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the heat's on, sorry, I was wondering what the (inaudible). Because some people would say really think back...oh, it's raining, that's what's happening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe? No, maybe it's the heat, I'm losing my mind, sorry.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't been here this time of year yet, so hearing noises. Yeah, some parents would be, even if they had ample finances -</p>

<p>CLIENT: They would still be annoyed about it, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really pissed off -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - about potentially wasting their money and then having to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - shell out more when they could just pay for community college -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but your parents weren't really concerned with that. [0:05:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's strange because that's the furthest thing from my parents' mind, like my parents' reaction...well part of their reaction was like maybe you can decide you want to change your major if you get really excited about something else and spend even more time going back to college, so they weren't really thinking about they want to spend as little as possible. But that's partly because it's always been something that they really emphasize is like having the best possible quality education and I'm like getting the most out of it and like enjoying it and putting all of yourself into it is like a goal number -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is that really something that's a goal for you? Because I'm hearing different things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's not really, not much of a goal for me I would say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get the most out of college and to....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to get the most out of it is more of a goal for me now than it was in the past because part of what inevitably happened - and I knew it was going to happen once I was thinking about going to a different school for the semester and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - getting my 12 credits so I can go back to Oberlin, I knew that wherever I would go, even if I was looking at the choices in Indiana or wherever else - and Chicago State's one of the better ones with that - I knew that it would make me appreciate Oberlin more and realize that I have actually had way more interesting class offerings and professors and like way more interesting students in my classes and (inaudible at 0:07:08) interesting resources going on there that in retrospect I'm thinking like why didn't I make more out of that now. And so I do want to make more out of it, but I'm definitely not valuing it as much as my parents are. [0:07:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever feel a bit entitled?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit -</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, I don't mean that to come out -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, I totally understand why you would ask that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because some people would say look at you, you screwed up this -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - really good private education and then your parents are like, oh, don't worry about it, shell out more -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Safety (inaudible at 0:07:38) yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll shell out more -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I definitely am aware of how lucky I am in that respect because I know other people who didn't have the same situation but also had problems at Oberlin and who came from families that weren't as well off as mine and they ended up not being able to continue going to Oberlin or having a chance to, but not really trying because it was sort of out of their reach. And so I am pretty aware of that. [0:08:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think that that might be something that could prove motivating, I mean, I know you're big on recognizing, "oh, I guess that is a little like ridiculous to me and then I'm making" or that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - "that I expect myself to be smarter than everybody," you know, in some sense that we were talking about last week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the fact too that you kind of potentially wasting your parents' money -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, and I'm more aware of that than ever before because I wasting their money earlier when I wasn't really paying attention or getting really anything out of my classes at college and I mean arguably the same thing was even true in high school too so....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And some people's motivation is "if I don't do well, my parents will cut me off" -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but if you failed out of school, would your parents let you live with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure they would, I'm sure -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And support you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what happens when you do graduate from school? Are you going to probably go home for a while or...[0:09:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's sort of the opposite of what I want because being aware that I've had such a large safety net all the time has made me sort of desire independence more because when...even though I know that looking at other people who don't have that advantage of having parents who can financially support them when things go badly, it made me wish that I didn't have that because I feel like I rely on it too much and so I've consciously tried to aim towards finding things to do that'll let me move out once I'm done with college, and that was sort of my goal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's interesting that you say that though because your actions in order to probably provide an independent lifestyle for yourself at first, you're going to need that college education -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and that degree, so while that's your goal, it hasn't been motivating -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't been -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - enough to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - consistently following it, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to motivate you to succeed and get out there, I mean some people graduate in (inaudible) years and you really want to get the hell out of their parents -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would have - [0:10:03]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I know, I get your point though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so it's interesting to reassess your goals consistently and make sure that your actions are -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually working towards this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, totally. Because even some people who have wealthy parents will say, "well you screwed it up, now off to community college you go," but while it is fortunate, I can see the same way where it perhaps is hindering you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and if you really want a kick in the ass, you could tell your parents something similar like I would like less -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Less support from you -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - less support from you guys -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and then I can actually do this and....</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually, that's something that I mentioned probably for the first time ever after I got the letter from Oberlin saying that I couldn't come back because I talked about how the efforts that I was like maybe I won't go back to Chicago State or to whatever school and I'll just leave college alone for a while - [0:11:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and that was an appealing idea to me for a while and I thought of maybe like getting a job that I didn't need a college degree for and earning enough money to be able to pay to go to community college on my own because I thought that would maybe appreciate it a ton more, just inevitably because it's hard to totally devalue something that you're paying for, it's not impossible but it makes it harder. And I thought about that but I ended up not really going for it in part because I felt a lot of pressure from my parents to sort of go with the easy choice that they presented to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but you know you don't have to get a college education.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. (Chuckles) It's hard not to because that's been sort of presupposed about my life journey by my parents for a while and they've been sort of sending that message to me forever. And I remember thinking about it in college, like one of the whole...not in college, in high school when the whole college process began and you started looking at schools and I remember thinking, "do I really want to do this, like I'm really interested in this or are my parents sort of passing me this idea and saying it's really important and I'm just agreeing with them." [0:12:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I sort of felt like I did and I tried to solve that by...I wanted to go to art school actually when I was first looking at schools, I used to be really interested in photography, and I still am, but I sort of abandoned it as a serious potential career pursuit, and I sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's a complicated answer. Basically I started to doubt my actual level of interest and feel like I thought it was a really appealing idea to be like an artistic sort of person but that the actual reality of being really methodical and detailed and devoted to your craft which was sort of what you have to do to be really successful at something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - like that might have been beyond me. [0:12:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because while you say that your goal is to get back to Oberlin and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - to get your degree, I really, you know, I'm kind of trying to do some motivational interview and I don't know really, you -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm not like 100 percent -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - motivation if this is really -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - sure that that's really what I want to be doing, honestly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's going to make it really difficult for you to work towards a goal if that's not even your goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess what are the reasons for getting your college degree?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Reason number one is that it makes it feel -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is reason number one first like pleasing your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of, yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I made it more convoluted than just that, but that's what it was -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is there a reason number two?</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of, yeah, but I don't know if I felt it intrinsically. There were some things that I felt were important once other people suggested them to me and I can sort of hang onto them more a while but they're not always convincing and part of that came from the therapist that I saw before you actually, the RBT person - [0:14:19]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was her name?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - Indiana. Helen Brown.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Helen Brown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because someone was like asking me and I was like, oh, I wonder who it was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it was Helen Brown -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I might write that down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was talking with her when I first got back from southern Illinois like the beginning of July and I didn't know what my plan was and my parents were pushing me to start looking at schools to go to and figuring out what I was going to do in the fall.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although actually they said they were...what I thought was surprisingly generous and they said, "well we really want you to go back to Oberlin obviously, you know that's what we want, but if you think you need to do something else first before you go to Chicago State or whatever, then that would make sense as well." And I sort of considered that and I didn't know what to really do, whether it made a big difference to wait just a four or five month period to go back to another school and then to go back to Oberlin later or whether I could flip that in terms of the order and - [0:15:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What year is your girlfriend because like I -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's a senior right now too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So she wouldn't be there though if you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - did that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she was -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So was that a motivating factor to get back to Oberlin or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't really because right now what my plan is I don't think I'm going to go back to Oberlin in the spring either -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I think that I'm going to be going to cooking school and/or doing some sort of volunteer work probably in New Orleans, I'm still trying to figure out all the details.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For the spring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, spring and summer -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you would return to Oberlin -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next year, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And is this something...is returning to Oberlin really your goal? Because do you think that you're going to get back there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that I probably will and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because after three years of school, some might say finish it up. [0:15:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this a form of procrastinating and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought about that too, but really what felt hard to me would be going back and like starting my senior year in the midst of everyone from my former senior year graduating and it was sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, because you would still have to do another half year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would still have to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - be there in the winter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because Oberlin makes you spend a full year right in your like senior -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - senior thesis.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so since I wouldn't have been able to graduate on time with the rest of my class -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - it felt like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes more sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I might want to avoid the intense emotional trauma of watching all my friends leave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my girlfriend too, that would have been pretty hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. So that's your plan for the spring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but at first I wasn't really sure whether I should have done that now and be going to Chicago State in the spring -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - and that was really what the question was for me, and Helen Brown sort of convinced me that I needed to not run away from the problems that I was having with responsibility and with not like actually making intelligent choices in my life at school and that if I ignored those and did something else that I wouldn't really want to come back and confront them either. [0:17:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that sort of made sense to me because I was having trouble trying to confront any of those problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The only thing that I do worry about...well was the point of (inaudible at 0:17:24) school in New Orleans or it's to go to New Orleans just randomly and then start cooking school in Chicago?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was looking at a few different cooking schools, none of them were in New Orleans really, there were some in California and some in like -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the person (inaudible at 0:17:37) New Orleans, I think it's a black hole for people who are aimless.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So....</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that would be something to be concerned about. Because I know that community who makes the organic food and finance and stuff -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and I think it, it's kind of the black hole of people who are -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - lacking, yeah, lacking the motivation to find what they want to do -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and kind of stay down there. So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that wouldn't really be what I was doing - [0:17:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - down there, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just want to be careful that you don't end up with planting tomatoes -</p>

<p>CLIENT: For like the rest -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that's what your goal...yeah, if that's your goal, that's fine, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm pretty sure it's not, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I've been meaning to take a semester off from Oberlin for like the past...pretty much since I started I actually asked my parents really early, like two months into my freshman year, they were like it's so early, like maybe you're not really sure and then I tried to ask them again in my sophomore year and they didn't like my plan and they thought that I should do something else but I didn't want to do what they wanted me to do and I couldn't compromise with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I didn't want to compromise with them rather, and then junior year I chose living off campus with my girlfriend instead of having a semester off basically, so I never got around to doing it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what I'd meant to do was do this program that Oberlin has actually in New Orleans where they do different educational outreach things and they work with a different school every year pretty much and they like rebuild classrooms or have out of school arts - [0:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you still do with your Oberlin -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so that would be nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've already been in touch with them about trying to do that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - over some point in the spring and that's what I meant to do for the past three years so I feel like I should do it before I graduate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're more on track with what you were doing -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - before. Okay. So still what are your reasons for getting -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wanting to go -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - your college degree?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - back to Oberlin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really so I don't have to deal with it later -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you definitely want to get the degree from Oberlin or would you want to just...I don't know how it works, like if you spend three years at Oberlin and then you finish up at Chicago State and you get a Chicago State degree?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's how it works.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you want your Oberlin degree after have all of this -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: After I made it so far through that, I....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any sense of because Chicago State is probably a less competitive school than Oberlin as far as I know, is that....</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's something that matters more to my parents, it doesn't really matter as much to me because I think there's very little relative difference between a graduate degree. [0:19:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Because I meant more of the work if you're going into Chicago State with an attitude of...before you were like "well this work is bullshit at Oberlin -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but I still respect my professors and think that they're smart people' is even more of at Chicago State, "well look at these other idiots, like I'm not going to do this work here."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes that's tempting to fall into and I have a problem with it with one teacher in particular who just annoys me a lot, but I've been working really hard to resist that because I keep on reminding myself that I felt exactly the same way when I had the more capable and more engaging teachers and that it's more about me then it is about what the students or teachers are like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, back to so what other reasons to get a college degree? So to please your parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So please my parents and also because I have a pretty aimless future life plan and I know that I might be...I'm actually pretty sure that I'm going to change my mind about what I want to do that my idea of going to cooking school and maybe doing that for a while isn't most likely what I'm going to want to do for the rest of my life. [0:21:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're thinking you're going to probably need that degree at some -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, at some point that I'll be happy that I got it, so I can transition into something else without having to spend three years in my 30s or something going to college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything else that would be extrinsically or intrinsically motivating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, I mean I don't really -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think you'll feel like a sense of achievement or pride for having done all the hard work and finally earning that diploma?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might, but I don't really feel like that right now, but I easily could if I actually transform a little bit the way that I approach in doing schoolwork and how I feel about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because if you actually are putting in the work, it might actually mean something to get the -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - diploma, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to I didn't even work for this, what does a stupid diploma mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's an appealing idea, but I don't think I'm there yet though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think you're there yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well is there any way that you...since Chicago State is maybe empirically a little easier - [0:22:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - than the work at Oberlin and you did minimum work and you managed to scrape by with a C+ kind of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - average wise, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I had like a -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - here probably you could scrape by -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - 2.7 GPA or something, I don't remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a 2.6 something or 2.7.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And at Chicago State you could probably scrape by with maybe I guess a C or a B-?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so wrong with aiming for an A or an A-? Instead of the B+ that you've so....</p>

<p>(Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I so easily set myself...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that you're like I probably will get anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean nothing, really, it would be not that hard for me to reach for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I do think with the goal of going back to Oberlin, if you slack off at Chicago State, I don't know how that's going to help you back at Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's true, it won't at all. What they said to me like technically speaking about what I have to do before I can go back to there is don't get any grade lower than a C, I think, and have like a B average overall, which is lower than what I set up for myself but I could still set the bar a lot higher, it's totally true. [0:23:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because if you're setting the bar for a B+, you kind of know that half-assing the studying at Chicago State will have a good chance of achieving that for you, but what about setting the sights on...I mean, you have nothing else going on you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about finding some motivation and -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - earning some pride in what you do, taking some pride in the academic work that you do and then maybe you won't feel like it's such bullshit work if you actually invest something in that paper or in that studying and take something away from it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've felt a little bit like that and I've gotten something out of some of the classes that I've had at Chicago State and with others and it has felt a little bit more busy work, not methodical - [0:24:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean sometimes you can see the point behind the busy work -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - even though it's annoying to do, you can see how they're trying to set you up, sometimes when they have, I don't know, a school that maybe doesn't have the same kind of standards, they'll say, like maybe a Oberlin (inaudible at 0:24:17), like okay, this paper is due then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But maybe at Chicago State they're more likely to say like, "send me the outline for this paper" -</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly true, although actually Oberlin loves doing that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I hate that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hate that too, that's really annoying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know that's going to be good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, and every -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like designed for you, you're actually going to have to organize (inaudible at 0:24:36).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And every time I don't listen to the suggestion to do that, it never worked out for me as well, so it is going to be helpful for me -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So as much as it's kind of like looking down on this style of busy work, this stuff is probably what's going to help you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - succeed -</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it totally is -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and following their busy work is maybe what you need to do at Oberlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that what it's going to help with is that I always want to cut corners on things because I say to myself well I guess this is sort of worthwhile and I should sort of do it because these motivations that sort of affect me some of the time, but I don't really want to so I'll just cut out all the least interesting parts and that's really what it does - [0:25:18]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I'll still do fine even (inaudible)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I'm wonderful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's easy to think -</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, in those situations have you been working on challenging those thoughts?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like in the situations recently you mean or...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yeah, like with the homework and the challenging the fact that I'm so smart I don't have to....</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been trying to, yeah, but it's hard sometimes because I do have this little instinctive voice that comes out sometimes and says oh -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I'm totally able to challenge this and I'm like, wait, am I really the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well I did bring you...I found this sheet be helpful, okay, so if you want to take a look at that, I had two, but I had to give one away to the last people and I was like I can look at it myself. But here, I will stand over you and hover. So here is where the (inaudible) event - [0:26:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - would go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that would be my assignment or whatever it is that I have to do -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's more like it could be the...it's not just the assignment -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - but having to do the assignment -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - by a certain deadline -</p>

<p>CLIENT: The responsibility or duty or task or whatever it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, and then the consequence...oh, I found the emotion as well, I think it's resentment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, you're -</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not really anger, you know, I think I asked, like some people it's like what is that emotion (inaudible at 0:26:34) and it's like, oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It totally is resentment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it resentment towards society at large, is it resentment towards your parents, is it resentment...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's sort of at heart my parents and I broaden it to have society at large involved as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the consequence would be the, you know, unhealthy and you can put (inaudible at 0:26:54) behaviors as that not doing my work -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - failing tests -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and feeling bad about myself -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - focusing on short-term pleasures, it goes to long-term -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - desire. [0:27:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So here is where the irrational beliefs would go and the irrational beliefs are not the thoughts because that's clear to make that distinctive is that the thoughts are you can get to the irrational belief by going further with the thoughts, you know -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - from the thoughts that your thoughts are, "I shouldn't have to do this" and then you said, "why shouldn't I do this, because I'm smart and I can get by not doing it, I -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's the irrational belief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well yes, the irrational belief is more "I shouldn't have to do" because they have some examples underneath, demands -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: - demands.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so I shouldn't have to do work that I don't want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I can't stand to do work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't stand to do work that I think I'm superior to doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're kind of grading yourself as better as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's the, you know, I'm worth...that's sometimes more it goes with worthless you know, but you kind of are rating yourself as better in this situation, "I'm too good to have to do this work." And then here's where you would dispute where is this belief getting me. [0:28:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is it helping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And where is the evidence to support my irrational belief that I shouldn't have to do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And is it consistent with social reality, I like that phrase.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and does it even make sense that just because you don't want to do something, that you should, you know -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that you say you shouldn't have to do it, so what? Is that logical to think just because you shouldn't like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - don't want to do something that you don't do it? You know? And who says that you shouldn't have to do these things, if everybody else is, why is it logical to think -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - that you shouldn't do them if you want a degree and that's what's necessary. And then you can use...you don't have all those probably because you're not awfulizing (ph) really but can you stand the frustration of doing that work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think this is helpful and then that would be where you would write in here new, you know, I would prefer not to but I can stand it if this is so and - [0:29:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And definitely a repeat of that (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And these are helpful for setting it up at home when I'm not around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I can like look back at my past one -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you can bring it in and we can talk over if you're doing it right, if that's really a belief or if that is in fact your belief because I think sometimes we'll say "oh, that's not what I was really thinking but I was thinking," no, sometimes people will say, "no, I was saying I really would prefer," I said well if you were really thinking that, you would have done it because if you really preferred it, you would have realized, but this is what's important to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you get it and I think that this is something you can work on. So when you went to do your homework because you were supposed to it right when you got home after this -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and you didn't, I assume?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I did that night -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [0:29:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: - because that was my homework just for the next day of school and then I did that and then I came back from school that day and I said, oh, well I said I was going to do the first chapter of my math review but it's Friday, I don't really want to do it yet, I'm going to leave it for tomorrow, and then my parents went away for the weekend which also made it strangely harder to stick to my plan because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They weren't over your shoulder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not that they like to try to be involved and forcing me doing my homework at all, but more because it was more tempting to enjoy having the house to myself because I've been with them a lot over the past several months and it was really nice to have that space, so I sort of wanted to make the most of it and it was easy to justify waiting until a little bit closer to the test to study, so I had this convenient excuse that I made.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it's funny when you say who you're rebelling against, but in the end you're ruining your own goals of...I think the one that might be the most helpful is the goal to have the financial freedom from your parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because even if you're going to culinary school, you're still going to have to probably have Mom and Dad paying the rent - [0:31:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - of wherever you're living and I think...is that something that's important to you, to be financially independent?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is something that's been increasingly important to me and something that I've been thinking about a lot...well I've been thinking about it a lot ever since high school really actually I sort of tried to push in that direction and my parents have, for various reasons which I've already talked about (inaudible at 0:31:22) resisted that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're an only child.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're their baby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they have a great additional control over other things in my life because -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think it's important to realize that who you're really rebelling against, you're rebelling against yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is your -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm actually like falling into the trap.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are the self-defeating behaviors, it's going against your goal, you're saying, "oh, I'm not going to really study tonight because, fuck it, fuck them with their stupid homework, I'm going to do what I want tonight."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not very goal-oriented, you're not looking ahead and I think it's important to have that in mind in your new rational thoughts is, "I would prefer to do this later or not do this at all." [0:32:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "But I know that it's important for me to reach my goal" and say that every single time those thoughts come up and challenge it every single time. And I'm not saying you're not going to have days that you make mistakes -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I try to remind myself of that because I think it was on Saturday, the second day, at the end of the day I hadn't done that much work on Saturday either even though I'd said on Friday I was going to do some on Saturday and I started to panic and say oh, God, I'm not sticking to my schedule and I'm being sort of irresponsible and awful and I said, well it's not that bad, I mean I'm never going to stick to my schedule 100 percent but I just need to try harder tomorrow and that did help, I got more done the next day and then I got more done the next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're not a catastrophizer like "oh no, I haven't done it, now I just as might as well give up," so that's not something that you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is something that I do and that's something that was a lot worse for me in the past and it was easy for me to say oh, God, I haven't done this for the past two weeks and it's such a disaster that it doesn't even matter if I do it now and I'll totally make things even worse for myself. That's what happened in the class I got a D in basically. [0:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So can you say that this week was a success?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in some respects it was a success, but there's still a (inaudible) work -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's still a long way to go, but it's not going to change overnight -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and if it did, you wouldn't have been in this situation, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's on the plate for this week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not as much for this week, just regular readings and I think like a small written assignment, but I also want an assignment due every week (inaudible at 0:33:37).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a lot of time on the train, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I drive in, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you do. Because train time is actually a -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, it's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any way you could take the train?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can and I do it on Mondays when I have three classes back to back, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you bring work with you on Mondays?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's like, what is that, an hour you drive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's almost more than an hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I live in a unfortunate part of Indiana for public transportation. [0:34:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought you just meant generally, which is my impression of all (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, no, it's pretty much true, it's hard to find a fortunate (inaudible) in Indiana.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Crown Point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Crown Point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like a little bit too far south so I can't take the train, I have to take a local bus that goes through like 20 towns in Indiana before it -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you have a car that's available to you. Could you drive to the station or, no, is that not worth it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I could, I never thought of doing that actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you drive to the station and on the train you have no excuse but to do your work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but, yeah, on Mondays I take the bus and it's like a really long bus ride, but then I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - can do work or read -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that might be thing you're setting that as part of your schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's something that you'll be less likely to avoid because it's probably more stimulating than listening to other people's conversations (inaudible at 0:34:45) around you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think maybe even setting yourself up to take the bus more and making sure you have the work available is -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - could be an easy part of your schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That might work, it's just hard because I just started to drive, well I got my license last year -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - but I have just gotten my car for the first time -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - at the beginning of the summer and I spent so long spending forever on buses - [0:35:10]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - transit and especially when I only have one class a day and it's like an hour-long class and it takes me almost three hours to get there by public transportation, it's hard to -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that means that if you really have to utilize that time at home -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - the time that you're not spending on the bus -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and maybe you can outline, "this is how much time I would have been on the bus today and that I should have gotten it done and that is how much I have to do at least minimum today."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be a good approach, yeah, because I'd have to appreciate all the time I'm saving by driving, it's apparent to me (inaudible at 0:35:42) every day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I think, from what we were talking about last week, it seems like you kind of lack basic study skills.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you've never really had to implement them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well that's totally 100 percent true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you do your readings, are they books that you own or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're books that - [0:36:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - articles, I don't know like what's most of what's going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's mostly books that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Text.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - there's some like [horse packs] (ph) that are just articles collected into a book that they sell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you highlight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't highlight, I underline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do, oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is that as good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean it's pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, highlighting is more satisfying, I would suggest highlighters.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never hold onto the highlighters though, that's always my problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well organization is something that it's going to be part of -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is something I need to work on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe actually buying some highlighters and doing that. I think it's easier for me because underlining doesn't stand out as much when you're flipping quickly through pages of important, so making sure you're really doing that in the text. Before a test - I'm in grad school so I know how it is - do you ever make summaries of chapters?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's something that's very helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't since like high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but doing that and then you can print them all out, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's a lot easier - [0:37:00]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then that's your study packet -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - you have, instead of going through the book which can be such an ordeal, I mean if you wanted to be really motivated, you can outline the chapter, then when you find the time go back and type up everything that you've outlined or highlighted, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then have it under Chapter 12 and then you can have a whole catalog so that when it comes time for the test, it's not as, you know, study 12 pages of...it would probably be a lot less, but just a little couple pages that you can bring with you every time you take the bus -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and it'll become easy to study that material even every day if you have that hour every day commuting, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that sound like something you could do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that doesn't -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is that something like you would do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't sound like something I would do, but it does sound like something that I could do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So you don't have any tests coming up this week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a lot of reading, is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have some reading that I've been meaning to catch up on because I spent a lot of time concentrating on the two classes I had tested in and I didn't spend as much time on the other two classes I didn't have tests on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So what do you think on some people talk about rewarding themselves for doing - [0:38:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - for doing good or punishing themselves if they don't do it, which one's going to be more effective for you? And which one are you more likely...are you really going to punish yourself or are you really going to reward yourself, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More likely to reward myself than punish myself (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I don't think that it's necessary to study every day and to beat yourself up, I mean -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - as long as you set up the time like you don't have to work on a Saturday and right now it's not like...I mean you could because you don't have that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - much of a social life probably, but I mean are you planning on going back? Do you go back to Oberlin on the weekends or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have been up twice but I've been trying not to go up all the time because it's easy to really want to do that and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I feel like then I won't really get anything out of being at Chicago State. I've made a few friends at Chicago State, but no one that I've like hung out with outside of school yet, just people I run into and talk with when I'm there and I have pretty much only like two friends from high school or other places that I know are still around in the city and I've been seeing them and that's pretty much my social life. [0:39:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would rewarding your...or do you think this is counterproductive to be allowed to go up to Oberlin if you get all of your work done beforehand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be a good reward for myself and I did do that one of the two times I went up to Oberlin actually, although it was like the beginning of the semester so it was -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you looking to go up there this weekend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't looking to go up there this weekend actually, but I guess I could, I hadn't thought about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, this is your reward, what is something...I mean, some people use like "I allow myself to get Jamba Juice today if I do all your reading" or -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - some things a little like that, what's going to be reinforcing for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably something like that or probably if not Jamba Juice then like ice cream or something else for sure, but also definitely hanging out with the two friends that I do have from -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - my previous life who are here is definitely something that I look forward to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know if they're available on...well it's already Thursday, do you know if they're available on Saturday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't. [0:40:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you could do something like make plans with them and say I'm only actually allowed to hang out with them if I do all my work Friday night.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and like have them -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean they don't even have to know if you don't feel, but to know that you have to get it done by this deadline because I think you do tend to follow the deadlines, but it's just the last minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To make your own deadlines and then really stick with it, you know? And then reward yourself of going out with them that night or getting an ice cream on the way home from Ellis, you know? Or something like that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - so you can think about that more, but definitely keep setting the schedules, checking off the lists. I think basic study skills is something that is going to help you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - highlight, organize the chapters, make sure you keep up with it, and if you get behind, organize what you got to do each day, but it doesn't have to be every day. [0:41:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it just has to be consistent, though, I have to get enough done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you have to get enough done, I mean, Sunday is a lot of times people's day to do work, I don't know if that's going to be counterproductive for you because you like to put things off until Sunday anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's hard for me to think that I should actually schedule things out to Sunday because then -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because some people -</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I might even leave it until later if that's even possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is helpful to realize that some people do go to work full time and go to school full time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and you know what I mean? And they don't have the luxury of working on the weekdays that you have, you're going to have the luxury probably of working in the morning some days, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you wake up and do work right...is that part of your schedule where you can get up early and doing work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really that early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you could wake up at seven?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's really early, oh my God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, well how early do you get up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I used to be like a really late sleeper even like a few years ago and I would sleep until like one or two regularly and now I sleep a lot more normally, although still not waking up at seven, I get up without anything to do like - [0:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But think about how much work you could get done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could get a lot more done, it's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wouldn't have to do -</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I wake up -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - any of the work on the weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now I wake up like 10:30, 11 if I don't have anything to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you always have something to do in school, don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if you could have your weekends just to yourself, wouldn't that be reward enough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That would be a reward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you wouldn't have to worry about Chicago State stuff -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and you could just have fun, go to Oberlin, do whatever you got to do -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - assuming that there's no test, there's no reason that you couldn't take the entire weekend off.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, yeah, I know about all my homework pretty far in advance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know that maybe this weekend's a wash, but maybe start that plan next weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For next week, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And set times to get up, do your work, schedule it all in and your reward will be a free weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is pretty -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that reinforcing enough? Yeah? Okay. So that's going to be your homework for this week and you can work on that sheet -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - when things come up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Any other questions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's pretty much it. There was something else I wanted to talk about, but I -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want me to write it down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's too complicated to really get into without - [0:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Is it related to academic stuff or is it not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it related to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's related to one of the friends who I still have in the area and also my girlfriend who isn't really my girlfriend but sort of is, it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - really complicated -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So there's a lot of like social stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can work on that next time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any other goals? I mean we talked about your goals of getting basically through this point and building the skills to succeed later and get that college diploma. Are there any other goals that you have for therapy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For therapy now, I think another thing I'd want to work on is...two other things actually that I can think of. One is that I'm really bad at confronting people when their desire for me to do something is different than what I want to do and it's hard for me to voice that conflict -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So assertiveness training?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - stand up to it, yeah. And also I guess I'm a shy person, I was like hesitating to say that, but like I used to be really shy and I've like found some ways to work on being more social and being more of a person who gets out and meets people, but it's still hard for me in some ways. [0:44:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's hard right now because -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm cut off -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - of the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - from everyone that I just spent three years getting to know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we can talk about that and I have some good exercises you can do to attack - they call shame attacking exercises and they're hilarious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, yeah, we can work on that. There is a good book downstairs that...I mean, there's a lot of good books downstairs, I don't know if you...I'm sure you're probably like sick of reading.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I spent like a minute looking through all those but mostly -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I don't know how they will be but (inaudible at 0:44:38) the time in the car, they have CDs -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - I don't know, I'm going to leave that (inaudible) because you probably sound like more of a person...I don't know, I sometimes wonder if the CDs are for people who are less cognitive (ph), you know what I mean, like I don't know, you could try that, right, money is no object.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mom and Dad are going to pay, so....</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is a good book on assertiveness down there that I've read, I think it's called "The Assertiveness Option." It's a yellow book. [0:45:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that might be helpful to supplement -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - and get some of those thoughts and irrational beliefs there, which I think helps with shyness too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of it is about like people who really get angry assertive, they think they're being assertive but they're really like aggressive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But a lot of it's for -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have those kind of problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, (laughter) but a lot of it there is more for the social anxiety and thoughts that get in the way of saying what you mean and confronting situations, so I think that could be helpful for you and then also with the social stuff as well, we can work on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you want to take a look, I don't know if you want to add to your reading list, but pleasure reading.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Thanks for coming and I will -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - see you...oh wait, not next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not next week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Next week, not the 15th, I wanted to tell you that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not the 15th?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it the 15th or the 16th?</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me write that down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got a calendar here. I think I blurt things out (inaudible at 0:45:56) October -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - yeah, 15th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: October 15th, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have to go fly to a wedding, a Friday wedding (inaudible) this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Think they always pick it the worst dates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. But then (inaudible) on the 22nd and I don't know if you have...I have a 9:30 a.m. Wednesday that never fails if you'd like to slip it in there, I don't know -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might if I start waking up at 7 a.m. -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like to schedule that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wait, 9:30 a.m. on -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wednesday the 14th -</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wednesday the 14th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well wait, do I already have one with you for the 15th at the same time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well you always come...oh no, wait, I'm sorry, you come on Fridays, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursdays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thursdays, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today's -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. I don't know where I'm...yeah, so that 15th I'm not going to be there, that's what I'm saying, so if you'd like to switch it to the 14th just for that one day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't miss a week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something you'd like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well wait, today's the first, but I'm not going to see you next week, but I'm also not going to see you on the 15th, but I can see you on the - [0:46:59]</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you're not going to see me next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought that was what you just said because you have the wedding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no, I was getting it wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sort of confused.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Let's look at the calendar together, I'm sorry, I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's today, the first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - today, we're good. Next week is good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Next week is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The 15th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I was -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the (inaudible) and so we can switch the 15th for the 14th?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 14th at 9:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nine thirty a.m.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The 14th is Wednesday -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have class or anything or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have class, but it's at 4 p.m.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, look at all that time you can study at the library in between.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, that is a lot of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think that's good, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm hesitant, but I'll -</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me next week if it's going to be too much of a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah, I think I should see if I'm really committed to it because I don't want to say that I'm going to go and then not (inaudible at 0:47:40).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it would be good for your plan, yeah. Okay, so I will see you next week, no problems though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have a good week, keep up the good work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. See you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you.</p>

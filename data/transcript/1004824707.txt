<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't bring them today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's going to be okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He and I are okay, which is good. So thinking about feeling like we have been stalled, it's hard to think about because I like I have a hard time remembering it. I feel like I've been just fuzzy in the head in the last few weeks. I don't know. [00:01:03]</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm feeling or how to talk about it and it's easy for me to talk and not, it's easy for me to come up with something to say but I don't know that it is the right thing to say, which I realize I'm not actually like how it works but you know what I mean. Or rather it is the most true thing to say. Maybe part of it is letting go of the idea that you have some kind of magic trick up your sleeve that will emerge at some point and it will be better. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>But I don't know. Maybe it's (pause). I feel like I am having to let go of the idea that I'll get better at all (pause). And that's hard. (pause) [00:02:57]</p>

<p>That's just, I felt like we have been talking and part of me hasn't been here or something. (pause) It's like the sort of conversation I have with somebody when I'm really sad, when I'm having a conversation with them and I want to be having that conversation but being really sad is kind of by far the most present thing in my mind and it sounds like what the other person and I are talking very quietly. Can't quite hear it. [00:03:59]</p>

<p>(pause) But yeah, I don't know whether that's actually descriptive of what I want to be describing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean, you often feel like you're not expressing how sad you really are? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) maybe, I don't know. There's just not much to say about it is the thing. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>I mean, I'm really sad but the amount of time that I can talk about it is far smaller than the amount of time that I'm sad. (chuckles) But so it's like, (pause) it's like I'm holding a big box and I think it under one hip and do something else but I have to hold the box until the time that I can't do anything else. [00:06:00]</p>

<p>But you know, I can't not talk. That would be unthinkable. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, on the subject of your getting better or not getting better, or never getting better. I suppose I'm of two minds about what to say. Not because I have two different opinions about what's going on but because-[00:07:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't need you to say anything just to be clear. I don't need you to reassure me on that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was your thought about not needing me to reassure you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that's not why I said that. I'm not sure how much anything you say at this point is going to affect what I'm thinking. Probably more than I think because it tends to but yeah. But I'm not asking you to reassure me. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This relates to one of the sides of what I was going to say. I just thought that you might actually be worried that I'm going to reassure you. [00:08:04]</p>

<p>Because-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nah, your too good for that. (chuckles) You don't do that. (pause) But yeah. It's hard for me to talk. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay. (pause) [00:08:58]</p>

<p>I guess I'm sort of getting interested in what this is getting grated (ph) with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is getting what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Grated (ph) with. (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Fair enough. Well, I trust you not to say shit just to make me feel better. That's pretty basic. I wouldn't be here otherwise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah. Pretty basically I think pretty crucial. Yeah. I do think there is stuff happening and I do think that there are ways that you are sort of moving forward on what I think is a pretty big project you're undertaking here. [00:10:07]</p>

<p>I'm aware that I have just said something that is perhaps reassuring but I say yeah I just think that you just have to deal with that. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I can deal with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) reassuring you when I, in a way that doesn't feel sort of (inaudible at 10:52) I would hope because I just (inaudible at 10:56) what happens, well yes I think there is something that's true and known about reassuring. Say it at times such as now such as what I just said but the other side of it is, I think you're really worried that I will sort of move away from your despair or convey something to indicate that I don't want to hear about or can't tolerate it. [00:11:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Franco and I were talking about this today actually. And you know, he was also finding how hard it is for people to hear, yeah things are really bad without some kind of consolatory addendum, you know. [00:12:08]</p>

<p>He's like, "yeah, I can't believe how many people say have to say, but I'm sure its all for the best." Or something like that. And yeah, it's hard for me to talk to people because they don't want to hear that I'm not getting better. (pause) And that they want to tell me that things will be better but every time I start to believe things will be better then its made that much worse the next time I come crashing down, which is always pretty shortly thereafter. (crying) [00:12:58]</p>

<p>So, (pause) yeah. I'm a pretty optimistic person usually. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The changes that I see are not really to do with you feeling better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're feeling better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do think you're sort of a little less split. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of the time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't mean anything (crosstalk) but impression is you don't have an experience as often as feeling like fine maybe you're making this all up one minute and then you know wanting to jump to the next that you're a bit more consistently in touch with how awful you feel but (crosstalk) [00:14:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's more that when I'm fine and feeling like I'm making it all up, I'm more aware that that's not real. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I mean that-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't. It still happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it has to happen at work for example otherwise, I just couldn't do my work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I don't want to split hairs here but I would suspect that it's kind of clear that you're putting on your game face there or at least it's more than that. [00:14:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's weird how much it is involuntary. So it's still like my, basically from my knees down is just a wreck from standing all day. Like my knees are swelling and shit. It's stiff. It's ridiculous. I don't know what's going on. But I get to work and my feet don't hurt while I'm at work. They don't hurt until I go home. It's like that. It's not that I'm, its just habit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so it's a pretty profound disconnect remains.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I'm more aware of that as part of a cycle rather than as an actual change. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think the thing that comes to my mind is, I think you're a bit more aware of some of the time of how anxious and guilty you can be about burdening people and the way that that there is a real struggle between that and finding guilt on one side and wanting to let people you're close to know how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Again, I don't think that is something that makes you feel any better, but I do think it's something you're a bit more cognitive of at times, like that you're in the next a struggle like that. [00:17:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know I hate myself less most of the time. I have fewer kind of flashes when you're walking along and suddenly I will think about something and it's like, I am so horrible for this reason and it's just like complete revulsion. It happens less often. It still happens. (chuckles) Like it still happens often enough that I usually don't bother telling you about it because that is just how I am. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:17:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now that I think about, I notice it less. (pause) Yeah something like that anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you might be really worried that by my pointing to that or pointing to that, you know that there is an indication that I need you to be getting better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which must be a very scary proposition for you. (pause) But that's something that has to happen for me. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) I don't know how to take that. (pause) [00:20:06]</p>

<p>And yeah, at this point I feel like killing myself, which is being ingratitude. (crying) (chuckles) Everybody is working so hard for me but (pause) it doesn't (pause) I mean it doesn't (pause) (inaudible at 20:58) [00:21:03]</p>

<p>The last time I hurt myself, I just cried and cried. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 21:36) Was it when you cut out you're (inaudible at 21:40)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't (pause) I don't know how to not do or how to just, he really wants to be able to fix things for me and he just can't and I can't even help him deal with that. [00:22:14]</p>

<p>I can't soften that blow for him. (pause) It's been all of-all of the ways that kind of relate to myself and relate to my own body and ways that take care of myself or don't like they are not just me, it's about taking care of other people and that's really hard. [00:23:05]</p>

<p>It's really hard not to hurt myself. (pause) And you know sometimes I think it's worse when I don't than when I do. It hurts more. Like a lot more. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hurting is what actually helps. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But so then what. Do I not hurt myself so that James can feel like he is taking care of me more? (pause) [00:24:06]</p>

<p>(pause) [00:24:59]</p>

<p>I don't even know what I was going to say. It makes it hard to talk to you. I feel like I am letting you down. It's not even like I feel like I am letting you down but I'm able to be honest. It's like I feel like I'm letting you down and I'm not able to actually talk about things that matter and (pause). [00:25:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling more so like you're letting me down because of what we were just talking about or are you're just sort of describing this as just, I know it's always true to some extent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think the latter. Yeah. (pause) People at work have started getting on me for apologizing too much, which is the most useless thing ever. It just makes me feel bad about another thing. (pause) Oh great, now I have to say this the other way. What was I trying to do anyway but (pause) [00:27:02]</p>

<p>(pause) Yeah, I don't know what to say here I freak out. Not really but I get really scared because you know I still have (inaudible at 27:31) running down my sides.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Running down what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My side. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like as if you're both carrying something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that yeah. A lot of moving furniture I guess. (chuckles) (crosstalk) [00:27:56]</p>

<p>(pause) It was nice to see Franco. (pause) It's like he is back not yeah. [00:28:57]</p>

<p>It's like he doesn't, he can talk about what he is thinking of instead of just making conversation, which has been pretty clear to me for awhile that's kind of how he has been talking to me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Because what he is thinking about is (inaudible at 29:15) or that he feels like he (inaudible at 29:20).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like Sascha wouldn't want to say. She is very intent on controlling information you know so, but it's like I kind of feel like I'm the queen of that so don't bullshit me Franco. (chuckles) So you know it's nice to know, I feel like he is actually there. (pause) [00:29:59]</p>

<p>I'm sorry (inaudible at 30:04) alternating between people, I'm really sorry and just want to punch her in the face and then feeling really bad for her again. But still just wanting to punch her in the face. (pause) Feeling bad for being glad that she is out of Franco's life, etc. (pause) I meant to take another level of worrying about the extent to which I obsess about Sascha as a doppelganger of myself. (chuckles) [00:30:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like your ambivalence towards her because you identify with her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I don't know (inaudible at 31:13).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you concerned about being like her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) More about agency is one of the things that I've been obsessed with her about is that she is really angry at James but she is not angry at me because I'm sick, which is really vandalizing (ph) from my perspective. I'm like fuck you. I make the decisions to. Yes, I'm sick but I'm also a rationale adult. I choose things. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>And talking to Franco, he said it was kind of astonishing to him that she had this perspective because she herself gets so upset when people act as though she doesn't have an agency with her own anxiety disorder. So I guess, but then I also wonder to what extent is Sascha in control of, how controlling she has become. And I want to kind of cut her some slack but I also but like you really have to be responsible for your own actions and I don't yeah. I both need to be held responsible for my own actions and I don't want to. (pause) [00:33:06]</p>

<p>(pause) I worry about having a rationale (inaudible at 33:23) or needs that hurt the other people around me or I worry about either people sacrificing themselves to help me. I don't want that. (inaudible at 33:38) (pause) And that the thing that I think I need are not actually (inaudible at 33:53) [00:33:57]</p>

<p>Sascha thinks that if she doesn't have the final say over anything Franco says about her or them as a couple to anyone else, then we are all going to hate her. And you know, she really doesn't. I know that she is pulling this shit and I love her anyway. Like, yeah. It's totally fine. I mean it's not fine but I love her anyway. So she would be okay without these things that she is trying to desperately to cling to and so I worry that all of this mess (inaudible at 34:54) I feel like I'm this cloud of dust living through life and that I worry that it's all for nothing. [00:35:10]</p>

<p>So, that's about what you might expect. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I think you might be sort of retrenching a little bit. [00:35:59]</p>

<p>In response to worries (pause) I'm trying to about it in response (pause) to let me hold off on that for a minute. [00:37:06]</p>

<p>I guess it's down to me sort of like a kind of masochistic retrenchment, like you are settling yourself down by thinking some pretty awful things about yourself. (pause) [00:37:59]</p>

<p>Ways your similar in the things you don't like about Sascha and at risk of or not at risk in throws of damaging and disappointing the people around you. It's not that those are new as you say but I think you may be putting them to particular use at the moment. (pause) [00:38:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How so? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I'm not sure that is my hunch is in response to our talking about ways some things are changing though we both agree I think that you're not feeling better that you're that that made you feel very worried. [00:39:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 39:58) and having to-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're like kind of reminding and reassuring both of us that you suck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Because we wouldn't want to forget that. (chuckles) (pause) </p>

<p>I think it's less about what is happening right now and more about what's happening when that I think the situation between Franco and Sascha are like over the last few days, weeks and that I'm really angry at her, really pissed off and (pause) I have to say, you're not better than she is to myself. [00:41:06]</p>

<p>I'm okay with being angry at her, you know so I say but look you're just angry with her because you think she is like you because you're horrible also. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that deflects that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, it's kind of like under minds the anger and hurt in a way or like you said, it deflects the anger from her back towards yourself its sort of the meringue (ph) tactic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess it's and or to what you said. (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) [00:41:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing similar about what we're both thinking is that there is something settling about sort of (pause) trashing yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of unsettling?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Securing do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes you feel less anxious or guilty. (pause) Whether for being angry at her or for I don't know sometimes you just (inaudible at 42:58) [00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No I see that. (pause) That's a hard thing to wrap my head around. (pause) That's a way how much I beat myself up for function to healthy part. That's why I do it. (crosstalk) [00:43:57]</p>

<p>Now, I feel like that. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. Other than that, I meant to mention earlier, I forgot was another (ph) Friday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care. </p>

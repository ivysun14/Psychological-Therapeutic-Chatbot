<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how you doing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's been going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] seems to think she has special rules.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I did not say I have special rules.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The only thing that she says that for is because the other day she told my mom she hates being scared when people come up behind you and scare you and you yell, like when they poke your sides.  It's like your heart skips a beat, you know?  She scared me this morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, first, I scared her this morning.  I woke up and she was downstairs listening to music and I thought it would be funny to scream and then pound my feet like I was running away.  [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] and she comes running up the stairs and I was laughing and then, and then—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then I scared [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I scared her and then she did it back to me in the shower and she says, that's not funny, you don't like it.  And I go, well, you just did it this morning and she goes, well, that's different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why was it different?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I said it was a joke.  I said it as a joke when I said that's different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really wasn't though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it wasn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So could you understand how she felt?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel she does understand how you feel?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you feel that'll make a difference in the future or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just don't, I don't like it when she scares me in the shower.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, nobody likes to be scared.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, she did it this morning.  Paybacks hurt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  So, I mean you both understand that it's not fun to be frightened.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you don't want to feel that way, you really don't want your sister to feel that way either, right?  That's important to communicate, but, you know, sometimes it's better to communicate just by sharing rather than acting it out, you know, when you frighten each other.  That's more acting out really.  You don't think she would listen to you if you just say, oh, I'm afraid or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That goes both ways.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	One—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you do something that frightens, if you do something that frightens one another, if you go to the other person and say, you know, that frightens me, would they respect you, would they listen to you, would they—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, 'cause we'll do it again for a joke any way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because that's just how we are.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So you can hear them scream.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hum?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So you can hear the other person scream.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's funny when they pop around the corner and all they jump.  It's hysterical.  But it's not funny—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it's funny when she's trying to take a shower and she like screams really loud 'cause I scare her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's not funny when you're scared.  It's scary when you're scared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  So what could we do?  I mean could you, could you get your enjoyment in another way other than scaring each other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  But I think it's funny.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I know, but you both know what it feels like to be at the other end, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I mean what, what's worse?  Being frightened—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We get over it.  You're, you're only scared for a like a couple seconds and then you laugh really hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you want to continue the behaviors or you want it to end?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's going to anyway.  We're always going to scare each other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	See I just don't like when she doesn't knock and she just barges in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean that's funny like, shhh.  It's funny when she scares me when I'm in the shower, but I'm, when I'm not physically in the shower and I'm in the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was an accident.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] bother to get in the shower, it's not funny when she scares me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The thing was this morning, I said I want to take a shower and I was, and [NAME OTHER]'s like, oh, I was going to take shower.  So I'm like, okay, go ahead and take a shower.  I didn't know she wasn't in the shower yet 'cause she turns on the water before you get in, you know?  And so I'm like, okay, so maybe she's in the shower.  I walked in because I was going to wash my hair in the sink.  And then she like, yeah, a long story after that, but, yeah, but that was an accident walking in and she wasn't in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you felt bad about it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was still funny though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was funny 'cause I screamed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But not for you doing the screaming though.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it hurt my throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It really scared you.  Well, so you don't think it, the behavior will change?  I mean knowing how each of you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Feel?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, 'cause the next day we're just going to do it again.  We'll get over it and just like, boo, [INAUDIBLE].  You know, on like the little cartoon where you're hiding, and your hair spirals up and stuff—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.  The hair what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The hair like spirals up and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	See, but I get scared easily and people like just think it's funny 'cause they go up to me and they go like that and I jump back.  So I guess it's, I guess it's even funnier when I get scared.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I don't know.  Well, she's used to it.  People at school that don't always scare me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People at school—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get scared easily.  I'm afraid someone's going to jump out of my room at night.  I'm afraid someone's going to hide in my room or in my closet and wait 'til I'm like almost asleep and then pop out and scare me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who would do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my mom or my step dad or [PATIENT NAME] or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] would probably have a stranger do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has that ever happened?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but that would be scary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would just be—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Every time we turn out the hallway light and go into my room—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Your Barney light.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm like, yeah, I run down the hallway 'cause I'm afraid someone's going to chase me down the hallway, like some stranger, and when I open the door and I slam the door behind me and I turn on the light and make sure no one's in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And so every time I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I turn, I go to the bathroom and then I come back in my room and the house is dark.  So I'll shut my door really quick, I turn on the light, look around, turn it off, and then dive into bed and jump from like the door to my bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you're afraid, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Always [INAUDIBLE].  My teacher says she still does it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what do we do?  I mean, nothing?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  It's been pretty good I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it has been?  The relationship's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Been going good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel closer to each other or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure, kind of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So you're trying to communicate more with each other and talk about what you think or what you feel or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, we let each other know what we feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And there've been no problems like what happened last time, you know, taking things out of her room or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nothing like that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or, or waking, waking her up?  You don't do that anymore?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're respecting each other's feelings more.  So this is just another element of it, you know, in terms of the fear element.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Although she did put my towels in the hamper this morning and I wasn't happy with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was cleaning up the downstairs, right, and she always puts her towels like, there's a sink and then a little ledge, and then the shower and stuff and she always puts her, her towels on the little ledge and that's like annoying.  And so when I was cleaning, I didn't know if they were clean or dirty or not, so I just put them in the hamper.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There were no other towels in the bathroom that I can use.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's 'cause she doesn't do her laundry.  It's not my fault.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was going to do it, but I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The laundry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  But what you're saying maybe you should have separate towels, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We do have separate towels.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just in her way and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her's, she doesn't know how to hang hers up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's just lying there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I do sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, why don't you just let her put hers away and you put your own towel away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do put my own towel away.  She just doesn't put hers away.  So when I'm cleaning, I put it in the hamper because I don't know what to do with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you'd rather she didn't do that?  Would you rather she just left it there for you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum, or she could just hang it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could you hang it up?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but that takes more time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you don't have much time?  Is this is the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like two seconds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All she has to do is shove the towel up on the little holder thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But if it's on the little towel rack, I want it to look neat because if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it properly and in the morning, I just don't always have time for it.  So I just put it on the little ledge thing and go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I build you a little drawer.  Can you put it into the drawer?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it won't dry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could you let her in the morning just leave it on the ledge and then when she comes home from school, she can put it—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I won't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You won't do it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, I won't.  I'm not going to lie.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, how, what could you do then to make sure you get your towel and [PATIENT NAME] won't put it away?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, here's a good idea.  Take two seconds to hang it up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm going to hang it at a different place now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, why, tell her where you're going to hang it and if it's hung there not to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Where I hung it today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where'd you hang it today?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	On the thing where the towels are kept on that door.  It's better than over by the toilet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if, if, if she hangs it there, then you'll know not to put it in the hamper, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, that'll resolve the problem.  And what about your step dad.  He hasn't been giving you a hard time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm still not talking to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're still angry with him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The other day he, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think you told him that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You probably told him that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We talked about, oh, when I saw you on Tuesday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When he screamed and he has people in the room or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm not talking to him really.  Yeah, but see did mom tell you what happened?  He failed to let us know that he said he wasn't going to stop at Walgreens.  I told you guys that.  You guys were, they were really busy doing homework and it was really like tense.  [NAME OTHER] was being loud and obnoxious and my brother.  [PATIENT NAME] was trying to get me to help her with homework and I was, I just didn't want to do it right then and she was trying to be helpful to my mom and my mom had just got home.  So it was really tense.  And [PATIENT NAME] says, call [NAME OTHER] and tell him we need pencils and when I called him and asked him if he's stopping at Walgreens, he was really like already tense and stuff and saying, um, and he said he, he's, he's stopping for crickets and he's stopping at, I don't remember where else, but it's not a place that carries like lead pencils and supplies like that and so he was already stopping two places and he wasn't going to stop at Walgreens tonight.  And I went back inside to tell them that he's probably not going to stop at Walgreens, except nobody was really listening to me.  So I said it a few times and walked away and then, um, when he came home, things were like really tense even more.  Like everybody was like freaking out now and then my mom said that she'll just go out and get the pencils and [NAME OTHER]'s like, no, no, no, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.  And then I went in my room and I heard him say it and I just got really upset.  So I'm not talking to him right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe it's a tumor.  Maybe it's a tumor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She said maybe it's a tumor.  But it's not a tumor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're angry with him too, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause he went in my room.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My mom thought I'd be over my anger with him right now, by now.  She thought I'd be over in a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we talked last time though about him not going in your room and your mom going in your room instead?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has that happened or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  I didn't talk to [NAME OTHER].  I don't know if mom did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is anybody going in or you don't even know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there's nothing there that you're worried about anymore?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there anything you worry about in your room that they would find?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now they go through her room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't do it on a regular basis.  What's going to happen now when your mom's having that surgery Monday too?  Is that going to make—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s home all week.  Things are going to be a little more tense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even more tense?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like they were last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like my mom needs a lot of attention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When she has the surgery?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.  And then my grandmother is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, she's going to stay with you?  Your grandmother?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, and then when my grandma leaves and [NAME OTHER] leaves, um, and she's still not completely better, I have to sleep in her room and like during the school week I can't do that because I'm going to have to sleep and make sure she gets up.  Like when she goes to the bathroom, I have to make sure she comes back and like doesn't fall or anything and, um, and then she gets frustrated because the pillows under her leg aren't right and her ice pack's not cold anymore and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you have to take care of her.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I have to wake up and take care of her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's only two of us there now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to, you'll help out with—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can kind of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We can like switch days and stuff so we're not like each having like missing a lot of sleep for school the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Why don't you do that?  Work out a schedule.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She just wasn't there the last time.  So things were a lot harder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For you.  Okay.  But [NAME OTHER], is he going to stay there overnight then or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, I don't think he's allowed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your grandmother can stay overnight?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So when you're in school, she'll take care of your mom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, for however long she stays, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And last time what, it took about two weeks for her to heal?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.  How about the medication now that you're, we cut you back, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is that working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have those electric shocks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What are you doing?  You're mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, why are you doing that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Mom wants to talk to you about it.  I'm being serious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?  You don't think the medicine's helping [PATIENT NAME] or—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, the Depakote?  Cutting back on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We cut back on it.  We went to 250 in the morning and 500, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, 250 in the afternoon, 500 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And you feel that you're worse at the lower dose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She doesn't, but I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you see a change in her?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you see?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's getting more anxious and more like tense about things like especially in the morning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or maybe it's 'cause you pick on me every morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, let me ask you what happened to those electric feelings?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They hurt a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they still occurring even—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even with the lower dose?  It hasn't made a difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they're just [INAUDIBLE].  My mom thinks it's 'cause like a year ago when they started, like I pulled a plug out of the wall [INAUDIBLE] and there was no, like no cover on it so like a plug came and like, you know when you pull a plug out, it kind of like goes back and it went back into the wires and it kind of got like knocked out.  She thinks it's from that, but I don't think it would be 'cause a lot of people get shocked—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they don't have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it almost like a memory of that when it reoccurs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I, 'cause I didn't even remember it like that that happened until my mom said something about it.  Like I knew it happened, I didn't mean like that.  Like I knew it happened, but I didn't like connect it, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, I'm, I'm inclined, especially with the surgery coming up and it being a little more tense, you know, with [NAME OTHER] there, go back to the 500 twice a day just temporarily 'cause it's not making that much of a difference anyway cutting back, right?  And it's still [INAUDIBLE] less than you were taking.  What do you think?  I know you don't like the Depakote, but if it's going to make you calmer and help you get through the next few weeks.  It's worth it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don', I don't think it's from the Depakote, I really don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what it's from.  I didn't say it was from the Dep, Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Would you be okay with that and then after the, you know, when your mom heals—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can we just do the Abilify with the Depakote?  Weren't we going to do that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we had talked about that.  Well, yeah, we could do the Abilify.  But that would mean adding like a fourth medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're okay, you'd rather do that then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Let the record show up until now I haven't said anything to her about her medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm okay with that.  I mean I could give you a low dose of Abilify in the morning and just keep the Depakote the same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see how you feel on that.  Now am I going to be able to see you when your mom's healing?  How you going to get here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [NAME OTHER] probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] will drive you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Why don't we do that.  I'll give you a 5 mg Abilify, keep the Depakote the same.  And then you're going to work together to try to help, uh, help your mom through the week, okay?  And then we'll try to listen to each other.  Good.  Let me do that and then, well, let's go out.  You need, you need more of the 250 Depakote and you need the Abilify samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

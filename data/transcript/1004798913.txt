<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the latest?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Let's see. I saw you last Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just going to grab my water (ph). Yes, that's true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not a lot has changed. In fact, almost nothing. I called on Friday and (pause) she said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm working on it (inaudible at 00:25) we have a conference here next week (inaudible at 00:30) but I think Monday I'll be able to finish it," and I haven't heard anything and it's, you know, after 6:00 there now, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Their Monday is over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I'm confident, if nothing else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'll happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It will.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just a matter of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just bizarre.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...timing (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I almost feel like there's some reason this is happening (pause) and it will happen at the right time. [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what the reason is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not yet (laughter). (pause) I mean, I think—in some ways, I think it's dependent on me, what...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 01:22) you make of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, what I choose to do during this time. So (pause) I've had some really interesting conversations though with the woman that I'm staying with. She has an 11 year old and a 13 year old. I guess (inaudible at 01:45) much of that, but (pause), you know, kids, as you know, are very demanding. You have to (pause)—I don't know how to say this, but they require more than half your time. I mean, it's a huge commitment. [00:02:24] And to see her—and her husband lives there. [I didn't know her husband before I met her] (ph). And to see her with these two kids, being the taxi, being the chef, being the confidant—her daughter is depressed and she's going [through bad] (ph) and I just don't know how she keeps it together.</p>

<p>And so it's interesting to see (pause) how she takes care of herself and what I can learn from that. And another perspective, you know. (pause) I mean, it's also just kind of weird because I'm in this place where I'm fully present, you know, pretty much. I don't have a lot that's (laughter) (inaudible at 03:27). You know, I'm not waiting for the (inaudible at 03:32) to show up right now and (pause) it's just such an odd place to be and I'm not used to it. And I don't know. It's (pause) I'm sure this is the case with a lot of people, but the first thing I do when I'm stressed or depressed for that matter is, you know, sacrifice anything that's healthy for me, that's good for me, whether it be exercise or eating right or (inaudible at 04:15) enough sleep, you know. And sleep, without questions, always the first to go, you know, if it's there at all. But under normal circumstances, you know, those things that keep me sane, keep me feeling good about myself, for whatever reason are as not as much a priority to me as the things that I don't care about.</p>

<p>So, part of what has allowed me to notice this is that I'm (clears throat) because I'm grateful for her, you know, I've been there coming up on a month on Wednesday, Thursday. But anyway, so, you know, I don't know how much longer it's going to (inaudible at 05:02) to be. A week, two weeks—I just don't know. And so (pause), I'm bending over backwards to try and help her with anything possible. Cleaning out her garage, cleaning out her basement, doing some construction around the house, helping her dad do some things. She doesn't expect it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet she's grateful for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She is and the way I see it is if I can make her life easier in some way that she wouldn't have the time to even consider those things and whatnot. But I've noticed this track (ph) in myself where instead of taking time for myself, I'll take my time for other people and happily give it away, as if I'm doing something that's sustaining. [00:06:01] And it is to a point, but it's also (pause) not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't fill all the needs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think doing those kinds of things definitely fulfills a need for you in that I would hope that you realize what good you're doing for someone (ph) like this. That should be somewhat uplifting for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and that's what it does, but it's also, I mean, I have to counter that with everything that I'm not doing for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you do both?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, can I do both...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you do, you know, a little bit less of one so there is time for another?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would just—even giving myself a chance, you know, to be heard and to express needs to myself. And it's interesting when I think about my own inner self. I mean, I can anticipate what other people need. I can anticipate things that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like, you saw all these places where you could do something for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, and it's like am I just completely deaf to my inner self? [00:07:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what is it that you're not doing for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I'm not doing the things that I would like to do regularly. You know, like, play music or I have done some of that but it's been—I've noticed it's been this thing where I'll do it, do it, do it and then I'll fall off for a few days and then I'll be completely (pause) discouraged, you know. So I did go over (ph) some exercise yesterday, but that's—I haven't been doing as much and all these things together (pause), it's like I'm really giving myself the short end of the stick and my tired hours and (pause), you know, the fact that I don't have any goals really established makes it even easier to not achieve those goals or not even (inaudible at 08:06)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not realize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...turn aside from it, you know. But I'm also wary of having (pause) large blocks of time that are not scheduled, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would happen—are you asking? Oh. (pause) I don't know, I mean (pause), I don't know. (pause) You know, I've thought about this lately is that, you know, how [ashamed and guilt and those things may] (ph). I still feel shame and guilt, of course, for my sister and that. [00:09:08] And I still feel a lot of shame for what happened in Mexico and yet I still entertain thoughts that would put me exactly in that horrible feeling that I experienced for weeks, if not months, of intense shame and guilt. And yet I'm entertaining things that are just, like, yet you'd be right back there. Why do you want to do this to yourself? Never mind what you do when you are seen, why would you want to do this to yourself? I don't have an answer for it. I mean, it was horrible and it still is. It's like I think about that and I think about what she had to go through and I put myself in her position, it's like (pause) I'm really lucky she's still with me. Why do I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you jeopardize that and jeopardize your health, because like you said, it's such a horrible feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think, again, my health is, like, already dismissed and (pause) it doesn't really matter, you know. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder when you fell so low on the totem pole of importance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't (pause)—I can't really think of a time when I did (pause) look (inaudible at 10:50) took care of those needs and (pause), you know, basic needs.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you think about yourself if you did take care of your needs? What if you put your needs first? [00:11:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would I think of myself? (pause) I love that cat, that's a really sweet cat, but god, I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) I was confused for a second. I thought, wait a minute (laughter). But I got it now. I remember the cat, allergic, yes (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: For whatever reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No (ph), sorry. (pause) I don't know. I mean, I imagine I would (pause)—well, I could imagine two things. I could imagine I wouldn't deserve it. And then I also imagine that it would be uplifting and I would feel good about myself. Which one would rise to the top, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably both. Well, who would you have to be and what would you have to do to deserve taking care of yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I mean, I don't know if I can answer that. I guess it's just my habit of denying myself. It's been a thing that for whatever reason, I don't feel I deserve it or (pause) I don't know. [00:13:15] (pause) But I think it's something that I don't necessarily have to, like, full on turn inward and say, "I'm sorry, I'm checking out now," you know. (pause) I just think there needs to be a point when I can say no, you're going to do something for yourself.</p>

<p>For whatever reason—I don't know who it was or something on Facebook, somebody posted something that said (pause) something about the importance of being able to say no at least once a day, you know. And I don't know—I mean, for me it has a certain meaning, like, no you can't have dinner with them because you were going to go for a run or, you know, and no you can't, you know. Or just no you can't stop, no you can't continue to ignore me, you know, my inner self, that kind of thing. And think, I don't know, I've just been kind of pondering that lately, just as far as the importance of standing up for myself to myself (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. (inaudible at 14:53) as a limit setter for how much you give away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's how I saw it and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or how much you act to please others rather than pleasing yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly, because that's been my reason for being for so long. (pause) And I don't see anyone really doing that for me (laughter), you know. (pause) Not even if they tried, they couldn't. (pause) Or maybe they are trying and I'm just not realizing it (pause) or it's just not that effective. [00:15:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do people know what you want? Would they know how to (pause) do something that was pleasing to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes it trickier. I think it goes hand-in-hand—not knowing how to ask for what you want, not knowing how to do things for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you communicate (inaudible at 16:18) you can't even hear it. (pause) You know, I guess it's encouraging that I'm actually diagnosing the problem (inaudible at 16:42) be alert to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it shows how much of a present (ph) you are now, and not just because you have this time. And I think this time certainly gives you a lot of space to practice and to be aware of your thoughts in a way that you really can't be when you have, you know, a lot of other demands in general. [You have] (ph) school (inaudible at 17:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Continually saying yes to everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you're a lot more present now than you were a year ago, you know, even (inaudible at 17:14) put you back in the school situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, I think you're right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does allow you to notice what's going on in your head and what's not going on in your head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, it's true, it is true. And (pause) I want to actually know what it is that's (pause) allowed that, that additional presence. (pause) I guess maybe it's part of just knowing, acknowledging the need. I do think this time right now has allowed me to kind of step back and look at what I'm doing and how I'm using my time. [00:18:16]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Because it seems like every day is kind of an experiment, you know. It's a case study. OK, how did I use my time today? How is that different from yesterday? Do I want to do it this afternoon or will I do it tonight?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One thing I've noticed is that you let yourself question a lot more than judge. So one of the things that we worked on was looking at what are you saying up to yourself and your automatic thoughts were really full of a lot of judgment in the past. And you have trained yourself top stop and question how come, what? You know, before judging it. And it doesn't mean that it's free from judgment. There's still room to criticize yourself less properly. I do think that you have opened up a space where you question, you know, what am I doing? Why am I doing that? Is this what I want to be doing? [That's good] (ph). [00:19:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and how is this taking care of me? Is it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, at least putting yourself in there, even if you can't act on it yet. It's part of the process of questioning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and understanding they're just identifying. It doesn't mean it's not being met.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>So, that's where I am today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it feel to be there? [00:20:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty good. I kind of feel like I'm behind the wheel in some ways, you know, that I do have control and influence over this, varying degrees [of either] (ph), but (pause) I think the (pause) apprehension I do have about it is that (pause) like other times when I've tried to make efforts to do things that I know were good for me, health and play music, whatever, things that sustain me, this would be just a fleeting thing that I do for a little while then forget about. [00:21:39] But on the other hand, all those things that I did for a while and forgot about fall under this category and (pause) I tend to think that it's a different perspective, knowing that it's a fundamental need here to do those things without necessarily producing anything.</p>

<p>Right now, of course, I've had the luxury of time to think about these things and perhaps put them into practice and give them this programmed routine (pause) so that when I do get busy (pause), I won't be so quick to excise them. [00:22:48]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Multiple definitions of success. So, that would be one, you know, getting them into a routine so that even when things are really busy, that routine's in place and they stick. Another version of success if having them available and, you know, doing, you know, having a lot of gym time, having a lot of time to play music when there's a lot of time. And doing it less frequently when there's not as much time. I mean, I heard you say you would do them for a little while and their forgotten? They're not forgotten—you're talking about them. You clearly haven't forgotten them. So, sometimes they may disappear for a little bit and then they can come back. And that's not failure—it's just another version of success, if you let them come back. It's OK that they drop for a little bit. [00:23:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that is true and that's among the (ph) places where I have room for continued improvement on self-criticism. But (pause) that is also something I've (pause)—that has grazed my mind over the past week. And there's no right way to do anything. What might be right for some person (pause), some mythical person who's constructed out of television and my imagination and popular culture or whatever, that doesn't have any (pause), that does not reflect my life whatsoever. Who is that person and why am I holding myself to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That standard</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that standard that's (pause) imminently healthy and (pause) clear-headed and has everything figured out. [00:24:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like the superhero version of a person, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They can do all these things perfectly and never get stressed about anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. (inaudible at 25:05)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not a very realistic portrayal of a human being.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. And I'm starting to (pause) amount (ph) a little bit on that idea and (pause) cut myself some slack on whatever it is I'm doing and how I'm doing it. (sighs) (pause) What was your question?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know (laughter). I'm lost in wherever we're actually are in the discussion versus where we started.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess that it's just about, you know, multiple definitions of success and I think (pause), again, you know, what you say is true as far as those things going away, you know, being put on pause on whatever. [00:26:19] I think I see it differently now, again, because I see these things as not—you've got to produce something, but you have to take care of yourself. That's the important thing. That's the production, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, there can be some limits, you know. If it disappears for four years and might not feel like you're doing a great job taking care of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it disappears for a week, is that OK? You know, this is where you set limits and where you're able to say no. You know, that might be the, like, no, I'm saying no to the dinner, or no to the cleaning out the basement because I haven't gotten to go to the gym for four days because I was cleaning out your attic (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There may be some limits there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's one of those things that I have to keep an eye on, is how many times I'm saying no to myself and how many times I'm saying to other people and (pause) I have no concerns that I'm going to be saying yes to myself all the time and, I mean, I don't even know what that would look like, but (pause) it would be funny. [00:27:40] (pause) So yeah, I guess is just something I'm keeping an eye on or at least trying to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you started with the idea of saying no. Are people asking things of you or are you volunteering?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm volunteering and that's just it. I'm supposed to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard even having to say no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's a good point because I'm not really saying no, but there have been things, you know, in the past few days where it's like, boy, you know, that (pause) whatever, sure could've used organization or (inaudible at 28:24), you know. And then I've had to stop myself from saying (pause) this is bordering on obsession. And I don't need to prove anything, that I'm extra generous or, you know, Superman or whatever. I think (pause) that no one can be as conscientious and giving as Bryce, you know, nobody could do that. I will go down in history as the guy who take care of everybody else's needs except his own. (pause) There sure is a hole there and (pause) I don't know, I think filling it is a bit easier with (pause) pleasing others, having that satisfaction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trying to get recognition from someone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think it's just avoiding asking myself, what do you want? What do you want to do? What's important to you? And I do have the, you know, the default answers but I don't know if (pause)—I don't know how this is necessarily related to trusting my instinct, you know, which I have had issues with. But (pause) trusting whether or not I am (pause) really doing what I want to do. And I think I get glimpses of reassurance. But again, when it gets to cutting myself some slack about—are you going to sneeze?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 30:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I think] you're going to sneeze (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you bring the cat with you? (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can just tell you probably (pause)—are you allergic to cats? Yeah, you are, that's right. (inaudible at 30:57) Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 31:00) actually to bring with you (inaudible at 31:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the, you know, cutting myself some slack in that (pause) for me being into something doesn't necessarily I have to be (pause) Stephen Hawking about it, you know, or even just constantly dwelling on it or constantly reading books about it, you know. I think that, to me, is kind of hard to accept because...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sort of defined it as being totally [on it] (ph). Like, if you're going to do music you're going to be producing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible at 31:40), like, (inaudible at 31:41) something like that (laughter). But it's (pause) still hard for me to grasp that I can do music once in a while and be OK with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and still have fun with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and at the same time I'm still trying to balance that, that minimum requirement, versus the I need to do it to take care of myself. You know, what is that (inaudible at 32:16), what is that frequency or whatever. But....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the last time you had fun doing something? Actual fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Well, I guess it was when I was recording this song last week. That was fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made it fun?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I was able to execute some ideas that turned out pretty good. (pause) That I can get lost it, you know, still. [00:33:13]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's probably the question in a taking care of yourself piece, having fun once in a while, I mean, fairly often.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exercise is not fun (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that might not be—yeah, that might be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know what you're saying, you know, there's fun, which is important. There's also just, you know, health maintenance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But part of health maintenance is being able to have some fun, not just all fulfilling obligations to yourself or to others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Flossing and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably not that fun, but, you know, part of the routine of making sure that there is. Because when you tap into—what made me think of the question of, you know, are you actually having fun was when you said, you know, listening to your instincts, what is it that you really want to do. And I know we played with answering that question and having you ask yourself that question and figure out how to listen to what would actually be what you want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did we do it today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not today, no, no, no. A few months ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did I miss that? (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 34:26) (laughter) You know, that's one way of figuring out where are the limits of the things you do to take care of yourself. And I know for you exercise is not the fun piece, but where is—then where does fun piece go? One day it was playing soccer and one day it was playing fishing and one day it was recording that music. It doesn't have to be the same all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause) and I think, you know (pause), I think too often I qualify fun. You know, I say, "Well this was fun, but since I didn't produce something out of it, well that couldn't have been that fun because I would've finished it or what have you," you know. So I think that is something I just need to step back from and say this is for the fun of it, not for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not for the product. [00:35:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's for the experience of laughing at loud at a movie or (pause) feeling lighthearted about something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I still despair sometimes though, like now. (pause) Are you really going to do this? Why would you do it now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why not? Because (pause) I don't know. I mean (pause), I still have to contend with the whole this doesn't have to be impromptu (ph). That's going to be something that I'm going to have to really resist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, believing of the value of the process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and understanding that (pause)—well, I guess what I'm wondering is it fun because I'm (pause) just having fun or is it because I've associated fun with producing something? [00:37:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe both. You can have both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I just don't know if I have either one right now. But I think one of the important things is going to have to be understanding that doing things without purpose is OK and that's really hard for me to swallow, but if I can just experiment with that for a while and see how it goes, I can maybe start to accept it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When do you think you forgot how to play? Not playing music, just play play.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Decades.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's a piece to get back in touch with. Because play is not just for kids—grownups need to play too. [00:38:16] And I think it often gets lost because so much of becoming an adult is about being responsible and producing something and having things make sense. And playfulness is really important because it's what allow—I mean, it's a lot of creativity, spontaneity, these things that are really important in your music, that you can also have other places. And it doesn't have to have, you know, you don't run through the leaves or build a snowman for the product—it's the process of doing those things.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm allowing myself to (pause) take that in. [00:39:18] You know, again, that's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it had to be valuable enough for [me to think] (ph) on a fall day, just walking and hearing the crunches of the leaves and breathing in the smell of the leaves and noticing the colors. That's playful and you don't need to have anything at the end of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I do find myself actually noticing things (pause) for no particular reason. I find it encouraging because that tells me you are not so overwhelmed that you can't even notice that trees have some really beautiful flowers on it, you know. (pause) But the (pause)—I forgot what I was going to say. [00:40:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were talking about how you notice things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before that (inaudible at 40:40)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Playing product.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I don't know what it was, but I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It'll come back to you someday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someday. I'll write you an e-mail. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What distracted you? Where did you go when you lost your thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I think I just started thinking about what you said (pause), about the value of playing (ph).</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I think there are some things though that I enjoy doing but I wrote them off—this is what I was going to say (laughter). [00:42:13] But (pause) just even noting this is kind of—it just demonstrates to what degree I will self-sacrifice, you know, or self-criticize, you know. It's like (pause) I know I might spend (inaudible at 42:50) time in the morning on a crossword puzzle and yet, I don't know, maybe in the afternoon too. And then I'll be like, "Well, you didn't get anything done today."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what could you say instead?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I enjoy crossword puzzles (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, that's a way of playing, right? That is playing. I think you also said one day you had some really nice sauce pans.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Had.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's gone now, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But is that something you enjoy doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which part?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, cooking, making sauces?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, [glad you're around] (ph) (laughter).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried to enjoy cooking, I really did. And I can do it, but it's just not something I enjoy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 43:41) not talking about it. But if something you do enjoy play with is, you know, doing a crossword, that's fabulous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I enjoyed cooking then I'd actually be able to produce meals (laughter). I could've (ph) paid myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot of research that shows that you doing word games and things like that prevents Alzheimer's, so it's fine. If we want to add some sort of product to it you can, but you can also just enjoy the process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a perfectly enjoyable way to spend some time and that's important part of taking care of yourself, is doing things you enjoy just because you enjoy them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess (sighs) part of our work and my work I still am trying to implement is the goal-setting and without any goal stated it's hard to feel good about not doing something to attain those goals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the stated goal is having some fun every day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, that is a goal I can do, yeah, certainly. [00:44:55] But for the things that I (pause) am working on that are not necessarily fun, like, you know, continuing to (inaudible at 45:11). I do it, but it can get easily blocked off and (pause), again, it's one of those things I feel good about doing once [I've done it] (ph), so yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's a balancing act.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are we done here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We are done. We should pick a time, in case you're here next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, [I'll probably] (ph) be here next week.</p>

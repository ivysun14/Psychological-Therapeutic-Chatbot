<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I was just thinking about how different today was than yesterday in my attitude and how even after I said what I said here, I almost immediately I began to, well, at least feel more relaxed or comfortable.  And certainly today I just felt more positive about things.  But uhm, I also, even though I felt better, I had a dream last night that I woke up remembering, or I, I sort of woke up to end it.  And, and I don't know that I quite understand why I had it but it was about MSCZ.  And it was almost as if well, he, it, I think it started with his seeming to be more interested in a friend of mine of whom I know he's fond.  But uhm, I meant it was almost as if he, he were now falling in love with her and out of love with me.  And yet we were married, so he was sort of going through the motions with me but in a very cruel way.  And I don't know, I can't remember it too clearly, this part too clearly, but it was almost as if he would expect me to have intercourse with him or to want to and want to initiate it and help me to feel that way and then he'd sort of withdraw at the very last minute.  But I remember there was something to do with that and the feeling that not only was he starting to be more interested in somebody else, but he was being cruel to me at the same time, actively cruel.</p>

<p>Because when I say it now, I, I start thinking about my father in a way, in that, or I draw a parallel to my father, in that I always did feel he was more interested in somebody else and it just depend— — I, I think, I don't know whether I had just one person I thought he was more interested in or if it were just about everybody.  But I also, I think, felt all along that he wanted me to give him well, along with the approval and respect and parroting his ideas and everything, a certain affection that he wouldn't give ba—.  I don't even think he could give back at all and he certainly wouldn't even give any of it back unless I initiated it to start with.</p>

<p>(Pause) And something that I was thinking yesterday near the end is sort of on my mind now, but I don't remember what I was thinking then.  I just remember it was something to do with — I think in my mind I was trying to make a distinction between, between feeling angry and wanting to hurt and being afraid of my ability to hurt, but yet not being the same thing as feeling guilty.  And I don't know now where, how I was thinking yesterday but it was sort of like all I can remember, all I keep thinking is there's something about being or not being guilty that is involved here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You, you said that uhm you felt quite differently than yesterday, referring to what you had said yesterday.  Did you have a particular thing in mind or everything you said, or what was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think what I was, I had in mind then was well, probably more than anything, just clarifying my ideas more on, or my getting more what my feelings were about what was happening.  Or just — I didn't feel yesterday (clears throat) I was repressing thoughts the same way I sometimes do.  And no matter how uncomfortable they are, if I got away feeling I'm repressing them, so I don't know what they are, I don't feel the same well, it's sort of a feeling of freedom, I guess.  (Pause) It might have been something particular but it doesn't seem to me it was, because I didn't think about anything in particular when I got home.  Sometimes I'll come across a thought here that just, I don't know, strikes me in such a way, I keep thinking about it.  And it was just sort of a relief more than coming across something new.</p>

<p>(Pause) But that dream made me feel as if I couldn't have been quite so easy about things as I thought I was.  Because I don't know, I, I felt as if, from the dream I was being punished or making myself feel punished by having the dream.  But anyway, somehow it was a punishing kind of thing.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You said, uhm, you know, that your father came to mind when you were thinking about MSCZ in the dream.  Who comes to mind when you think about the other woman?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, while I was talking, FYC, FNA and my mother all came to my mind.  (Pause) And then, now I think of well, I was just thinking that in a, in different ways I always felt he favored each of them over me.  And then I remembered what I'd said yesterday about FYC had reached a certain place in his affections or received his attention for certain things.  And whether or not I would have been different anyway, I tried other ways to.  And then FNA came along who seemed to be doing similar things to me.  And it just strikes me now it was always as if it were FNA I was thinking of because she sort of displaced me.  She did it better than I did, whatever it was that I'd do and — (silence)</p>

<p>But then I think too that as I got older I consciously — although I may not have thought it at the time, but I always was aware of sort of a parallel between FYC's progress and mine — and it seemed like I consciously sort of patterned my whole behavior on what she was doing or had done at the same age.  And I always felt very aware of FNA's being different, and jealous of the fact she could do these things and I couldn't.  And it was almost as if I had completely given up trying any of those areas where she had her own sort of little thing.  And, and the, the 1 thing I wonder about now is just what happened when FNA was born and how did that change my feelings?  Because it does, it has seemed strange to me that I have just a complete blank as far as FNA's being born and being around.  And I can remember other things at the same time so it seems strange I can't even remember that.  But I have noticed that my father is more at ease with well, young enough children so that you might even call them infants, but certainly very young children.  And then he gets to a stage where he's not at ease with them.</p>

<p>(Silence) It's funny, because I, I used to just always think it was FYC treating me terribly that sort of marred the days before we moved to the house we lived in most of our lives.  So that meant well, let's say before 5 ½ and it — now I'm just thinking that I was pretty horrible to FYC too any my jealousy — I would hit back in ways I knew would hurt her.  And it was also that was the time when I began having all sorts of different types of dreams that I kept right on having for years.</p>

<p>(2 ½-minute silence) It's funny, because I was just thinking that — how demanding I must have been when I was that age, very young.  And it's almost as if nobody could have done anything right.  And I was also thinking of oh different articles and things I've been reading lately about of the oldest child and the youngest child and then the middle children, and how certain patterns of behavior seem to come out according to your position in your family.  And just thinking about things now, I'd certainly had some of the problems that they say middle children have.  But yet just from my observation of older children, I, I almost feel as if I never even adjusted to being second and getting — I could never adjust to the fact there already was 1 child there which — maybe that's true of all middle children, I don't know, but — and I've also always been so concerned about approval and pleasing whoever the adult authority is, which seems that middle children I've seen are little bit less concerned about that.  They might be more concerned about having a different type of image, but it usually seems that the oldest child who is used to just adults is more concerned about doing the right thing.  Or maybe I wasn't so much so, because FYC did turn out to be the one who most did the right things according to my parents.</p>

<p>(Silence) I started thinking again of uhm, the surprise I felt when FYC and I were talking about having to go to a church group when we were little, or, I don't know, maybe junior high, high school age and how we hated doing it.  And then I said something about do you remember the time we didn't go and we did something else?  And I thought of it as a big event in my life and at the time I remember I, I was frightened that I wasn't obeying.  And well, it was just one of the few times when I, I didn't obey a very direct order of that nature in any case.  And FYC said oh I always used to do that and I was just shocked to learn that she was rather casual about that type of a order from my parents.  And it surprised me partly because here I was constantly arguing with them and fighting them and disagreeing with them in a way and yet I didn't basically or I — there were some areas where I wouldn't question them and I'd blindly obey.  (Pause) And I don't actually think that even with their ideas and things I might have had some vague feeling that things weren't quite the way I would see them but yet I don't really think I questioned them.  It was just simply I didn't like the way I was being treated and that's where my argument with them came.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, in the dream you uh give almost as an example of the cruel treatment of you, that you said MSCZ engaged in, uhm, as an example you gave your expectation, well your feeling that he led you to want to have intercourse and to expect it and then withdrew at the last moment.  And it occurs to me this is surely then an example of how you apparently didn't want to be treated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was almost — I think the feeling I had in the dream was almost his saying, even though I don't really like you anymore, if you're good or when you're good, then I won't treat you this way.  I'll let you have intercourse with me or we'll have it, or something, but that seemed to be a part of it too.  (Silence) I get kind of confused over — well, I know I didn't like sharing my father's attention but I get confused over whether or not I would have minded it if he had given me more.  Or just, I mean, sometimes I think well what I wanted and what I expected was to get, if I were good, was to get total attention from him.  But I didn't and therefore I was jealous.  And yet sometimes I also think that what I wanted was a certain type of attention he didn't give.  And then maybe I could have shared it if he had given me, if there'd been a different quality to his attention.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What do you make of this seeming to equate expecting intercourse with getting attention?  It's as though you, you know, your thought goes very easily from one to the other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I know I equate it a lot because I think of all the times I've felt that I could be — I've been afraid that I could be — anybody when MSCZ and I are having intercourse.  And that's bothered me terribly, as if well, sort of the opposite side of it, but still I'm joining the two together and yet I right now, I don't know quite what I do make of it.  I just remember, or I just start thinking about earlier in the summer whenever it was that I was talking so much about sort of being friendly with any man — or just somehow that's having any kind of relationship with any man — in my mind has a sexual connotation.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Maybe because my father didn't give the attention I thought — somehow it got mixed-up in my mind that that was the only way a man would give attention.  And then I also think maybe I think of it that way because ultimately that must have been what I wanted, but I don't know.  And he never showed me any other way to be close to him.  I don't know, it just seems that it's, instinctively a female knows that's the way to be close to a male and he certainly never gave me any reason to think along those lines.  It's just because I'm a female I, right now I think I must have felt that way and, since he didn't show me anything else, I just assumed that must be the only thing.  But yet on the other hand I was jealous because I felt he gave more attention of some sort to FYC and FNA so I must have had some other idea about it.</p>

<p>And I also think that I didn't feel he gave that kind of attention to my mother except on the rare occasions when my mother then became pregnant.  And I know, it seems now that I al—, I thought that way because I couldn't stand to think of his giving that type of attention to my mother.  But then I, I, maybe there's something else, and I really wasn't jealous of FNA and FYC, but it had always seemed as if I was.  And I don't understand because even with them he was relatively reserved.  And he might have been exactly the same with me as he was with them except we fought all the time, so I don't quite understand why I felt he favored them.  And it wasn't, even in his favoring them it wasn't at all comparable to what I felt he felt in favoring MLWZ.  Because with MLWZ I think I always felt it was a real caring but with FYC and FNA it was because they gave back to him something he wanted.  And if they hadn't, he wouldn't have cared.  With MLWZ it seemed MLWZ could have done anything and he would have cared.</p>

<p>(Pause) I don't know why this just came into my mind, but I started thinking about how — either I mentioned it yesterday or the day before — MSCZ recently criticized my father and I couldn't bear having him criticize him at that time the way he was.  And after I left yesterday I thought of something, although I don't think this was actually what he was talking about, but I thought of it in that same context.  Uhm, he was talking about how my father just always takes things so personally.  He can't think in any other way.  And he recounted a conversation when he and MEIR really were talking.  MSCZ was there but he didn't have much to say to this one.  And they were talking about jewelry being a good investment and MEIR made some comment about certain diamonds cut, I've forgotten whether it's at the mine or what, but anyway certain types of diamonds are not as valuable anymore.  And he said something about FYC's ring and implying it wasn't as valuable.  And then my father just said well, the dealer he goes through would never do that to him.  And it was just sort of irrelevant it wasn't something a dealer would have control over.</p>

<p>And then MSCZ went on to tell me how one time my father, in talking about this dealer, had mentioned that he became connected with him because his firm worked on a case when the dealer who — it's a series of brothers — had been accused of selling stolen goods.  And he said that the brother whom he doesn't like knew that they were stolen, but he was sure that this dealer did not realize they were stolen.  And, I mean, he, he just can't have, he, I don't know, there was — I think it was bothering me that MSCZ was seeing my father this way.  But it was also bothering me when I think about it now.  Uhm, well, this, I don't know whether it's naiveness (sic) or what but, or simplistic view of things or what it is, but having to, if you attach, if he attached himself to anybody in any way whatsoever, and put his faith in them, then they had to be pure goodness and, and he wouldn't see any fault at all.  Just the way, with our family, he was always sort of indicating he felt our family were perfect compared to other families, and no family could ever be as perfect as ours.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Except what you call simplistic attachment, you felt really wasn't to you.  Whereas you've made very clear you felt that he had uh unquestioning allegiance to MLWZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What comes to my mind, which is for different reasons, a cry I always had against my father was sort of, "Unfair, unfair, you're not being fair,"  or "You're not really considering the other person."  And now what comes to my mind is just simply, it's unfair for a person to see things so simply to the other person, meaning me.  That in seeing my faults he couldn't also see what was good.  And with MLWZ he could only see what he wanted to see and there were certainly things he didn't like about sometimes what MLWZ would do, but he'd always make excuses for why MLWZ did them.  So I suppose basically he didn't really see them very clearly.</p>

<p>And that's — I start thinking about FNA again.  Uhm, there was a sort or probably a middle time when he was very disappointed with her because she just wasn't going to be the persevering student that FYC and I were, that he also felt was important.  And, but then after he had adjusted to that, he sort of put other things in place of it, like her singing ability and her artistic ability both, which I think he's blown up way beyond what they are.  And he would sort of excuse anything she did in those terms.  So she almost shared this kind of simple attachment uhm that MLWZ had with him.  And I know as, as I got older, and this developed more and more, I became very jealous of that too.</p>

<p>And right now I just sort of, it's more a feeling than anything else, have a feeling that I, well, where I had decisions to make and choices to make, ran my life just trying to find something so he would begin to look at me in such a way that he could then feel what I was doing was right and make excuses for me when I wasn't since, you know, when I didn't please him.  Because half the things he was making excuses for with MLWZ and FNA weren't things that should ever have needed to be excused in anybody's minds, except for his.  And in thinking about trying to find a way to please him, makes me think again about trying to choose some role that would be my own and yet still would meet his approval.  And I don't know, for a while I, I must have been trying FYC's because it was just so exactly what she did and it didn't work.  I wasn't happy at it and it wasn't working anyway, except I got more approval than if I didn't study, and so forth.  And FNA had already established one for her, so I couldn't really go into any of those fields at all, because if I did I would probably always feel I was only second to her and so what would be the point.</p>

<p>And it just kind of left me in the middle without anything.  And it — because I used to always fluctuate.  One year I'd be one way and then the next year I'd be another.  Or I'd start out a school year by being one way in the fall and then becoming something else in the spring.  In fact it just occurred to me — of all that I've ever done my whole life, the only thing that I think I did that nobody else did that pleased my father in such a way that I got attention for it was the fact that I went to RZG university.  And I suppose I was really pleased to get attention for it.  But on the other hand I knew just what I was doing there and how I stood in comparison to other people and how, how I had gotten in.  I mean not that I had any special way, but just, there was nothing wonderful about my being there, as being in any other graduate school.  And so it made me feel very uneasy that he was putting so much on it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence)  I'm thinking about what was on my mind I know, all weekend.  (clears throat)  And has been I suppose really for a long time of again, whether or not I could be pregnant.  And then I also was thinking about the fact that I had some spotting again today, so I don't know I debated or I—, in a way didn't want to do this, but in a way I wanted to do it, too.  Because I didn't know what it all means, over whether or not to call the gynecologist's z____.  And finally I decided to.  And I asked him various questions, which he explained, and everything made sense to me.</p>

<p>But then I hung up and I realized the one question I hadn't asked or the one thing I didn't know when I hung up that I really wanted to know was could I still be pregnant while this is happening?  Because he explained it that it was probably just from the hormone imbalance, and that that sort of, sort of—, I've forgotten the words he used, but (sniff) unusual or slight bleeding from that hormone imbalance and—.  And in a way, I don't know, I was mad at myself for not asking him, because I—, from what he said I don't understand whether I could be pregnant or not with that happening.  And in a way I, I don't know, I didn't want to ask the question.  I could feel afterwards that I don't even know if it had occurred to me directly I would have asked it, because I'd rather I guess not know than to know a negative answer.  Because I know this morning, when I thought, maybe I was getting my period again I was very disappointed.  And this morning also I woke up to a dream that I can't recall at all, but I know it had something to do with my having a child or  being pregnant or—.   I can't even remember how I know it, but I think I woke up with some kind of a question in my mind and—. (pause)</p>

<p>And also, I was just thinking about how I was feeling toward MSCZ this weekend.  It was more I had a feeling that I, I didn't know exactly what my feelings were, except they're somehow connected with this, and I didn't know how to handle them.  And I ended up, because I felt somehow uncertain about myself, feeling annoyed at MSCZ.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I didn't want to feel any sexual feelings for him and—.  One thing that helped was I realized that enough so at one point when he wanted to have intercourse I could at least say I was feeling annoyed at him and I didn't know why or something that helped.  Because I didn't feel annoyed at him so much anymore.  I still felt whatever the feeling was about myself, but—.  I don't know, again it almost was, whatever the feeling, it was making me want to just be alone.  Not literally, but in the sense of not responding to him.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of that telephone call I made again and thinking that if I want to know the answers to things I didn't ask enough, then I'll have to call again, which embarrasses me.  And then I was just thinking of the fact that when I called I'd assumed that the secretary would answer, because that's always been the way it has been before.  And I'd had to wait a long time to get his extension, and then instead of the secretary, he answered.  And I think somehow I thought it was going to be easier to start this, because it, because in a way I didn't want to be doing it, if I talked to the secretary first.  And it was almost like the—, I had to work up to the more personal questions, and I never did.  Or at least the most personal one.  And I don't know why I kept doing this either, because I'm sure he expects calls like this.  But I kept telling myself, "He's busy and he doesn't have time for me to just ask questions as they occur to me."  So I felt very hurried during the whole thing, as if I have to get off—.  He wasn't hurrying me, but it was me hurrying myself.  And I told myself it was because he must in a hurry, but—.  (silence)</p>

<p>I just got that feeling again that I guess is part of what I was feeling this weekend.  Well just thinking about hurrying on the phone, that I was doing it to myself.  And just this feeling of wanting to know something, and I guess in a way not daring to do anything to find out the answer, because I only want 1 answer.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why do you think it seems important to you to be pregnant now?</p>

<p> PATIENT: You mean the last month or two or right today?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well you said you were feeling it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (silence) Oh I have several thoughts when you ask that and (clears throat) one, the first one was, in terms of, I don't know, more my admitting it to myself that it's very important to me right now is that I was talking last week of wanting a baby from you and it just seems to be part of that.  And then anyway I was just thinking about how all through my life there been times when I've had dreams of having a baby or, I don't know, had an urge to.  Felt very strongly I'd like to have one. And then there were other feelings I have about myself that counteracted that type of feeling so strongly, I wouldn't keep feeling it.  And it seems like—, and part of that was feeling this need that I had to work and prove myself through something like that and I don't feel that so strongly.  Which means that this urge, or this desire to have a child comes out more.  I don't know, it— I'm not sure it's any stronger.  

And I don't know whether both of those things are part of the same thing or not.  But it does seem in a way—, I decided not to work next year and I've rejected one way of proving myself that it used to be extremely important to me.  And I don't know, sometimes I wonder if I'm not grasping at this and making it seem—.  I mean it's not that I want to become pregnant soon, but it's so important that right now I be pregnant.  And so it almost seems like by giving up one thing, and having decided not to be continuing next year makes it in effect I've already given it up, then I have to have something else to prove myself through.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think of the time during this year when I used to think I'd like to have nothing to do for a while.  And I thought of it as sort of a while that I could get to know myself.  But in a way I think that's kind of phony.  I don't know.  Or maybe I'm too scared about it now, but in any case now a lot of people are asking me what are you going to do next year, and I'll say nothing but, uhm, I'm thinking to myself this—, it's not a problem because of course I'll be pregnant and have a baby.  And then, I don't know, this possibility that maybe I'm not pregnant now leads me to think maybe I won't be pregnant in the fall.  And I can't even go as far as to think I might not be able to become pregnant, but—.  I don't know it's a threat to (hesitates) I guess my idea of myself and how things are going to be.  (pause)</p>

<p>In fact just today I was thinking of the girl that had been taking the pill and then when she stopped—, I think they had—, they waited about a year and she wanted to be pregnant all that time before she finally became pregnant. And today I was thinking of her, because as one point she was—, I think she was doing substitute teaching, on sort of a permanent basis for a while.  And all I could think of was, how could she think about teaching at that point when she'd really, in a way committed herself to wanting to become pregnant fully, because I was thinking that that would be all I'd be able to think about.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just wondering about the 2 things I really said in answer to your question, because, in a way one seems to be (clears throat) the one I've said most about or mentioned second seems to be more, I don't know, just a maternal instinct.  But a man is necessary to fulfill it, and so I don't know, I was just wondering if feeling this feeling as a woman just assign a man as the one that she wants too be the father of her children, or just how.  I mean I do-, I don't—, I guess I was thinking again on how can I feel a feeling that I can barely admit that I want a baby from you.  And does it have anything to do with that other feeling of wanting to be a mother.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, the next image that comes to my mind is I keep assuming that I must have felt this way with my father if I'm feeling this way with you. And the—, what picture comes to my mind is that that would—, if I had a baby from my father, which I'd want under these circumstances, then I would effectively be doing what my mother did, and being in her role cutting her out.  (pause)</p>

<p>So that the two in a way seem separate because it almost seems like, in this sense, having a baby is sort of a means to the end or proof or, I don't know, in some way, would be getting my father or you all to myself.  And that that's what's important, not the baby.  Whereas the feeling I interpret as sort of maternal instinct is more the child's the important thing then.  And I don't have, I don't know, was, when I recalled that feeling so many other times, there was no man in mind.  It was just the feeling of me and a baby.  (silence)</p>

<p>For some reason (clears throat) and I don't know why except thinking of my mother maybe this is why I think of FHYZ, but she comes to my mind and something she did early this morning.  Which annoyed me, and I'm not, I don't know if I'm being honest on why it annoyed me, but she came up to our floor.  And I can't remember now whether she had anything in particular on the business end that she had to see me about, but I know she had something to see either FBS or FBS's assistant about, a business-like matter.  And in any case she is careful about if she goes into one room saying "good morning" she'll go into the other, and that kind of thing.  And so she came into my room, already talking, saying "How was the play?"  She knew I was going to a play on Friday.  And it was th-, nothing like "good morning" or "how are you?" or "did you have a good weekend?" or anything, but simply "Well! how was the play?" as she came in, very abrupt and very business-like.  And, and it really annoyed me because it seemed like she'd decided downstairs, "Now, when I see FAJ I'll ask her this." And "When I see this person I'll ask them that."  And it's alright if it's business, but this was a personal thing.  I don't know that should come more naturally and spontaneously and—.  I thought it, in a way, she showed a lack of interest or something.  I think that's why I was feeling annoyed.  (pause)</p>

<p>And then the next thing I think of is the article I read in the- in the KWSZ magazine on temper tantrums, which are something I had when I was young.  And it struck me, I don't have temper tantrums probably—, maybe I do once in a while, but probably not anymore.  But I was just thinking about the first stage that they mentioned of sort of grumbling and feeling generally discontent and all.  And I was just thinking now of that and of the fact that in a way I thought of FHYZ and being annoyed, because I just wanted to feel annoyed right now.  And that was a good little thing to settle on.  Just like this morning I wanted to feel annoyed and—. So when she did that, which is typical of her and I know it and I understand it and have gone through it a lot of times before and often I'm just sort of amused by it, but today I chose to be annoyed.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why right now, here? And who with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I again was just beginning to wonder if it's back with you because you're not giving me what I want.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm so business-like, like FHYZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's (laughs) I hadn't admitted to myself. (clears throat) (silence)</p>

<p>What I started thinking of, and I don't know I just feel sort of confused, because first what was in my mind before you added "I'm so business-like, like FHYZ" was maybe I'm just feeling angry at you because of the same thing of your not giving me a baby.  But then that made me think of Friday, when at the end of the hour you made the joke about 'now I could look at you' when I was talking about, wondering your, what your expression was and all.  And I know then I was glad you made that joke.  Because I think it meant some kind of a less business-like and more intimate relationship or interest or I don't know.  In fact I don't even want to know.  Again it's not something I—, I don't think I want to think about.  Because somehow it's important to me.  And then it makes me think of the confusion I felt over something you had said a few days earlier.  Ov-, I don't remember when it was, on my feeling—, what I feel when I feel most complete of being—, feeling most incomplete.  And you named several circumstances, one being intercourse or imagining intercourse.  That sometimes I talked here about imagining it, the feeling.  And then you spoke of what I thought the way you handled the bill meant to me at that particular time, and—.  I don't know, one seemed sexual and another seems asexual or j_ just somehow very different anyway and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know, it seems to be part of how I want to label everything so I understand it and I know exactly where things are.  And if I talk for awhile about having sexual feelings toward you then I start thinking everything I feel is going to be sexual toward you, and if something else starts coming out, then I get very confused.  Or maybe it's sexual but in a different direction.  Because somehow I think that your being a man it's more important that (sniff) I feel this feeling of intimacy than if you were a woman.  (pause)</p>

<p>I guess what I mean is that in one way I've been thinking about it's physical, and  another way it isn't.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking that (sniff) maybe one reason why I feel this way—, I think one reason is I want to simplify everything, to the point of confusing myself, but—.  It seems also that (hesitates) I don't know, now it—, I don't—, it doesn't seem so clear, but all I was, all I could keep thinking was I didn't have even that kind of non-physical intimate relationship with my father and—.  But I certainly wanted it, and wouldn't admit wanting a physical one, so I don't know what that means.  But I think also this— (hesitates), something confusing to me, too, just in the thought that both could be equally satisfying at different times and it surprises me to think that.  Because I know I used to, when we were first married and even before, I used to, when I didn't want to have a sexual relationship with MSCZ, or at least I knew I had to somewhat, but I was hoping it would be a minimal amount, I used to think that the most important thing was to have some kind of non-physical intimate relationship or—.  I don't know something that would (hesitates), I guess be part of not being business-like with each other.  And that seemed much more important to me, and I thought I—, it could be enough to be happy with.  And I suppose I'm still finding it hard to see how something physical fits into that, too, is part of it in way or—.  (pause)</p>

<p>It also seems to me that if I thought of my father in that way, I could accept thinking about my father in that way, and always, no matter how awful I was with him, that was in a way a goal with me.  So it could be in my marriage, whereas I would have always rejected thinking anything that involved physical relationship and so I just continued to. (pause)</p>

<p>And then I f_, think about how I felt this weekend, (sniff) and that seems something else, too.  Because it wasn't rejecting any physical feeling for MSCZ because I was afraid of it or anything, it was feeling annoyed and, I don't know, at him and at myself, and discontented and—, that I didn't want to extend myself or give or, I don't know, just—.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, it seems to me there's a question you really don't ask yourself, and that is really, how come you were annoyed with MSCZ?  You describe what you felt but you—, it's not clear to me that you feel you understand what you were doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What strikes me is, there's, uhm, eh, strong feeling of discontent, a, you call it annoyance, but, eh, I don't know it seems to me it's more like a—, you you sound discontented, at a time when you say you want very much to be pregnant and you look forward to it and would be terribly disappointed if you weren't, but you don't sound happy about it.  You're discontented, troubled.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (pause) I think basically, I keep having the feeling—.  I'm not thinking about it in terms of being happy about the possibility and looking forward to it, because maybe I can't have this thing I want.  What I keep trying to concentrate on, is instead of being happy that maybe I am pregnant or the chances that I might be soon, instead I try to keep concentrating on I'm probably not right now.  And I shouldn't count to much on it.  Which in a way seems to be, (sniff) part of an idea about myself that, I don't know whether it's that I don't deserve this thing I want, or that I can't have it anyway.  Won't get it.  And also, it would go back to MSCZ, too, in that he won't give it to me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:Well, I don't think it's a baby that he won't give you.  You haven't said anything to indicate that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's not a baby that you can't have.  I mean as far as you really know.  Last week, on your birthday, you know it was very important for you to feel there was some change.  You said, well it wasn't as important as in past years, but you did think of, a little of MDI, and you did wear a new dress and your appearance was important to you, about the earrings, something that would show.  It seems to me that the gift you, at least partly wanted, was the same gift you have wanted for some time.  Something that would change your appearance.  And that what makes this  mixed feelings and this mixed attitude about being pregnant is that it's mixed up, with not just having a baby but, again, making yourself complete more directly, having a penis.  And it's that part of this that's a source of this discontent in your conviction that it can't happen, it won't happen.  (pause)  It's as though your treating being pregnant as a kind of compensation for that.</p>

<p>You can't be reborn a boy.  The next best thing is to have a baby, to make up for it.  Because that's the way you're talking about it, as though it makes up for something, rather than something that's just something you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can see that.  And also when you first were talking about this, and I was thinking about the question again of why was I feeling that way toward MSCZ, it was—, it just struck me that it was also this thing that I have talked here about imagining feeling complete.  And I've said once in a while I've felt that way after, or during intercourse with MSCZ, but certainly not afterwards.  And it was the feeling that I just started thinking that it's partly this frustration, or anyway feeling that he can't make me feel complete and make it lasting, which I want.  And I keep thinking that somehow he h-, he's the one that has to be able to.  And it also occurred to me, when you were saying that about my feeling about having a baby, that it's not only having a baby, but sometimes if I, I think if I really am honest about my feelings, my feelings are that the baby is going to be a boy not a girl. Because that would be the best way to make up.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I am very pleased about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Which one are you feeling (inaudible at 00:06)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The one between the squares? Yeah, [it's big] (ph) is always nice. It sucks working in a crowded space. Kind of, you know, (inaudible at 00:24) (laughter). I was thinking yesterday about the prospect of, like, what would it be like to have a job that I didn't really worry about all the time. Like, wow, that would be a different life entirely (laughter). So, we'll see, yeah. I think it'll largely depend on how much the people suck. This is, you know, corporate...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the customers get...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no, the managers. The customers are pretty much always—there's a ratio of, like, 80 percent really nice people, 15 percent decent people who are grumpy and 5 percent people who are just going to be assholes no matter what you do, like, wherever you go. But the (pause)—whether, you know, your managers and your coworkers are reliable makes a difference definitely, yeah. So actually at the shop, like, the people are really, really good. They're like, "My god (inaudible at 01:44) sandwiches all day." And so I want to go (laughter) it just gets really nauseating after a while. I mean (laughter), I feel like I would not be able to bare eating a sandwich ever again and I don't want to shed that fat (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I understand] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've been reading "Infinite Jest," remembering David Foster Wallace, which may be a bad thing but it's a really good book. It's really, really good. And it's about—I was trying to describe it to James the other night. We were like—at like ten o'clock, we were like, "Let's go get ice cream." So went down to (inaudible at 02:28) I was trying to describe it. Like, well, it's about competitive tennis and addiction (laughter). He was like, "What?" (Laughter) "Did I hear you right?" And I was like, "Yeah, basically." But a lot of it is about AA, which I didn't know very much about. The point of all that was to say that I came across one of the, like, AA slogans, which is, "Your best thinking got you here." (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 03:01)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like it and (pause) yeah, I don't know how to deal with where I am, because I deal with problems by thinking about them and I think about this and it doesn't (pause)—it doesn't crack. (Pause) I think I might've mentioned that. Like, I know I talk about this a lot, but I don't (pause), you know, knowing that there are some things about the way I grew up that I can understand and some things that I'm never going to understand and trying to come to understand other things, but (pause) it doesn't seem to help, to feel like I understand things. (Pause) [00:04:34]</p>

<p>James and I were eating dinner last night and this cat, whom my roommates feed when they're having dinner...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the name of the cat?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, very grandiose. He's a good kitten, but a little bit obnoxious, especially at dinner. So he will, like, turn himself up in your lap and ends up on the table, like, near your food or, like, jump up on another chair and then jump up on the table. But he's, like, nothing like Josie. So, it's really hard that you [get a blimp] in the radar, in terms of, like, annoying animal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's (ph) Josie?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, Josie is the beagle that I had that I owned for a year and then couldn't take care of and we gave to Amanda. And so Amanda has her. Who is, like, (sighs) she's like 15 pounds of pure mayhem and basically (laughter)—maybe 20 pounds. She's like yay high...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 05:42) dyanisis (ph) as it compared to Isis (inaudible at 05:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) I think so. Josie, I just named her that because she's orange. She's orange and white instead of a tri-color. And l like the song "Darling Josie." But so I—she's the one—the dog who this tall got up on the counter and up into the cabinet and got an unopened bag of chocolate chips and ate the whole thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...when my sister was gone. And so we had to spend, like, a thousand dollars...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 06:13) dog right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because she had to go to the vet (inaudible at 06:16) and stay overnight and, like, almost died and (inaudible at 06:23) eats glass and, like, tries to jump out of her nose and is like (laughter) just very willful. Yeah, like, nobody's going to be her boss. But so Isis is nothing at that level of, like, intense focus on food that she wants that you have.</p>

<p>So he tried to jump up on our lap. I have (inaudible at 06:50) at the same time as he jumped up, so his head hit my hand and, like, he, like, fell back and was like, "Hmmm" and looked away. And, you know, training the cat not to jump up on my lap. And he's pretty smart, so it's like (ph) he doesn't both James and I nearly as much as he bothers the other two. (Laughter) He's kind of learned, like, we don't really take shit.</p>

<p>But I felt bad (laughter). I, like, had this urge to apologize to the cat (laughter). And then I was, you know, kind of sad about that. And James's like, "What's wrong?" (Laughter) Of course, like, "Are you OK?" like, monitoring my space. I was like, I'm fine, it's just therapy stuff (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 07:38)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, that's a good chunk of my life, is (laughter) drawing boundaries and then feeling bad for that, wanting to apologize to people for not letting them hurt me. (Pause) I got in a fight with Eric (sp?) on Friday night, like, a real fight. We all, like, were going out drinking and going out to dinner. And we're going to, like, have a couple of beer at a dinner and then James and I were going to kind of peel off and they were going to keep going out because they want to drink way more than we do.</p>

<p>And Eric (sp?) got up and, like, left the place to smoke a cigarette. And it was kind of a restaurant/bar and apparently, they have, like, a cover charge or something after a certain time. And it's really unclear what happened but the bouncer wouldn't let Eric (sp?) back in. Called Eric (sp?) an asshole. Eric (sp?) called him an asshole back. The bouncer said, like, OK, that's it, you're barred," and wouldn't let—and Eric (sp?) was like and James was like, "You can't come back in." And Eric (sp?) was like, "Fine, I won't pay the check." [00:09:02]</p>

<p>And so it was like—it's really unclear where the blame lay and, like, that fight I think probably a little of both how they've, like, been (inaudible at 09:15) Eric (sp?) not backing down because he makes it a point of honor never to back down, because he's a dick. But (ph), like, or he's childish in that way (pause), which is all fine, but then (pause) the restaurant really mishandled it such that the waitress, who was, like, on the verge of the tears was like, "Well, I can't split up the check." James was like, "We're not paying for Eric's (sp?) check." The waitress said she couldn't split up the check so that we could pay for our share because it would have to come out of her wages, which is completely ridiculous. And then they're like, "Well, then you guys have to pay the check. (Sighs)</p>

<p>And it was—and so I called Eric (sp?). I was like, "Eric (sp?), what the fuck are you doing?" I'm like, "Just pay the damn check." And he's like, "I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it." [00:10:20] And I was like, "Eric (sp?), the only people that you are inconveniencing here, the only people that you are hurting are James and I and the waitress, who has been nothing but lovely." And he was just like, "Well, let her eat it, whatever." And I was like, "Eric (sp?), we can't—James and I, we can't do that. We're not those people." And he was like, "Well, I'll reimburse you," and it was, you know, clearly, like, a way for him to save face. And so, you know, that was fine, whatever.</p>

<p>But I ended up, like, yelling at him out in the street after we got out. I was like, "This is (pause) ridiculous. Like, even if you are entirely the wronged party, in terms of, like, your fight with the establishment, like, you have to recognize that your actions have consequences for your friends. Like, we are the people you are hurting more than—and the waitress. And I'm not going to stand by, like..."</p>

<p>And he (inaudible at 11:22) rude to waitresses, is the thing, and that really pisses me off. Like, I just don't think he sees them in the category of people, in the way that people who have never waited tables sometimes do. (Pause) And he was just like, no, not going to see it, not going to listen to me, not going to think about things from my point of view. And I decided to just, like, storm off, literally actually. Well I guess that's not literally, but I did storm off (laughter). [00:11:56]</p>

<p>(Sighs) I didn't back down, which doesn't happen very often. Usually I just can't handle being angry and so I back down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because I've never heard you (inaudible at 12:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't yell at people very often. (Pause) And it was completely terrifying to, like, look him in the eye and realize that, like, he was not going to back down. Like, I was not going to be able to make him reconsider or rethink his position or (pause) that even if he did reconsider privately, he was never going to be able to say it out loud.</p>

<p>So what happened was, you know, James and I kind of walked around a little bit and then went home—at the pier. And when we got home, like, Eric (sp?) and Wes had gone home as well and Eric (sp?) was like, "Why are we fighting? Like, can we just, like, say this is OK? Can we just agree that we're never going to see eye-to-eye on this?" And I'm like, "Yeah, I think that sounds right." And he was like, "Uhhh." I was like, "I'm still angry at you. Maybe tomorrow." And went to bed. And the next day I woke up and I wasn't angry at him anymore. I was like, well, glad we did that. [00:13:35]</p>

<p>So I feel like it went really well, actually. (Pause) It's funny, like (pause), interacting with people who have no idea how terrifying that is for me and, like, Eric (sp?) was like, "Well I was never really angry at you," the next day. And I was like, "OK, I'm over it. Are we OK?" And he was like, "Well, I never really had a problem." And I was like, OK fine, whatever. But (sighs) I don't know. (Pause) You know, kind of (pause) sort of proud of myself about not (pause), not saying that I believe something that I didn't just because I was afraid. [00:14:53]</p>

<p>You know, I also feel like I was probably much angrier than the circumstances called for. (Pause) Maybe? But maybe other people are angry like this all the time (laughter). You know, I don't lose my temper very often.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I really did not want to back down. I did not want to lose being friends with Eric (sp?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, [with that, one is I say] (ph) a very psychologist sounding sort of thing. [Kind of] (ph) like a piece of it was being angry at your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is a very psychologist sounding thing (laughter). I was trying to, like, prepare for it but that was way above my expectation. How do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was his temper, his stubbornness. He was taking it out in effect on people who didn't deserve it and really hadn't done anything to him, but who had been nice to him. That sounds like how, at the time, it was with your dad and his temper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How is that being angry at my dad as opposed to having sensitive spots that make me angry? [00:17:05] Or are those the same thing? (Pause) In the same way, a large part of it was I was angry because he didn't give a shit whether his tab came out of the waitress's wages and, like, that made me really angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think (pause), I think there's a part of that that is probably a displacement of the same thing. That, you know, the feelings for the waitress is, again, for somebody who's completely innocent and well meant (ph), who doesn't really have any power in the situation but gets screwed over anyway. [00:18:01] And who is in her role in danger of being sort of marginalized or overlooked because of what people do, which, again, sounds...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) OK. I will buy that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) I'm probably budging a little bit in saying (inaudible at 18:33) angry at your dad. You know, on one hand if you said, "Well, what if I said this is kind of a soft spot of mine that Eric (sp?) kind of—well, what he did sort of poked at or jumped on. And this soft spot developed in part because of things that happened with my dad." Like (pause), that makes sense to me. Like, I'd be on board with that. [00:19:07]</p>

<p>The thing that I'm probably budging on a little and sort of adding into the mix is that I think you probably are angry at your dad and, you know, (pause) in ways that (pause), you know, for something that you're probably clearly aware of are other things that you may be less aware or kind of struggling with and those kind of things tend to be acted out. (inaudible at 19:46) worsens your day, like, and so this was maybe a little bit of a kind of acting out of that. I don't mean like (inaudible at 19:57) but it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...sort of channeling it a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and this would, I think, tend to kind of confirm that. Like, I'm very angry at my dad but I have immense trouble reconciling who he is today with who he was then. Like, it's very difficult—I'm very angry at my dad, you know, 20 years ago, 15 years ago. Today, I don't know that he's the person I should be angry at. Like, I don't know if he's that person anymore. I don't think he is. But so, it feels like I have all of this anger that really doesn't have any place to go. You know, I'm sure, like, part of this is very scary to think about being actually angry at my dad today. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's also like I couldn't (pause)—it's difficult for me to imagine him today screaming at a 12 year old. Like, I don't think he would do that. He's got other things that I could (inaudible at 21:27) for, but, like (laughter) that angle of, like, losing control of his temper and, you know, being unreasonably angry with someone who is innocent and can't and doesn't have any power is not part of what comes out of him anymore. You know, like, I think he still gets really angry, but (pause) it's just all very confused (laughter). So...</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if (pause) you also feel sad about what happened with Eric (sp?) because it (pause) involves (pause) how difficult and how risky it can feel to push back, to get angry, to sort of defend your own (inaudible at 23:28) that way, not another way but that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) It's like there's this basic impulse towards self defense and somehow that just got, like, (pause) taken apart from me at some point. It's just like I have—it is as hard for me to make myself defend myself, like, actively. You know, obviously there's things that I do to defend myself that I'm not really aware of, but like it (pause)—that's really hard for me. [00:24:33] And I feel like that's something that's really basic and shouldn't be so hard. (Pause) That I shouldn't have to feel badly about myself doing this. </p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, it feels like I did get punished for what felt at the time, like, defending myself (pause) or asking for what I needed. (Pause) It's just that it's very unclear to me what the difference between want and need is. I mean, it's unclear to most people, but (pause), you know, I don't have a mechanism for feeling OK about needing things. [00:26:37]</p>

<p>(Pause) You know, it's also, like, in some ways it feels very good to be that angry. And I find that very scary and, you know (pause), bad that I feel like I could do anything to somebody else and, like, that's really scary for me. You know, I kind of stormed off in a huff (pause) because I'd already said more than I meant to, you know, and more upset than I meant to be and I just felt like it was going to escalate and I needed to leave. [00:27:48] I feel like it wasn't going to get useful from that point on. That's (pause) very scary.</p>

<p>You know, so if I'm angry at my dad now, like, what do I do with that? Do I talk to him about this? What do I do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When we've talked about it before, it's always been in a situation where I think he bought it up and in retrospect, I think he bought it up because he was feeling guilty. You know, we talked about it last year, last summer in Canada and—you know, because I had just been hospitalized, like, a month before and was still not doing that well. And we talked about it (inaudible at 29:21) hospital again in October. But both of those were in situations where I felt very, like, safe and calm and peaceful and so my impulse was just to say, look, it's OK, it's OK.</p>

<p>But it's not really OK. You know, in some ways it is, but in some ways it's not.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>You know (pause), the way I deal with him now is (pause) kind of (inaudible at 30:35). He has what he has to give and he is who he is, and some of that's really wonderful and some of that makes me want to claw your eyes out of their sockets, like (laughter), and (pause) that's it. (Laughter) I can't make him be a different person, so I just (pause) loved him and don't let him drive me around, you know, kind of be out of the car with him (laughter).</p>

<p>(Pause) You know, but there's seems like this huge disconnect between, like, my dad and the way I remember him as a child, you know, as this kind of, like, tyrant. [00:31:43] As this, like, just completely volatile person who, you know, was going to go off. It was only a matter of when, but I didn't know when it was going to be and somehow it was always surprising, but also completely familiar. Here I am in hell again and I just have to wait for it to go away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at) (pause) it just sounds so similar to the way you sometimes talk about things being now. Not with him (inaudible at 32:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: About my moods (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it does, doesn't it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I thought was, like, crushed (ph). In some ways that seems to be, you know, more than what (ph) you're living with sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. One (ph) I have the same kind of frantic need to feel like I can control how I feel when they happen, how bad they are (inaudible at 33:18). How this is, you know, if you hold your mouth just right this'll happen (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 33:28) Yeah, but I think that includes—and you're right about the (inaudible at 33:32). But, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In here?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, probably. (Pause) I mean, it's very hard for me to even be aware of that in here, because I'm so conscious of the ways that (pause) things that are painful in here are ultimately fruitful, like, that they're, like (pause)—I mostly believe that this is going somewhere (laughter). And most of the time, I ultimately feel better, even when it's really painful. (Pause) But so I think the other is also happening but it gets lost. [00:34:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That could (pause)—it's hard for me to know whether that level, what you're describing, operates. I could imagine that both being true in some sense in how you genuinely feel and an example of what we're talking about, where it's very important to believe that this is going somewhere and that it's helping because otherwise (pause) I think it would—it might feel, like, really unfair or like you were being badly treated or (pause) but I'm...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the best I can go by is that, like, I don't have to drive myself to therapy. Like, I want to come, like, everyday. (Pause) But you know, other things that I know are good for me but don't feel like they're good for me, you know, it doesn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) (inaudible at 35:49) myself really avoiding (ph). And I don't this, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well good.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, once I'm here, I don't' necessarily—it's hard for me to be here. No, not that, but (pause), you know, I could talk about stuff that doesn't really make me hurt a lot (laughter) for a long time. And, you know, so unless the things that hurt are pressing, it's hard for me to kind of bring them up, which is the disadvantage of (inaudible at 36:55), but, you know, I feel like I think if you were pushing more, I would feel much more resentful of it. (Pause) But maybe I just don't like people telling me what to do (laughter).</p>

<p>(Pause) Also, I don't like (pause) I don't like people telling me that they know the answer when they clearly don't, you know. I find therapists who push more, that dynamic seems to happen more often. (Pause) It takes me a long time to learn not to trust people or categories of people, but (laughter) I'm [there with a therapist] (ph), lucky you (laughter). [00:38:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I can live with that] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I figured. You know, like the—god, the woman that the intake at the hospital last October. You know, some on-call doctor during the psychiatric intake and at the end is, like, talking for an hour and, you know, I was bad enough to be admitted into a psych unit where, like, I—that's where I was. She basically had made up her mind that I had some, like, giant guilt complex out of being Christian and so, like, asked me, like, "Do you think that this comes from X place?" It was clearly designed to have me say, "Oh my goodness, it's because I'm Christian. Oh my goodness. Or it was because I was raised Christian. Like, I feel so guilty because, you know, I feel like God's going to spite me." I was just like, "Fuck you." [00:39:05] (Laughter)</p>

<p>But I tend to be resistant to that sort of] (ph) thing. (Pause) I think the clock is ticking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Oh no] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) (inaudible at 39:36) going very fast. I didn't—I just couldn't, but it doesn't get to me. (Pause) I've been feeling pretty bad lately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you said the weekend was really bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really bad. And it's been more kind of deep under the surface, but, you know, I'll feel like I feel like I'm fine and then suddenly I just will want to kill myself. (Pause) That's not good. (Pause) That's not good [for me] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yesterday's [bad enough] (ph). [00:40:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really, just, like, scattered parts of it. You know, like it was fine, I made it through the day, I had energy, I did things. But you know, I catch myself just sitting down and [be like] (ph) I wonder what would happen if I jumped (inaudible at 40:55). I'm lucky this is only three stories. (Pause) But yeah, I don't ever (pause)—it's not ever strong enough to override the fact checking impulse that, like, so what would happen if you did that? And then all of the reasons not to do that that come pretty apparent. (Pause) But you know, if suicide were easier, my life would be more difficult right now, if that makes sense. [00:41:47]</p>

<p>(Pause) The thing about reading David Foster Wallace is that he's (pause) basically always saying the same thing. But you know, he says a lot of different things but he always basically just saying people want love, people want to connect, people want intimacy. And they don't know how to ask for it or look for it but that's what they really want. And I find that (pause) very comforting, especially as he breaks it up in the context of things that are pretty close to my life. Like, mental healthcare and prep schools and (laughter) all of these things. [00:42:53] But the thing is, like, he killed himself. Like, I come back to that. Like, he lost (pause) and I don't want to be there in 20 years. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible at 43:21).</p>

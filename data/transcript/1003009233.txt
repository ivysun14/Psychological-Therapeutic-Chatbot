<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And thank you very much.  I'll keep that over to the side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I fill it out up here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not necessary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can do that or, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty redundant, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well how have you been doing?  I know we spoke on the phone briefly -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Between visits.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] yesterday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he refused to, to do the blood test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People are not always very receptive to that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said, no.  He said that, the, it's gone way too far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's afraid that I'm going to, like be put on too much medicine, that I don't have any of that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the Lyme test?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's because he says it's usually right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm getting all this, like, like the information, and he said he doesn't want, he doesn't want, uh, he said that's your thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he won't do the, that blood test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he referred me to an infectious disease specialist or whatever it is at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I called and made an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that person will do the blood thing, he said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's this guy who is into it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says this guy is really into it, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he said if he gives it to the, the lab, if I had done it yesterday at that lab, he said they wouldn't have even have done it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] or they would have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There may be a protocol, you know, to go through -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said it would take too long or something because they actually have to take blood out and look.  A person actually has to look at it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's exactly right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I have an appointment on Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, with this infectious disease specialist, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I, I asked him, I said, you know, I said the exercising is not really helping.  Um, I told him I was on the doxycycline and he said he hated that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It makes him feel sick.  I said, "Well, it makes me feel sick too" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "But it will help."  And he just said I have a bad case of fibromyalgia, and I could try exercising five days a week.  But that's a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm tired all of the time.  So that's hard for me.  And if I something during the week, it's like I can only put up, you know, do so much in a day, like if I have, you know, like I always go to the gym after this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if I come here after work, I usually don't go to the gym that day because it's too much to, it's just too much for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but he said I should do it anyway, to go to the gym.  So it was just weird because it's like I'm getting completely conflicting information from him, like saying that all he's, like he's afraid that I'm going to take too much medicine and get hooked on it.  And, um, have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And is it the amitriptyline, I mean, specifically that he's worried about?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because he's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because he prescribed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's pretty much in favor of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He prescribed that and that was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that addresses a number of different concerns.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's because, I think it's because now I have the clonazepam and the Xanax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's not like I take the Xanax all the time.  I took it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like three times in how, however many months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, and I think because I said if I, I was told, like about the rifampin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, but then he's likes, "Oh, another medicine?"  He's like anti-medicine sort of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said that the only other thing he could do for me is to give me pain medication, which would alter my character, and I would be hooked -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On it for life kind of thing, like I'd get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What a strange way to look at the world.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know, I don't know.  I'm like, I want to take medicine if it's going to be, I want to figure what's wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I'm like I appreciate that you're trying to do, figure out all these things because what if it is, but he's like, "Well all these doctors are so into it that they think everybody has Lyme disease."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm not even sure that Lyme disease is in the picture for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I brought some more information -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To discuss with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But just to review -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, because it's interesting that he started off -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With, you know, and we continued -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it made sense with the Elavil -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which can go to so many different areas, depressive symptoms -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know its original indication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, some pain management issues, some aspects of panic disorder and anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then when symptoms of the panic kept breaking through, um, the clonazepam went on -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As kind of like a foundation to try -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To prevent the breakthrough of panic symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The alprazolam is just there just for the panic breakthrough.  And if he only knew how seldom you refill those -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told him that I don't have a lot of sadness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think he'd be as worried about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's just like, he's worried that we're going to think that I have all these diseases and or whatever I have and I'm going to start taking, he said he had a patient, he had like four other patients like me.  And one of them, her doctor now has her on an IV for a year and a half, thinking she has some infectious disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And sometimes that's what it takes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But not always.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But he's saying that these people don't have the diseases.  That they just have fibro and the people are saying there're other things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If the tests are unreliable though, how can you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be sure they don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said it's reliable.  That's the thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what confusing me.  I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You read the book, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could read 10 books.  It's depressing me.  This book is totally depressing me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Remember everybody gets better though, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because it's like, like you get it, it's like these -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's relief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Medical history things, like, it's like little did he know the rest of his life was going to down hill from his Lyme disease.  And then it like turn the next page and the, I'm like getting depressed reading it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  I want to direct you to a particular page in that book -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm going to explain why.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I'm going to talk to you about some symptoms first -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then a different plan, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, fatigue -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Often with agitation, as opposed to complete exhaustion.  So like tired, you know, but, like an agitated depression, feeling down and dragging but, oh, I can't sleep and I have so much going through my mind, more of an agitation than just a plain exhaustion.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get that at night.  I, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  People often complain about that at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And when the Elavil came into the picture, it sounded like that helped it a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It did help -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I first started it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like at first it would just like kind of knock me out but now it doesn't do that as much.  I have been waking up during the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I can fall back asleep, and like before I started any of this medicine, I was waking up in the middle of the night a lot.  But I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep because I'd start panicking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But now I can go back to sleep when I wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you remember if the waking up was associated with feeling flushed or hot or sweaty at all -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm, I'm hot a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or periods during the day, feeling flushed, hot -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'd, I'd, when I have a headaches -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like now, I have a headache and I feel like overheated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could you use some, uh, Motrin or anything?  I've got some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess, but I, I have Advil I can take.  I just haven't taken it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sure?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you like, I have water, you know, be comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm a, I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm used, yeah.  I'm kind of used to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But this is the thing, sometimes people live with symptoms for a long time and that I've been doing more research and have a slightly different proposition on stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And their advantage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, go on.  I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I want to be sure I'm asking you the right things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  You're, you're doing great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, low-grade fevers, especially in the morning or late afternoon, often associated with feelings of coming down with the flu or a virus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So I try to take my temperature as much I can remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I kept forgetting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, okay.  [LAUGHING].  It's like I keep forgetting.  The last time I didn't remember until later in the day, which was the problem.  But, so randomly.  Okay.  So my temperature range from anywhere from 98.6 to 99.6.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So like on [DATE] at 4:00, it was 99.2, 6:00, and then like, there at 6:00 or 7:00, or I don't know, it was like 99.6.  The next day, like noon, it was 99.4.  Then it was at, then later in the day it 98.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then [DATE], it was like back to 99.4 and then down to 98.6.  So my temperature changes a lot, but stays -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But in that range.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And mostly pretty low grade.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, one day it was just staying at 98.6, both times I took it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, 98.8, 99.4.  I mean, but it ranged the highest was 99 point, what did I say, 99.6?  99.6 was the highest it got.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good.  That's really helpful information.  When the headaches hit, where do you feel them, like what part of your head?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, like the, the front I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know where you -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Headaches, especially frontal -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's, it's so hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are often confused with sinus or top of head.  So, frontal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it's, I mean, but it just, I just feel like sick, just makes me feel kind of sick and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like my face feels, am I red?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little, a little.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel my face is flushed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little bit flushed, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Because like my, like I can feel head is hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Eye symptoms are common and include blurred vision episodes, red eyes, dry eyes, depth perception problems, and light sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I have any of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And sometimes people they're walking down the stairs and they miss a step more often than the used to or they're uncertain -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like going off a curb or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm a klutz.  I just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then you felt like that hasn't changed much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've always been a klutz.  I've walked into walls.  I've fallen off steps but, um, I don't think it's changed much.  I mean, I've noticed I like maybe miss a step.  But that's very recent and I just thought it because I wasn't paying attention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it's, see it's just so funny because this is what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was like, well, they'll ask you all these questions, like of all these things that could be wrong but look it there's so many, like everyone has all these things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But to what degree and how prominent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's what it turns out to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.  That makes sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything with your ears, see I'm not even going to ask you leading questions -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything you've noticed with your ears, off and on at all in the last few months or year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Unless I have an earache.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't have it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes people will sense sudden episodes of hearing loss, a rushing or a ringing sound in their ear, a buzzing, but it, it usually doesn't feel like an ear infection with pain or swelling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's like an ear, they might hear a rushing sound like the ocean or something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I hear like a, kind of like, like that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it doesn't have an [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, not often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That't the bottom line.  A couple times a month, a couple times a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, god.  Not that much.  Maybe like once every few months, if that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not a real prominent thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Recurring sore throats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I wouldn't say often.  I mean, how often would be recurring?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like maybe a couple times a week -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pretty consistently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Swollen glands, especially neck and underarms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've never checked the glands under my arms.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where, what do you, where are they?  I don't even know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like, you know, when you're putting on bra, you know, and you just kind of feel like lymph nodes with glands -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like it hurts?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like a swollen, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it hurts when I push here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, but doesn't that, my mom says that hurts everyone because there's a nerve there, like a nerve, like by your jaw?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't hurt if you push on your jaw?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Back of your jaw, like here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hum-um.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  Oh, that hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't think it's swollen.  It just hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thought that was normal.  I don't know.  I haven't noticed a swollen gland unless I talk too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here are the ones where things start looking different from sort of a typical depression.  I think it's worth asking about and people often don't realize this could be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Associated with infection, but anxiety, panic, or worry attacks others perceive as very anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you, what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well like, um, just feeling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Immobilized, like when you mentioned awakening from sleep -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Worrying or feeling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very panicked or an increase in panic or, you know, and think about your, in thinking about traveling at one point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That makes me more anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It was so hard to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean, still -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Set it up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I know I, like even if I have week with a lot of things, like, let's say I have something every day at, with something after work -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I won't be able to go to sleep as easily or I'll think about it and it's weird because I think about, like, let's say I have to go.  Okay.  When I had to go to New York, okay -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I worry about each and every step along the way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't worry just, like I'm going to New York.  I am, like, "Oh, God," and I wake up at time and I usually feel sick if I wake up early.  So I, I don't want to do that and then I get anxious when it's dark out when I wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I have to get in the, you know, and that each, each, each step is like, "Oh, God, am I going to get through that step?"  So that's annoying and that, that does happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or if I'm going out at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so that's always been a problem but I mean, it's like once I was made aware of it, my like anxiety wasn't what everybody had, it made me more anxious about it, and like, in New York, when, I was fine during the day, for most of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when I knew that that night was the night that we were going to out to a bar, I got nervous.  I got anxious and I, you know, that's when I took the Xanax -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I knew that, like that night, night was going to last longer and it would be like longer then I wouldn't be just in the room, in a bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'd rather in a hotel room, and that, that sucks because I should want to go out and go to this really cool restaurant and go out.  But I was like, but like in my mind, it's like, "Oh, I would be better off in the hotel room."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because then I wouldn't feel sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll get to the point where you feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope, I hope so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really feel optimistic about it.  Agitation, irritability, rage, impulsivity, or aggression?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm not really an angry person.  I don't think -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I haven't really been hearing that either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, the only time that I get angry is if I feel like, like somebody personally attacks me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, like I'll hold a grudge.  I'm having that problem with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, um, but I won't, like, like be angry at them.  I just won't be, I won't be mean.  I'll just like, a calm kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And you haven't been flying off the handle, yelling at anybody, or rage or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I ever done that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really impulsive stuff like big purchases, gambling, or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Big purchases are the opposite of me.  I don't buy anything.  I think I mentioned that earlier and I think a problem that I have to work with.  But, um, gamble, I don't gamble.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been, I won't buy me a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So impulsive just really isn't, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not really in the picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.  Not, not really.  That, that is a waste of good money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like buying that kind of thing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, or just acting erratically or not typical for you and I'm not really hearing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we've never even thought, "Oh, something looks like bipolar," or, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Not anything like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, episodes of confusion and disorientation that are usually transient and can be scary, like driving a car and suddenly you forget where you're going or you're walking toward a room and you think, "I can't even remember why I came in here" -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just kind, uh, you know, it's something you're used to doing but suddenly you, you just lose your way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You forgot how to do it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not sure why you're there.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have trouble, I have trouble concentrating -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like when I'm reading, like when, if I, I could read a whole chapter and I don't know what I read because, uh, my mind was wondering.  I have trouble focusing on like written stuff, especially if I have to read it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that happen increasingly, would you say in the last few months or years or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's been like that throughout school.  I think, I think it's like always been like that, but I've had trouble concentrating maybe more towards college and on but I'm not sure.  But I don't, I mean, sometimes I'll start going somewhere and I'll be confused, like driving, but I have a really bad sense of direction.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like at a constant state of lost.  So, uh, and a lot of times like before I even go anywhere I just sit in the car even if it's a place I have been a million times, I'll have to sit in the car -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And think about which direction my car should go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then when I try to, like pick, I have to like literally drive there in my head and it's hard to keep that in your head so you keep losing it and you have to keep starting over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know what I mean because, like I'll start going down the road in my head and then I'll, I'll lose it and I have to back up and I have start from my house again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has it always been true?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since I have been driving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're looking about 10 years probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ten years, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just never, never thought about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Since my mom says she can't, that she has to do it too, she said so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Poor sleep, especially difficulty falling asleep or poor sleep quality, like not feeling rested?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never feel like well rested, ever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've always had trouble going to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A lot of times it was nerves for the next day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, just worrying about every, everyone in my life and things, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always had trouble falling asleep, and I was always a very light sleeper, like if you breathe, I wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Joint pain and stiffness often symmetrical?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm stiff in the mornings when I wake up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just feel like sore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Kind of all over?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, more like in my legs and, and in my back.  But it doesn't really happen every day unless I sitting in a place for a long time.  But isn't that normal to feel stiff when you wake, when you get up after you've been sitting for a long time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know that it's joint pain unless, like I'm sitting in a weird position.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And how about foot pain, heels and soles of the feet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean, my soles start to hurt -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But in high heels -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or in flats.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about first thing in the morning, like standing up out of bed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If my, if I was walking around the night before -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then my feet will still hurt in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um, muscle pains, especially in the calves, maybe twitching and cramping also in your muscles?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I used to get a lot of charley horses, but I don't get them as much anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I, I was told that dancers used, dancers get them a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but since I've stopped dancing, I don't really get them anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what kind of ma, like, I mean if I touch it, it hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like if I press it.  But it doesn't hurt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other than that, unless it's like the morning or I'm stiff, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's doesn't hurt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about nerve irritation symptoms that can be described as burning, vibrating, numb, or shooting pains?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get shooting pains in my body sometimes.  But I just thought that was normal.  Do you ever feel like a shot of pain somewhere?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Definitely.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You get that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And some people will talk about it as sciatica, that kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, that's what my mom said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, yeah, I'll just get it, like in my head sometimes or in my legs or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That will just shoot a few times or start, uh, twitching I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But not, not often.  But that's just tired muscle, I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How long have you been experiencing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, God, years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Years worth, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Years.  But the, but the shooting pain, I don't remember the shooting pain being years.  But that, it doesn't, I mean, it doesn't happen all the time but, like it will happen once in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't have to like stop what I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Tremors and/or muscle twitching?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Other than the twitching, I said, but I thought -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was just like in a vein.  I'm trying to really, thinking here of this sort of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It could be muscle though.  Um, heart palpitations and strange chest pains?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know that I have chest pain.  I, I have heart palpitations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why went to the cardiologist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that they [INAUDIBLE] as syncope or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, inappropriate sinus tachycardia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they told you to keep up your salt intact.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They said, yeah, eat more salt and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Drink, drink eight, I'm not drinking enough, I know that much.  It's too many things to remember -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard to remember, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Between that, all the medicines, and I was like trying to take my temperature.  It was just like I just trying to remember a lot of things.  But I think I have to drink more and then they said that like my body misinterprets, um, excitement or happiness for panic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was told a long time ago, not that long, like a year ago, that, like if I'm really excited for something, I'll feel sick because my body will, the adrenaline will start rushing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then instead of the blood going to my heart and head, it goes to my legs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So then I feel faint and I feel sick and shaky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if I get happy or really sad or any, anything, it winds up being me feeling sick or anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was told with the, the heart palpitations.  I know I was like sitting in a, I wasn't even anxious then.  But I just sitting at a heart monitor -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I wore for like 24 hours -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was just sitting in a staff meeting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my heart was like 166 just sitting there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that would be inappropriate sinus tachycardia -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said.  So I have had heart issues.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think that after running the mile, I think that's when they started looking at my heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But they said my heart was fine, it was just dehydrated at that point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  Yeah.  And they're probably talking about the salt to help keep the water.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They said the salt -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Circulating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  So that when, they said if I eat the salt when my blood drops to my legs, I'll still have enough volume to stay up here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what they said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, episodes of breathlessness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like if I haven't run up the stairs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In general?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you feeling short of breath just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If  I'm anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then my chest feels like someone is pressing on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like I can't breathe in anything at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Is it painful if you do, like painful across your chest or like in the ribs or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not painful.  It's just like, it just makes me more anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pressure?  No.  No pressure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just like, it's just like un, very uncomfortable pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That it's, that it's just like it, it just makes me more anxious because then I get worried I'm going to pass out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Strange rashes recurring on the body often, red stretch marks, peculiar tender lumps and nodules along the sides of the legs or arms, and spider veins?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I have spider veins.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Red -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have, what was that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Red streaks that look like stretch marks or, uh, strange rashes that recur.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a line here, but I think that's from me folding.  [LAUGHING].  I'm not sure.  I can show you.  I'm not sure that's what it is.  Um, and I have those dots on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That rash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's a, I don't know if it's a rash or what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But sometimes they get raised and red.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They don't really itch, but they just get raised and red and then my mom is like, "What's, what is that?"  And I'm like, "Oh, that's one of the dots," and it will go back down.  And sometimes when the ones on my leg raise, they get itchy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had one on my leg for a long time.  I think like three years or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What does it look like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's just, I'll show you.  That.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that one is a little bit raised.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know what you're talking about.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then there's like that but they're not as raised but they're like here and here and here and here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then on my stomach right here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll just -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I didn't have them before.  See these dots?  Those are fairly new.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah, I do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I know that just a sign but that's probably folding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's probably from your clothing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And then on your chest it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My chest are the new ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Almost like it's in a line a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, there's a bunch of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've only had like the, like the freckles here and here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never had, I never had this much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is totally separate from the, from the freckles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  This is like new.  This is like in the past few months or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I never had those before and sometimes they raise and sometimes they go down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know what that is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How about gut symptoms, especially acid reflux problems, like upset stomach a lot?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I don't think I have acid reflux because that's like here, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's, yeah, or even further down, like it's just an upset stomach -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Chronically nauseous?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I think only when I'm nervous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I've been like nauseous consistently -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I think that that might be anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't think I have more upsets, I don't know what normal people have so it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like hard to say what's normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about pain or tenderness in your shin bones, like if you push on the front?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Yeah.  That hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That hurts or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I don't know if it's more, I don't know what's normal?  Like I'm not pushing that hard -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And this hurts.  But, I mean, it hurts a lot of places for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it hurts here.  It hurts here.  I have tenderness on my thighs, the top of my thighs are really bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Is one leg worse than the other?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Or do you have swelling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I swell anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They both feel the same.  They both feel normal.  They feel the same.  But I, I mean, it is painful to push on the bone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, but, normal?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give this to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can actually, you know, look at the symptoms, take it to the infectious disease person at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's a case study of a person who, um, was known to have Lyme disease at one time, got it treated, had a response to doxycycline, got a set of symptoms that was similar but not the same, didn't respond to the doxycycline the month before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But did very well after one month on Levaquin, a second antibiotic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What I have been seeing with people from this area, and I do think that, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, conditions tend to cluster together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A better response to one month of Levaquin than bothering with the rifampin.  Some people say the rifampin can have some antianxiety effects.  There may be some mention of it in this chapter I'm going to give you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But even after several months, not as dramatic of a response as the Levaquin.  I think what's speaks to possible Bartonella with your situation is the appearance of the rash -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where there's a streaky quality.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There is?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, um, the ones on your chest they're like small lines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They are kind of linear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That tends -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Although not all of them</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To be a little bit more characteristic.  I'm sure if it's wildlife in our area or what.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but also some of the panic -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some of the anxiety that kind of persistent fatigue -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the agitation, hard to fall asleep, the headaches, um, and then some of the stiffness, the nerve -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Involvement, would you want to consider a month of Levaquin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Instead of the doxycycline or with it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can go with the doxycycline too.  I mean, if you, if it's not making you completely miserable to be on it, I'd suggest keep everything the same, add the Levaquin, go to your doctor's appointment at [DEIDENTIFIED], tell them if you've noticed anything on the Levaquin.  Because sometimes it can take five or six blood tests before an intercellular parasite will show up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Could I wait until we get the results from the blood tests and then go on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could or if you want to talk the person at [DEIDENTIFIED] and say, you know, take this with, check off what applies -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or if it reminds you of something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, say I've been looking at these co-infections.  My psychiatrist thinks there are a couple of things that might be involved with my symptoms -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That have to do with depression and anxiety -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Weird reactions to bug bites for a years, traveling history, all -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, the skin condition.  I've been on doxycycline on X amount of time -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really no change in it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How long have I been on it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably like two or three months now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know but like it's, like been a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me double check.  Yeah, two or three months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel like I'm not like doing anything because I'm only taking half of the dose.  I'm only taking a 100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It could theoretically tackle, there are a couple of co-infections that can travel together that the doxycycline could, could get to.  And some of them are mentioned in here and some are common in this area.  Ehrlichios, ehrlichiosis, Babesia, Lyme, um, Bartonella usually isn't addressed by the doxycycline as much as a doxycycline-rifampin combination or Levaquin, with or without doxycycline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  But we shouldn't figure out if I, through the blood test, if I have it or not before I start?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's worth a try.  I don't think you have to wait on the blood tests just because that one is not very reliable either.  It just like with Lyme -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It isn't?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you hit it, no.  You can ask the person at [DEIDENTIFIED].  Recently, what I've gotten back from the lab says you may have to send five or six samples before it can be documented.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's good at hiding, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So what was that other test I saw on TV, where they did it and they could -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There is a urine test, urine PCS -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That can sometimes pick up the genetic traces, the DNA traces of something like Lyme.  I think it can pick up some of the other co-infections as well and that might be where your infectious disease expert at [DEIDENTIFIED] will know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he might test that test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  You know if he, you know, may have some better way to zero in on it or definitive -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's also probably why your rheumatologist said, you know, we could send it to Lab Quest, we could send it to Lab Corp and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, they have you up but they keep sending back to me is, "We didn't visualize it this time but that doesn't mean it isn't there."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You might have to send five or six samples.  I mean, that is a real hassle for anybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if your rheumatologist knows someone good at [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, there's no reason you can't go in -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, those are characteristics of all of these things then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, co-infections.  So it talks about -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How, how do you tell if it might be Bartonella, if it might be Babesia -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it might Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if it might -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Be Ehrlichia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It talks about different characteristics of each one, and I think you'll see why I kind of was thinking more along the lines of the Bartonella and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Frankly, the red streaks, there's more characteristics of Bartonella than anything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And did, are they known to raise and then go down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They can.  And when it says, um, strange rashes recurring on the body often, they could be red stretch marks, tender lumps and nodules.  They could look like spider veins.  They could look like stretch marks.  But they wax and wane, you know, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you didn't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really have the textbook type of bulls eye rash that's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I didn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Associated with Lyme.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  The one time I think I got bit, bitten it was like in my hair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure, but that bug was bigger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was like this size.  So I don't know if that could be a tick or a bug that could be carrying it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was like this big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On this bug, and, and if it were engorged with blood those ticks can get to be a pretty good size.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And I don't, I don't know if I would see a bulls eye if it's in, under my hair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you did mention even as a child when you had bug bites, you tended to have a reaction to it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They would, they'd blow up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They do even now if I touch them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So there's, I think -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There not supposed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's something.  I'm not sure what.  There maybe some clues in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I actually have the reference, um, it's written by a doctor who works in, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he sees a lot of this.  Um, I got this from Amazon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and he does do a nice job of talking about why the diagnosis is challenging.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, why, you know, the one guy he diagnosed with the Bartonella -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He had been previously been treated from Lyme.  All of his Bartonella tests came back negative, but his clinical history was so strong.  And within a month, he knew they were, they were on the right track with the levofloxacin, the Levaquin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Levaquin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, which is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's only a brand name at this point.  I don't think there's a generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would only need a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it would be Levaquin plus 1 doxycycline?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could keep taking the doxycycline, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or plus 2 doxycycline?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or none.  If it's just Bartonella, the Levaquin should do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you have a co-infection of some sort, yeah, that might be where an infectious disease expert could say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it is, I think it isn't.  You could hold off on the doxycycline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, you should consider -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the Levaquin, if that works in a month, these spots would be gone?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They should.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's a way I could know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  I think when I was taking the 2 doxycycline, my pain's actually got worse -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> While I was on the doxy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like the 2 doxy, I like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Tried to go to Pilates and I couldn't even lie down on the ground.  I had to leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Unless that's a Herxheimer reaction, like it's killing them off and they're giving off the toxins.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I remember you saying that it could get worse and then get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I thought maybe that's what was happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it also upset your stomach a lot more, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's what it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like especially throwing up sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It really made me feel sick.  So, I mean, I can do it again if I'll get rid of this.  But I don't want to, you know, be on this doxycycline for like four months -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Taking 1 if I'm not doing anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.  And that's where an infectious disease person might be able to say because sometimes if a, if a long-standing infection is suspected, sometimes they don't go in with, you know, heavy guns blazing on the antibiotics.  They'd want a more gradually release the toxin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So you're suggesting, what is it called Leva -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, Levaquin for a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Levaquin.  Okay.  And that I would take once a day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what are the side effects of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Generally, it's well tolerated.  Sometimes a little bit of upset stomach -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but it can be taken with food if need be.  Again, probably save dairy products for later if you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Was it one hour before and two hours after or two hours before and two, and one hour after?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One hour before a meal -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or two hours after.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dairy but don't have dairy an hour before or two hours after?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I would take the -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I heard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Antibiotic one hour before or two hours after dairy also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One hour before and two hour, okay so two hours after taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes also, um, people if they have they are running magnesium deficiency, did we talk about magnesium at all?  Um, they can get, um, irritation of tendons.  So usually magnesium supplementation is a good idea with Levaquin.  It's just a precaution.  But, you know, it's a, a supplement.  It can be bought off the shelf.  Usually people take the Levaquin in the morning.  They take magnesium at lunch.  And I have never had anybody get that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tendon irritation.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] has seen it though.  So as a precaution he usually recommends it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's not too many medicines that I'm on?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The magnesium is just a supplement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a supplement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's probably good for you anyway kind of thing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can also help anti-inflammatory.  It can help fibromyalgia.  It can help your body fight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So is this too many things, too many variables because what if that's taking care of it and not the Levaquin what, yeah, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no reason you can't take magnesium anyway.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it wouldn't do anything about the red marks on your skin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that's the way to tell that that's not the drug that's doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And then you recommend it, I guess I should do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, especially read this because I know I've thrown a ton of information at you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, you have two different doctors saying two different things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I hear it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's very reasonable to talk to the person at [DEIDENTIFIED].  I mean, that person is practicing in our neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He knows what's local.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He probably knows what's likely to show up on tests and which one isn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you know, first do no harm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really my thought.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fortunately, Levaquin is really pretty well tolerated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and it can be taken with doxycycline.  There are some antibiotics that don't fit well together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes rifampin can interfere with pain relief from other medicines.  So I'm just thinking if that's likely -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To look like a longer haul -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, which is not that [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Un, unless your [DEIDENTIFIED] doc says that's better for other considerations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So you're saying to get it and then if he says stop taking it, stop taking it, before Tuesday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, say if, today is Tuesday, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you felt so inclined, say you got it, you started taking it tomorrow -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And by the time you see him on Tuesday you say, "I'm just better."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.  That would help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would be surprised if he said stop taking it now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But if I, like how, when should I start feeling a difference, like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Probably within a few days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?  It's that fast?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you'll know if you're on the right track or not, yeah.  That was the case with this guy who had the symptoms for a couple of years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And like right away he just kind of felt -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it was in, within -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Few days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The first week or two he called and he said, "We're on the right track with this."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So that would mean I would have less physical pain?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like I wouldn't get as many headaches, like all these little things with like that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You'd concentrate better.  You'd feel less anxious, less depressed -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sleep should improve.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm willing to try anything.  I just don't want to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A week later the guy called the office and was very excited that he was feeling dramatically better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> His headache and anxiety were much improved and his joints were starting to feel better.  By the time I saw him, uh, again, a month after we started the antibiotic, he stated that he was 80% better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This particular person, who had had the Lyme disease before and had had these symptoms for a long time, he did take it for three months.  But that was the one thing he took.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The Levaquin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was for three months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Why did he take it for three months if he felt better after two weeks?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think because after a month, he was 80% better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he just kept going?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think he, he -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Believed he could have total recovery from his symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And this wouldn't harm me in anyway so it's worth a try?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It shouldn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It shouldn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And since some of the other things don't seem to be working, why not try it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If there's a root cause we can go after -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if some of what we've treated, we've been treating has been symptoms of that, you may not need as much Elavil, as much, uh, benzodiazepine -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  What's, what is the benzo what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, it's both the Klonopin and alprazolam, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Look at me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, which is what we went after the anxiety and panic with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When the Elavil didn't cover all of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  And that's the other thing.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said the clonazepam is not a long-term medicine.  I can only be on that for so long.  It's not long term.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's, it's interesting that he should look at it that way.  Some non-neurologists, non-psychiatrists -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> May think of it that way.  And I think it's because sometimes, like sleep medications are also in that class of medication and the hope is that in that case, you've got insomnia, which if you can reset your sleep clock, you're going to outgrow the need for it.  But bear in mind, Klonopin was originally developed as an antiseizure medication.  I have patients who have been on it for seizures for years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it works well.  It's long term for them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Patients with restless leg syndrome, periodic leg movement disorder at night are on it for years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it takes care of the problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I wonder why he?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he's probably thinking we're hoping the anxiety and panic is short term.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And once the source is resolved -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially if it has an infectious -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Component to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He was just saying that the whole thing, like people have wound up in the hospital with these saying they have an infectious diseases and it's all stress related.  So he said it's depression and anxiety that are the cause of all of it.  And that the spots are from medicine.  Or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You had the spots a long time before the medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Did I?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> These ones I didn't?  Not these.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Before the doxycycline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before the doxycycline I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's thinking maybe in all the other medicines.  And then said some other, uh, whatever he saw.  He was like looking at my arm because I guess I, some people have this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It just some people have it, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That rash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a [INAUDIBLE].  It's not a rash.  It's jut like raised red bumps.  It doesn't itch.  It's just like, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't have that all over, it's patches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, just, just this part of my arm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It's patches.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> On both arms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He says everybody has that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, some people do.  I know other people who have it.  My best friend has it.  It's called something.  It's just like the hair, the follicles don't, um, I, I don't any terms.  [LAUGHING].  I'm trying here.  Um, it just didn't like, uh, you have to scrub it or take the medicine if you want to get rid of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it's itchy, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It doesn't itch at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just bumpy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But anyway, so he goes, "That's just you."  So like some things he says are just me.  So I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If it's just you then why are you in so much pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You weren't born in pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not the pain, but like the marks might just be me because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know how you get older and get more marks on you?  I don't know, I'm willing to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.  They wax and wane though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Give me the medicine.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not necessarily buying that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I see freckles and moles.  Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Tho, you know.  Those I understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you haven't had the same -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The whole time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And this I had, I've had for a few years but that was never there and then these are more recent and then these are even more recent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is the thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This I've had for, forever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't, is that a good thing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not painful or itchy -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's kind of like a skin that hasn't exfoliated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's basically what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's why they have exfoliators.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, on both, yeah.  It doesn't really get rid of it, but it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, yeah but the other dot on my stomach, that happened like a year ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If nothing else were going on and it, you know, no headaches, no nerve stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could get used to headaches but like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No muscle twitching.  Yeah.  But the fact that I'm hearing more physical even as the panic -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And some of the depressive symptoms are coming under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're getting more rest but you don't feel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very well rested.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I feel like when I'm tired that's when I get these headaches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been getting more, more headaches -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I feel hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I don't know.  I thought fevers go along with headaches, like do most people get fevers when they have a headache?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not necessarily and earlier I had someone in the office who said, "Well everybody throws up when they get a headache and then they feel better."  I said -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've heard that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "Not everybody throws up when they get headache."  Some people do have that as part of a migraine syndrome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always get nauseous when I have headaches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then do you throw up and feel better immediately afterwards?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  So that was the case perhaps for this person's experience -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's strange.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And we were trying to figure out what was going on with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But sometimes people just assume, you know, oh, well, that's just why.  But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I've assumed for like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know.  That's an awful -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Lot of stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It was like in the very beginning I'm like the, the doctor was like, "Wait, that hurt?"  I'm like, "It doesn't hurt you?"  [LAUGHING].  You know it's like you don't, you learn to live it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's like I don't think I'm different.  But now I need to not be like, I sat down.  We just newly upholstered the dining rooms chairs this weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I sit down and lean back and I can't lean back on the chairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because my spine is touching the wood.  So I am thinking of making like a pad for the back of my chair because I can't sit there.  So it's just, you know, in the office I have to make sure I have pad with, a seat with a pad on it.  I can't sit on a regular chair or I feel these bumps going into the chair.  So they wouldn't make those chairs if it hurt everybody, I feel like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So there's got to be something going on and I have these spots.  I don't know what these spots are.  So I, I'll take whatever this is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'll give this to you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And absolutely, if there's an infectious disease that's where I welcome what they have to say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially if they know what's going on in our neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my legs itch a lot since the doxycycline but I think it's just dry?  I don't know, like a lot more than they used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But my sister says my legs are just, I, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I don't know what's normal.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The itchiness might improve with the Levaquin too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really.  That would be nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because sometimes when you try to treat one, it irritates the other if you have two, if you have co-infections because they kind of throw each off and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the co-infection would be what, the Bartonella -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Potentially Lyme or possibly Ehrlichia or one of the other things that responds to doxycycline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And these would be things instead of the fibro?  So I wouldn't actually have fibromyalgia, I would have these other things or are these other things caused it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Here's the thing, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This, this I'll go, go ahead and say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would, unless I had some kind of irrefutable proof -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would never say you don't have something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You may have fibromyalgia and something else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fibromyalgia alone doesn't seem to account for the worsening of some of the issues that can be seen in psychiatric -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Despite what should be fully adequate treatment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your response to the fibromyalgia treatment hasn't been completely robust either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I took that one medicine and it didn't do anything.  I can't take the other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I should be on salt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You should try Plaquenil, which is very -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I, I tried, there, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hydroxychloroquine was that one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> M or N it started with, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think I wrote down one that he was thinking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There was, there was either, there were two choices, Lyrica and this other one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There was Cymbalta also, Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, that was the first doctor gave me that.  That's depression medicine -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That was given to me for physical pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She said I had the fibromyalgia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that made me really sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never want to touch that stuff again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And it didn't address the depression symptoms either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It made me more anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Neurontin, you tried the Neurontin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Neurontin.  Neurontin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that didn't sit very well with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't, I, I just didn't, I didn't feel any different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I didn't think that it was doing anything.  I mean, I just, still everything still hurt and now, I mean, my hands are getting worse I told the doctor yesterday, like I can't, you know, open cans.  I feel like it's just everything hurts.  I can't cut things because I'm pressing down on it.  So that's starting to get annoying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And this is why I think there could be something else involved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not second guessing someone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fibromyalgia is mysterious, we're not sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but as you know, some people have had everything attributed to that or everything attributed to chronic fatigue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In the meantime, they were getting treated but feeling worse -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And eventually a co-infection was found.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm just asking you all these things because I don't know these.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  No, it's reasonable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm someone -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, yeah, I'm not going to say -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your rheumatologist doesn't know their area, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He knows more about it than I do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have a lot of pain on palpation that is consistent with what's considered fibromyalgia.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But there could be more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There could something on top of it that's doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because with all the medicine you're taking, I'm hearing about what's getting worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm even seeing more skin manifestations too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.  Sold.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think it's worth trying to, trying to attack it and it sounds -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As though it's reasonable for you to feel something within a week to month -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Within -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To know whether you might be on the right track with this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  And maybe I'll see it, see something [INAUDIBLE] .</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And if you have an infectious disease expert on board, all the better.  The more -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Experts the better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm always suspicious though if someone says you can't possible have -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I know that worries me about the, about tests.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially if we don't have a really good test that can prove it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if someone thinks the tests are reliable they haven't done all their reading.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He said that, um, I would, I would only go to this infectious guy once, infectious disease man once.  "You need to do this blood test."  He said it won't be like a thing I'll keep doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know because I was like another doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So this may mean he thinks it is worth pursuing but he just doesn't have faith that his lab is going to find it.  I don't know.  Isn't that weird?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know because I was like, I ha, have to go to another doctor?  That's why I said, "Can't you just let me take the blood test?"  And he's like, "No, I won't do it.  Go to this other guy."  He goes, "This is a onetime thing."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You've got coverage for it.  Clearly, he's going to make the referral.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll have more information.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, especially if you try it and, and you feel a difference</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And really it's of two minds also whether antibiotic treatment helps or hurts in terms of the test.  Because if it ends up being able to attack the organism and release something -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It might be the [INAUDIBLE].  Sometimes people with a negative Lyme blood test -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> After they have taken the doxycycline for a while, it starts to break apart the cyst -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Interesting.  So you can see them all then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And there is relief.  So, you know, where as usually, um, you know, something like a culture in the throat for strep.  You know, if you have been taking a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And if been -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I remember you saying that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and if you've been taking amoxicillin for a few days, at that point, it might not show up because it's killed enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can be the other way with something that insists itself or hides -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, sometimes it gets -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's like putting a stick in the hornet's nest -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And stirring it up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's interesting.  So it might help even to take this and it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Possibly.  So I wouldn't say, you know, you're shooting yourself in the foot -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you start and he's never going to detect it -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's either -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going to show itself or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess I won't be able to get it until tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I can't get tonight though.  I'll have to get it tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  The CVS on [DEIDENTIFIED] I think is open pretty late.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But then I have to go and stand around the CVS.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want me to call it in?  I have the number.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you can just call it in?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can call it now and me give it to the available.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was going to pick up, I have to pick up another prescription tonight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I can call it in that way they can get started with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And if I get the pharmacist on the phone, they'll take it right away.  We don't have wait -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For them to check it on the doctor voice-mail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I would start taking it at night or take it at night?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would recommend first thing in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They usually, I think he usually recommends that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have to remember that.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it could also be probably a couple hours after dinner.  Let me see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Because I'm going to have to eat when I get home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have been staying up pretty late.  So that's why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think you probably, you could probably could.  What I would recommend though actually, let me call it in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Pick up some magnesium also.  Take the magnesium tonight with your dinner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Go into CVS?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Can you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just really funny.  My mom doesn't let me go down there to that area when it's dark.  She says I'll get shot.  [LAUGHING].  I can do it.  I mean, I can do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Any place else I can call it in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  It's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just always have that in the back of head, like it's dark.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like if it's dark or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't go.  But I'm [AGE].  I think I can do it.  Um, can we write down exactly what this magnesium thing is about just so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine.  I can totally do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We could also call the Rite Aid in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to go.  It just, this thing right next to my house so I'll just, just go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or, you sure?  I don't want to set you up for something you're not comfortable with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It's fine.  It's really okay.  I would tell you if it's not okay.  It's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sure?  They also have a drive up window.  Would you want to pick it up at the drive up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I can't.  I would have to get the magnesium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've got some.  I'll give you some -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To get you started.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I don't want to get killed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This way you don't have to go in because I really don't want you to go against what your mom says.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but that was when I was younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Moms just worry about certain things, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's like always in the back of your head, you know.  I wasn't allowed to go the [DEIDENTIFIED] until I was like [AGE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because she said my purse would get stole, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But my mom is like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, moms are cautious, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm never going to say a mom -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to be way worse than my mom ever was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be like "You never leave house, okay?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a riot.  Take 1 daily.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three hours apart from, uh, antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, oh, I take it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes, right -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not with the rest of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you take the magnesium, say you took your antibiotics in the morning.  You take the magnesium at lunch.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just to be on the safe side and should be taken at the same time of day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I take my antibiotics at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, then you can take the magnesium with breakfast.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But when do I take the Levaquin?  You said in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As long as you try to take it, uh, a couple hours after dinner then, after you've had a chance to digest dinner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, so take it with the rest of my medicines, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And there isn't -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There's no reason why you can't.  It doesn't interfere with them.  It doesn't interefere with the doxycycline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then the magnesium in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That would be fine, like a vitamin.  Just think of it's like your One-A-Day vitamin in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need to start taking vitamins.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You should.  You should.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And preferably 1 with calcium and iron.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's, we have Caltrate 1 a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's a good choice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I stopped taking that.  I had the same bottle my freshman year of college when I went in as when I left college because I didn't it all throughout college.</p>

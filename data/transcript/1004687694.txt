<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So let's see, administrative thing number one—there's only two—is in terms of getting money for the extra Blue Cross sessions — remember I had the procedure where I was supposed to submit them. They were going to get denied. You were going to take the denials to U.H.S.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I just got the set of the last nine submissions denied.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I need to take that to U.H.S. today if I remembered to put them in my bag. Which I didn't. So tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they'll submit it — and yeah. She said she'd already put two through in that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:00:46). Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then whatever — I think some. Basically I think some of the ones that got denied, they will pay for and some of them I will pay for. (inaudible at 00:00:56)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay. The only reason I asked is that —</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) (laughs) [00:01:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to be more (inaudible) than it needs to be but that's just such things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I asked partly because I've got a bunch of the denials as well. I was going to give them to you but then one of the pages also has some claims process for somebody else. So (inaudible at 00:01:22).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you can't tell whether — yeah yeah. And I'm getting those denials. They send them to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:26) Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I (inaudible). So yeah. So hopefully that will all — that whole extra eight sessions will get paid for or not paid for within the next two weeks. (inaudible at 00:01:40)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing — I don't think it will affect us much. One way or the other we will figure out some way that it doesn't. But I've had a glitch with Blue Cross where I found out at the beginning of last week that I was kicked off the Blue Cross provider list as of March. [00:02:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I'm so sorry. That —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds about like them. (laughs) And not tell you until last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well they didn't even tell me. I kind of figured it out by the pattern of the way they were responding to claims I had submitted months before. The short version of the story is that — so with Blue Cross you have to recredential if you're a provider like every couple of years. It just means going online and saying, "Yes my practice is in the same place. No nobody has tried to sue me." Stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're supposed to do that every two years. And for reasons internal to them they switched my date up five months. And the last time I did it was in August of 2010. And they switched my date to March.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:02:54)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they didn't tell me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then when I called them — like when I discovered this. I called them and said like, "Hey you know two years — it hasn't been two years yet." They said, "Well we sent you a certified letter in March. And we have your signature on the receipt saying you got it warning you that you needed to do this or be terminated." And I was like, "Oh gosh." [00:03:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do not remember this happening?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. And I said, "Well I guess it's partly my responsibility. What can I do?" Da da da. And then we talked about it. I was like, "You know for peace of mind, why don't you send me the receipt from the certified letter?" And it turned out not to have my signature on it. And not to have been signed for at this address. So I went to the post office and I said, "This wasn't signed for at my address by me was it?" And they said, "No it wasn't." And so I have written back to Blue Cross about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. So I imagine you are wondering at this point, "Do I even want to have Blue Cross as one (inaudible at 00:03:51)." (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I never want to talk to anybody at Blue Cross ever again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I was planning to probably leave Blue Cross into the fall or end of the year. I think it would make the most sense for me to leave in any case by the end of this calendar year. [00:04:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But — probably because everybody's open enrollment period will occur around then. So people can switch plans. Like the one that you had been talking about getting on which is the P.P.O. plan anyway which will have an out of network benefit. There might be differences in terms of co-pay and deductible and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although — hopefully I would imagine (inaudible at 00:04:36) will probably cover some part of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Can I ask you to send me a list of people, of insurance providers, that you do take? Do you have a list?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Blue Cross was the list.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the only plan I was still on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay. So basically I'm not attached to Blue Cross Blue Shield other than that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:05:05)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) that you'd recommend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dr. [inaudible] doesn't take any insurance either so it looks like — I mean I think there is a way that I can do it where I go to out of network providers and then I submit the claims for everything. [00:05:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me be clear. I'm happy — I can submit claims to whomever. Like it's not going to involve you submitting claims whether it's Blue Cross or somebody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The difference is — I'm discovering retroactively the out of network benefits that the people I've seen Blue Cross (inaudible at 00:05:37) have and mostly what it looks like is some of them have the same co-pay and don't even have to pay the deductible. So the only difference is Blue Cross sends them the check and they just sign it over to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And pay the co-pay they've been paying all the way the along. That's version one. Version two is there is a slightly higher co-pay. Ten bucks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there may be a $250 or $500 deductible or something like that depending on the plan.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Most of the plans that I was looking at do have deductibles. [00:06:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Also I guess I should be clear that I'm not looking to make any new money off this event. So in other words as an out of network provider I could then balance bill people if I wanted to but at least till the end of this year which is when I was planning probably to get off anyway. I'm certainly not going to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even after that I'm going to go up in a gradual way. In other words so technically at this point I could say, "Hey I'm out of network. Blue Cross says I should take ninety but I can take whatever I want." But I'm not going to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because it wouldn't be fair. So in other words even if you were on a plan that had a $15 co-pay and it went to $25 for me being out of network, like the (inaudible at 00:07:05) covers that anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it wouldn't make a difference. And I'm also happy to apply some of the difference to the deductible as well. [00:07:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I really don't think it would make a big difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it doesn't sound like it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm still — I've just got.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Saturday night and yesterday I was kind of recovering. So today is the "let's try to get people on the phone day."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had a session of not being able to get people on the phone this morning but I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to be insured in the state. So we'll figure something out. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Sure. And I'm sorry to (inaudible at 00:07:54) —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for letting me know all this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - the day you're getting back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's okay. I mean it's better I'm not locked into any network at all at this point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Insurance companies kind of suck. Oh well. (laughs) [00:08:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I assume because your new job is a part time job it doesn't come with (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it doesn't come with benefits. Yeah. And it's — it seems increasingly unlikely that I'm going to be able find a job that will have benefits for the next year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:08:36)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. Plus even if I did have benefits it would be through the school, which doesn't cover most of your sessions anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually they —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know they're upping it to twenty-four outside sessions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're staff they do cover it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh! Okay. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's only if you're a student that they don't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because why would you want to cover the students?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anyway. That's another story. But yeah university staff insurance you can actually get a plan that will cover (inaudible). [00:09:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Okay. Okay because I knew that they had people on staff at the health center that treated staff and so I assumed it was the same thing. Like the counseling center where they're like, "We can just do everything in halves and then we don't have to cover you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No. I don't think they even see people for therapy in halves who are staff anymore. Out of network benefit. Like the regular therapy (inaudible at 00:09:46).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. I think it'll work out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I told you that James' coverage is — I told you this whole saga right? That James' coverage, which is the reason that I theoretically can't get covered in the state, doesn't meet minimum critical coverage standards. [00:10:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah you did mention that. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just need to get somebody on the phone to tell them these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's very frustrating that a hotline is never open. There is nobody answering the phone during normal business hours. But I just have to keep calling. Yeah. Well thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a really good vacation. So that was good. (inaudible at 00:10:49) I do this — it's both good and bad in that if I leave or do something totally different it's really like I can just leave all of the things that I'm worrying about back home. And not have to worry about. Plus it's just very hard to be depressed when you're hiking. Or while I'm hiking. (inaudible at 00:11:20) It's just really good. So I did a lot of hiking and talked a lot. And ate like five thousand calories a day because we were hiking for four thousand footers. And it was really fun. Yeah it was really good. [00:11:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it was the less uniformly — I think James kind of like two thirds of the way through the week — I was like, "This has been such a great week." And James was like, "Mm." (laughs) As in like it's been really good for him but I still struggle and like cry a couple times and so forth. And so he's like, "Okay so this is what a good week for you looks like now." (laughs) "Good to know." But yeah it was really good. And now it's over. Yeah I'm just like right back where I was before I left. I'm trying really hard to carry some of that peace and strength onward and it dissipates pretty fast. [00:12:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. (pause at [00:12:51] to 00:13:00) So yeah I'm having a hard day today. So far. Yeah. I went to a trivia night yesterday with my church. There is a like a group of 20's and 30's and (inaudible at 00:13:21) go to trivia night once a month which is one of my favorite activities in the world. I used to go at school with the theology department and we always won and had t-shirts. And I'm not actually very good at it but I think I'm way better than I actually am. [00:13:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it — I didn't really want to go but I had really wanted to go their thing. So I was like (inaudible at 00:13:54). We won.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Thank you. There was a rough moment where one of the questions was wrong and I knew it was wrong. Like the question itself was — the answer that they were looking for was not the right answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I got like very heated trying to explain to everybody else at the table why it was not the right answer. Everybody else really disagreed with me but I was like, "But I know this! But do we just want to give the answer that they want?" And so we ended up doing that but we got it wrong anyway. I realized that after about thirty to forty-five seconds, it's like, "Okay. People are getting pissed off at me. I better back down." [00:14:46] (laughs)</p>

<p>Just you know. Not everybody has to know you're right all the time. (laughs) But — I don't know. But those kinds of things just — it was about the Roman calendar. And you know where there is only ten months. And then two months were added. But they knew that two months were added to the Roman calendar and they knew where the names of January and February came from but they thought that January and February were the two months that were added which is not true. July and August were the two months that were added.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they asked for the two months that were added and gave January and February as the answer. I was like, "That's not the answer."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like one on hand, "Who the fuck cares?" And the other hand I'm kind of a professional quibbler. Like that's what I do. (laughs) [00:15:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Right. And this is not so far distant from your area of expertise, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not like smack in the middle of it but it's in the ballpark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's close enough. And I have a small enough area of expertise that I like to hold on to anything I can. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:16:05) those are probably months named after Roman emperors or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. July and August is Julius and Caesar Augustus.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the whole calendar system is an interesting thing. Everybody had solar calendars and they knew that it wasn't exactly right. And so they would just stick extra months in when it got too off. And everybody did this. [00:16:32] (pause till 00:16:43) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>It was good to talk to James a lot. We didn't do as much getting time alone as we really needed to. So if our trip had lasted two days longer we would have had a huge fight. (laughs) We just had a couple of minor fights. They were mostly just — we'd just been talking to each other too long. You know. (inaudible at 00:17:17) said, "Okay. Let's go read books for awhile now." You know. We're both kind of professional quibblers. That's kind of how our conversations go. One (inaudible at 00:17:40), "Well that's not quite right. There's this other aspect to it. Let's look a little more shade of difference here." And you know. Periodically one or the other just gets like, "Why does it matter? Arr, arr, arr." [00:17:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know. But yeah. I haven't really had the chance to just like talk to him about much for a long time. So that's good. (pause at [00:18:18] to 00:18:31) He's trying very hard to be supportive of me. In ways that are completely not intuitive for him. Yeah. He's not somebody who is good at trusting things blindly. So I when I say, "I think when you try to reason me out of the way that I'm feeling that doesn't work. It's not good." He kind of needs to know why it doesn't work. (laughs) [00:19:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's trying really hard to just help me in the ways that I've asked him to. So. Last night I just cried for a long time and he just stayed on the phone and said, "I'm here. I hear you. It's really hard." That didn't make me feel better. But I don't think it makes things worse. (pause at [00:19:57] to 00:20:24) And I'm just really scared right now. [00:20:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I took a leave of absence to take things easier and I feel like things are harder. They're not actually harder, I think, but they're much more uncertain. And so I don't know what I'm going to do. I know I have to (inaudible to 00:21:00) but it's hard for me to see how all of it, individual things that I am doing to deal with impending joblessness and homelessness and lack of insurance, are going to actually get me to a place where I feel secure. I just feel I'm just walking off a cliff. I can't see how it's going to work. [00:21:41] (pause till 00:21:55)</p>

<p>And usually what I do in this situation is just try to keep my head down and not think about the future. Just think about the next twenty-four hours. Just don't go any farther than that. I'm not whether that's actually a good thing or not. (pause at [00:22:12] to 00:22:37)</p>

<p>You know we did a lot of driving around the lake. And so it's like when you're going over a crest of a hill and it looks like the road just stops in front of you. And when you get there you say, "Oh well it's going down again. Or turning." Or whatever. But I feel like — it just looks like—. I don't know what to do. [00:23:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. (pause at [00:23:16] to 00:23:39) I guess that makes me think of your emotional life, which seems to me you experience in a similar sort of way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where you don't know where the next cliff is that you're going to tumble over the edge of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. About half way through last week we had a day where we were just like off. James and I. In just the way — you know you can feel when you're on the same page with somebody and when you're not. And it was really because I was fretting and getting sad and getting upset. And I, first of all, just didn't want that to be the case. [00:24:51]</p>

<p>So I didn't want to tell James about it because if I tell James about it then it would be the case. And I didn't have any kind of specific thing to ground it to. So it's hard for me to — it's sometimes hard for James to hear that I'm feeling some way when it's not coming from anywhere apparently. And so I said, "Look —." He kind of was like, "We're not — I feel like I'm distant from you and I don't know why." And I said, "I'm distant from myself. I'm trying not to be where I am basically."</p>

<p>But where I was trying to go with this was at some point he said, "Well the way you deal with emotions is you feel them and then you move through them." And I said, "Yeah the moving through part is not even funny. I just stop there." Yeah. It's never — . [00:26:08] (pause till 00:26:21)</p>

<p>Yeah so I don't know when I'm going to get — feel like I'm getting hit next. But I also — (pause at [00:26:32] to 00:26:43) I don't know how it is that I go from being in despair to functioning again. I do. But it doesn't feel like it's because I resolve anything. It feels like I just say, "Well guess I should go to sleep now or well I can't deal with this right now. I have to do this other thing." And then (inaudible). [00:27:16] (pause till 00:27:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess my strong suspicion at this point is that there really is a logic that accounts for you're feeling worse and feeling better or feeling some relief. That's not always true. But I think it's quite likely it is for you. And that part of the difficulty is that we don't know well what that logic is and probably moreover that to be sort of (inaudible at 00:29:07) you probably don't want to know. As much as I know you also do some of what it is. [00:29:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. I mean that makes sense. Why would I not? I mean I don't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well so, why would you not want to know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have suspected that some part of this — I don't know yet how much — is that sometimes it's actually when you're angry or disappointed in somebody else that you get upset and sort of really take it out on yourself. Like you sort of reframe it as other — as you're being worthless and awful. And a burden to people and things like that. [00:30:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if there is something to that I think that's an example of something I think you often really don't want to know about is ways that you can be maybe even really angry at or disappointed in other people. I'm not saying you never want to know about that but I think there are times when you feel like — you have reactions like that that are much stronger than you feel are fair or easy to acknowledge. So that part would be some of how this might work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying that's the only thing because I don't think it is that's causing your upset. It's just something we talked about some and —. [00:31:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I mean the same conversation that I was just talking about I ended up getting very angry at James. In part because — I don't know. (pause at [00:31:45] to 00:31:59) You know he kept kind of poking at me and saying, "No you should —." I mean he didn't use these words because they're not really the words that he uses but something like "Feel your feeling" or whatever. And finally I was like, "Okay. Great! Thanks James! Now I feel like crap." (chuckles) [00:32:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Are you happy now? Now I'm going to cry for the next half an hour." (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Thanks a lot." (laughs) But yeah I — I mean that makes sense. I think that it's often not — it's both feeling as though it's not fair of me to be this upset at somebody else but it's also there is nothing I can do if I'm upset at somebody else. Like I feel I don't — there is no recourse. I can't fix anything. (inaudible 00:33:28) I remain stubbornly convinced that if I just work hard enough I can fix myself. (laughs) [00:33:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it doesn't get me anywhere to be pissed off at the insurance companies and the state of healthcare and the law and everything. And it's like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm smiling because I've felt the same thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know what you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's a fact. They're there. They're what I have to deal with. (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well —</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's harder for me to be — to feel helpless than to feel angry at myself. [00:34:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I bet it is. (pause at [00:34:30] to 00:35:00) Maybe one problem though with feeling angry with yourself is that—. (pause at [00:35:15] to 00:35:42)</p>

<p>I mean at that point you're sort of physically taking in some version of what was going just before with you and the other party. Like you were helpless when you were being overlooked one way or another. You were being badly treated. At least that it feels. And then I think you're kind of doing that same thing to yourself when you're angry at yourself. You're overlooking the fact that you may have been right. It wasn't your fault. [00:36:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was somebody else's bad behavior. Again this is (inaudible at 00:36:32) to you. (pause at [00:36:32] to 00:36:41) I mean in other words, I'm not sure it entirely goes away with the helplessness there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get that you (inaudible at 00:36:49) fantasy that you're left helpless but —</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:36:56) doesn't actually fix it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) more so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause at [00:37:04] to 00:37:15) I don't know what to do about that. (pause at [00:37:16] to 00:37:51)Yeah I mean I hear you. [00:37:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just — I don't know. I don't have much to say about it. (pause at [00:38:02] to 00:38:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well another pretty much half baked idea to throw out there which is it may be that you're really invested in sort of remaining in good stead or standing with people close to you. And that, especially people like James or Franco, you know you've learned that there is some latitude there in terms of being able to fight and be out of kilter and so forth. But that you kind of maybe only have faith in that up to a point and it especially involves you're being close to reasonable and not too demanding. [00:39:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think are things you have the sort of impression will really mess things up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes you have to work really hard to protect — stay in the other person's—good graces is too strong. It's not that. It's something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I hate fights. I hate them. I just want them to be over always. [00:40:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet they scare the heck out of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yes. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And probably what I would imagine in a nearly unbearable way that they're just almost intolerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I've gotten to a point where I can say, "Okay. I'm not going betray myself in this fight." I'm not going to say things are okay when I know that they're not. I'm not going to say that I'm not angry when I'm still angry. But I really just want them to be over like fast. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not just that I feel like I need to be reasonable in this way that my friends aren't reasonable for them to accept me. [00:42:08]</p>

<p>I also feel like there is just playing fair and there is not playing fair. It's important to me to — I don't know. I mean (inaudible at 00:42:39) my Dad — not to be somebody who takes something that is just about me or about something else in my life and throws it into a conflict with an innocent bystander. And so yeah it's a problem when I can't — when I have all of these emotions that I can't kind of put in the ring but it's also important to me. [00:43:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I understand. I was thinking about it in a different way but I think that — I mean who knows? Like (inaudible at 00:43:45) with what you're talking about. I was imagining you as a three or four year old like with a mother who I was imagining had very little capacity to stay with where you were emotionally and deal with the anger and unreasonableness that any three or four year old often demonstrates. And learning quickly that you were just going to lose her in a probably bad way if you were like that. And then thinking about it sort of in a later edition as you better be fair unlike your dad who could be unfair in this way. [00:44:46]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I'm really being very speculative there and well beyond (inaudible at 00:44:52).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's so — in some ways though it's like the relationships I had with my parents and the relationships that I have with the people that I'm most close to now are — like Franco, James and Amanda — are really different. I don't know remember being three or four years old very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I basically never fought with my mother until I was an adult. Ever. Ever. But that was in part because by the time I was eight I'd learned that if I didn't take care of her she was going to die. Like yeah. So I just never fought with her. I don't know. I don't remember ever getting angry as a kid or expressing it as being angry. I just got told not to whine a whole lot. A whole lot. [00:46:11] (pause till 00:46:23)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:46:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. [00:46:28] [End of audio]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Client 0735-103, client 0735-103. Session number 13, session number 13. August 2nd, 1970. Session number 13. 1970.

</p><p>PATIENT: Good morning -I meant afternoon. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm fine, how am I? Isn't that the way they tell it?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right.

</p><p>PATIENT: It sure feels good have an optimistic outlook on life. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really?

</p><p>PATIENT: Don't ask me why. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just for some reason. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just for some reason I have a fairly good outlook on life right now. It may have to do with a change in the atmosphere at work. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that really meant a lot to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it did. I haven't made much progress on the project just yet and that is something to sit and think about. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you worried about the project?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't seem like it's going to be that hard of a set up however a while ago when I tried it, it didn't work the first time around. So it looks like I'm going to have to so some more work on it. Of course there are other things that might have entered into it like the fact that I have had a payday since this time last week helps a little too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That helps you feel a bit more cheerful too. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To have some money in your pocket. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Even if it is just for a few days. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but still it makes you feel like for those three days like you can do things. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It just seems kind of funny to not have complete control of the situation like this piece of equipment that I have been trying to get shipped out of the lab for a week to Missouri and I haven't made much progress on it and my boss is getting kind of irritated. I think part of the problem is the fact that he chewed out the guy who is suppose to crate it up the other day and of course the guy isn't going to do anything for me because my boss chewed him out. I don't know whether he realizes that fact or not but that is the way I look at it. 

</p><p>(3:43)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I bet you can't run things the way you know they need to be run because there are outside factors like him entering in. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It sure seems that way, yeah. Oh well, as they say it will all come out in the wash. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, today you're not very inclined to worry about it or you just feel like it will work out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I threatened to take the easy way out and my boss just hasn't heard me yet. If I can get a rental truck and shove this piece of equipment in the rental truck without even crating it, you know, and take it down there but he hasn't quite gone along with that idea yet and I don't really care if he does either. It's not really they way I want to do it but I will if I have to. That has been one problem that I have always been willing to do just about anything he's suggested to accomplish stuff at work and yet when I try to suggest a little better rating he doesn't seem to do anything. I mean I read these articles about how carpenters got a 25 percent raise, how truck drivers got a big raise, you know, and all this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But not you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, you wonder why in the world you're doing what you're doing because you can drive a truck for this damn company and you can go out and drive a truck for someone else and make twice what you're making. Even shoving milk bottles around seems to be a pretty lucrative place to be. It makes you wonder if the 6, 7, 8 years it took for you to get your degree was it worth it all. 

</p><p>They have been talking about a union, or so to speak, all the researchers and scientists want (inaudible 5:54) get together to form a union. And it looks like every year it's getting to be more of a necessity. It's going to have to be done one of these days in order to get decent raises for ourselves. I think that is one reason why this rumor goes around about them trying to split up all this work and send it to different places so that these guys can't organize. Maybe the bosses are starting rumors like this to kind of keep things shook up. In analyzing these tapes do I seem to be making any progress?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't analyze the tapes if you maybe wanted to know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really. The biggest progress I've made is my opinion of myself. It seems to me that I am making progress there and that is beneficial enough. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your opinion of yourself really has risen. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think it was fairly low there to begin with and the way I see it it's seems to have come up a little in the last few weeks. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's significant. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, for me yeah, and maybe for anybody else no but to me yeah. Sounds like you're going to have to get this one repaired or something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It squeaks all the time. I think that little talk the boss and I had the other day did a lot of good too. He seems to have adopted a different attitude towards me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He's really treating you different?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, he cut me down to a point where I was not doing anything much and then I felt like I was getting berated because I wasn't accomplishing anything but really I didn't' have much of anything to do. 

</p><p>I think this idea of looking for another job has kind of dropped down in priority too because of the fact that maybe I have a little more self-esteem where I am working now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It makes it not as drastically important to get another job. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's not as important to find another job if you are doing good at the one you're doing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that is a good way to make progress there rather than feeling like it is a complete dead end there. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I keep saying well maybe he is secretly trying to get me a raise now so that I can - because I told him that either by the first of the year when the raises come out again I either wouldn't have this problem or I wouldn't be there and maybe he felt or maybe - well, he felt it was important enough to give me a small raise now and then another one at the first of the year. But that's just my own thinking and he may not be doing anything at all. 

</p><p>(10:08)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That is certainly what you would like. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, wouldn't it. I keep thinking about my accomplishments on a general scale. It used to be like I would say, "Well last year I didn't accomplish much, this year I ought to try and accomplish..." and I would paint a big picture of what I ought to try and accomplish. Here lately I think that I've been taking more of a day-at-a-time attitude where I say; "Well today I think I will try and accomplish this one thing and let the rest of the things kind of go as they will." Maybe that's why I feel like I've made some progress because I don't set such vast goals to try and accomplish in a days time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Makes more sense to try and think about it a day at a time too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe even a week but getting any further than that is like trying to bridge a gap that's too wide with a small bridge. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like trying to make your bridge one step at a time instead of doing the whole bridge all at once. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Seems like the bridges come in taxis and they only come in certain sizes so you try and find a chasm that's wide enough for your bridge and you wind up at the first chasm that you come to and your bridge isn't long enough. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's cute. The point is like your bridge is the standard not the chasm is the standard. 

</p><p>(14:12)

</p><p>PATIENT: You and I both should give up smoking should we?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know why I smoke. I smoke strictly because my wife smokes I think. And if she were to give up smoking and encourage me a little then I think that I could give it up too. I'm trying to figure out which one of these microphones are live; is it that one over there? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you self conscious of the microphone and the recorder today? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not anymore than any other time. It is just something to think about and maybe talk about. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It feels kind of inhibiting?

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No.

</p><p>PATIENT: Actually I think I have a more optimistic outlook maybe I'll feel that I don't have so many problems to talk about now then I use to so if I look around and see something else to talk about. Problems arise everyday and some of them just kind of go away and some of them have to be worked on. The other day I got my riding mower in the car and I went over to church and mowed the yard. All during the time that I was mowing I didn't pay much attention to the fact that the seat was kind of hard and consequently it rubbed a blister onto my behind or something I can really see what was but anyway there is something sore back there. So that is one of the problems that you just sort of ignore and it goes away I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel like you've got kind of a grasp on how to deal with your problems. 

</p><p>(16:47)

</p><p>PATIENT: I think so. Whereas I didn't seem to have any grasp or any - anyway the problems just couldn't deal with the (inaudible 17:00) and now I've got this feeling better and this problem may be solved this way or so on and so forth. So at least I am attempting to solve them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's good to be trying, to be working on them. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's one reason why I started this because I felt that I had a problem somewhere here and maybe I needed psychological analysis or something. It not only helped me pinpoint the problem but it helped me solve some it. Maybe I'm taking an overly optimistic attitude about the fact that this problem is being solved or something but nonetheless seems to me that's the way to not only approach it but that's one way of making it go way or whatever. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which is one way of making go away?

</p><p>PATIENT: Let's go back, let's see. Before I started I felt I had some kind of a problem which might be psychological. So first of all I admitted that there might be a problem and I made an attempt to try to get some therapy and now I keep saying well things are getting better, things are getting better which maybe just from my own standpoint that I think it is. All it needs to is for me to believe that it isn't there or that it is going away or something like that and eventually that will solve it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe being optimistic itself will really help with the problem. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You have to be optimistic, you have to have some kind of - you don't have to really adopt this attitude that every day in every way things are getting better and better because that's not really a valid assumption but you've got to have enough optimism to say well each day maybe there is a little bit of progress made along with accomplishing a goal or solving a problem or something. Seems to me like pessimism just breeds pessimism. You get to a point where if you're pessimistic enough your problems will just swallow you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or if you are optimistic you're outside of it enough where you can take a couple whacks at them each day. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And if you don't hack it at least you can say at least it didn't get any bigger today. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's really different from being swallowed up. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Letting it sit inside and just engulf you. Did I mention that my wife is in marital counseling or group counseling or whatever it is where both of us are participating? She didn't seem to respond to it too much so I didn't push it. I think part of her thinking is some of the things that she has read and seen. Like for instance this movie Bob and Ted or whatever it is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Did you go see that? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I saw that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think she thinks that group therapy is what they had there where they all sit around and holler at each other. Even this idea of the way that she and I get along I think we have made some change and I hope that maybe, from my standpoint anyway, maybe it's progress. But now - well, let's see maybe 6 or 8 months ago when we first started this trying to go out and do things more. Up until then I think I was kind of inclined to turn down anything that she suggested because I'm the kind that can get just as much enjoyment out of sitting home propped up in front of the TV set at night and she wants to go out and do things. With the advent of summer and with, like I said, my attitude on things changing, like for instance last night we went to this fair down here at (inaudible 22:26) park and we had a good time, but I was looking at it from a pessimistic attitude. I didn't really want to go I just wanted to go home and plop down in front of the TV and relax and watch TV but she wanted to go to it so we went down there and like I said we had a fairly good time. It was a good show and it was a chance to get out and take the kids someplace. Like I said I worry about not having the right atmosphere with my kids. So I took them to that and dragged them around and got them real tired and took them home and they went straight to bed, out like a light, you know. 

</p><p>(23:00)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You had fun?

</p><p>PATIENT: And so did I. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They had fun.

</p><p>PATIENT: We didn't really do very much we just went to the show and came home but none the less they can't say - to me it seems like they can't say, "Well, you don't take me anyplace." Like Saturday night we took them to the drive in movie. Of course they didn't care much for the movie but the idea of just getting out and doing something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's another part of what you are glad about. You did take them someplace and you did something with them and that makes you feel like you are doing your bit as a father. And I guess you think the change in you is nothing more than you being ready to take your wife up on it when she makes a suggestion. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. At first I did it just from the standpoint that I wanted to and if I didn't want to then we didn't do it but now I can accept the fact that maybe I don't want to but she does so I'll go ahead and do it anyway just to kind of please her and I think this, is more of a better attitude to have. Chances are we would never get together if it was just one of us wanted to and the other one not wanting to, that would be the situation all the time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, one of us wants to and the other one says okay we'll do it just because one person wants to and at least it creates a better feeling because you accepted what they wanted to do even if you didn't want to do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not a stand off, it's like you're compromising and that means that things are working. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Even if she did get fired from her job on Friday. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh really?

(25:13)

</p><p>PATIENT: She's got a particular atmosphere about her when she works. She has worked as a hostess for years and years and she can go into a place and get hired as a hostess and she'll adopt a few of their ways of doing things, maybe not all of them. So the other day they had a situation where two of these (inaudible 25:39) stores out there and the managers switched places for some sort of variety I guess, and the manager from the other place said we have to go by the book or we're not going to do it right. He was just that type. So she and this manager had it out 2 or 3 times that day. Of course the guy who ran the place normally came back the next day and he's the kind who is like well you can do it the easiest way possible or whatever suits everybody. Of course when he - he and the guy that he switched with got together, of course, before he came back the next day and this guy told him that my wife was very hard to work with and all this and he just wasn't going to work with her anymore or something. So, the next day when the regular manager came back he didn't say anything about it until quitting time and he told her that he didn't need her anymore. It was just that simple. But she is able to accept that, she is the kind that, it's just like water off a duck's back. It didn't bother her at all; it would run me up the wall if a guy just flat out fired me all of a sudden. But she just turns around and the next day she was out looking for another job. It didn't bother her. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's that simple. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said that's the reason why she does the bills because she can let it fall off her back and not worry about it and to me it would drive me up the wall if things just didn't go according to (inaudible 27:10). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, when things don't go according to (inaudible 27:15 sounds like Hoyle?) then you get worried and upset and think they ought to be going differently and -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and why aren't they, and maybe it's my fault that they aren't going that way and all this stuff. So, even though things aren't going real good I'm still optimistic so that's progress. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that is really something if you are optimistic when bad things are happening. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, she turned around and went out Saturday and got a job at a Nursing home. I asked, "So how much money are you going to be making here?" She said, "I'll be making more than I made at the other place." She always says that of course and by now I ought to know that, that is her idea and it might not work out that way. Just like going to the fair Saturday night. I had these tickets that were suppose to be for church members. They sent out free tickets so I got them to send me some free tickets and they were supposed to be as I understood it just for Friday. All the church members and what have you would come and have a big grand opening to this fair, you know. So I thought that was the only thing they are for but she got this idea that she wanted to go to this fair and she said, "Why don't we try and use these tickets?" I said, "No, they're no good." She called out there and some guy in the office told her they were good. Well, I couldn't quite believe this but I would go out there just to see. Se we went out there and sure enough they let us in on these free tickets. I think I was kind of hoping that we would have to pay to get in so that I could say, "Ah-Ha, I told you so." But it didn't work out that way which is - I didn't have a chance to fail it seemed like this way because if we get in free I'll be happy and we didn't get in free I'd have her to blame it on. So I couldn't lose in this situation it seemed like. 

</p><p>(29:08)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But if you had been the one to think that the tickets were free then it would have been like a failure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wouldn't have gone out there and tried to use the things because I would have been afraid that the guy would say, "Sorry, those were only good for the Friday show." Which was the way I read the instruction sheet that came with them; they weren't suppose to be any good after about 2 o'clock Friday. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like failure is really painful for you. Painful enough that -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I try to avoid it. This goes back a long way. I have a tendency to not finish a project. I, you know, I'll do as much as I feel is necessary and then quit which normally isn't till the end of the project. If things get going bad I like to escape and get out of the thing. Like I was working in the commissary - no, you know the place where they go to have sick call in the service. So they assigned me to this thing and I was in - well I was working a lot of different jobs and the one that really got me was working in the infirmary. They would send a prescription in there and I was supposed to read the thing and get the certain pills, you know. So one day this guy brought this prescription in and I couldn't make it out so I went back and asked the doctor which one of these pills I was suppose to give them or what bottle or what have you. So he said, "They are the little purple ones over in the corner." So he meant this corner and I thought he meant that corner so I grabbed the wrong bottle and gave it to the guy. So I said something later like you did mean these didn't you? And he said, "No, I meant those over there." So this to me was a failure. So I was in a position where I could just sort of back out of the situation by telling them that I got my orders to be shipped out and they wouldn't check on me, they wouldn't' really care they would just say, "Send over someone else to work over here." So, I just kind of, a couple of days later I told them I got my orders and I got the heck out of there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to be around where you had failed and were likely-

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I didn't want the guy to come back on a stretcher due to the fact that he got the wrong medicine. I think this was the whole crux of the thing. Anyway, that is something that I have done several times before and after that. If things start going bad I like to be where I can back out of the situation and go someplace else and try again. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, not to have to live through the whole unwinding of something that is probably going to be a mess. 

</p><p>(32:24)

</p><p>PATIENT: Even now I have a tendency when given a little ol' job to do if I don't like it, then if there is anyway at all that I can either put it off or get out of it then I will. Like at the back of my desk now there is a project that I was suppose to do sometime ago to test something and I just didn't feel like it so I stuck it back there. I felt like well, I'll just push it back there since it's a low priority job. But maybe one of these days the boss is going to ask me about it and it's not going to be done and I'll say, "Oh, I'll get that right out." If he gets to the point where he is ready to write up some sort of report on it or something like that then I'll have to do it but until then I'm not going to. I'll worry about it maybe but I'm not going to try and make any sort of effort towards it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that is because you don't feel like it not because you might fail at it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's not failing it's just to find out what this stuff will do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think that one reason why I stuck it back there is because this guy I work with kind of thought it was a ridiculous situation to begin with and he didn't seem to think it was necessary so of course I adopted the same attitude because I didn't really like it to begin with. . 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That capped it off when he -

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that cemented it over when he said it didn't sound feasible at all. I think maybe one of the biggest things I ever learned was how to not only live with my problems but how to solve them rather than trying to back out of them or go someplace else where they may not be the same problem. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's really important to change what you've made. 

</p><p>PATIENT: To a certain degree. I think I need to accomplish a lot more on the subject. Some of the things that I think that I don't do is because of the fact that I say, "Well, this, is something an ordinary researcher can do and really they should have a researcher do it." For me to hand this to them and say here is what needs to be done now do it then I get to feel more important about the situation. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you don't like to be doing menial work. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I should be doing things more important than this and I should have a researcher where I could say here's something; if it's something that he is capable of doing then turn it over to him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But when you get handed a job like that it brings home the (inaudible 35:31) again that you aren't being thought of they way you think you should be thought of. 

</p><p>PATIENT: This guy in human relations, I had to talk to him the other day about this bill and in my opinion he has adopted, or has become my number one enemy at the company and of course he doesn't realize this. And I can't say that I really envy the guy because this, is probably what he has to do several times a week but every time I see him now I kind of say, "Oh there you are again." He's got nothing better to do then ride me about my bills. And in my own mind, I don't really say this to him but I just try to avoid him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't quite make you feel friendly to put it mildly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I just don't have any love for the guy at all. Up until that time I hadn't paid any attention to him but now that he has adopted to my opinion that he is my number one enemy in that company. Because every time I see him I think this same thought that he only wants me to pay my bills; and that is a very touchy subject in opinion. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That hurts when someone brings up your bills. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, someone who really shouldn't have anything to do with it at all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He shouldn't have anything to do with what?

</p><p>PATIENT: Whether I pay my bills or not. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, who shouldn't have to do it, the company? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really. I think that should be between me and the bill collector or me and my wife and the bill collector since she is the one who makes out the checks. As far as anyone in that company is concerned it shouldn't be their business at all, unless they want to send the bill paying job and I'll turn my pay check over to them and they can file it to the best of their ability.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if they don't appreciate what an impossible task it is to pay this many bill on this little salary. 

</p><p>(40:10)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the way I look at it. They're probably like everybody else. He should know how much I make; they keep a file up there of what everybody is making and everything. In fact they probably even keep a file on what your raises were and everything. To me if he was going to be earning his pay then she should have been the guy who said to the bill collector, "Hey look, this poor boy is not making much money and you shouldn't expect so much payment on this bill." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If anything he should help you out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah he should tell the other side of the story. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Like I said that's my own selfish way of looking at it. I've got one debt that I don't ever intend to pay. I had to borrow money on this government loan thing to go to school. Then after I got out of school and everything, actually the thing is due now, it's due the day you graduate, they came up with this GI Bill thing so after they came up with that I started calling the Veterans Administration and asked them if this Veterans benefits was going to pay off this National Defense loan that I had and they said, "Oh no." It had to be for schooling that you are doing now or may do in the future. So I had to borrow from the Government to go to school and now the government wants to give me money to go to school so I figure that one of the two will cancel each other out. As far as I'm concerned that's the end of it. One of these days there is going to be someone hollering, "Where is this money you borrowed to go to school?" I'll say, "Well, it's in that Veteran's thing that you didn't give me until after I got out of school." I fully intend to get a lawyer on the thing and have them straighten the thing out. Until they start hollering I'm not going to worry about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But it is in the back of my mind that it is going to happen one of these days. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If you're definitely not going to pay it then one of these days it's going to come up and you'll have to cope with it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, when it does I will. I'll just get me a lawyer and say here is the situation and here is the way I look at it and I fully expect that one of them will cancel out the other and eventually, because I don't intend to do anymore schooling. That is what the GI Benefits are for. I would kind of like to but I'm just not ambitious enough to get out there and fight it anymore. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't have the energy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's kind of late in the day you might say to try to go to graduate school because I'd have to erase some of the poor grades I made in under graduate and it just seems like a formidable task so I just don't have the ambition. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it seems like a big task. Like you can't just start on it from zero you have to start twenty yards behind. 

</p><p>PATIENT: The thing of it is, it's kind of funny I went through school on this, oh well, I'll do what I have to, to get by theory, and then when I got through almost all of the way I decided well I think I'll take a whack at a masters degree and see what I can do. So I take the graduate record examination and make a decent grade on it and then I go to graduate school for a year and of course I had to go back and erase some of the bad grades from my under graduate work so that was what I was doing all of that year of graduate in stead of doing graduate studies, I was actually doing under graduate studies all over again. This went down the drain or up in flames whatever you want to call it because I - I don't know, I just didn't feel it was anymore important than undergraduate was and I didn't work at it and of course I made bad grades this time around and I didn't accomplish anything making bad grades in graduate school so I quit and went to work. The biggest problem about me is that I know too much about myself. I know that I am smart enough to make good grades but to lazy to try; and thereby hangs the tale. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean by "too lazy"?

</p><p>(45:45)

</p><p>PATIENT: I just don't like to sit down and read a book and study and prepare myself for classes like I should. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sitting down with a book (inaudible 46:24) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it must be something that is just already interesting. There are about two things that I really like to read about and that is a good mystery and a good sex story and I can't, or I don't need to take courses in either one of those so there goes that interest. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it sounds well and good to say you want good grades but that is kind of abstract when it comes down to studying you don't like to. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and I have to put all this statistics into a good mystery story or a good sex story or something (inaudible 47:02) then I would be engulfed in studying. It surprises me that I've gotten as far as I have with my lack of ambition. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, when you call it lack of ambition it sounds like you feel like it's a bad thing about yourself. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm lazy let's face it. I can't figure out how I ever got any further than 10th or 11th grade really. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess lazy means that you don't make yourself do things that you don't want to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I just coasted through high school and then when I got into college I didn't put very much more effort into that. It surprised me that I ever graduated. Actually I'm kind of thankful at times that I've gotten as far as I have in school because I'm just so damn lazy. It's pathetic at times. Actually I can be perfectly happy at night just sitting down and watching TV. Once in a while I'll gather up enough ambition to go play some golf or go to a movie or something like that and then for three or four days I regret it because I'm so tired. All I want to do is sleep and I just sleep for the next 2 or 3 days to catch up on my rest. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't have enough energy to stand for games of golf? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, not really that's why I like to have a female partner that way that kind of boosts my energy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well that will do it for today. How about Wednesday at 2:30?

</p><p>PATIENT: Okay. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I keep thinking that you're going to forget this but you never do.

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then you're like, "Oh, I can put this away now!"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, I had a phone interview with the head of the department yesterday, and (pause) it's one of those cases where I'm trying not to feel too confident, but I think it went really well. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He said things like, "We have two or three other candidates who are pretty qualified and I want to talk to them, but I really wanted to make sure that we got back to you, and didn't keep you waiting." (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great! (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I talk, and he said, "Well, you know, back to what you said, I think you'd really fit in to the life because that's what I believe." Yeah. I think I did well, actually. Although I practice interview horribly, which is really strange. But (pause) I'm feeling okay about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still kind of bracketing between, "I really, really want to do this," and, "I can't do this. I'm going to fail, I'm going to explode in really bad ways." But less of the latter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now I'm (chuckling)... Now I'm finding myself trying to will myself into getting better, just like, "Oh, well, all I need to do is just not (pause) collapse," and so I'm... yeah, I'm finding myself reluctant to acknowledge when I'm not doing well. [00:02:00] (pause)</p>

<p>I'm Tom Turkey!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Excuse me a minute. (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so thank goodness for that. (pause) And I feel good about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel good about being on the door, being a door person, which I usually would not have, refused to apply to schools where they'd have me on the door. Because I was just like, "I'm 22 years old, I'm not doing that." (chuckling) And now... (pause) I don't have—I feel like that's something that I would really like, actually. (pause) Yeah, pretty much. (pause) [00:03:31]</p>

<p>My friends have kind of rallied around me when I've complained. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I never understand it. I never understand why they care about me so much. (pause) It's both this huge relief, and this. I feel so good but also, it's really disconcerting in some ways. (pause) Ashley, out of the blue, sent me a cookbook that I think we both kind of had been ogling for a couple of years. That's not the right word to use (chuckling). I don't know why. But I'm trying to kind of shut up and care... (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Shut up and enjoy it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Of course it seems that I have to actually rely on my end. I can do this. But I'm not too nervous. I know how to do this. I know I have a plan. Not that I've spent time coming up with a plan, but a plan immediately comes to mind. Like, "This is how you learn a language. This is how you catch up with a language." (pause) The nice thing is they said, "Okay, we'll call you in a few days. Don't worry until then." There's nothing I can do now. Like I don't have to worry about it until they call me back with whatever decision they've made, or if they want me to come up for an interview or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But for now, I'm done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, you just set a great example for what to think. Nothing you can worry about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I can sit and do it. (pause) Yeah, it feels like this could be kind of something to hold on to, which would be like... (pause) [00:06:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And they'll let you know in a few days whether there's going to be another step or whether they've made a decision?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not really sure, probably one or the other. I can't imagine—I would not hire anybody without meeting them face to face. So I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, like not hDanng things to say? I might not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) The chair of the department is in Nova Scotia for the week. So he was calling me and doing a phone interview from Nova Scotia. His three-year-old son interrupted him, like, "Dad, could you get off the computer at some point?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which really helped me, because I was like, "Oh, this poor guy." (chuckling) I tried. I don't know how it is, but... nothing I can do now. (pause)</p>

<p>(inaudible) I keep coming back up, I keep... (pause) the last few days have been better, but, you know, better than us getting along... (pause) it really was terrible before. James is hDanng a hard time, and I'm not really sure what to do. Our good friends (pause) Franco and Kerry, I probably talked about them, they just moved, because of Kerry's job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. She's a researcher?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Scientist. She dissects rat brains. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She works on memory disorders. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's Franco's wife? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, Franco's fiancée. Sorry. So they're gone, and I think he's really sad about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have been a true champion of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then basically they're the only people in town he'd talk to (chuckling). And then the other people that he would sort of talk to are gone. So I think he's kind of grieving that and trying to keep working at the same time, and trying to support me... I don't know, it's kind of dawning on him that he's alone. You know? Calling to check up on them? Not calling too often? (chuckling) (pause) [00:09:38]</p>

<p>I feel like I am (pause) have been so inwardly focused for a long time now. I don't know if I'm getting to the point where I'm well enough to look outside, or whether I'm getting to the point where I have to look outside, or what? But it's hard to be okay with hDanng been so inwardly focused. It's hard not to beat myself up about that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think you give yourself a hard time about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just for hDanng a lot to do and still being very needy and not really able to (pause) think about handling my problems. You know, handling that. (pause)</p>

<p>Oh, Dan is also back in town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This town?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, back in the country. (chuckling) Yeah, so we'll probably talk later this week. It was so funny, a year ago I would not have believed this would be something I would forget about for large stretches of the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You and he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I have no idea what my position's going to be. I suspect he's changed a lot in the last year. And I certainly have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When's the last time you talked to him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: The last time I e-mailed him was at the beginning of the summer. I just wanted to talk to him, really, like, last May. Like over a year ago. (pause) We'll see. (pause) [00:12:14]</p>

<p>Yeah, it... (pause) I just feel like that was such a long time ago. It really wasn't, but... (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel distant from him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's from him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) But we approached things differently, so I don't know. (pause) I'm just anxious that... I'm nervous that he will (pause) expect time not to have passed. That would be really awkward. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could see that he'd kind of expect you to be at a similar place to where you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe it's that way with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe it's that way with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Yeah, I don't... I think, "Well, am I still really in love with him?" And then I think, "Those are not really useful categories." (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whatever it is. But they're very useful categories for him. Those are like... that's how he thinks, or how he did think, last time I talked. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't? (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. I mean, I (pause) I think being in love with somebody means so many different things. It basically means something different with everybody, with every relationship. It's like saying something is blue. It's useful to say something is blue, but it's not that precise. And I don't know how I feel about Dan. It's like he hasn't really been in my consciousness for a long time. (pause) </p>

<p>I don't want the same things to happen that happened two years ago. I don't want it. (pause) I don't know how. I kind of—when I start thinking about it, I try to make plans but I don't have any data to make plans with, I just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What it's like to talk to him, you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and go from there. And I have a hard time with that. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd say so. (chuckling) Makes you so nervous!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I'm less nervous than I was expecting to be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you think? Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess since it's not really any more then it's not good. (chuckling) I don't know, in a way this is kind of exciting, and (pause) so really, it's actually really good that I'm not nervous. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying that you miss how you felt at that time? How things were between you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think you're always going to miss that, I think (pause) that kind of (pause) I miss that about the first year that James and I were together. I miss that about the first year that I was with him. I mean, that falling in love process is so fucking intense, and it can torment us. But it's also crazy! (chuckling) So yeah, I miss it. But I don't want it back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just saying, you know, there's a really well known psychiatrist from 30 or 40 years ago who thinks that falling in love is the only socially acceptable psychosis. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I would agree with that. [00:18:56]</p>

<p>I mean, I miss the first year of being with James, but I would never trade it for what we have now. (pause) It's just so much better now. (pause) I don't know, it's just how it works. It kind of sucks. (chuckling) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't have both, or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The fact that that doesn't ever really last, you know, and I think there are people who in some sense choose or end up falling in love with one person after the other. I would think enough of this thing that we have for ten years or twenty years, or thirty years, I don't know... (chuckling) but I don't know. (pause) </p>

<p>Yeah, I am nervous—and not in a good way—about talking with James about talking with Dan. I haven't told him yet, which is (pause) Dan e-mailed me on Monday, and just the last two night he's just been so sad. It's just clearly been not the time to say it. (pause) So I haven't really had time to tell him. And with James, there really is a right time and a wrong time to tell things. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How might he react?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he'll probably say, "Oh, okay." Yeah. (pause) I think there's a level of still being hurt by me, and still not trusting me. But it's pretty far down. It's pretty small. (pause) (chuckling) I am the person who makes these conversations difficult, not James. Because I still act with subtlety, and I have such a hard time talking about it. And he really doesn't. (pause) I just have this impulse towards secrecy with regard to Dan that's really not what I want to be, how I want to be talking with James. Besides that, it's just (pause) recognize when I want to be keeping things that I felt that I want to be something else. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how do you understand having fallen in love with Dan? </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't feel guilty for having fallen in love with him. (pause) I blame myself for letting things go as far as they did. Which, in an absolute sense is not very far. But the emotional trail is really wide. (pause) I knew that it was going to end badly, but it was just so good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) Dan and I were on the same page in life, the way he looked in my heart. He knew, was completely fucking crazy about me. (chuckling) I was completely fucking crazy about him. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made you crazy about him? </p>

<p>CLIENT: He just got—he has more love than anybody else. He just (pause) he just loves. I mean, not embarrassed about it, and not (pause) he just, he sticks his neck out for his students every single time, all the time. And he lets them into his lives in ways that... well, (chuckling) as in my case, are pretty screwed. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think I'm the exception there. I think I am the only person that this has happened to with him. He's—intellectually, he gets the connections between the minutiae and the big things the same way that I do, and loves the minutiae because they matter. (pause) [00:26:46]</p>

<p>You know, he takes joy in relationships and in his work. (pause) And he's—(pause) He's romantic in a way that I could be but I'm not most of the time. I might have said this before, but (pause) he's like Keats, I'm like John Donne. (chuckling) Except I'm not like John Donne at all. But, (pause) and James is very romantic too, but in a very different way. And it's not like he's romantic in the sense of courtship, but just in the way you think about your life, the way you think about relationships. (pause) And he tries really, really hard to be that way, but he's honest and honorable and all those things. He's not as honest as I am. </p>

<p>I'm reading, off and on, because it's depressing, We Need to Talk About Kevin, the novel by Lionel Shriver, that I hadn't heard of until my sister gave me the book. Anyway, it's about a woman whose son has committed a mass murder. He shot all the kids in the school. She's writing letters to her husband to kind of figure this out. It's a really good book. But one of the things that she says is that her husband always rounds up. When things aren't exactly the picture of what she dreams that they would be, he rounds up and makes it... she's basically says, you don't want to call it lying, but it is. I'm obvious that way. That is a real problem. That was a disappointment for me to find out. (pause) </p>

<p>He's so much fun to talk to. Yeah. I don't know what to say. And he gets the depression. I think he understood what's been happening in the last two years. But he's come from some real personal tragedy, and (pause) that means we understand each other so much. (pause) [00:31:10]</p>

<p>Although, I mean, one of (pause) Damn, it... it hurt me last year, when I just kind of tried to tell him what was going on, and he was thinking about it within the lines of what he experienced, and I had told him that I had experienced before. Which means that he was really not understanding. Not that he wasn't taking it seriously, but that—I told him, I'm taking a leave of absence, and I'll be going away, I'm not going to be there because my doctors are here. And he wrote back and said, "No, I can't see how that's a good thing. Can't you just fly out to them?" It's like... No. No, I can't. (chuckling) (pause) It felt kind of dumb. I'm sure that I know a lot of him doesn't want me to be with James, but a lot of him really does. He wants to make me happy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) I think what strikes me is the way that you (pause) talk about him and what you tell about him is (pause) emotionally, when you're in, you're all in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It can be problematic. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it sounds very absorbing and intense. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) Yes. And I wouldn't want to be different, I think it's good. But I don't think most people work like that. (pause) Yeah, I mean, I (pause) I have to be careful not to be too enthusiastic about it, and it kind of creeps me out. (chuckles) I don't know that it does, but I worry that it does. I feel like they pull back, like, "Okay, that's too much. Pull back." But yeah, I just care. (pause) [00:35:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. I don't think it's just that. (pause) Something about the degree to which you put yourself in things, or the way that you kind of invest in people. (pause) Yeah, he was pretty important, though. I'm not sure what to say about it yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um... (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just (pause) what I like about teaching is that (pause) they're all so great! Even the shitty ones, they're all so great! And you get to see that as a teacher, where you don't in a different kind of relationship. You don't want them to hate you! (chuckling) (pause)</p>

<p>There's not (pause) like a generalized thing. Like each specific person, it's just (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I have the impression that you've often had (pause) something in your life like this, like teaching, or Dan, or (pause) James at the beginning (pause). Not that James hasn't remained the most important relationship in your life, but this sort of falling in love with kind of absorbed... thing. Well, you've sort of said that. But I guess I understand it a little more clearly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I would be able to too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I got such a high from that, I think in part, because I just get so absorbed in some thing that I get really connected to something else. Like, whoa, look at this! (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. This is pretty pleasant. This is time for now.</p>

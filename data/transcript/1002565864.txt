<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I haven't seen you in a while.  You're doing okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well I got something to talk to you about but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well last I saw you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing drastic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was, you know, you were and thank you for the follow up, ah, phone call about the resolution.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, no it was like the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I saw you, ah, [DATE].  Your mood was okay.  You were recently stable.  You were not sad or anxious or irritable.  Your appetite and sleep were fine.  Your energy was good.  You were exercising, some revving up in fall.  Again, I had not seen you since August before.  So and August was all the drama over the breakup.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there was some revving up in the fall, higher lithium for 2 days helped, October and December.  So anyway, by the time I saw you in January, things had stabilized.  You were doing quite nicely on the lithium, Depakote, Wellbutrin cocktail.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And has needed Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've been on all those since?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, yes.  Ah, there's been some ups and downs but I, I'm going to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean ups and downs, life ups and downs or your brain ups and downs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well there has been some brains ups and downs, minor ones, but, ah, ah, whatever you want to talk about today, but the topic for me is, ah, you know, how realistic is it that doing anything to do with medication can, ah, help avoid a little ups and downs when I explain to what, um, my life was like, no, no drama by the way, ah, and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, ah, ah, this is the discussion for after we collect the data and figure out what's going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But given your history, there are 2 ways for you to live your life.  One is to be dragged along by your moods—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On these cycles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the other is to have a little more control of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it doesn't, you, your personality and your nature gets your life into stuff and that, that's because you're alive and vibrant and engaged—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And whatever.  You have probably a more dramatic life than other people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Many of my friends and family would say that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and that may or may not be related to your mood disorder.  It may not.  Who knows?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your life is that way and so you can start any way, anywhere you want in the circle.  So let's say without mood problems—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Life, life is moving this way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And all of our lives when something makes us sad we get sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something [INAUDIBLE] fall in love you get more dramatic, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we all react to our lives.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People with mood disorders react to their lives in disregulated ways and so something that, like a death in the family, something that makes all of us sad, makes them more sad and gets and the switch gets stuck in the sadness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it stays sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And something that revs us all up, people with mood disorders, they rev up higher.  They do stupid things, give away all their money or whatever and they stay there longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's a dysregulation in the mood system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not being with or without moods.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, it's regulating the mood or modulating them.  So let's leave that for the end, though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For now, in these 6 months—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your mood been like in general?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay up until really June, [INAUDIBLE] but June great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mood's been fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very, very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes very stable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're taking your medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes and I think there was 1 day in that period since I saw you up until at the, at the most recent late May where you and I both agreed I was having, you know, a slightly revved up after eating and that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I just, I try taking double the Depakote instead of the lithium this time and, ah, and also took a sleeping pill that night and the next day I had more trouble getting up and getting going as usual but I, I was back to normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like a 1 day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Deal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It works with, ah, I don't like people doing that as much with lithium because lithium has a toxic, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes that's right and I went through that one time when I took—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you ever been lithium toxic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  This was before you.  I, I asked them because I was at a hotel and I was, um, I forgot I, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Few, few people live, live to tell this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  I, I, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I knew I was going to double it and then I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought, you never took those 2 so then I took 2 more, and the next day I was miserable.  I mean I was like every—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, it started as I could feel pain in my blood stream and my vein.  I mean everything hurt but I, I was, you know, fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well listen a usual dose of lithium turns out as about 1800 mg.  So you're only on 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm low, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're on such a low dose and we're using more in different ways for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I doubled the Depakote that night but that's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You have plenty of room on the Depakote but you don't have to double it.  You can add 250 or 500.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and again the, the way we Depakote load, add a 0 to your weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's how much you can take in 24 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh well that's a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So yeah.  So there's, there's, in fact in the emergency room I would always do that, that, add a 0 and give them that right now, give a manic person—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That amount right, usually, you know, 3 g, you know, 3,000 mg or something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And how quickly do, do, when people are really revved—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does that get them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was overnight for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, immediately, immediately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it's great.  It's a great treatment for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like Depakote.  I like the way it smells and I don't care, maybe that's just an association but I mean I, I like taking my Depakote.  I look at it as like it's a happy pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right so, so it sounds like something happened last month.  Let's ignore the last month.  Up until then you were stable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  With, with one tiny thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were generally not sad or anxious—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I would say it was the best 5 months I've had in the past 3 or 4 years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were not irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Business is good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Business not, that's part of what happened in June.  Business was, I was really into but not obsessed.  We had this, I have a new marketing director.  We had this slow wonderful growth of business, added a few new people, cleaned up our act.  [INAUDIBLE] meetings.  It was a wonderful time for my business, a wonderful time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, ah, and your sleep and appetite were fine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very good, lots of and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No helplessness, hopelessness, none of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	None of that during that period.  I also went to the gym absolutely regularly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And sleeping really well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And your energy was good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're getting pleasure normally, enjoying things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wonderful with a new guy.  I feel wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you, you bounced into—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well yeah I mean he's, I just lucked out.  He's [AGE] HHHeeisidwas a [DEIDENTIFIED] like me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Comes from a wealthy family like me.  Went to an Ivy school like me.  He's a [DEIDENTIFIED] so, so, like big deal if I have a slightly manic day what, what's that compared to his patients.  Ah, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you got an expert on site so to speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great for us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't know that when I, the first, you know, 3 weeks we were dating but, and he's quite well known apparently in this community.  He's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he's, he does on the couch—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Analysis.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four times a week, 45 minutes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well some of his people he can only give them 3 times a week.  You know, it's annoying that people are less willing but yes that, that's, about —.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he [DEIDENTIFIED] one course this semester at [DEIDENTIFIED] and, ah, at those seminary I guess.  That's what they do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, up at [DEIDENTIFIED], my [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah the, um, yeah.  What's the, what's the place that's, seminary the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not a seminary.  It's called the, ah, [DEIDENTIFIED] Center.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah whatever it is.  That's, no but it's part—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it's like a seminary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's part—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it's a good word for it because—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But what is the word [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's called the, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because of the name of it I think people are going, in any case that's where he does his—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's funny that you call it a seminary.  It is something like it.  I know what you're talking about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then, then that's a religious thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's part of [DEIDENTIFIED] and they, they do, they offer psychoanalysis and psychiatry and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In a religious context?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's, no, no.  There's no religion in his classes.  It's just that they believe that those people, it's a very progressive seminary, could use a little bit of, of his stuff so that's what he [DEIDENTIFIED] part time.  You know, it's not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But mostly he's doing outpatient, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and [DEIDENTIFIED] downtown or whatever that place is.  He [DEIDENTIFIED] over there and he [DEIDENTIFIED] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah anyway.  So he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the relationship's going well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very healthy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good and no more with the old drum?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, no.  Not at all.  Legally I can't be around him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh that's right cause the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twelve month mutual—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twelve month, from—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].  The court date was [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, um, what has happened in this past month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  What happened was my [DEIDENTIFIED] director, [NAME OTHER] was so incredibly successful and we had such serious lucky, things that happened that although May and June and July happen, generally are fairly busy months for my business, June was out of control, and in, ah, the course of a given week on average I am in the [DEIDENTIFIED] and which is intense for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I get there at 8:00.  I, starting at 9:00 until the program ends.  [DEIDENTIFIED] is at 2:00, other places, 4:00, I sit down maybe once or twice and I stuff down a sandwich.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm on my feet cause it's not a seminar, it's not a lecture.  We are [DEIDENTIFIED] people and [DEIDENTIFIED] them and [DEIDENTIFIED] them and working and helping them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's very interactive and I'm very devoted to it so I probably put even more energy.  So it's very, it takes  a lot of out you.  I love it but it takes a lot of out of you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  How many people are usually in each one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We have a 6 to 1 ratio.  So it's usually, often it's 10 to 12.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you'd go with a team, with a few of your guys?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it's usually me and 1 other person and 10 to 12 participants but sometimes it's 18 and there's 3 of us and sometimes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you start out with a dog and pony show and then you break off into groups and, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Well we start off with a very brief introducation and then everybody gets videotaped [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right away at the get go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then you compare?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then we, then we, then we, and that's right.  In the middle, we're all together in the main room doing all these interactive exercises.  On average, um, and what's, what's best is if I [DEIDENTIFIED] 2 days a week.  I have 1 or 2 days a week to meet with new clients [INAUDIBLE] and 1 day a week to [INAUDIBLE].  So really good days [INAUDIBLE] [DEIDENTIFIED] in some ways, although other stuff gets a little neglected.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you do the whole thing in 1 day or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah cause, because most, most of our time is with [DEIDENTIFIED].  So they, they can't do longer than 1 day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] is a day and a half program, which is nice cause we have an overnight and we come back.  Some of them are a little more relaxed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you do refreshers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Same people there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's that?  Yes but that's probably a few months later.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh and that's at a higher level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  We also got a refresher [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We, we package it up and [INAUDIBLE] do that.  So 3 days a week I'm [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where, where are your offices, out of the home or you have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  My, I, I'm, when I moved to [DEIDENTIFIED], I found a really good space.  I have a small townhouse and it's big enough that 1 bedroom is completely [INAUDIBLE] people and 2 bedrooms serve, one is like my room and my office.  It's very big, and the other one is my guest room, which is hardly ever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and it's structured as a business, though.  You, you have, you have an employee?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a full marketing person and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they come to your home every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you start and work and you're on the phone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and I have a full time person that does the finances and the computers and then I have a part time office assistant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you, do you let yourself sleep late or you, you get in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no.  I start at, I start at, we start, because all my people are [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everybody in the office and, no except for 1 person.  Ah, so our office hours are 10:00 to 6:00.  [INAUDIBLE] until 9:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is good cause [INAUDIBLE] later too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So tell me what happened.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the balance, the balance, the problem is the balance is usually 2 days of [DEIDENTIFIED], 2 days office.  I can do 3 and 2 which I actually like because I like to [DEIDENTIFIED] but it's a little tiring.  If I do 4 days in [DEIDENTIFIED] ah, that's exhausting.  Two weeks in a row I did all 5 days of [DEIDENTIFIED].  One of them was a class at [DEIDENTIFIED] and rushing back the office for a 4:00, we have an [DEIDENTIFIED] I do.  It's like a radio show going around the world at 4:00.  You know, and then in a meeting after that.  It, it, it was insane and, and, and the first week it was all in [DEIDENTIFIED] but the second week—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can't leverage yourself?  You, there's no one as good as you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The problem was because of my marketing director is off as, um, at first.  Yes later but when it's a new client I've always, they always want me to do the first program and in particular—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you want control of you business too, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sorry?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want control of your business too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah but, but I'm, believe me I've got great instructors and give me the choice of like, there's 3 of us and 18 people.  I will put [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] in front of the room dong the modules.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I will go sit somewhere and make phone calls and relax and eat a sandwich and let them do it whenever I can.  I am not afraid to delegate believe me but it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not afraid that they're going leave you and open up their own businesses?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No cause all, all of my people work for me 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 days a month and they have their own thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] have a film production company they're trying to start.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER], ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so your pay is per diem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Per diem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're paying them for the work they do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not the office guys but the instructors.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got it, got it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Boy you ask a lot of questions, but the second week was not only—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they're kind of contractors, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.  That also helps the cost of business in New York State and the federal government have strict rules to what it means and —.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And stick to those and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well no you, you, ah, you meet those rules.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Oh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As long as you don't—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	More, stricter than my ex—employer who got, got, ah, sued by the government because they didn't follow the rules.  The second week also involved 2 days in [DEIDENTIFIED], Pennsylvania.  Then 2 days in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes [DEIDENTIFIED] and it was very intense.  It was a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A law firm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well a [DEIDENTIFIED] brought me there but it was a [INAUDIBLE] sell themselves to [DEIDENTIFIED], the high end [DEIDENTIFIED] and this [DEIDENTIFIED] brought me in to fix these guys who had never made major presentations and now had to go in front of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was very intensive.  Both weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, that's a smart move on their part.  Did it work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] says that they now are going to refer me to all their people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They, they said, "And when we do we're going to say [PATIENT NAME] by the way is a genius."  That's the word that they used.  I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they sell it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  They, they—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They had 5 meetings set up and the first one was supposed to be the least likely, and so they could sort of practice with them, and they got an offer, the first one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And did you feel like they were totally rough when you started with them and you polished them up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One was completely, a complete blank slate.  He had no idea what to do but that was good because he had no bad habits.  Two had done enough that they were comfortable with themselves and I could just fix them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And 2 had done too much before and had really bad old habits that I had to change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were the toughest, but they were all really nice guys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did, um, how about outsourcing that stuff?  You know, there's a specific project, they need it to be [DEIDENTIFIED] well, could you just come on and learn what needs to be [DEIDENTIFIED] and do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because part—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's too complicated?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, well I wouldn't know enough, I could learn enough about the content that I could pull it off, but when you sell your [DEIDENTIFIED], you're also selling [DEIDENTIFIED] because often people buy the [DEIDENTIFIED] and keep them in place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they want to see these guys in action in front of the room and see what they think of them.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just off on the side going, you know, coaching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The person, yeah, like the coach of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do they ask who's this guy, do they ask?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  They just, I'm just with the lawyers and the financial group.  They just think I'm somewhere in that little bunch and they—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm not a lawyer but I look like one on TV, you know.  So, um, anyway so it was an incredibly, both weeks I mean you tell if my interpretation led you right.  What I think happened was to get me through, cause, ah, kind of like the charisma and energy I have to produce at these things, my body chose to kick into manic towards the end of each week and I was kind of a little up and I, and I didn't do anything about it until Friday night, which then I would—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When was this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This was in, ah, the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, unfortunately June was no thrill either but and then so I do the Depakote and everything on Friday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, but it's a good example that life started pushing you back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, yes, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you needed to marshal those resources.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and it's, in a way, you know, my friend, [NAME OTHER], always said maybe you were manic when you started the business and that's good cause I how would you have started the business if you're not, like well, [NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The, the really bad thing about mania is bad judgment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually saying a few things that you probably shouldn't.  Little grandiosity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And expansiveness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not knowing the limits of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Things that are so cool to you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cool to everyone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To everyone, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I was, see because it all had to be channeled in this professional thing which is such a really finite set of skills that I have to use to [INAUDIBLE] because there's really very low opportunity for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's not that much room to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To go overboard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was, I, I [INAUDIBLE] I can't believe how much [INAUDIBLE] great guy.  He's a really good instructor.  On the last day, I had a little trouble understanding him at times.  I think it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Talking to fast?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But what happened, what was so difficult—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have anyone who's with you all the time who can give you some of that feedback?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My instructors are all good friends and they know, but thank, I was just, it was just [INAUDIBLE].  It was just me.  Um, the problem with these 2 weeks and, and 1 other week in June was when I did my thing Friday nights to bring myself down, on Saturday and Sunday not only was I not manic anymore, I was real tired and really depressed, and then I thought Monday morning—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you pull yourself down.  You're going to pay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  You got to pay sometime and then Monday morning I had to get, get it back up and then back down, and it was, so my, basically I did everything that I usually do including the changes I was supposed to make, when I'm supposed to make changes, but nevertheless it was a very difficult, exhausting month and, and that was so extreme.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But my question to you is with, with manic depressive patients, because we can regulate it to a degree, you know the good news is that the, the, the manic, both the manic and the depression part didn't last any longer, didn't last very long.  It's not like it extended it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's almost worth, you almost needed the mania to get through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's almost worth a few days of depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, ah, yeah but it was, I'll tell you something.  I mean it was pretty bad, those [INAUDIBLE].  Should I, I try not to be a drama queen about this honestly but should I consider myself just 10% handicapped and I should just have to take care of myself like maybe an older person?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Older person who's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't make too much of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, don't make too much of this.  The only thing you missed is on that last 1 or 2 days when you were revving a little past the comfort zone—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Remember we all live with a floor and a ceiling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On our, on our range.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, maybe your floor is a little higher.  You're ceiling is a little lower than other people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you've got the floor and the ceiling.  When it looked like you broke threshold on top, you should've tweaked a little bit of the mood stabilizer, either lithium or Depakote.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Right.	"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depakote's probably easier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you did it a little too late.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But if you could start, you know, what you have is not unlike migraines or seizures.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know anyone with migraines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I know 2 people, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they get these auras.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or people who get also herpes, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you get a, a cold sore.  If you can get the tingle, if you feel the tingle, you, you grab the medicine right away, you prevent the whole process.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Same thing with migraine.  If you, if you recognize—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  My friend [NAME OTHER] is very, has become very good at—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Picks up his aura.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Sometime they smell something.  You know, some neurologic thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He's very in touch with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you, you've got to see this as a migraine, the revving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And grab your medicine as quick as possible, not to abort it, not to shut it down but just to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just to modulate it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You need it to be up.  You just need, it didn't need to be that up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right because then I wouldn't have had such a crash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So this is, this is minor stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and most of my schedule, I mean I have more control over it than that.  Most of the time I could say to a client, "No  I'm sorry.  I'm filled up that week."  I'm not technically filled up that week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I say that I am so that I don't have that kind of schedule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This time it just, for a series of [INAUDIBLE] and I hope that doesn't happen again this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could do that.  I, I'm a guy who's not unlike you who, ah, [INAUDIBLE] was wining and dining clients.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it was just, you know, he had to drink a lot every night and it would just throw him into, he, he was making millions of dollars but he had a, you know, and he couldn't modulate it in this way and say I can only do once.  You can't, you know.  If you're [DEIDENTIFIED], you got to be going—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These are young guys like in their [AGE], whatever, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So they have [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And really burning, you know.  I don't know what they're, but he had to walk away from the whole thing.  He just couldn't modulate it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your case, I think you can modulate this.  I think you have the capacity.  I don't think you should, don't get worked up over this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't make this a drama.  You'll manage this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The, the main thing I've heard from you is that in these 6 months, you had, you know, 5 great months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh it was really, I've really, I mean really good months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's the most important thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is a, a blip.  It's nothing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right so I, I'll write you were mildly unstable times 1 month but really it was only a few days that you passed the line on top.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You passed the line on bottom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right, twice in 2 weeks.  So it happened twice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I certainly would not change your regular medicine and the other key thing is that now you're taking your medicine, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you, compliance has been an issue for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess, I guess another question to you would be, like say it's Thursday afternoon and feel like I'm revving up, just besides calming me, does Klonopin slow you down at all or it really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  No some people find Klonopin is a stabilizer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could use that as—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I could try that in the, in the mid afternoon of a day like that, and then by the evening if I feel like it's not slowing me down, then do the Depakote.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's fine.  You can toy with all of them.  You could even lower the Wellbutrin in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I didn't even think, I didn't even think of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin [INAUDIBLE] and the other things are stabilizers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I didn't even, I just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if you take—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like brushing my teeth.  I just take the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't even think about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It should be, though.  Are you, are you still taking the AndroGel too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you take, ah, the gel, ah, 1 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two, ah, 2 a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two of the 1 mg?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you know what?  I'm so terrible at that.  You, you, you, your people or you have represcribed it a couple of times so it must be in the record.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here.  Save you a bunch of money.  You're paying—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ah, wow!</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know this is the research I do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I should've, um, brought my gym bag and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, we'll find, I think I have a, ah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's really generous.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you pay out of pocket?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no but I do have a copay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  This is the AndroGel 1%.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It says, ah, AndroGel or placebo but this is the real stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Oh, I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, yeah and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For AndroGel?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No for, ah, testosterone.  Isn't that how I met you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't you come up to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  My, my, my assistant now, one of my best instructors, [NAME OTHER], did research and, ah, it's either her sister or friend, um, goes to one of the other doctors here and she, and we were trying to get that doctor to see me and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and he, he couldn't or she couldn't so then they said there's another, is there anybody else in the office and it was you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you coming to see me [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but I think in our initial meetings I, I was, I was so thrilled that you because I was, at the same time I had seen a, who do you see who does blood work?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Endocrinologist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	An endocrinologist and, and I was trying to deal with her and my regular doctor and my psychologist and my therapist and, and you and I was so thrilled because you, you had expertise with men and, and, and, ah, and testosterone and plus everything else you do and that you were like the first person I had found that could put all the pieces together so a big topic of our first conversation I think was about testosterone.  Maybe that's why you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That may be yeah.  You know, I, I would, would enroll men with depression and low testosterone to see if testosterone made them better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, all right so we're sticking with the lithium at 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you need prescriptions by the way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need almost everything.  I, I mean I'm, I've got, you're still giving extra Depakotes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, ah, one of them I don't need, desperately need it but might as well while—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to shut this thing—</p>

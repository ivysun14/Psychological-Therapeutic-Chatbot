<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Long time huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, few weeks.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh, let's see. Well I guess we already had dialogue on the phone, it seems like recently, we might as well pick up from that one. I'm having a hard about seeing why we should continue, basically. And essentially feel that we shouldn't. I think the clincher probably is that I just don't care about filling out the forms anymore. I just I think that has become the barometer of my faith. My faith in the process and seems like the real clincher as far as this being of value to the fizreal (sp) to the program in general. I mean I could sort of do but I just - 0:01:29.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the issue is that feeling like continuing now, you're doing it more for this research program then for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be the only reason that I could think of right now. There is some marginal, some marginal comfort. I feel like there are some skills that I have learned and have learned over the last few months. But I feel like I have learned them quickly. And well I am always concerned about losing skills, not to concerned about doing that in this case. I feel like you've, I feel like I've learned some real good sort of awareness about producing language quickly in response to feelings. And being very aware of the micro interactions between myself and other people. And I've become a hundredth prone to self editing as would normally have been. And some issues not dealing with situations abstractly but now dealing with concretely. And stuff like that. But those were all really interesting things. 0:02:59.5</p>

<p>But think there sort of I really am just having a hard time working with the separation between this world. You know the world of the two sheets of paper rules of what kinds of dialogues are appropriate and which ones aren't. And the one where facing material concerns of which are scarcely discussed in here. Which produce the ironic thing of making you and me feel guilty when they were discussed. [inaudible] a screen in my opinion. You know, I can't say that this is a waste of time, but I think the sense I have right now is that it's kind of delaying the - It seems as if is more of a distraction. But I could probably still use counseling but probably not this kind. And probably should still get keep, get some sort of dialogue going with somebody. But I don't know that it would be this kind. 0:04:35.1</p>

<p>And I don't mean to, I hope that there no, you know, hurt feelings or anything like that. Or nor do I wish to be condemnatory of this particular paradigm or anything like that. But like I said I feel, I don't feel very invested in this. I mean I promised to [inaudible] that I would that I would give it the college try. I had one sort of hoard experience before coming here and that didn't. It didn't work out very well and think it was more of just a personality conflict. I don't feel that at all with you. I actually like you, I mean I don't feel the personality problems at all here. But I just. My sense is that we just literally sort stumble related things. And I don't know I have to give credit to the program it did help or to you. I mean you did help a lot. But I can't, yeah I mean my - 0:06:09.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask a question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, ask away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I understand what you are talking about. Of course this comes as no surprise. This is something that we have talked about if not from day one from very early on. The fact that there are things in your life that you would like that are bothering you. That you would like to see change. And that you would like to talk about in here. And you feel like, and in fact I focus us on different things and those things have not been explicitly talked about. I guess what I am wondering is, seeing as how that has been going on the whole time. What do you see as why you're really thinking of stopping now? 0:07:04.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: I promised that I would try it. Now let's see. I promised I would try hard there were several moments. I mean there were session I thought that were good. I get sort of plateau they're unwittingly good in some ways. It seems like we seemed to stumble across these interesting things. But you know this last month, you know. I'd say the last month especially where the contrast about what was going on in here and what was going on out there was just so stark and so harsh. That I just sort of lost, I've lost faith in the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lost faith in the whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I actually place the, I think when one day I tried to actually to say I wanted to take five minutes, three minutes or something like that to talk about the outside world and you wouldn't do it. I remember I thought that was absurd. I quite frankly I think that was when I pretty much decided that I was out of here. 0:08:44.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that? That was a couple sessions ago if I remember.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember you saying at the time that you felt like you could come in here on fire or something and I would say tell me how it feels to be on fire or something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't remember.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something like that. 0:09:11.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I do, yeah right. It doesn't win friends and influence people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I remember too that last session we talked again about this at one. And I had said that this was about the midpoint, I think this is the fifteenth session. That I thought we could use this session to talk about what we had done up until this point. And maybe changing and that was the context of which we were talking about us both being uncomfortable with you having all of these real concerns. And us not being able to address them directly. Now at the time that seemed okay, or you thought at least you would give that a chance. But today you come in and you sound like you've decided.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. Now do you want to comment on that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah. I mean its just it is something of a discrepancy. It is a different. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I guess a couple of, couple of points. Great. We are starting with this again. 0:11:22.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The barometer.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What a fitting ending. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well my guess is that this is uncomfortable to talk about. You've come in already and basically said "listen, I am coming in to tell you" -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I did have to be honest. I have -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I appreciate that but that doesn't make it any easier to say right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I feel like part of it is that I should have just said something a lot sooner. I have had a lot of reservations much earlier and we were very close to the edge. You know it just like there was always, it just would never go away. The problem would just never go away. I kept trying to say this and so at the fucking eleventh hour, you know you come up with this idea after I have been haranguing on it for months. And you know it like what did I have to do pull a gun on you. You know, I mean which is basically what I had to do. I have to pull a gun on you. I mean its just like, you know. Like who wants that, I don't want that. That's listening? I mean this is not listening. I don't know what it was but it was just, it just seemed like basically I had to, you know, I don't down a jetliner but it gets your attention. I mean, it felt, it felt like I had to use extreme measures to just to get. I mean I did, I was so fucking polite. 0:13:23.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well of course you were. You always are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well exceptionally so. I mean I was heart felt and earnest in my last request that we just once spend less then ten percent of our time here in a different format. And it wasn't until, you know, and all this other shit was going on too. I mean the drinking and the spin offs from that and careening out of control. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was happening with Cynthia.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and the Memorial Day weekend. It was just. And it is just like I don't want that, I mean so discrepancy yeah sure, I guess. I mean I can, it made sense to talk about it at the same point. I guess there is certain amount of pessimism is built up over the last couple of months. And I guess I have my opinions about how much you are going to change. Or what is going to happen in here. 0:14:40.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well I imagine so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let me just see if I understand it see because this actually, I didn't know that you saw it this way. But to you it seems like you had been asking all along to do this and you had made this kind of this one final request as politely as you could. And it wasn't until I was kind of pushed, lets say my back to the wall or something like that, that I conceded a little ground and I said maybe, well lets rethink this lets see if we can be more flexible or adjust this or something like that. But it seemed like an eleventh hour proposal. And just basically to keep you around. To keep you here; to keep you coming every week. 0:15:24.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay that is what it sounded like you what you were saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is what I am saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you. Well, that may be partly true in a way. I mean I actually I don't remember it, I remember myself feeling that way at the time. Right now I feel, I find myself trying to resist the temptation to convince you to continue. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that would be disastrous. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Probably. Besides I couldn't convince you anyway. If you are dead set on leaving, you are going to leave. No matter what the fuck I say right? Right, I mean? 0:16:04.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that's right. That's the way that people are. You've decided to leave. There is nothing that I can do. But I do feel the temptation to -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean not to be. Well we should both be here because we feel something is right or is working. In addition to the contractual stuff. Pretty much not much to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'll tell you, another thing is I have been wondering myself these last couple of weeks about what to do today in this session. What to, how to, well thinking that we were going to continue. How to try to accommodate more what you wanted to talk about. Because I do feel and something of an awkward position. Let's say that time that you brought up the you just wanted to have less then ten percent of our time as you put it to tell me what was going on. You know, there was some. I did want to let you talk about that. At the same time there was something that I noticed about if you remember what I did was say something about how you brought it up. There was something. Some bargaining that you were doing or something. That I did, I did think it was important in its own right. I did and I did, what occurred to me in fact was does, is this something characteristic of Ted. Is this something that he does other times and other places. 0:18:04.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I believe it was that I made it impossible for you to say no. I was so smooth so polite. And you felt like you couldn't say no and since you did feel like you couldn't say no you thought that you should bring that up. And then fifteen minutes later if memory serves me correctly, I pointed out that you actually have options that you could have said no. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it wasn't that I couldn't have said no, it's just that if I had said no I would have been the rude one. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not how it worked out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I pointed out two possible responses that would have been completely appropriate and you wouldn't have looked rude. I mean go review the tape.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no. Refresh my memory, I am just not remembering. 0:18:55.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not a tape recorder either, but I do remember that there are two. I went over it and I realized that the, from the initial premise that you have made was incorrect. That there was no way for you to respond without being a jerk. That you could have said, well I you know, yes lets do, you know. You could have said something to the effect of that is fine, can we just brief [inaudible] side here or can we do it at the end of the hour or something like that. I mean you had options. You have options. For responding. And I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would have been yes though right? That wouldn't have been saying no, that would have been saying yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I am uncomfortable with it or actually or something like that. And as I recall, you actually agreed that there were other responses besides having to say yes and being [inaudible] 0:19:52.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean I may have and as you can tell I don't remember exactly what happened then. I guess why I was bringing it up now was to say that that at the time even though I was bothered by the fact that because of the kind of therapy we were doing it was supposed to be focusing on the process and so forth. There was something that I thought at that time in the process between the two of us. And I think I bring that up because that seemed like a really, that seems now to be really a turning point in your decision about what this was going to be like. You know. What, how flexible was I going to be? How, were you going to be able to talk about these things? Was I in fact going to listen to you? Was I going to let you tell me? 0:20:56.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps I can state it from my perspective a little more clearly. My perception of New York and my transition to New York which is one of the reasons that I came here in fact. I have a great deal of trouble dealing with it, is that I'm face with many intractable situations and people who don't want to barter, and don't want to bargain. And don't, who have their preferences and don't want to budge an inch. And at first I sort of hide under the steps and you know, what ever. Did everything I could to duck the situations. And then of course I helped find, you helped me find my tongue. </p>

<p>You know, it's not as you can well guess I don't think it's too, I don't think its something that took to much digging to find. But I did sort of you know as I told you once the situation in here was so friggin Byzantine that everything I went to became easier. I can only marvel at your stamina for training me beyond the point that New York [inaudible]. Kudos to Jim, and at the same time, so on one hand I mean this has been incredibly helpful, I have said it before. And now I have said it again. And at the same time, you know, this is help also felt like it has mirrored this situation out there. Which is basically we're doing what you want to do or what we're talking about the problems that are important to you. The processes that you see are valid. It's like hey screw that, you know, I mean. You know, the irony here is that the training that this giving me, maybe giving me, most of all is the one just to learn to walk away by myself. And just say you know what good bye. You know, I mean if, you know, I mean maybe - 0:23:14.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I am just to chicken to say goodbye which you know, so what this all produces is my sense that this is the perfect, perfect representation of New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the other thing is that you raise an interesting point. Is that is could be, you seem to suggest that in fact, you've gotten better enough that you can leave. That not leaving was part of problem before and not reacting how ever you needed to react when you were presented with these situations with people who were inflexible intractable out with their own agenda. And if in fact that was a problem that you were having before that we were working on indirectly or directly or however in here and you got better with that. Maybe that's why you are leaving now. Which is an interesting proposition and one I am - what's so funny? 0:24:25.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I really hope, I really hope that my perceptions are real, and that is all that I can say. I mean I don't think, I don't mean to be condemning you. I'm fairly, it has been frustrating in here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has been.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has, but you are presenting a compelling case or at least I get the feeling that you are pointed in that direction. Or saying that, you know, you're learning [inaudible]. And you're learning how to say no in here, or at least I'm curious is you are headed in that direction. 0:24:59.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's actually what I thought you were saying. I was just trying to say back to you a different way. The way that I took it, which was the situation you encountered in here was very similar to that which you've encountered outside and in New York. And because you have found your tongue now you can out there do things differently and in here come in and say look, enough. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is pissing me off or what, this is frustrating. This isn't what I think I need. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well. Yeah I feel exactly that. I mean I don't, I don't, I can't embellish on that. I can't add anything to that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:25:44.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose there is some curiosity about whether or not there is something beyond this. Now that I've learned how to say no. Should I stay in it and take it anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughing] you make it sound like torture. You know, take it anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me just say I find, I'm actually perfectly willing to agree with your assessment of it, if that's what you were saying. I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which assessment?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The one we were talking about with the finding your tongue and being able to come in here and say what you are telling me now. What's one thing that is curious to me though, is that this would happen right at the point when I'm saying lets come in, let's assess the situation and see if we can do something different. 0:26:50.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean, come on, it can't be that curious to you, I mean the crisis. I mean people pull out umbrellas not coincidentally because it is raining, but because it is raining. I mean people, I mean you. I mean part of the reason this came up was because, part of the reason that you proposed that we reassess things, is was because it was clear that I was fucking mad. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's right. And also, well and also that things were changing very rapidly and you're, or things that were happening, it seemed, especially that one week, you came in. There were all sorts of things that were happening in your circumstances in life that you felt like you couldn't talk about. Right, that was the case too. But never the less, despite all of that. It seems to me that what is happened was I said, yeah, this is frustrating to me too, why don't we use next time seeing as it's the midpoint to come in and take stock and see what else that we can do. 0:28:09.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am afraid that I am going to get burned again. You know, I invested a bunch, going to do it again. You know. I've already, I've been a bad boy, I didn't hand in two forms. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ut oh. I don't know if you hand in your forms or not. No seriously, I have no idea. Did you get busted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gosh, great bedside manner Jim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I mean I am just asking. You were saying, hey look I've got to hand in forms to and they call me up where are you're forms, so. 0:28:57.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean, you are the team captain. What's, I mean, I get the feeling that what's going to happen is that we will try a new system. But in the background there is going to be this sense that we sort of botched around on or you know. Its just going to be like, you know, it separation or force or - I mean it's just hard, what are we going to do? Start talking about-I actually think that you like the other style. That that is who you are. I mean that that's who you're wired, that's probably adopted this voluntarily. I mean to switch from metric to English. You know at the age of twenty nine or whatever. I mean, I have a hard time sort of coming in here saying well anyway my feelings were really hurt when she said this, or something. I mean, I'd be pulling the gun from your mouth. I mean I have a hard time sort of envisioning this so. Plus, if I stay now, now I've got, now I've got an integrity problem too. I said I was going to go - 0:31:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you will have gone back on your-</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right, I'll have integrity whatsoever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - promise to me and to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I guess I haven't actually formally said that's it I'm not going back this is over. I did say that I saw no point in proceeding and would like to propose that. I don't suppose I have. I guess I have a small amount of maneuvering room for say staying in here and having some integrity still, so I guess it's not so bad. But, I'm just like wondering what would we do. Talk about the -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I am wondering too. That is what I had kind of envisioned you and I discussing here today. As what do we do, how do we adjust this make it? Because look I mean, the thing is this, we are in this model, I do think the model works. It has helped you to now as you have said before I think it could help you more. But the other thing is that you do have things that you want to talk about. You know. It is not my goal to come in here and be all inflexible and stuff. 0:32:27.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. Its not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was teasing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you seem to be saying is, you know, this up to now has been a lot of work and I am not sure what to anticipate next. What to anticipate from here on out. And in addition to that I am not sure how much you can do, meaning how much I can do to accommodate what you want to talked about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean what options do we have? I mean I, you know, you're the one with training, not me. I mean you are the one that's you know. Is there a Windows 98 version we can use, I mean, of this. Is there an upgrade that we [inaudible]. I mean I don't know what to say, because you seem. I mean from my simple perspective as a political theorist. I know you just love it when I do this, but. I mean basically since the empirical referenced that you used in this setting is not my perceptions of the outside world, but our interactions. The interactions between us that that is fairly, you know, there ain't a whole lot of room in that. You know. I mean it's just [inaudible], you know. Christ, I mean if I were doing here the theory here, I would say, you know, or if I were your adviser or whatever. I would say, look let the yap for five minutes before you start. I mean. 0:34:37.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And maybe that is what we decide to do. I don't know. You know, speaking of our relationship that. One observation that I can make about, I can at least suggest about what is happening right now is that is that we both seem to be kind of stuck. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well does this happen in other places, I can't be the only person that you see. I mean does this happen else where, do other people complain about this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About not being about to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About the limitations of the paradigm, or something like that. This can't be the first time this has come up. 0:35:24.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is to be, yeah to be, it is one of peoples, actually frequent frustrations with this model. That that it comes out a little differently for everyone. But the focusing, yeah, yeah, other people have had this concern. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So isn't there sort of a list of what do you do if? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually, it's the same thing for everyone which is to, is to keep focusing on how this comes about in the interaction. And that's how we learn -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where how what comes about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This -</p>

<p>PATIENT: The frustration.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I was saying we are both kind of stuck. Right? What the model would prescribe to do is to stay with that and work on it that way. Frustrating huh? 0:36:38.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I it doesn't. I guess this is an old saying and I've just heard it recently, but I thought it was amusing. Somebody said that they were there to put the fun back into disfunctionality. Basically to take something that doesn't work and say that it does work. You know. It's like by sheer act of mental capabilities to say well it doesn't work, so focus on why it doesn't work and make it work because it doesn't work. Oh okay. I mean that is sort what I am hearing, is like well we just say that it works. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: By focusing it came apart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me put it a different way. That's actually not what I mean at all. What I mean is the whole point of this therapy is this kind of focus on this interpersonal process and maybe it is just a natural part of this kind of process, that it gets stuck. And maybe the way that you and I work that out teaches us something as well in terms of mindfulness and all that other whatever-ism. The whole thing. Maybe this is part of it, maybe this is part of what it is about. 0:37:51.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't seem a whole lot different than what I just said but, I mean. I mean. You're saying that it is a natural part of the process. And I'm saying that all you did was say that the process seems to get stuck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it must be a natural thing then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No it is different. Because I think what you are saying is what you're saying carried the further implication that getting stuck is something wrong and we will use what's already not working to fix it. You know. Yet. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we've got a darker interpretation of the process.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell you what, let's take another. Let's take another take on this. Here is what I suggest. Here's kind of what I had thought to we might talk a little bit about today. So I'll just throw this out. 0:38:49.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I just say one thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to feel like the jerk either, you know, that makes you talk about things that you don't want to talk about. I mean that doesn't appeal to me at all. You know, its like great, I am going to Jim squirm for five minutes while I tell him about I think my SSLI's numb my brain or something like that. And I was like yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I mean I don't want that. I don't I would, I mean who wants that who wants to be torturing his counselor. So whatever we do, like I said, I don't want to, I don't want to be here if you don't want to be here. I don't want you to be doing things that you don't want to do. And I don't want to drag you kicking and screaming into some new process. 0:39:40.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So. I mean part of the reason that I want to bail I don't because I don't want, so anyway. So I've said what I said. So what do you want to say. What were you going to say, I am sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I was, one way to kind of stop and take a look at where we have gone up to this point and where to think about going. Is to talk about the goals that you had, your objectives for this treatment in the first place. Because like any short term kind of treatment, which this is. There are supposed to be specific goals that you work on. 0:40:39.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And even though we don't always bring them up explicitly every time. That is always supposed to be what is happening. So what were, if you could, what were your objectives in beginning. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't write them down so I can't be held to the accuracy of the preciseness or the precision of the comments. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'll tell you what, actually I have them written. But what is more important to me is what you remember starting with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I remember starting with a) being the refrain was having difficulty adjusting to New York. The absence of social networks and the absence of ability to talk with anybody about kind of what was going on. And my ability to deal with it. I knew that I had completely fucked up relationship with Cynthia. That was completely unable to face it. Similar points with my living situation. And similar and complete inability to face it. 0:42:03.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So was that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the job was just, you know. So those were those were kind of an inability to face really situations kind of with which people weren't listening. I was unable to, and that is my impression of it. I don't think I could have articulated in the June. But I think that was, people weren't listening and so I had to fight for change. Rather than just get it by dialogue. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you had, so is this like the one, one objective. Just so that I know what we are talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I thought that would help me, I mean the objective was to live long and prosper. 0:42:54.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But I am just asking if that was one or was that multiple ones. Just to kind of structure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was the global category was adjust to New York and become sane again. The subcategory was find way for dealing with situations that seemed intractable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Cynthia being the first and foremost one, I think I was incredibly dependent on her. Could no speak my piece with her. And in all honesty, although it hurts to admit it, but you did help me out of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let's talk, yeah that is what I want to talk about next, where is that now. I mean how do you see that issue now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fuck. Where do I see that issue. Well it interesting because formally we are broken up. But we spend an incredible about of time talking about how we are broken up and there don't. Which seems to sort or mirror this situation too, you know. 0:44:11.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its like, talk and talk and talk. And in fact. And occasionally we'll sort of slip into, you know, there is an occasional late night and we will let our guard down. Not that she cares, not that she thinks at all that its letting her guard down but you know, occasionally we sleep together. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You let your guard down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Among other things. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you guys, so as you are saying you're officially broken up which was something that you have kind of envisioned as part of your initial goal. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But at the same time there is this continuing link that your contact and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: 44 year old men dating 24 year old women are probably not real healthy. 0:45:09.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jesus. Check please. [laughing]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be the dream of any 44 year old man as far as I know. And with many others.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right well, you know. It is disturbing, puff daddy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry I missed that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We are completely different world, mine's one of retirement income and I am trying to, I mean this is a woman that likes to stay until four in the morning and party and flirt. And 44 year olds don't do that and you don't know that. I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I mean maybe that is more to the point then. Maybe its not that she's 24 and you're 44. Its maybe that she's not into retirement income and she is into this other stuff and you're not. 0:46:12.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you could be a 44 year old who is into staying up all night and flirting all the time and that would be a different story right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be a different story. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or she could be a 24 year old who is into retirement income and that would be a different story.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, fair alone. Age alone does not determinative of anything although, if you had to bet, most 24 year olds are not into retirement income and are into staying up all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry about. Well I am not going to deny the correlations there. But. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay thank you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, the more important thing is what we are talking about here are your goals, what you wanted to accomplish through this process. And how far along you see yourself on that. Now it could be that you have accomplished what you want. 0:46:58.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could be. That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And or it could be that you haven't accomplished anything of what you've wanted. Or it could be that you have accomplished part of what you wanted, but not everything. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well I haven't. I haven't gotten out of my living situation. Although just before I came here, I wrote an e-mail saying that it was time to reassess that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's come back to that in a second though. But with this Cynthia thing. Where would you say you are? I mean, have you accomplished what you wanted, or, do you see something else that you'd like to- </p>

<p>PATIENT: I need more distance between her. I think basically as long as we are occasionally, you know, occasionally smash mouth kissing, that I am not going to date other people and I am not going to feel, I'm going to feel the albeit, the interpersonal intrapersonal. I mean I am always going to feel connected as long as we are doing this thing. And by virtue, but the opposite. If she dates somebody else, I'll be wounded. 0:48:13.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would imagine so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be hurt like hell. You know. I mean in this little nebulous world anything can go. But the problem is that you've, you know, how could you do that I slept with you last night. You know, like yeah, but there is no commitment. You get up into one of those and let me tell you, that's no place to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So it is like you are saying that you are officially broken up but emotionally there is still that connection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And so I would like to, so where I would like to be is strong enough to push her away. And strong enough to push Eddie away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is your roommate, housemate. Yeah, okay. So.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not there. Am I all the way there, probably not, I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say that you part way? Or. 0:49:20.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think, I actually think that its no, its probably no accident that this, that every week I am able to confront things that I don't like anymore including you, including Eddie, including Cynthia. And I am much more frank then I used to be and it's like it. You know, I don't like you. Or I like you but not in that way. So I am leaving, it doesn't make sense. I've just been sort of frank, so I guess I mean. I suppose my ability to say, you know look I don't want to be here. You know, means and the fact that I said I have already said this essentially to Eddie and to Cynthia. I've been what maybe 85 percent there whether or not there is follow through, I don't know. I'm a little concerned as I was about a month ago, I think that I said maybe two months, a month and a half ago, I think the idea would be that I thought that I would break up with you and then this stuff in here. Or break up with Cynthia and stuff in here. Like I thought I would be happy if I just sort of, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is a strong parallel there thought right. 0:50:41.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's undeniable. Absolutely undeniable. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that those things are connected. And if there was any the positive goal I could see in here is somehow making sense of it or somehow ushering through follow through. Or something like that. I mean maybe I have gotten my diploma by being able to walk in here and say said "Look Jim, its over, I don't think we should be here" and that frees us up to help post game show or something like that. Or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I hear, here would be the thing, right. If we were to continue in here with the goal of helping you follow through. Would you see that as, as you have said before, undermining your integrity. One might say. Or another way of putting it would be a demonstration that in this case you're not following through with what you said that you would do. Which is to break up in here. 0:51:44.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well oddly enough. This is the first time, well since this is the first time when my outside situation has been introduced into the context of the therapy, now this feels more normal to me. You know, whether some discussion about what is happening in here, this is what is happening out there. So or I, I mean, I don't. I feel like continuing has, I mean I am willing to swallow my pride and continue, you know, say okay maybe I was wrong, do back and fill out the forms that I didn't. Or at least one of them. But, -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I don't see it as wrong though. I can see how you might see it that way. But I just don't, I mean I am uncomfortable with, with you know, even calling it that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wrong. 0:52:45.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That you were wrong before. Because lets say if you're to come in here and we're to do something a little different or at least to change our focus in this way. Give him what we have talked about in terms of what you started off wanting to do and how far you have gone with that. Would that then mean that, would that then undermine your integrity for coming in here and saying look I am frustrated with this I am tired of how it is going. And I don't think that it is working for me anymore. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean maybe it would, I think that answer -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that is what I am scared of. I think that I have always been frightened of dramatic change and dramatic confrontation. And I am quite concerned that sort of hang around, you know, hanging on to whatever interaction I can scare up. It is just going to basically be. I mean, I don't know as a therapist surely you would want to send people out able to, you know. Send people out that were fully functional and able to stand up straight and you know. 0:54:34.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well listen, here is my thing. Is my goal is to help you, to help, to help you. This is supposed to be, this whole thing, this whole enterprise, yes there is research attached to it and all that. But it is about being helpful o you. Okay, and that is about this goal that you had at the beginning. These goals, lets say. About what you wanted to change. Now, if you think that one way of saying it might be if you think stopping now would be the most helpful thing. You know, I mean I may disagree in the sense that I feel like there is more we can do in here and we would get out of the process. I do feel that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. That was unknown. 0:55:43.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do. I agree with you that actually as you have put it that actually you have learned a lot. Or this has helped, or not. But I think of things like, you know, what is so funny know is you were pointing out how this is the first time that we have talked explicitly about how this thing with Cynthia in here and it came up how much that parallels what's happening between you and I right now. What is striking to me is how much it paralleled even though we were talking about it. And how relevant that was to your goal. And I look at something like that and say -</p>

<p>PATIENT: System works as far as you're concerned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe, maybe that is my, maybe you might be right. I mean that's my own bias in looking at it. That could be. But I do look at that, that's what I, when I say something like this. I think this can be helpful to you more on top of what it already has been, that is the kind of thing that I look at. What I go on, you know. It seems like there is stuff here. But here is the other funny thing that I worry about. Which is, does that mean that if you continue in here that you also can't do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, that's another layer of complexity to it right. 0:57:21.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well less stakes in setting the meeting next time, set a meeting for Thursday and I am sure as hell going to be sleeping with Cynthia this weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [laughing] That is what it can feel like huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we better make a call here boy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there are actually option. One thing we can do is we can schedule for next time. And we just, we don't have to. In other words it wouldn't be that I am asking you to commit now to finishing thirty sessions. You can have another session and continue talking about this. 0:58:17.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of ad hoc sessions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I would say. I would say at the very least we should plan on, I think that we should meet this week. That there will be some continuity to meeting within the week. Within this week. Or at least, sounds like you maybe can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking, yeah you may be right. There was a kind of there had been a - one thing that is tough about this is that there has been a long gap between this session and the previous one right. So continuity might be good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or we could just meet next Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, on the other had I was think that we could take a week and see how things are going and maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe I can break up with Cynthia. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It might be time to take a break though. and</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, lets, so what do you think, maybe a week from Tuesday, week from today, what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't we meet next Monday at six. Can you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Tell you what, why don't we do it a Tuesday, because Mondays actually being a, is Tuesday possible at the moment. 0:59:34.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just double check. Off the top of my head I am thinking yes. But, that would be Tuesday the 30th. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [inaudible]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want to do it then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday the 30th.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Electronic organizer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Still in the old archaic paper organizer myself. 1:00:15.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, we are the adjoined corporate America. We don't have any choice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, like I said, lets consider this next week as not like necessarily any commitment to continuing anything. But just to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I appreciate that. That is what I would call a good and hard earned idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That saves us from sort of, that saves me from being sort of terrorized by the idea of being trapped in disfuctionality. And well at least that is what it saves me from - 1:01:02.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do wonder though, I don't know if this, what this is a parting shot or something. I do wonder though if that doesn't make it even more of a parallel with your relationship with Cynthia. You know. Where you are like officially broken up but there is this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [laughing] oh god. That was cruel Jim.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't meant to be cruel, actually maybe it something that we can just keep thinking about for next time, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that too much to end it on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry if that was too much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I am 44 I can take it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eh, but you know how I am. I'd rather put these things out in the open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Jim, if it weren't for you I couldn't take the simplicity of New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, very good. So I will see you next Tuesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright, take care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye. 1:01:54.9</p>

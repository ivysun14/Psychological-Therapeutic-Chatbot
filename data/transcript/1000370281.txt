<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I have 2 different things on my mind and, uhm, 1 is about, uhm, well, first I think I'll have to cancel Friday.  And then we had a faculty meeting today which is sort of the source of both of these things.  And there's been a time limit set on when we can leave, pretty generally.  And so it made me wonder if I could come on Tuesdays at 3.  But for some reason, I, when it, when I just thought of it now, I felt very hesitant to suggest it and I kept saying to myself, well, maybe I should wait and see what happens and not mention it yet.  And even just about cancelling Friday, I was thinking, well, I'll start talking about the other thing and then I can come back to this.  But it became obvious to me that, just because I, for some reason didn't want to say it or was afraid to, it would make it impossible to talk about anything else.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You say, for some reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know (laughs) what reason.  Ex—, except that it must be from a fear of, again, uhm, causing you to be displeased with me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: There's another possibility.  You've made a point recently, several times that, ah, you find yourself feeling very angry when you want something and can't get it, a response or whatever it may be.  And I suppose it's possible that you worry that if you don't get what you want you might feel very angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean, regarding the Tuesday time.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know which one I had more feeling about, saying I couldn't come Friday or wondering if I could change Tuesday.  (Silence) I don't know, right now just thinking about that, uhm, I, my thinking previously when I, after the meeting, when I thought, well, I could ask if you could change the time on Tuesday, it seemed to me very conceivable that you might not be able to.  And so right now, in any case, it doesn't, I can't feel that I would have been angry if you said you couldn't.  Because the other possibility that I considered at the same time was, uhm, speaking to my supervisor and asking if it would be possible if I left a few minutes early on that day and, uhm, since I do stay very late other days, much later than many of the other people (clears throat).  The other things that was, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Stutters)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I'm sorry, I didn't understand it, I guess.  I must be confused about something.  Ah, you, you said you wanted to leave earlier.  But you asked for the appointment to be earlier.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, we have to — I leave earlier on Tuesdays because I have my hair done first and then I come here.  And, uhm, if I came earlier here, then I could still get home in time while the hairdresser's is still open to have my hair done there.  But I can't stay at school until, ah, 2:30, which is the time now set and get home and then get back in time to be here at 5.  (Pause) And the whole things of being somewhat annoyed about this limit now and having to stay until 2:30, I think is involved with the feeling, and this is in a way connected with the other thing that was on my mind, uhm, that so often, since I've been at LKC, the other teachers who have children with them longer, uhm, are always after the fact that the teachers of the beginners don't have as much to do and it's not fair and we should be given more oth—, other duties because we don't have the boys with us as long.  And, I don't know, I suppose it's every one thinks they're working harder than anyone else.  And I've always found that this annoys me a great deal, since they don't know what involves, what we put into the day when the children are there and then what we do after the children leave.  And some people, perhaps, organize it so they could leave really early every day but I don't find I can and do my best teaching.  Or, if I leave early, I have to take things home very often.  So it doesn't seem to me in the end that it really is that uneven but we're constantly being told this.  And there're, every year, there're are remarks made to this fact.  And it just seems like we're being put in the position always to defend ourselves.  And then my natural inclination is to be defensive anyway.  And this sort of happened at the meeting today.  So, but I, I felt disturbed, in a way, that after the meeting.  And I, for a while, couldn't figure exactly what it was that was disturbing me.  Because there are a number of things that came up and none of the things seemed that unreasonable or anything to cause me to feel the way I was.  And then, uhm, I began to think of, uhm, just 1 little comment made by the teacher of the other beginners' class.</p>

<p>And it just, perhaps this isn't it entirely but it seems to be a good part of what's disturbing me and it's, it's related again to this feeling of competitiveness and this feeling also that my supervisor always seems to be meeting with the other girl and having time for her but never for me.  And it just happened that, ah, I've had several things I've wanted to talk to her about and told her yesterday that I did and mentioned that I'll try to see her today before the meeting.  And she's also very busy but when I came down to see her today she couldn't see me.  And yet, uhm, the thing that upset me, I think was a comment by the girl and by my supervisor implying that they met each other yesterday, when I couldn't.  I couldn't have met my supervisor yesterday.  And, I don't know, just somehow seems that this other girl's always in seeing her about various things and she's always too busy, my supervisor's always too busy, for some reason or other when I'm trying to see her.  And I can't, I can tell myself reasonably, well, it just happens I look for her at the wrong times.  But underneath it all, I think I feel very slighted.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, I noticed, uhm, that the, you've talked about the, uhm, Tuesday thing and your ideas about that but you didn't say anything about Friday.  Except to say that, you know, you thought you'd have to cancel it.  Is there something you're avoiding or —?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, I don't think it occurred to me that there would be any reason to.  Perhaps because it's, we're going away and, ah, I don't know, I guess I might have cancelled for other reasons but it seems that I almost never do except when we're going away and leaving early.  (Pause) I don't know, maybe there was some unconscious desire not to tell you why.  (Pause) Because I think, just from having done that sometimes with you and also being more aware of how much I've done it with other people, I think it does give me some feeling of power if I do it that way.  And I know, I on the other side, am very, have, have be—, been very aware of, uhm, being curious and not feeling I can ask and feeling left out often when I'm, when I'm treated that way.  So I think I tend to do it sort of, well, for the power of it or to — I was going to say revenge but I, then revenge on whom?  It's, it's probably more I felt weak and now I want to be the one feeling strong.  (Pause) In fact I think, well, it's sort of vaguely connected but that's one of the things that bothers me about the, all these meetings that the, ah, supervisor has with this other girl.  Because I don't know what's going on and maybe she's being told things that I won't know and (clears throat) and just anyway, saying things that will represent her in a better light than me, which sometimes she's inclined to do.  But in any case it makes me feel weak because I wasn't there so I don't know what happened.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yo—, you know, I'm reminded really of ah, what you, I think it was yesterday, ah, you wondered if you were playing a game with me.  Or it might have been the day before.  But you were waiting for me to ask a question, so to speak.  You kind of knew I would if you didn't say whatever it was.  It sounds similar to what you've just been —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  No, ah, yeah.  Well, I thought of that too only today I wasn't (clears throat) conscious of doing it.  I really wasn't thinking of that aspect of it.  I was thinking of something else.  So often, I, I'm very aware of doing it.  (Clears throat, pause) I suppose when I do it with other people, even if they don't ask me it's the, the pleasure I get out of it is the feeling that they're wondering, even if they don't ask.  But I don't, I wonder if there's something else too because, ah, my tendency is not to tell a lot of personal things about myself to people.  (Clears throat) And it's not just because I, I want to sort of keep secrets from them but just the feeling, well, these are things that concern me personally and things I'm doing that have nothing to do with them and they might not be interested.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know, it'd seem that, uhm, there is the possibility that whatever your reasons for wherever you're going, which you haven't said, you somehow must feel must be quite separate from you or, you know, in some way it's m—, must be you feel unrelated to anything else you've been talking about or concerned about or trying to figure out you know, in your terms, as though it has nothing to do with —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Analysis or you or trying to, you know, figure anything out.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But it's also something that I do anyway.  Uhm, there're things I have to do to get ready for the weekend.  But I sort of, in some ways I want to go on this weekend, in some ways I don't.  And I, so I just kind of put it away out of my mind until I can no longer avoid thinking about it.  (Pause) In fact, MSCZ often complains that I'm not organized about getting ready for a weekend and I say things take me longer than they should to get ready the day we're leaving.  But it's mainly because I can hardly stand to think about it before the day we're leaving.  And yet, if I don't know ahead of time then I can't stand that either.  But I somehow will then designate the day we're leaving as the day to do all the things to get ready.  And we're going to PTN, which, uhm, for some reason even if I know my parents won't be there, which I doubt they'll be, I don't think they'll be there this weekend, still, I have very mixed feelings about going up.  And I th—, and it's partly because we race up on Friday and then we have to race back on Sunday.  And this weekend we'll be skiing both days so we'll be racing out each day to go skiing.  And I just find the whole weekend exhausting.  And I just don't enjoy that kind of thing anymore.  (Pause) And sometimes I wonder if it's because I'm lazy.  Well, I suppose in a way it is, but I sort of, I keep going every day all day during the week and so I sort of use weekends as a time to, well, I don't know exactly what I do do with it except I sort of feel as if I kind of get my energy again.  Or I, I feel I have to withdraw, in a way, during weekends so then I can be around people and meet all the demands during the week.</p>

<p>(Pause) I keep thinking about the meeting and I think, uhm, aside from this never ending conflict over being, feeling so competitive with the other girl and feeling she's much better at defending herself than I am defending myself, uhm, we were told to make reports shorter for, uhm, the children.  And I had been worried that mine were too long because I'm apt to make anything too long I write.  But then, for some reason, I think because the headmaster somehow knew I was worried, he came up to tell me that he thought the reports were fine and that it was good that I went into such detail on the different children.  So now I'm in the middle of another conflict or not being too sure exactly what the headmaster thought was good and then knowing that my supervisor wants them shorter and just somehow feeling I had an indirect criticism anyway.  And it is connected with the other teacher because hers were extremely short and I think personally I felt they were too short.  But now it makes me feel that, in a way, it's saying hers were good and mine weren't as good.  (Clears throat) Because this is, uhm, sort of typical of the way I think too because what I'm doing now, after the meeting, is, instead of, well, there's nothing I can do about whatever happened and is upsetting me but I keep dwelling on it instead of just going ahead.  The weekend really has no reality to me because what, the only thing that's real is what just happened at the meeting.  And I'm always just sort of looking back and mulling over things, rather than thinking ahead.  And I can't even, sometimes I th—, I'm looking forward to the weekend, sometimes and then I almost have to stop myself from anticipating it with pleasure.</p>

<p>(Silence) There was another thing that happened at the meeting and I couldn't figure out until just now it occurred to me why it was bothering me too.  Uhm, there's one grade that has lost their assistant for a while and they need to have help on just corr—, correcting workbooks because they seem to have about 20 workbooks per child.  And so we're all being asked to help co—, help them by correcting the workbooks for them.  And I think again I'm bothered because of the feeling I've always had of, take care of yourself, and is something happens to you, you don't ask somebody else to help you out, you still somehow manage it, which is what happened to us in beginners when we had lost our assistant for a while.  And because of that, I think I'm feeling doubly strong.  But just anyway I feel that way.  And that, so I guess I'm feeling resentful that not just that my help, as, as others is being asked, but that, despite the fact that we didn't get outside help, we're being asked.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I just had the feeling again of something I was trying to talk about one day when I said some, sometimes I didn't feel I could say anything because things just seemed too depressing, or what I was thinking.  And I don't know, the way it seems to me today is more that all I think are negative things and it's all sort of a negative concept of myself and, and relationship to other people.  And it's, that's what's too depressing to keep talking about.  And feeling, I keep every once in a while thinking that, well, it's a guard I have when I'm with other people too because I'm inclined to be negative when I'm with anybody but every once in a while I'll stop myself because I'll think, well, I've gone on and on today, here in such a negative way, I have to stop now.  Almost as if I can't ask you to listen to any more.  (Silence) I just started thinking about, uhm, something that the man who runs the gallery said today.  Because I went back today to look at the pastel of the 2 that we're trying to decide between.  And, uhm, both of them are vertical but there was a horizontal one that my father had thought if we hadn't gone, he probably would have picked out to give to us.  But he's, he's picked out for himself and for my sister a vertical one each.  And both days we've gone this man has said that my father had pointed out something very valid and this is that it's easier to hang a horizontal painting than a vertical painting, as if for some reason he wants to sell this horizontal one, which is the same price as one of the other 2 we're considering.  And he did this again today with his father, who also works there.  And yesterday it didn't bother me but it began to really annoy me today.  I don't, I don't know, perhaps it annoyed me because I didn't feel that what he was doing had anything to do with my liking or not liking the picture.  And also the feeling that, at another time perhaps I would be swayed by his doing that, even though it didn't today.  But it was, it was almost that I was determined not to even look at the other one again.  I know I don't like it that much but just to sort of spite him.  For some reason it — or else I just wanted to vent all my anger at other things out on it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you were angry with him because he was trying to get you to see something you didn't want to look at?  (Smiling?)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, it was more, he was using — well, he was trying to sell one thing and, and he didn't really care what I thought about it or what I liked or didn't like.  Because even in talking about, between the 2 that we're considering, one is more expensive than the other and therefore it's the one he wants to sell.  And the things he'll say about that in itself are sort of irrelevant to a person who is trying to decide which one they like better.  And just the way he tries to find out what's bothering you so he can smoothly get rid of it if it's about the one that is more expensive and to play it up if it's the one that's less expensive.  I don't know, he'd gone through this conversation yesterday and so the fact that he was doing it again today with his father but for my benefit, after he knew I'd already considered the other one that he was trying to point out again, just bothered me.  And the virtue of that one was that it was horizontal.  It had nothing to do with what it looked like.  (Clears throat)</p>

<p>And I, I think, I began to, to think that he doesn't like it either and he was afraid nobody else will buy it because it really was not one that interested me at all.  (Pause) But I, I realize that's just sort of making up a reason because there're others that have been sold that I don't care for so, (clears throat) well, I think it is a case of, he sort annoys me anyway but I, I want an o—, object to be more annoyed at so I don't have to be so annoyed at myself.  (2-minute silence) The way you asked that question and sort of laughed made me feel very defensive.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How so?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Bec— I don't know, just as if I had obviously been stupid and laughable and I don't feel I was so I began to feel very defensive about it.  Or maybe the fear, maybe I was after all in thinking of things the way I was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: That maybe you were what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Being stupid about my reaction to the comment that the man made.  (Silence) And I think I was feeling defensive because, just because if you were laughing at me then maybe there was a reason to.  But I didn't, I really felt I judged this man correctly and (clears throat) and this is what I'll do.  I'll either — seems if you've asked a question that would either lead me to think, well, maybe what you're thinking is the way I should be seeing it, then, then I'll change over or else I'll become very aggressively defensive as if I have to make you see that I'm right.  Or, if I do this with anybody, that I have to make them admit that I'm right or see that I'm right because somehow it's connected with how they'll see me in a very important way, even if it's not a very important issue.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

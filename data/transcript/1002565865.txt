<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you make an earlier appointment?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so, unless it's, oh, I did, I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I have you in for 7, hold on a second.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that, is that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, they actually did, the person at 6 cancelled, so did they call you and tell you that 6 is open?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I have you in at 7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh no, it was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean luckily you don't have to wait an hour, luck.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was a bad boy and I grabbed some extra pain meds because I was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're slurring a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm slurring and I know and I know I'm slurring and I'm happy to slur because I'm just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're happy to be a little stoned, a little high?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't want to be overly high but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How'd you get here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	By—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Subway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Car service.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The car service, okay, so uh, I don't have to worry about you tripping and falling or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On my way home?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean I'll probably take yellow cab home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, I saw you in April, you were having trouble with your wife, your mood was okay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were irritable, you were—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I need to bring her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we kind of discussed when I have pain and stuff, [INAUDIBLE] and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That sounds, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll have to bring her if she has concerns about how you're doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably more in the revved up, overspending manic stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're spending—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she's kind of the emotionally overspending or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She is or you are?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she's more emotionally overspending and worries too much about what we're going to do eight weeks from now about stuff, you know, like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean about running out of money?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, like whether we'll take this vacation or not, you know, [INAUDIBLE], it's like I can't, it's like, uh, you know, I want to do it but I don't want to have to confront, deal with it and what I will do is [INAUDIBLE] cancellation policies, like analyze hotels [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean because of your back you won't be able to go on a vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or you just don't want to go on a vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I really want to go but because they're cutting, [INAUDIBLE] only 800 bucks and be good for a year, you know, but you can't trust, you can't trust them anymore—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can't trust who?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The airlines, you know, every two weeks and, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean if you would get [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's non refundable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get a voucher or credit, you wouldn't know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] see if the voucher, what kind of voucher I get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're probably right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean that's, I mean that's the only thing I can't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can't trust [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, they're getting killed.  All right, so uh, your appetite was okay, you were exercising, your energy was okay, you were not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless, concentration was okay, you thought you were doing reasonably well on the high dose Provigil, the Klonopin, the Vivactil—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I kind of feel like Vivactil, it seemed like it was just too many pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you stopped the Vivactil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did you do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well it didn't seem like it was doing anything for me, about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're supposed to talk to me about it first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About when, about when did you do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like shortly before, around the last time we had that session.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean on the phone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, we didn't actually have a phone session, we just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We chatted.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So around then you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, everything, too many pills and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what about the Parnate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Parnate, I'm taking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three of them, 3 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three a day and still in the evening, does it matter or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most people it charges them up.  All right, so you're on the Provigil, Klonopin, and Parnate.  How much Klonopin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, actually, probably, maybe even less because I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About how much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About 1 1/2 to 2, actually it is about the same, 1 1/2 to 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and what pain medicine are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Percocet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how much do you take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, usually 2, 2 of those, whatever—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I don't take that much—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When did, when did you take it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, today I cheated and took 4 but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But everybody, you know, that's not, it's fully disclosed the parties that it's supposed to be disclosed to so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And why today, were you in a lot of pain or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You wanted to get high?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was really in a lot of pain, you know.  [INAUDIBLE] get high on anything I want, you know, it's not like, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's you mood been like in the past three months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm really grouchy and frustrated, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it get worse when you went off the Vivactil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, I didn't notice a thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, so you mood has been low.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you've kind of relapsed, because your mood wasn't so bad when I saw you last—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you kind of have relapsed—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over the past—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But more it's, [INAUDIBLE], it's like this grouchiness, you know, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me specifically what happened with your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, basically, what [INAUDIBLE] early in May, I had [INAUDIBLE] over two months and [INAUDIBLE] celebrating, you know, like homemade beer and stuff, we just graduated from cheap beer.  [INAUDIBLE], you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It makes you want to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That and cheese, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That and cheese.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] there's a lot of very good, that kind of American crafted beer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, like micro brew—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [INAUDIBLE] breweries in the Belgian style—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, so what happened, why are you telling me this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, because I threw my back out at this [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Drunk, were you drunk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I wish I was but that wouldn't have made a difference, no, I was just carrying it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What does throwing your back out have to do with, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With drugs?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, with the story about the beer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's what I was carrying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you were carrying all that beer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was a festive occasion and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I know that's stupid because there I was brining in the beer, you know, I figured he should have given me [INAUDIBLE], you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, did he feel bad about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he felt permanently bad, I'd have to say, he was, he was really okay.  There wasn't much else he could have done, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you bought the beer at some grocery and were bringing it to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, actually to all of us, that's why there was so much, it wasn't just for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many, how much beer was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, maybe, uh, I think like 4 of these big bottles, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Four or 5 and I suggested probably delivery, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you were shlepping it upstairs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Up the, uh, [INAUDIBLE] [DEIDENTIFIED], if you know the configuration of [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a nice uphill grade, you know, there on [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DEIDENTIFIED] over there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's where [NAME OTHER] and uh, up to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then over to [DEIDENTIFIED] so [INAUDIBLE], you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  And then what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, and somewhere along the way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you fall, did you go down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just, I just knew that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something snapped out of place.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, something snapped out of place, no weird pop or anything, but kind of when I went home I realized, it wasn't a necessary pain that didn't you know [INAUDIBLE] and I kind of recovered during the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And when did this happen, two months ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, just about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it better or worse since?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been getting, generally consistently, uh, uh, bad, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you in pain all the time, all day, every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have moments when I'm not in pain and, you know, but the therapy seems okay.  I guess [INAUDIBLE] something, I don't think they pay for [INAUDIBLE] what should I do if this happens.  He's kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's a little nervous to put you [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], he's nervous when it comes to asking me what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, generally, we don't like using pain meds, opiates with the Parnate, you know that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've not had any problem with temperature regulation or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the other thing, but I'm having muscle spasms, that was my next question.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one, what did you use?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, just those two and the Klonopin and the muscles seize up, mostly in the front and in this leg if I move it this kind of a circular—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rotating kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well that's, um, you're pressing on the nerve root but you have this coming out, that gets the nerve root and you get nerve pain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was reading about stuff, something that [INAUDIBLE].  I was reading [INAUDIBLE], you don't have something approved but don't seem to be marketing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know, I know they, they're the ones who make Tylenol with Codeine.  All right, at any rate, so you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] specifically for spasms, specifically for muscle spasms.  I should have wrote the name but I figured [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't want to shag you with too much because you're on, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Should I, should I discontinue the Parnate or what should I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, you can't, you'll crash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, well, you know what I mean, taper it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  I mean unless you want to and then we'll have to manage you as you get more depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're in a bit of a relapse now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I meant, what's the best way to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, so we need to talk first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your appetite?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, sometimes it's good but generally less than it has been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your appetite is low.  Are you sleeping through the night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, most nights, some nights not as good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your energy level like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, pretty low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even with the 800 Provigil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I generally take lower than that because it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you take 3 of them or 4?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take 1, sometimes 2 because I just don't feel like doing much and I think if I don't feel like doing much—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you able to exercise, I mean are you walking some, are you doing anything to move around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well basically, [INAUDIBLE] physical therapist recommends, like he feels that I have to get really stretched out and stuff [INAUDIBLE] things to help rebuild my stamina.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The pain doesn't keep you awake at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Rarely, I wouldn't say never but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did the pain get worse when you went off the Vivactil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because Vivactil, tricyclic antidepressants are used for pain syndromes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what?  I just forgot about it because I had all this crap thrown at me and especially they'll give me, they market [INAUDIBLE] and it's just, I know they're starting not, they're starting to put name brands on some of these things—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's a crime, they just throw these generic names, you know, and you probably hear that a lot I imagine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nortriptyline you're look [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you don't know what you take.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, and they should require the pills be standardized and sometimes they look, even the medicine themselves all often look different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any suicidal thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you anxious much of the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you irritable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That means not just mad at your wife, mad at people in general, a short fuse in general.  You're allowed to be mad at your wife, you guys are at each other's throats half the time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, my wife—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about your son, how about other people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My wife is the kind of person who will yell at like wild and really yell like wild—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I'm not asking about that, I talking about, you have a short fuse in general with people other than your wife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I don't have any—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're what we call angry with your wife.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's my bizarre phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a little weird.  Okay, don't get up just, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hello, hello, I missed it, which is still a bad thing because [INAUDIBLE] no number I know, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your self esteem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's really hard to say, it's kind of, yeah, self esteem isn't so bad.  I move around somewhat, I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't feel like you're no good or guilty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, guilty would be using bad judgement in, you know, this whole thing, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean for carrying the beer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I feel—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Listen, people make mistakes.  In the scheme of mistakes, it's not a big one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but you can't have predicted that, come on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I know, [INAUDIBLE] not a whopper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, you know, I mean it's so easy to revise history when the outcome is so bad but you could not have predicted that this would happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any other bad judgement though, gambling, spending?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, actually, I'm very, um, I like to travel but I don't, I'm not a compulsive spender though other than traveling to places.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and tell me what's going on between you and your wife now, are you guys at each other's throats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, we get along.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're getting along and with your son too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] six out of seven days it's really good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great, that's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not fighting every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, most days we don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, what's your son doing for the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, actually, I don't know if [INAUDIBLE] a lot of other people just to be fair to him, [INAUDIBLE] for college kids this summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You thought he'd fall into a job or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah and look at it this way, um, I don't know if you have any kids that are in [DEIDENTIFIED] camp but from what I'm heard is all the counselors are American and it hasn't been that way in some time, it's usually, you've got a lot of Australians and New Zealanders and for some reason Ukrainians who must have had a lot of English instruction in the Ukrainian schools and they holler at them, it seems like half the counselors are—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From those places because in part because the Americans didn't want those jobs and now they're all, American college students are back taking those jobs, there's nothing in the city for the jobs that the American, they didn't want to work in any, what would you call it, mountain resorts in the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, the dirty dancing and, you know, and the summer camps which were the traditional exactly boy kind of jobs Which —.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So what's your son doing for the summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, his girlfriend is living in our house with us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	His girlfriend, I haven't heard about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, she's kind of a stabilizing factor in a way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you like her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's living with you guys?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was that discussed or that's just how it fell out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's how it fell out, yeah, fell out, no, it was discussed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean he asked you and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, we knew it was going to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long has he been with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, let's see, it'll be close to two years this autumn, it'll be two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so they both don't have jobs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, actually, my wife asked the lady who owns [DEIDENTIFIED] deli and she got her a job in about 5 minutes, that seems to be working.  I guess that's helping, it's great right. [INAUDIBLE], right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This girl is from academic parents so she's like military—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, it's like you grew up everywhere but nowhere kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's Jewish but her name is [NAME OTHER]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's she from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, she's from a combination of [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's Jewish, she's military and she's from [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, academically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's weird.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a little strange.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So her dad is military?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, her real father died in a mysterious shipwreck in the [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Military guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Academic, anthropologist, I think that's the only people who would be on a boat in the [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Interesting and, uh, listen, she sounds interesting.  All right, so you're going to be spending a lot of time with her this summer, I guess, if she's living in your home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  They have their own keys, they come and go, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they nice to hang around with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we go out to dinner with them occasionally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so you don't seem especially depressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You seem a little stoned.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A little stoned and totally happy about it because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] all summer and [INAUDIBLE] there's no reason not to, you know, I've been very good about that, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I tell my wife, look, if I was having a drug problem it would have surfaced by now.  I can control myself around narcotics.  We would know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Listen, I wonder if you should back off on the Parnate, do you want to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  If were to back off it, is there, there's a really, just from reading on this drug, of course this is the literature from the company but there was some in there that really was really targeted towards, you know what it is, I think with the pain, I have to say about it, whether it's a [INAUDIBLE]specific drug that's really targeted at what I have and whether it would really help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, the Parnate?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	From [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah, no, you can't, it said no MAOIs in the profile.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you mean for the muscle spasm?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, because that's getting so bad, you know, [INAUDIBLE] what would I do if, you know, end up [INAUDIBLE] or somewhere, you know, it's, and all the sudden I have to scream and flail my legs and arms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean you're jerking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I mean [INAUDIBLE] don't go to the theater but just, you know, which is okay for a few months but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Show me, show me an example of what kind of jerking you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like my leg, it'll like go back up in the air and like [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Since your back has been back or that's been much longer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's never, I haven't it since then, this is like new, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the past two months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what I'm talking, my arm, yeah, it's mostly the right leg, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just jerking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right and I was kind of worried about kicking people in the face and also, uh, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's happening every day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, more than every day and I mean I just got this just from falling off, you know, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's called myoclonus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is the name of that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the jerking and we see that sometimes with our meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's a side effect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a side effect, yeah, but you're saying it's only been in the last couple months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, this is, uh, this doesn't seem to be connected to the Parnate, it's just that they said that you shouldn't take it when you're on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With this new medicine but, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't seem that, [INAUDIBLE] some, [INAUDIBLE] drug if they put it in Parnate classics, you know, like they have Sony classic movies, the old, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Classic, but you know, uh, Parnate, the reason it's in those categories is because no one is really promoting it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Drug companies because it's old.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Parnate is the rocket fuel of antidepressants, it is better than anything by far and you didn't respond well to anything else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, unless you can pull out some literature, I don't have a name to give you, I mean there's like, [INAUDIBLE] 2 minutes to get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The best thing I find for, um, muscle spasms and especially back pain is Valium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that was my other big question was see Valium or Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Valium beats Klonopin for muscle and I think Valium will be enough to make this go away, also you could be having the jerking from the interaction between the Percocet and the Parnate, so if, since you'll be using the Percocet, I vote Valium, reduce, you know, get rid of the Klonopin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If you write this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll write it all down.  Reduce the Parnate and even reduce the Provigil—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't want anything on board that would charge you up too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, let me put it to you this way, charge me up, [INAUDIBLE] psychologist friend, he says this happens to actually a lot of people, if my wife gets up, I get, if she's not at the house at 6—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll go into those craft show coffee mugs, it's really two mugs built into one and I'll knock down two very strong coffees and I'll roll over and go back to sleep and sleep very nicely and I understand that's not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	After, after two coffees.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean it happens to other people, right, it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not too much?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You really got a tired brain, your brain just wants, craves sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a tired brain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you agree?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, that's a good way to put it, I like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it's always been that way, we've always struggled to charge you up, to get enough juice flowing.  All right and so, uh, do you agree to try some Valium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm all in favor of it, I just, this, I'm not pro drug addiction but isn't it the one that's making people crazy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, Valium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, drug addiction, the dangers of addiction versus—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not even close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't mean me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now with me, you know, my wife will like [INAUDIBLE] about what to do—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you take any Klonopin in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On occasions, yes, I only recently—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have this jerkiness in the morning too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I feel it coming on mostly in the evenings, maybe fatigue makes it worse but I know that, yeah, but if I get a sense that there's pain there that is like, I guess it's sort of like the old, what was it, oh that hurts so you take, you feel there's bad weather coming or something, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, the Valium we're going to do 5 in the morning and 5 at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a healthy dose so you may be a little fatigued from it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or sedated from it so, uh, the Provigil, I'll give you a range of 200 to let's say 600, all right, 1 to 3 tablets in the morning just to keep the energy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Parnate we're going to reduce to 20 mg for two weeks.  If you're okay after those two weeks, if you're not, if you don't get depressed, then reduce it to 10 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, should I come in two weeks in the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, give me a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is ruining my life, I mean I don't want to, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, the jerking or the back pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the whole pain, the whole package of pain, all the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the little surprises that come along with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, anyone talk about putting you on Neurontin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They tried that, it didn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't touch the pain?  Not great for moods, I mean you tried it for pain in these last couple months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe from, uh, [INAUDIBLE], yeah, that's why you didn't know about it, it was very brief and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you know for nerve pain, Neurontin helps sometimes, also a touch of Elavil, you ever take Elavil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, very briefly I couldn't see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, all right, so we'll stay away from it but there are other medicines that often help for nerve pain, um, but for now, in my experience, Valium is great, it really makes a difference, it calms the muscles down, relaxes things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you don't have any problem and you don't think, so [INAUDIBLE] an addictive personality, I can't understand why because, look, this isn't rocket science, you know, I mean you have a brain, if you feel you need one more, it doesn't make you an addict, you know, it's not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you're taking 2 a day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the Klonopin, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, the, uh, what was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], sometimes I'd take, you know, I kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That should be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	According to how I feel, if I feel like my critical thinking is a, enters into the whole mix of decisions and you don't take everything so totally literally, maybe more of a [INAUDIBLE] orthodox, um, which some doctors would hate, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I want to hear from you once a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, call my voice mail once a week, let me know how you're doing.  I don't want you taking, I don't want you to be this stoned okay, try to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not going to be this stoned—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Take as much, take the Percocet that you need but don't go over the line—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because then it won't work anymore and then you'll have to keep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Increasing doses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're going down on the Parnate, we're switching to Valium and we're continuing the Provigil, okay, tell me if that's clear to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's better than average to me.  I am writing it down but, yeah, this is pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see you in a month, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call me if there's any problem and that dream like state, we're not going to worry about that, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which dream like state?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The one you called me about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, oh, right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're not going to, we're going to ignore that since it happened only once?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'd rather, uh, there's always a mixed feeling about these things too, you know, it's just not interesting to write about, you know, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's your age again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had a recent birthday so I'm [AGE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm [AGE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, here's the Valium prescription.  Do you need other prescriptions?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let me see, I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we're going down on the Parnate, so you don't need that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Provigil we can always call in and Klonopin you don't need because you're going off the Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

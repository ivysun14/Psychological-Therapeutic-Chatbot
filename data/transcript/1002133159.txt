<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
			
<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy. AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.  The therapist in this case is unknown.</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's not bother today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see how we get on shall we? We can just try it if we don't like it, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I think once you've got your time if you just forget you've got the time] (ph) [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Maybe we can talk about [audio blip]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and this virus (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything you [audio blip] m-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I remember [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just one of our usual sessions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so then you [inaudible] said "no", but we're not going to do that, [it's not] (ph) all about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Well why do you want to start talking about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I, today I had — what did you have for breakfast today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me think. I was lazy this morning, I slept in, and then all I had was some grapefruit, a boiled egg and some bread and marmalade. What did you have for breakfast? [0:01:00.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had so two boiled [inaudible] I had two boiled eggs and some bacon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, did you have any [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a fear that this tape and this recording might interfere with our work. So I have the feeling that it makes me less tense when we're talking through the tape recording because it gives me something new to think about. Don't you think having new things to think about helps?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's kind of interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will we have him record it back once we get through?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye (ph), I think we should listen to it don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Listen to it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will we have time to listen to it before the hours up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, but I don't have to go away immediately we finish our hour, because we started early it's possible to start till three [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then we can listen to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and we can ask Dr. Berlin to play it to us so we can hear what we said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Before the hand gets around to three?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. No, we'll be stopping about 20 of four, and if we stop at 20 of four we can listen to about 10 minutes of our recording.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. [0:02:01.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you were saying that you were uneasy, that it might interfere with our work in some way. How do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think that it might interfere with our work or it might interfere with my cigarette.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you think it might do that then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know. Well [risk taking] (ph) and sounds now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it must be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does it feel like to be [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: be taken in like that? You're not finding it so bad then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's possible we could just try it for a couple of minutes and not the whole time we talk, just try it for a minute or so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we'll see how we get on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then have him record it back into us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you, how do you think it might interfere with our work or with your cigarette?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it may not give them an idea that you shouldn't give me the cigarette, the people when they're studying us, one of the docs you work with, I mean it might give them the idea that you shouldn't bring me cigarettes anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think I'm going to let them bully me then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you have your own boss still (ph)? [0:03:00.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who's my own boss?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's right. You must think I'm easily put off my stag.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When can I light up my next one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a clock out there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. When would you say I should light up my next one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when did we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When did we start? Just a while ago. You know what, don't you think that it's all, uh, it's uh, this is like you do on television?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are there any questions you want to ask me about how this interferes with our work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can go ahead and tell me because you seem to have some doubts about your (ph) work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean it's hard to tell you things. Is it all right for me to talk about what I did during the day, about my day?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just tell me what you usually talk about, it's fine with me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean remember when I would — today I had two boiled eggs. I mean I had, for lunch I had some salmon and some lettuce. And I've only had two cigarettes today. And I haven't had any extra cigarettes today. [0:04:06.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've had three then because you smoked one here, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it but, uh, I didn't have any besides that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean that you didn't have any extra ones in the school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, I see. But you were saying something else about being worried about the recording. Do you think these other doctors might criticize me so much I'd be ashamed of giving you the cigarettes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well I have an idea that they might, uh, that they might criticize you for giving me the cigarettes, do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They might tell you not to give me them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, so do you think that was [inaudible] do you think that I have to worry about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what do you think then? Have I given you any impression I'm the sort of person that's susceptible to that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Did you mention to me about the cigarettes the first time? Did my mother ask you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you told her that you were free to do what you wanted to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. [0:05:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Remember long ago I never asked you for a cigarette, and then one day I came in and said "can I please have a cigarette"? And then you said "this is the first time you've asked me for a cigarette". Do you remember that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, I remember that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean so you know there's lots of things we've got to talk about before I won't ever have the horrible feeling again isn't there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think. It strikes me that one of the things that bothers you is that you think people who are working with you are very much influenced by other folks' opinions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what do you mean? Well give me an example.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the one that you've just given me about the effect of these other doctors' opinions on my work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. Well [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you give me any examples from your own living (ph) of where this happened? Where someone was doing something and because another person criticized they stopped doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I can't think of any offhand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were there any in your family at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't think of it offhand. But there's — then would you say that this has — but would you say that this is [for the idea] (ph) or this is [audio blip] decided to stop giving me the cigarettes because my mother told her not to because she had been giving me so many cigarettes, or remember that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yes, that's those things. Did you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now for instance, so to change the subject for a minute. I can see that this is going to be very helpful to us, this may be very helpful to you, and it might be very helpful to me. Don't you suppose it might be very helpful to me in a way? Because I can hear what we've been talking about, don't you think? [0:06:33.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would be dishonest if I said that the purpose of making this recording is to help you, I don't think it really is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's to help you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be very useful to me and it might be very useful to people like Dr. Berlin who are trying to study the way different doctors are working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I don't think — I think they'd be very nice about this, uh, situation and just not you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we will raise hell with them if they're not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, [I bet they are] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're keen to protect me from any kind of embarrassment or criticism, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe we better take it off now and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm quite comfortable with mine on if [audio blip] mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will you tell him to stop? You can tell him to stop anytime you want can't you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can if we want to, but I think now that we've started we should just finish it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay and we can listen to it before I go?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's right. Now is there anything else special on your mind you wanted to talk to me about (ph) [audio blip]? [0:07:34.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, about I had a dream but I can't seem to remember it. I mean I can't seem to remember everything (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't or you don't want to? Is it a difficult dream?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard to remember. I think it was something to do or something to do with my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Why not do you think] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I keep dreaming that I'm over at my grandmother's apartment in Baltimore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you dreaming about this last night that you were in Baltimore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I oftentimes will dream that I go from here up to Baltimore to my grandmother's apartment to stay with my grandmother. I keep having that dream. And (chuckling) I keep having the dream that I see my father (coughing). Should we tell him to stop now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm quite comfortable with it on [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Stop now? I think this is better than nothing. Would you tell him to stop now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's keep it going to a wee while longer, eh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: May I smoke my next one now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure. [0:08:26.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is very interesting, no?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it will be good fun for us to hear our voices afterwards and the kind of things we said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're now on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. Well what was happening in the dream with regard to your mother, you mentioned she was in it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She, uh, had, uh, uh, she — I mean a dream that she came up to see me and I — well you see there's something I'm afraid to tell you about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there any parts that you're afraid to talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well let's talk about all the things in a different, in a line, you know talk about them you know one after another?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I was just wondering what consequences you'd [overlapping voices] [0:09:25.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: First let's talk about the recording and about how I feel about the recording. You don't think that's important to talk about today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and we could probably be talking about this for some time [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I felt that this is something new to me and is very interesting to me and maybe we could work better. I felt that maybe we could work better with this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe we'll be able to, especially when [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe we could get out the tape recorder. What do you think of this arrangement, take a tape recorder and, and uh, do tape recording all the time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well as I've got [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And have our own tape recorder and just keep it private to ourselves and not have anybody ask to hear it except us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's a thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then play it back for us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you're not too content about Dr. Berlin and other people hearing what goes on, eh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's more (ph) what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Yeah, I know] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you hear what goes on outside?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should think so, yes, I should think so. [0:10:24.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You sound pretty [audio blip] [for this].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, I don't think they'll [audio blip] to hear though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because Dr. Berlin has a special thing that fits into his ears. But what trouble do you think would arise if [audio blip] what was going on out there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well but there's some things that I'm [going to throw they're] (ph) afraid of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what do you think might happen if you [inaudible] went on in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it effect me having a cigarette tonight or [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see, you mean you might be punished for criticizing him, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he might keep (ph) me off the cigarettes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, you wouldn't like that very much would you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. Would you be willing to call him in to talk to him about the situation if I thought that it was necessary?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I asked you to do it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I would. But tell me, do you not think you can manage to deal with him yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel I'm getting along better with [audio blip] anybody that's stern. But yet he's trying to help me and I do like, in some ways though I do like Mr. [audio blip] so (ph). [0:11:24.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you not think he might manage to — you might manage to talk to him yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, that's hard to say. I don't think I could get away with him, he's so stern.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but do you not think you can manage to make a reasonable position clear to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well how can I learn to do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How can I learn in here to do that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then you make your position pretty clear to me don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ever find it difficult to persuade me to change my mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for instance, one night it was difficult for you when you had, took the cigarettes away from me, because I asked if you broke your rules and asked the people for cigarettes in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, aye, I remember that night. You were kind of cross with me on that occasion. [0:12:22.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I tried to get you to change your mind. And oftentimes I try to get too long or I try to get you to change your mind about three cigarettes and let me have more cigarettes in here, and get you to change your mind and give me another cigarette.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. You sound as though you find me a kind of difficult person at times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the thing I'm worrying about tonight, because I have so, we have so much time on our hands, that I don't get the extra cigarette and then I won't be able to you know. Is it all right if we play back what we heard right this minute?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's wait till the end [audio blip] want to interrupt our hour, because the most important thing is for us to have our session together. I mean the recording may be fine (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think we've done very good work tonight?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we've talked mostly about the recording. I think you've stated your case on it pretty clearly and told me what doubts you had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That isn't good work though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it is. Yeah, I think so. [0:13:20.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you laughing about, hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When (ph) one dime is left for the telephone, "now listen to me".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "You've been a naughty, naughty, selfish" — I said, "Would you please give me something to make me feel (ph) better?" And she said, "Now listen to me. You're being a naughty, naughty, selfish", (pause) I was asking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As (ph) you certainly want the whole world to know what a difficult person Miss [audio blip] anyway, eh (chuckling)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were awaiting your chance to get that in weren't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh (other chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you still finding her difficult?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel a little bit nervous when I'm with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, in what way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so there I was with her today. I went into the kitchen to smoke a cigarette and she said I thought and did things. I mean naturally she didn't object to it because she knew that that was the rule and she didn't say anything about it, she just talked to me while I was smoking a cigarette right in front of her and she didn't say anything about it because she, you know why that was, because that she knew that I was allowed to have it. [0:14:36.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I hadn't been allowed to have it she would've been cross about it wouldn't she? Don't you suppose she would've?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The reason she, uh, didn't say (voice starting to tremble) anything about it because she knew that I was suppose to have it, knew that I was following the rules, right, and knew that I was only right that I should have it. Don't you suppose that was?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so. I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if they'd been asked to give me more cigarettes and they had no objections.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you think the rules are kind of handy sometimes to help you handle people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know, I feel less [inaudible], feel less tangled up in this school now that [I'm I mean] (ph) allowed to smoke, I feel less mad at the school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're not so fed up with them, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel fed up with them. No kidding, it's the third day when I get my medicine, and the fourth day that I just get fed up because I'm taking the pills.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that was a theory I gave you. What do you think about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. [0:15:35.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, are you convinced?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. What does convinced mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One time Mrs. [audio blip] she said to me, "Ought to be sure!" She said, "Be sure." And, uh, I said, uh, "Be", uh, you know, and I said, "So you think about it carefully and you tell me the real answer. Don't just say sure!" Remember the other day Mrs. [audio blip] called me selfish. I could talk about all the people that have called me selfish and all the people that have called me foolish and, and all the people that have called me rude!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now is the time to do it because you can let the whole world know through the recordings (both chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, yeah, are you sure that this won't, but I want to and (ph) get something real straight with you about this, then (ph) I you to be serious about this. Are you sure that nobody will, uh, find or will, uh, for, keep me from having cigarettes or if they hear about this? [0:16:35.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm quite sure. But what I'd like to know is why you're so uncertain of my strength to deal with other people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But do you think that that will interfere with this in any way?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well why do you have doubts of it? You do seem to doubt my ability [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm so afraid these doctors might, they feel that you shouldn't give me cigarettes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm afraid even me hearing and just talk about this might have affect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. But tell me, have you noticed in the past that I seemed likely to be influenced by what other people said to me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm, I don't think you'd, uh, take the influence by it because you've said maybe clear it with Miss [audio blip] [I would be too glad] (ph) to be free to do what you wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's still a wee doubt in your mind though [audio blip] still worries you a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What is the wee doubt do you think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not too sure, it's just that you keep saying that you're concerned that maybe the criticisms of those other doctors will make me stop doing something that you like me to do. [0:17:34.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Remember the first time I started coming to see you I started talking about a lot of obsessional (ph) ideas [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: �and a lot of doubt? And does this thing take in the sound like this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a microphone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just (ph) [audio blip] speak into it like that or just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you don't, and you don't need to pay any attention to the thing (other chuckling), and with this you can even get up and walk around and not worry about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. I got a record, uh, ["The Big Hurt"] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you told me about that yesterday [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I, uh, I told you yesterday I went up to the, of all the things I did yesterday, you don't want me to tell you all the things, like today when I first got up I took a bath, a shower, and then I shaved myself, put on some shaving lotion, and I went to the table and ate my breakfast and then I made up my bed. And now I, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was there anybody with you at breakfast?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I went to Mr. [audio blip] class and he talked about a community and about the com, and the root word for community being common. And we or I had, uh, before I left, and though I didn't pay much attention to what Mr. [audio blip] was saying in class, I thought that was quite a strain and I got through with the down at Miss [audio blip] I had a good lesson down at Miss [audio blip] had a good time down at Mrs. [audio blip] the other day. Had a good lesson down at Mrs. [audio blip] I mean. [0:18:52.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. I noticed you didn't mention anything of the new school teacher [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel he's very, uh, he insists that I do certain things. Once he asked me to do something, he insists that I keep on doing it. For instance he'll say, "Would you please, uh, go out and rake up the leaves and rake up a few leaves in the yard?" And then I have to say, "I'll, can I, uh, write some letters?" And he says, "I told you to go out and rake up the leaves, so I think you better go out and rake up the leaves first before you do that." And then I'm, and then once I start [overlapping voices] [0:19:23.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he say that to you this morning?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, he did. And then, uh, and then I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you think he meant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Said I wanted to do something else. And, and we're starting to, uh, straighten out my records, to get my records all in order. I did that this morning just so that we can make a list of all my records I have so my mother won't duplicate me when she gets me other records. [Audio blip] I'm looking forward to my mother coming up to see me tomorrow. She's coming up Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I haven't told her what she's to bring me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't, m-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think that this will probably, it will make the hour go by much quicker won't it, because we have something interesting, instrument to work with?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you forget (ph) the, I think of getting you an, uh, our own private tape recorder so that we, just you and I could record on it? We'll let — no, and would you let nobody here about hear it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This would be for us, yeah, I won't (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nobody hear it except us, and you promise you'll let nobody hear it except us? [0:20:22.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I keep my word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you promise that you, or would never see anybody in the school unless it's in my presence and without giving me fair warning?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahead of time if, I mean Miss [audio blip] was to be [inaudible] obviously being the new teacher, again, if it was to be Miss [audio blip]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, though you may remember [audio blip] you said if it was an absolutely emergency and your treatment was threatened [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: �I might have to see them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you feel, was your reason for seeing the teacher; was it something to do with our work? Was it something to do with our work being threatened?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it wasn't, but I thought it would be to the advantage of our work if I saw him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just how many minutes have we got now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you had grave doubts about that didn't you [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When do we stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's the clock.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When do we stop? When the hand gets around to where?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When it gets around to the eight.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, and then we can, and when are we — then we're going to hear our work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, we can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can we hear the whole hour?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We won't have time to hear the whole hour [audio blip] it will take an hour to clear (ph). [0:21:23.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we'll take and hear a few of it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A bit of it, yeah. We can hear the high points, where we've been especially clever both of us, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. How will we, how will it come back, the sound to us?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Through this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, he, Dr. Berlin will bring the machine in and we can hear it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh (coughing). You know what, and, yes, my mother is getting me a collie, [inaudible]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well so you tell me [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess it must be so, eh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know what, do you, don't you — do you wish that I could tell you these dreams?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it was something about your mother in this one that you were going to tell me about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, but you know oftentimes I feel very, uh, I mean it's hard for me to go ahead and tell you this, especially with a tape recording machine to record. Mm, will they play it back to us next time we come up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would doubt it. What you do is he promised he would send me the tape recording when he goes back to Wisconsin. [0:22:28.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then what will we do with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you and I can play it together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On this machine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'll have to buy a machine of my own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we can play it together on that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you going to buy a machine? When are you going to buy a machine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As soon as I recover from the affects of paying my income tax.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You'll buy a machine (laughter in voice)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will this fit it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One that this will fit? Will it be just like this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think probably I won't be able to afford as good a one as this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it will still hold this same film?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can this film be played over my tape recorder at home?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. You know what, I feel a little tense. Now I feel less tense [don't I] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a kind of contradictory message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so what do you mean a contradictory message?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, you said one thing and then the other immediately afterward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you think the horrible feeling has anything to do [with when I saw her] (ph)? [0:23:27.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. You know oftentimes you see, uh, oh, a design, see, uh, designs in the air don't you with the designs, isn't that right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Isn't it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well I think it could be a fabulous thing] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It must be a confusion of thoughts. It must not be anything serious but it seems serious for the moment doesn't it? Do you feel that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Well it's not really] [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: �the horrible feeling is not (ph) a serious form of discomfort?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't seem to enjoy it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (chuckling) I don't enjoy it one bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When shall I light up my next cigarette?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well wait to see. How long have you got to go [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: When the hand gets down to there. Do you think we should be recording our whole hour?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, just for fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course you don't seem as serious when you're not talking, when it's, when we're by yourself we're doing it. [0:24:27.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably not. I think you're probably right there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or (chuckling) you're being a little bit out of, uh, of seriousness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we're paying attention to what we're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you feel that bad? The way I feel about the tape recorder is that, uh, we should, uh, uh, talk through the tape; that this might interfere with our work in some way because we couldn't be as serious as we were without it. Don't you think sometimes we should talk without the tape recorder sometimes, and sometimes with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, I don't think we should use (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt that this was something new and yet I thought it was something that would get you less tense. When I ask something, why is it I feel less, more relaxed now that we're talking with a tape recorder than I would without it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you are [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it, so it gives me something interesting to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I would wonder if you are [audio blip] because it strikes me that you've been pretty uneasy today about this tape recording.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I felt very uncomfortable in the car when I was coming up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh? [0:25:26.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it all right to do this with the cord?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes [audio blip] What were you uncomfortable about [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In my head, so I thought I was going to have a horrible feeling, a little bit worried today, because this is about the fifth day I've had my medicine. So I had my medicine, uh, I mean I think it was at, yeah, the night before Easter, mm, and then I had it the next day and then I had it that night, and then I had it Monday morning and I had it Monday night, and then I had again this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could it by any chance have something to do with the fact that we talked about making this recording yesterday [audio blip] that you were uneasy on your way up here? Did you worry about it [at all] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't worry about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I have to just sort of, I kind of forgot about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you'd forgot until you came in here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. Did you tell me before that you were going to bring up a machine?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. You said yesterday that you didn't mind making it, remember?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Could you please have them take off the tape recorder now? Tell him to stop it? [0:26:25.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, we've made more than half of it [audio blip] I think we should finish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now that you mention it could you, would you be willing to stop it now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you insisted but I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Personally am quite comfortable with it on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you turn it off now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't make me uncomfortable [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you turn it off now? Can I light up my next cigarette now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. [Smoking and silence from 0:26:52.0 to 0:27:08.2] It doesn't make you uncomfortable?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it doesn't bother me a bit. It bothers you though a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. You don't think it's nicer when you can [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you give me any other example [audio blip] somebody's behavior to you has changed because an outside individual interfered? [0:27:29.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't think of any offhand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I was wondering if it ever happened with your mother [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's a long story, I'll tell you about that some other time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'd like you to tell me about it now, nah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll tell you about it some other time [inaudible]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now you're teasing me. You don't want it recorded and that's the thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Do you think this may be that you're uneasy that your mother may find out about it and what we've been saying, hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I never did, thought of that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would you just give me some explanation of what the doctors would do when they find out about our recording and our work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just compare standards of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And do you think they'd just, then going to this they'd stop to think about the situate — the cigarette situation? [0:28:31.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if they might. Some doctors don't give people cigarettes when they see them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Would they go into on this cigarette situation or not?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They might talk about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But would you have, would that stop you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [Silence from 0:28:53.9 to 0:29:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about this long story about your mother that you keep teasing me about [audio blip] hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll tell you about that some other time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe next time I can come up I can [say these short ones] (ph) of all the things you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Remember how you asked me time and time again what I thought of this teacher [audio blip]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. [Silence from 0:29:24.3 to 0:29:54.0] Have you thought anymore about [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I feel he's beginning to clamp down more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I feel that if I go along with him he will get easier, settle down a bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what ways do you think he's clamping down on you [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think he's clamping down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, and so he's trying to help me and trying to insist that I do these things. [Silence from 0:30:24.9 to 0:30:35.9] Shall we take it off and hear it over now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's wait till 20 of [audio blip] when our hour finishes. I don't want to interrupt our hour just because there's a tape recording being made.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's wait till the hand gets down to five.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Goes round to eight, mm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's when our hour finishes. That's right you can walk around with your thing [audio blip] [Silence from 0:30:58.8 to 0:31:15.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know, um (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, what would you like me to know [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you know who's a person I like better than this teacher [audio blip] gone (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm, you haven't told me much about Dr. [audio blip] what's his name [audio blip] so tell me about Dr. [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He looked something like my father. Let's turn it off now and hear our own shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, Brian (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I insist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You really want it off?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we not keep it on till we finish our hour [audio blip] [0:32:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well let's [audio blip] now he wouldn't object with you if I insist. Shall we? Just tell him to stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you really insist?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can we not keep it on till the hours up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, let's stop it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now you have to tell him yourself [audio blip]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You want me to tell him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd have to then ask him to stop now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's his name?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dr. Berlin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dr. Berlin, would you please stop the thing now? Uh, we or I mean that means Dr. Cameron said for me to stop it (other chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then I'm sure he stopped. And can tell him, if we want him to start again we can tell him to you know? [0:32:48.4]</p>

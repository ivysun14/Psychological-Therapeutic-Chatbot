<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) After I left yesterday I, uhm, just suddenly, well, it suddenly occurred to me that half of the time when I was talking about, uhm, well, especially at the end, when I was talking about putting in a lot of effort and, and not, it wasn't appreciated, uhm, it seemed to me suddenly that what I was really saying to you was that I had tried very hard to get here early or on time yesterday and still hadn't made it.  And it, I don't know, sometimes I'm amused when I sort of see what I was doing.  I don't think it was entirely what I was doing yesterday but it, the way I ended, it occurred to me that I was telling you something more than talking about what I thought I was.  And, I don't know, it just, it was a very upsetting thing to me since I had felt I was being honest about the fact that I wasn't bothered at being late and I had thought I'd really thought about it.  And, I don't know, to find out that I could sort of fool myself as much as I did was very disturbing.  And I think also the feeling that probably all along you saw through what I was doing when I didn't, bothers me too.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Another thing that, uhm, I just started thinking about when I was thinking of this realization that in part I was indirectly telling you something, was, uhm, the way just so many little things, and they kept occurring to me after I went home, that happened yesterday, I had, I had looked at every single one of them which could be looked at in different ways, uhm, as if, well, even as strongly as if I thought people were against me.  Just little looks or tones in people's voices, everything, I was taking as people being against me or, uhm, well, feeling, I was feeling competitive and feeling that people were doing better than me in the competition.  And then today lots of situations that involved the same people and could have involved practically the same types of reactions, I just saw entirely differently.  Or not, maybe, saw entirely differently but I was able to realize that they could be seen at in different ways and I really had no way of knowing exactly what way would be the right way.  And it just somehow, things aren't bothering me that much.</p>

<p>One thing in particular that I was thinking about is, uhm, a remark that the assistant in the other room made one point when she came into our room yesterday.  And we were hanging up some papers because it was parents' day today and so we were doing it a little more carefully than we sometimes do.  And, ah, I'm inclined to have a lot things out in my room.  And the teacher in the other room is inclined to have very little out.  And this girl made the comment that they were trying to put things away, not putting more things out.  And I immediately bristled when she said that and sort of didn't let myself think about it.  But when I got home last night, I became more and more sure that the other teacher had been complaining to this girl that, or just sort of criticizing me behind my back, to make her be sort of defensive in that way and make her comment.  And today, when I was talking with them again, uhm, her reaction to me is sort of, of cool but there are many reasons that it might be cool.  And, and in any case, it just, even if they were talking about me behind my back it didn't bother me in the same way that it did last night.  (Clears throat)  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I connect how I was seeing things yesterday with something else too, which I'm trying to avoid talking about because it was the same reaction that I had when I first got to talk about intercourse.  It's just, well, something too personal.  And that is that yesterday I began to have my period.  And very often, either the day before or the first day of it, I just kind of lose the relationship of things and I'll be extremely moody or very upset very easily.  And, I don't know, this is something that, no matter how, how many times it happens, I am not aware that's what's causing it until after I've gotten out of the mood or the situation and then I can see that it always is worse right at that time.  And MSCZ always says I do it on purpose, I sort of use it.  And I don't know, perhaps I do unconsciously but it does, it ha—, it, his commenting on that has made me wonder if something really does happen to people or if they do just kind of use it as a way to stop controlling themselves so much for a while.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Can you give me, ah, more picture of what, how you feel, that, ah, this is the day before or the day you start?  Or when?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes I'll, uhm, just some little thing will upset me very much and I'll become very tense and, uhm, very inflexible.  And, and what I'm thinking about right now is, uhm, — gee, I can't even remember what I was looking for but I remember, a long time ago, one day I was looking for something and it was, it might have been a photograph or I don't know, some fairly unimportant thing.  But for some reason I couldn't find it and this became the most important thing of all.  Now this is probably a tendency I have anyway, if I decide to find something I can't stand not finding it right then.  But I became almost hysterical about the fact that I couldn't find whatever this was.  I think it was a photograph.  And then the next day or so, when I calmed down and anyway, that whole mood had passed, then I did find it and I couldn't understand why I'd been so upset over not finding it.  Or just sometimes, I think I feel as I was yesterday, particularly unlikable and unworthy.  It's not the right word exactly but —</p>

<p>ANALYST: What other words come to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, there was another one but I didn't want to use it and now I don't remember what it was.  Maybe it was, unwanted.  (Pause) And that immediately makes me think of the fact that usually I can't stand the thought of having intercourse while I have my period at all.  And I can never believe that MSCZ really wants to when he says he does.  Well, somehow to me, I should think he'd find it disgusting.  (Pause) But also sometimes because I do feel that way and I can use my period as an excuse not to have intercourse, uhm, I'll become much more affectionate toward him and I really feel more affectionate toward him since I am safe.  (Silence) I think that must be partly why I didn't want to even talk about the fact hat I have my period right now, because I thought it would make me seem disgusting to you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which is, it sounds like, really, another way of saying you find it disgusting and you attribute the thought to me or to MSCZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I suppose I do.  (Pause) And I think the reason I do is because I can't stand not to feel clean.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So is that like the word that you couldn't think of, unclean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I hadn't, I hadn't thought of unclean.  Or did you mean, is that like the word, unwanted, that I was —?</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, no.  I just wondered if —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  If that was the word?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Because you seem to be saying that that's what you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it is, I do feel that way and I feel that way right after intercourse, too, very often, (Pause) or just going to the bathroom, I sort of put all those 3 things together.  (Silence) And it, this makes me think of another thing, that, uhm, is sort of all connected.  Since I've been taking birth-control pills, I've had some kind of a discharge.  And I, it has worried me on occasion, although a doctor checked it and it was alright.  But, uhm, I think the real reason that I was disturbed about it is that I can't stand the feeling.  (Pause) And it made me just remember that, uhm, I don't know whether it's connected, why I can't stand all these things but, uhm, some point after I'd had my accident, I think, I had some kind of an infection in my vagina and I had to have, uhm, medicine put in.  I guess, well, my mother had to use some sort of tube and squirt it in.  And I found that extremely unpleasant.  And I guess that's sort of another association on why often I don't like intercourse. (Silence)</p>

<p>And that made me think of, uhm, right after my accident before I got to the hospital, I had, first went to the doctor that was the pediatrician for us and he had to just check and see how much damage had been done.  And, and I just recalled the feeling when he was, I think he was using q-tips or something and the whole thing with that accident, I just can't seem, I don't, I don't think of it very often but if I do, it's just all, or parts of it seem so vivid.  (Pause) And that's just made me wonder, because I was thinking about, uhm, well, the whole feeling that all these things were being done to me and I couldn't protect myself against it and I, it just happens that there's never been any other part of my body that I really hurt badly enough so things were being done over a period of time that I couldn't stop people from doing.  So the feeling all concentrates in that one area.  But I began to think of when I was in the hospital, recovering, I can't remember if I said this, I, for several days was constipated, partly because they wouldn't let me have any bowel movements at first.  And now, I don't, I don't know when I started feeling this way, I can't stand the feeling of not having a bowel movement every day.  And I just, it seems to change my whole attitude about things or I just feel sort of heavy and again unclean, I guess, and uncomfortable anyway.  And I, I don't know, I just somehow can't get going in the day unless I've already had my bowel movement.  And I wonder if it's because of that.  Because I can remember I was in terrific pain and I didn't understand why.  So I was scared then as well as being uncomfortable.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mean, pain —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  In the hospital.</p>

<p>ANALYST: In the abdomen or —?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Pains?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which?  Cramps or —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Well, I had to go badly but at first they wouldn't let me and then, then I couldn't.  (Pause) In fact, after the operation, I don't have any memory of any feeling connected with the operation or, or where I'd hurt myself, it's all concentrated on being constipated, that I, when I think of any pain.  Any pain connected with my accident is all before the operation.  So that I think of, as soon as they let me go to the bathroom, or as soon as I could, then my memory of being in the hospital is a very pleasant one and of feeling good and me—, making new friends and sort of being on vacation from school (pause) and I was just thinking, I don't see how the feeling I have now about being constipated can come from one thing.  And it made me think that my mother has always been very firm in her belief that a person has to get on a schedule and have a bowel movement at the same time every day and that, sort of, there's something unhealthy if you don't.So I know it used to always bother her that my sister, FNA, didn't really need to or want to or anything.  And I remember once, when I was probably in high school, she talked to me about how I should make schedule for myself so I'd be sure to have one every day.  And I sort of laughed at it at the time, but that's exactly what I've done. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think too of something that, uhm, some friends of mine were talking about once.  And they were talking about different kinds of sexual pleasure and that having a bowel movement could be sometimes one of the biggest sexual pleasures.  And I was just sort of horrified at the thought.  And then I realized that there are times when it does feel very good and I can't stand to face that.  Even if I'm all by myself, I sort of want to get it over as fast as I can.  And I think that's, there's something connected with that feeling and feeling of intercourse that makes me sometimes feel very unhappy about intercourse.  I mean, the feeling if I'm enjoying intercourse and then suddenly I'll think of sort of the same feeling, sometimes, as when I'm having a bowel movement.  And then I just, ruins everything.  (Silence) It's almost as if these 3 things that have been on my mind today are all things I look at in, on 2 different levels.  In one way, I think, well, I can sort of stiffen myself up and then be very honest about them and not really be embarrassed.  But on the other hand, they're all things that I'd sort of like to pretend don't really exist or if they do, pretend nobody else knows that they do so that I won't be connected with them in their minds. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think somehow the thought of the actual birth process just came to my mind, somehow that fits in there too in that when I'm looking at women who are pregnant and, on the one hand, feeling sort of envious because having children, I think, is very nice.  But, on the other, I'm sort of amazed that they can do it because I'm thinking of m—, what I think the actual moments of the birth is like and how can they associate themselves with that.  (Pause) And I've often realized I'm very afraid of the birth process and I don't know why, exactly.  I'm not sure if it's because I think it'll be painful or if it's something else or, just that perhaps it's that there'll be other people there, seeing it.  And then I won't be able to disassociate myself from this thing.  (Silence) I began to think of a mother I saw today who is pregnant and I hadn't realized it before.  And for some reason the way her face looks to me is again connected with my feeling well, how can she do this.  Because she ha—, she's sort of a very sweet and gentle looking person and has been, as far as I can tell from my relations with her.  And, I don't know, I just can't believe that somebody who's sort of like that can do it and I guess I think of, if you're going to have a baby you have to kind of, again, have a certain type of control over yourself and sort of pull yourself together and think, even if it's unpleasant, I'll go through it.  Because I guess that's what I think I would have to do with myself.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, I, I think I've often sort of kidded myself, thinking, well, I don't want to become pregnant because I'm afraid of not knowing what to do with myself or what I would do with myself if I weren't working.  But I was just thinking now, even if we had a lot of money and so there was absolutely no reason for me to work and if I were very good at using my own time so I was quite happy about it, I think with these feelings I still wouldn't dare become pregnant.  Because I can imagine myself having a baby but I just, I mean once the baby is there, but I, I just somehow can't put myself with this, with the birth of the baby and can't even imagine it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I can see now what I do is when friends of mine talk about how they felt when they were having children, I, the only things that mean anything to me or the only things I seem to really hear are the, the times when they talk about being uncomfortable or hardly being able to stand it.  And I was thinking of one friend of mine in particular who's had 2 children.  And the first child, the first birth was extremely uncomfortable for her.  And she felt she could never have another one.  But then, and her second child was extremely easy.  In fact, it came so quickly she almost didn't make it into the, ah, delivery room.  And she was very happy about how easy it went and there was just sort of a minimum amount of discomfort.  But I don't really think about the 2nd child and how she described that.  I, all I can think about is the first one.  And it's sort of like with the accident I had too.  I keep wondering why I can't just forget it, that I'm alive and I don't feel these things any longer, and why the feeling, when I do recall it, has to be so intense or why even I recall it at all. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it is sort of like my reaction to having a shot or going to the dentist, that before it happens, I'm very nervous and afraid and so forth.  And then, then it's over and I'm always amazed at how upset I become before it happens when it can be over so quickly.  And when, when it's happening, I can stand it.  And it's sort of the same thing: I don't, I I'm not afraid of dying when I, when having a child so it's not I don't, I'm not afraid of dying when I, when having a child so it's not anything like that.  And since so many people can do it, I, it's not really that I don't believe that I couldn't stand it.  But for some reason, anticipating it is, is just dreadful.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

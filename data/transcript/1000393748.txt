<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I was just thinking about (clears throat) the fact that the, something that happened today — it makes me feel as if it's a repeat of, I think it was last week, because I've still been feeling, off and on getting ready for the exhibition and just the end of the year and so forth, I don't know, s— under a strain or something.  That I'm not, I don't have a good working relationship with FYLR in that I do have to direct her on everything.  And I remember saying this before, that what bothered me was having to direct her on everything.  And today in particular I, I was feeling — because the last 2 days have been very tiring and I was very tired today, and I had to stay for a meeting after 2:30, uhm to meet with an architect who's building a new part of the school, and it might involve the class I'm teaching now.  So, but she didn't have to stay and I, I don't know if I were (sic) angry because I knew she could go and I had to stay or just what.  I don't think it was that.</p>

<p>But anyway, (clears throat) I was just feeling today, all through the day, that the boys have been harder to handle, as they always get in the end in this group in particular, just kind of goes all over the place.  And I, I know, I, I keep thinking I should do things a different way, but somehow what I do is I get more authoritarian without really being, structuring things.  And so I was feeling kind of it's my fault too they're getting this way, but they are this way anyhow.  And then I kept thinking that it would be so nice if I felt more support from her, or just that she'd come up with an idea of something to do or just so I wouldn't feel I had to do it all,all the time.  And in, in part of this was this feeling of having to think of everything and, which I'd been particularly bothered by on Monday and Tuesday, that there was absolutely nothing that she would take over.  Unless I gave her a specific order she wouldn't do it.  And so I had to think of everything in every area, and uhm, I don't know, I got used I guess with FEIZ not to.  And maybe I was, I guess I was feeling somehow the load is unfair or something.</p>

<p>And then today, during the day, we had a visitor who wanted to see one boy and she wanted to talk to me.  It's some kind of a study that the parents have been, been involved in since he was born, and there was just no time today to talk to her until after school.  And I was feeling, always trying to make time to talk to her and under pressure from that, and the, and again just feeling FYLR was not there supporting me or taking over or thinking of things ahead or anything.  So then after school uhm, she did one thing and then she asked what else there was to do and I specifically told her something, I thought quite clearly.  And I had to leave to take the girl out who had been visiting and when I came back FYLR was off visiting in another room, having not done the thing at all.  And actually there wasn't, well, there was time pressure in that the meeting was going to be in our room, but other than that there were things to be done.  But I hadn't, I, I hadn't them (sic) all fixed in my mind,thinking we've got to do this and that, and there's no time.  And so it wasn't that I was feeling at that moment under a time pressure, it was just that I was really annoyed that she hadn't even done that thing I'd asked her to do.</p>

<p>And so I, I really showed my annoyment (sic).  And then I felt awful afterwards thinking that it was so small of me, or I don't know, silly of me to have gotten so annoyed over something little.  I mean, what I actually showed annoyment (sic) over wasn't really what was bothering me.  And I never voice now what really bothers me because, I don't know, after we had that talk sometime in the winter, it was as if I agreed to accept her being less than what I wanted her to be as an assistant.  It was as if I agreed she did have a problem and I hoped she'd do her best rather than it saying how much it bothered me that she was being the way she was.  And so I kind of tracked, trapped myself and now I show my annoyance in things that really aren't the true thing.  And also, when I came in here, I was just remembering the other time and how the feeling I had that week was more the pressures that were on me.  And I was taking it out on FYLR when it wasn't really,well again it was a displaced feeling of anger.  And I, I don't know, I was wondering if it was that again today.</p>

<p>(Pause) But I think, the other thing that keeps coming to my mind when I think of having gotten annoyed at FYLR and, and what — and actually then I tried to apologize.  And I don't know how I said it exactly but it was something like, my patience is short today.  And she immediately, she got very defensive and said, oh now I'm trying patience, as if I'm always complaining about her, which isn't true.  I mean, I might complain here, but I don't complain to her or sometimes FHYZ will say, how are things?  And I might say well, same as ever or something like that.  But it's not as if I'm making a big thing of it.  And so that, so this bothered me.</p>

<p>But then I mainly think of how she did something she often does.  Uhm, I, I had to see FHYZ about the reports, the corrections she had made, and I hadn't had a chance yesterday so this morning I saw her early.  And in talking about some of the changes it involved my being there until quite late.  And so I didn't get up to the room until FYLR had to come down for duty in the room where the boys wait before coming upstairs.  So we — as she was coming out of the elevator I was getting in.  And instead of saying hello or anything, she just kind of casts her eyes aside and walks by as if I had purposely stayed away to avoid her and now she was hurt and she wasn't going to speak to me.  And she's done this a lot.  And I don't know, for some reason today that really annoyed me too.  It's annoyed me before but I felt very exasperated with it today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And somehow I think part of this annoyance is there are things that I want to get done and out of the way, so I'm not having to keep coming back to school for a long time after it's out.  And I pushed myself quite a bit to get through reports and exhibition.  And then I don't know, I got so tired those 2 days that my feeling today was that I just wished like anything I didn't have to be there.  And I just was feeling sort of worn out and as if I can't push myself anymore.  So it's almost as if I were ready to be annoyed at things too.  And I, I keep wondering too if something — I had some vague feeling during the exhibition of — I don't know, now that I know I'm not coming back and even though I'd, I wouldn't be seeing these mothers again, I somehow felt now I'm more part of their group than part of the staff at LKC.  I'm moving out of that and I think I somehow,i don't know, wanted to identify with them more or something.  And it was, there was just something about how I was feeling that was very frustrating and I couldn't quite get my, when I was thinking about it, understand it.  Except it did seem to have something to do with, I don't know, wishing they knew I was pregnant and then I'd be more part of them or something like that.  And I know sometimes now with all these things coming to an end, the last thing being done, I feel really afraid of the end of school.</p>

<p>(2 ½-minute silence) I think I'm still just wanting to feel my annoyment (sic) at FYLR.  And uh, I was thinking this time of the fact that when we were having the meeting FHYZ had selected people who'd either taught kindergarten or were teaching it or were going to next year.  And she didn't ha—, uhm, include FYLR and have in one who had to attend the meeting.  And I felt sort of badly about it because I thought that she might feel left-out or something.  And so I spoke to FHYZ about it and she said well she can stay if she wants, which I said to her.  I said since you're not going to be here next year you don't have to come to this but if you want to you can.  And of course she didn't, and then — but yet I still think she was hurt by not being asked.  But then I think well, but it's been her attitude that caused FHYZ to think not to ask her.  And what I think of immediately on that is, one day getting ready for the exhibition, she said to me, "I don't know why I do all this for these people."  Which is kind of always her attitude and,and then I think why am I trying to save her feelings?  That makes me mad (chuckle).</p>

<p>(2 ½-minute silence) I was thinking of when, I don't know, there's going to be a visitor tomorrow too, a man from the board of health.  And it just struck me that the way I'm thinking now, it seems as if I'm trying to expand school and make it fill my life right at the moment, that it's almost a panic thing of making everything seem like a big job to be done so that I keep thinking I have all these things to do with school.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What are you panicked about?  In other words, what do you feel you're avoiding?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, I think, I, I think back to just this feeling I've had recently as things come to an end, of thinking what will I do when I don't have school?  I mean, even in terms of the summer, I always knew I was going back in the fall so it was a different thing.  Or else I had summer school and — (pause) I guess it's as if I knew no matter how much free time I had and how I used it, that if I were stuck for something to do, I could always do something, if it were the summer, getting ready for school, or during a vacation getting ready for something else.  And I don't know, school just has always been a part of my life in a way.  And now for the first time I — it s the first time I see it as possibly never being part of my life again.</p>

<p>(Silence) And then I, then I just think again of this feeling that was very definitely there today and has been for a while, that I know is part of why the children are reacting the way they are, that I don't want to be there.  And so I'm just going through the motions.  But I'm really not putting my mind to the mood they're in, the kinds of things they'd like to do, except very occasionally and usually it's just sort of fill the space with something.  Or else fill the time with something and —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's what you're doing here, filling the time with school.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Hmm.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What strikes me is that you say the burden of your annoyance with FYLR is repeatedly that she, that you have to tell her,you have to be very direct to keep her on the track.  And what strikes me is that in a sense you're talking and thinking here as though that's what you require.  You see,you told me even Monday that you feel there are certain problems that you are afraid you will just let go and won't work on.  In a sense, by not getting at those, you invite me to have to be as direct with you as you feel you have to be with FYLR — to try to get you involved.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well it is true.  When you said uhm what I was doing here was filling the time with school, I immediately thought of what we were talking about at the very end of Monday, on specifically the thing that made me — I don't, I can't remember how I felt then except now I think of the word — anxious, was this feeling of,i don't know, making my relationship with MSCZ something else, not wanting to admit that it might be dependent on a sexual relationship, thinking there must be another way.  And I don't know, then relating that to what I'd said once about my mother and what she'd done, I felt she'd done.  And yet, when I thought of it after you mentioned that I was filling the time here with school, I thought, I think I was thinking too,i'll be quiet and see what you'll say next.  Which I guess is the attitude that I'm annoyed at so much with FYLR.  I don't want to do more than I have to and so if you don't bring it up maybe I won't have to do anything with it.</p>

<p>(Silence) And then what I begin to wonder is something that I know — well I don't know, I have the feeling it's kind of sidetracking because it's sort of going around in circles.  But I start wondering, am I thinking of my being annoyed at FYLR because I'm aware of feeling that way here and hav—, sharing a feeling I'm annoyed at her for having?  Or am I really annoyed at her?  Or just, I don't know, then I get all twisted-up in wondering what the connection is between what you point out I'm doing and what I say about FYLR.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And that fills more time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  (Silence) At first I thought well maybe what I'm avoiding is talking more about this feeling of what I'm trying to do with MSCZ or maybe I am trying to avoid to some extent.  But then the next thing I thought was that I wonder if what I'm avoiding is saying I wonder if you missed me yesterday.  And that made me think that after the exhibition was over I hadn't thought of not coming here during the exhibition.  But after it was over, I was I don't know, just for a while there it seemed like I was very aware of I hadn't come.  It was as if I were telling myself I didn't go to analysis or this day was different or something.  I don't, it was just sort of — I don't know what feeling exactly to put with it, except it seemed like I wanted to keep thinking about the fact I hadn't come.  I think maybe the feeling was a fear that you might not have missed me, that, and that therefore I should have come because if I don't come you might find you don't miss me.  I think that's been a feeling I've had about missing days at school too.  That it's not so much out of duty as a fear that they might find they get along perfectly well without me, that I feel I have to be there every day.  Or even when friends ask us to do something — and I used to have this feeling much more before — I would be really upset if I had to refuse, I guess partly out of this feeling of they might never ask again because they might find they didn't miss having me not there.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I find I'm just thinking about school again.  And I think almost I was comparing how I reacted to FYLR today when I was feeling sort of ashamed of having lost control the way I did, and then thinking about how FHYZ used to sometimes,because of some feeling of insecurity on her own I always felt, get very annoyed at me at times.  And I was thinking of one particular incident that happened the 2nd year I worked with her.  And uhm we were in another room, but we could hear if our telephone rang in our room, the intercom thing.  We could hear it in this other one and the 3, the teacher from the other room was in there.  There were just 3 of us and we were talking and I was in the middle of something when FHYZ interrupted and said wasn't that our phone.  And I, I said, oh I don't know, I didn't hear.  But she expected me to go running in and answer and it.  I was just feeling annoyed then because she did treat me sort of like a lackey then.  And uhm, I was thinking, if she heard it she could go, so I didn't go and she didn't say go or could you go check or anything.  And she got very annoyed at me in sort of the same way I did today with FYLR.  And when I'm saying this I realize,well maybe I should be wondering more about what I was fearing that made me then react so angrily to her or something.  But I don't know, I just, you know — it's like as if, as you put it, that I want you to keep directing me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you think of somebody telling you to answer the phone right after I tell you what I did.  But you don't go and answer it.  What I mean to say is, you just did right here exactly what you reported with FHYZ.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Is that why I thought of that?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I imagine.</p>

<p>I guess it would because I didn't want to tell that and I don't know why I didn't want to tell it.  (Pause) Then I, then I start thinking about how I'm, I'm just lying here thinking I've got to make myself, I don't know, do, I don't know even what, except do something and thinking of that feeling again I've had in connection with school too, of just that I can't I don't know, it's against what I want, I guess, but I, I just feel I can't keep pushing.  And so all I can think of is: sometimes I know I'll get to a point here that I know I'm sort of fighting something and then I can get myself to stop and I don't know, somehow get started again.  But today I keep thinking or just feeling — when I try to get myself stopped and started again, all I'm aware of is sort of that I've got to make myself do something and, and a feeling then of frustration I guess.  Because I keep thinking I can't and almost panic too about that,that I can't do it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I realize it's, "I can't"  because I don't want to and — (pause) I suppose when I think of my pushing myself — I am pushing myself in a way — but I create something, maybe it's phony, that I want more,that's opposite the feeling of wanting something else which will stop me from doing something.  And, well then I just wonder why don't I want to?  I can't see any reason why I wouldn't want to.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Want to what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I think of it in several ways.  One is to want to stop filling the time with school or all these other things or want to cooperate if it's in terms of here I should be talking about things that are really on my mind, not hiding from them.  Or want to talk about a specific thing and then I think well, I don't know what the specific thing is, except there were things Monday being brought out that I don't return to today.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I, and I, it's almost as if I were thinking, well I won't really talk about this,but (clears throat) I realize I start thinking about on Monday talking about the feeling I had in what I was trying to do with MSCZ.  And you pointed out I'd said that about my mother.  And then I was finding it was very hard to think of it that way that day because I was thinking of my father as being the one who,i don't know, was sort of not interested in sex and my mother was much more, if either of them were.  And you said yes, that's the myth you've been having all along.  And then I keep thinking about that and wondering, just wondering about that.  I suppose wondering if it's really a myth and what makes you think or use that term.</p>

<p>(Silence) And I also think, I was thinking of something that I think I did begin to wonder outside here — of when I was saying I had almost a grim determination that there has to be another way than sex.  Just wondering what makes me feel that way, why I'm afraid to see sex as a way.  And what I thought of then was that if I see sex as a way somehow it means accepting,i don't know, being more submissive, accepting my role as a woman or something.  It all seemed very vague and I didn't understand it and then I start wondering well I wonder about my mother.  And, or I, I guess I have the same answers, but — (pause) and then it's almost as if I don't want to understand.  And that what I just start saying to myself, like today of saying I can't do whatever I should do here,is sort of,i can't understand it.  That's the way I am but I can't understand it, so that I stop trying to figure it out.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
	
<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>Abe Levitsky, PhD, a San Francisco Gestalt therapist and former student of Fritz Perls, MD, the founder of Gestalt therapy, is the therapist in the following transcribed sessions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>August 8, 1963. These are introductory comments for the composite tape recording by Dr. A Levitsky. Patient was an attractive woman of 30, white, married, and had three children; age five, three, and one and a half. Educational level was Bachelor of Fine Arts and her occupation was commercial artist. Family background, parents were divorced when the patient was five years of age. She has a five year younger sister. Father was a traveling salesman. He was vain and immature. Mother seemed bitter, rejecting, volatile and egocentric. Symptoms, patient had anxiety states, phobic fear of driving, mild depersonalization; that is she said, "I have a feeling of artificiality", fears of having leukemia and cancer, hostile fantasies to her children, a degree of sexual frigidity during the past three years. Psychological testing, patient had an I.Q. of 118 with functioning fairly even. There were signs of strong dependent yearnings, envy of the male role, and strivings for masculinity. There was summarization of problems, hostility to the children with efforts to deny it, much tension and anxiety, good creative resources, and resilience. [0:02:04.5]</p>

<p>Patient was referred to the outpatient clinic of the hospital by our psychiatric consultant. It was decided that she should be seen on a twice a week basis. The idea of making a composite tape recording of the case did not develop for some time. The first interview recorded was interview 39. Only some time after that did the idea occur that occasional interviews could be recorded and perhaps worked up into a sort of bird's eye view of the entire case.</p>

<p>A word about the recording technique is important. The patient was simply told that "We frequently record our interviews at the clinic." The microphone was always in view on the desk. The tape recorder was off to a side and covered. It ran so quietly that the patient never knew when she was being recorded and when not. There was thus no reason for coloring material at a given interview because of feelings about being recorded. [0:03:06.5]</p>

<p>In as much as we did not start recording until interview number 39, it seems helpful to make some brief remarks about material in these early interviews. In describing her feelings of artificiality she said, "At times the whole world seems like a strange planet and the things I do are as in a dream." "This applies particularly to acts like combing my hair or brushing my teeth." "I have been discouraged from many a bath by this frightening aspect." Discussing her husband she describes their mutual respect, his many good qualities, his deep affection for her. She was very critical of herself feeling that she was an insufficiently affectionate wife and mother. She particularly felt inhibited in expressing affection "in small ways" towards her husband. Her sexual response to him was poor and she felt that she was sexually exploited by him although she could recognize the irrationality of this attitude. She felt that she wanted to have children "quickly and get if over with". She began to realize how resentful she was towards the children saying, "Those people are the object of my rage." She experienced enormous resentment about being a housewife and felt that she was afraid of going out of her mind. She wanted to scream and cry and do something violent. She experienced acute panic attacks in a variety of social situations and at times would have to leave the room to compose herself. There was a good deal of guilt over premarital sex relations. Also a young man who had been interested in her when she was about 18 became ill and died. His sister maintained that the man died because he was rejected by the patient. She also described sexual advances toward her by her much admired uncle when she was about 12. This uncle was sadistically teasing towards her about her wearing lipstick, high heels, etcetera. The patient felt that she needed to learn to love all over again. She felt she was a stranger in her own body. In an effort to facilitate free association, which she was encouraged to do; her chair was partially averted so that she did not face the examiner. Initially there was a good deal of reluctance on her part to free associate and her manner was somewhat stilted and over controlled. However, she displayed some humorous ways of handling transference feelings bringing in TV flash cards for prompting the actors and informing them there was "one minute to go, 30 seconds to go". [0:05:49.6]</p>

<p>It has been my feeling that the therapy of this patient was conducted under highly favorable circumstances. Although her difficulties were severe, she possessed very considerable resources for coping with them and for getting an objective view of her problems. Despite the ambivalence towards her husband and children, she was always rather convinced of her husband's devotion to her and in many ways got deep satisfaction from the children. She had an active social life, a good many friends, and well liked and respected. [0:06:22.9]</p>

<p>The therapist's cultural background was very similar to that of the patient. Most of the time, I felt very brotherly towards her and felt that I was well tuned in to both her fears and aspirations. My work with her was always a source of deep gratification. Some time after the conclusion of the therapy I was invited to her home for dinner and spent a most enjoyable evening.</p>

<p>A final comment, one's philosophy and technique of psychotherapy is necessarily an intimate part of one's life and point of view. For a number of years I have been concerned with the problem of the superego, its role in psychopathology and the approach to superego problems in psychotherapy. Interestingly enough, while working with this patient, my idea switched from a (inaudible at 0:07:14.0) like belief in rational guilt to an Albert Ellis like belief in the self-punitive and non-constructive nature of rational guilt. Although this change in approach to the patient is not highly discernible in the particularly selections reproduced here, it has affected my technique of psychotherapy quite basically. As a result, my feelings as I review some of the interchanges, is that I would've handled many situations quite differently. Specifically the problem of the punitive superego would have been introduced earlier and would probably have played a far more prominent role in the entire course of the treatment. The patient was seen over a four year period for a total of 332 hours of therapy. Pre and post therapy psychological tests were done and post-therapy tests contain a great many unmistakable signs of character maturation and improved feelings of self-esteem and well being. [0:08:20.5]</p>

<p>This is going to be selection one in the tape recorded case history of therapy with Mrs. H. The first selection comes from interview number 39 which was the first tape recorded interview in this therapeutic process. This will be approximately a five minute selection which occurs after about ten minutes after the beginning of interview number 39.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were at a party the other day and it seems some of the reactions that I had at this party proved that one of my main troubles is that I can't accept the world as it is. Of course, this is a ridiculous thing because you can't change the world. This I know and yet I seem not to be able to accept the status quo. [0:09:35.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well now these thoughts are all jumbled up. It seems to me that too many times in the course of the evening I was aroused to anger temporarily by things that people do and say. And these are not new to me I realized. I never pay much attention to them. What do I want to say here? Oh, the attitude of men toward women for one thing. It seems to me that it's unfair because most men, and this does not include Herb, have the opinion that women are alright in their place. This is what I feel. I'm not sure that this is absolutely true. But they like very much to get away from this if possible and go see a fight, or baseball game, or something like that. In other words, they want to retire to the masculine world and when they feel good and ready they would like to have the company of a woman. And this I have resented before. And that came up once or twice during that party. Of course, there are plenty of men that I do not feel that attitude from but when I meet those that do have that attitude, it annoys me. I think that it happened on one side of the room, all the men were talking about baseball being our fight. All that is, is that Herb because he cares not two hoots about those things. And on the other side the women were all talking about sewing curtains which does interest me. I have some curtains and it looks very nice, and I like to decorate my home. Then it just at the moment struck me as the epitome of the attitude that men have towards women and the result is that women start talking about their daily world and don't include the men in it. It's happened millions of times at parties. I think that's why I used to enjoy our art school parties so much because people could have discussions about anything under the sun in groups of male or female and it didn't matter whether you were male or female. It seems like those discussions are a thing of the past almost except once in a while. [0:12:55.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let's see, men do have their interests because it appears that the woman have theirs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you put it in terms of discrimination.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it's something that I feel as discrimination. Usually it is started by the men I would think, and I'm not sure because I haven't really looked at it that hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you may have felt it pretty hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At times yes. At times it never annoyed as much as others but I remember feeling terrifically at this particular party. [0:13:41.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Section Two, Selection Two is taken from interview number 46 with Mrs. H. and occurs early in the interview. It is about a five minute selection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And somewhere along the line I just realized that of course I love her. There's no reason why I just don't. It's so silly. It's just something that I'm fighting because I feel or have felt, degraded by my position. I was educated along certain lines and I feel that I've been pushed back because I haven't been able to use the talents and so forth. And I was thinking how unjust it was to educate a woman and then put her in a house and then I thought well no it really isn't. Somebody has to take care of the kids. (chuckles) [0:14:49.1]</p>

<p>Well I just was able to convince myself. I had lots and lots of thoughts, which I probably won't think of today, and I felt myself getting more relaxed and more contented. I know that this is not going to make me love my housework because I hate housework and I know that I do. And I don't see anything wrong with it, but I don't think that I'm going to hate it in the same way. I'm not going to like before for instance, feeling like somebody's standing over me with a whip. I might feel like oh this is a horrible job but I'm not going to feel that somebody pushed me there you know. I think in the long run it'll help me and also it'll help me not be so intent about my work and about caring for the kids. If I have any ideas, well ok then I will carry them out. If I feel compelled to do something because it's the thing to do, I don't think I'm going to do it anymore that's all. I really don't. And I haven't. At least it's worked so far. And I just felt awfully good, and I felt like I was going to be able to handle my feelings. When I thought of how much energy I had used in putting myself into a small nervous collapse, which is what I did, I mean I really let myself get into such a (inaudible at 0:16:18.2) my nerves went all to pieces like a rubber band breaking. And when I thought of that, I realized that if I could use that much energy and strength in building myself up into such a nervous state that I might have coming, I might be able to use that same energy in doing something good. And I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I figured that the place to start was in my relations with the children and with Herb and to try to be very proud of everything before I see mine and then to weigh and balance and so forth and act accordingly. And I think that maybe in the long run I will not have to be doing that it'll just come naturally. [0:17:13.0]</p>

<p>And another thing I've noticed is that I haven't felt so artificial. I told Herb last night that for the first time in about a year I felt like something. I felt like it was really me inside my body and not some strange person. I do feel I have more problems though. I don't think I cleared up everything completely. And I find myself trying to push myself into an artificial feeling and then I have to think away from it. But I think I know how to do it now. I think I know what pushes me into those feelings, and I think I'm going to be able to control it though quite where I will hardly ever have them and maybe never, I hope, because they're pretty bad but I'm pretty tired of it. I'm just sick of it, and I don't want to live that way anymore, and I'm not going to if I can help it. I realized that there might be a few things left, well one that pushed me in that direction, at least I think I know what I'm doing now. I see a clear picture of the forces within me and the forces that are outside of me. Of course I'm going to have to learn how to handle my emotions around my mother. I think that� [0:18:51.4]

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE: 
Selection Three is taken from interview number 68 with Mrs. H. This is about a ten minute selection and occurs about midway through the interview.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: The more I think about that I like to feel in control of the situation is what not being in control of things is what sort of puts me off the track. It comes to mind that in many things I do that's true. It's one of the things that actually leads to the artificial feeling. I like to know exactly every move I'm making, and I like to know why, and when I forget. For instance, that I had just crossed the street or if just walked a certain part of the block and was too deep in thought to remember it, it worries me. It worries me to the point of scaring me. In other words, I just don't ever relax and let things� Well I do let things happen quite often but the results upon me is so unbearable sometimes that I think I try to avoid it. I sort of keep a step ahead of myself. So I don't know what would happen if I ever would feel that I had lost control. [0:21:03.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well sometimes I think maybe if I were allowed to let my emotions come to the surface, that I might not be understandable or intelligent. Run. I don't know how to say it. I feel too unleashed inside because there's too many awful things going on. [0:22:34.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like for instance?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I would imagine that one time, not all the time, but sometimes if I would let myself go I would create a scene maybe. Well I'm just not in the habit of saying the first things that comes to my mind. I think I do better here than I do anywhere else. [0:23:17.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, who doesn't? (chuckles) It's not a first thing that comes to mind world we live in but you're not in your living room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And there's no cause here. I said well there's no cause to in either. I don't know now. Sometimes I come close to understanding it myself than I am right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Understanding is not in our program at the moment. [0:24:06.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know what else to say about it really. Well I scared and it's hard enough as it is. If I lost the last bit of control that I have, I might not stay together. It's true also that I have a vivid imagination and most likely those things would not happen. Sometimes, I don't know, as if right now, I feel as if there's nothing for me to say. That's really honest. I feel in order to convey messages to someone else you have to say words and sometimes I'm at a loss. Maybe we should play charades. You get the idea. [0:26:24.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you know what kind of charade you would play?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no. I really don't. Yeah, sure, I might pick up my purse and throw it at you. I might pretend to scream a little bit just to loosen up, maybe do a dance. This is charming isn't it? I hope have a good imagination too. Oh, I hope you don't. I don't know. Any kind of thing may come in my mind. I feel as though I have some pretty wild feelings in me and pretty wild thoughts and it wouldn't be civilized but I'd go. [0:27:50.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you recognize this I'm sure. I'm not asking you to do them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I know you're not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Either am I asking you to do something that I don't think you can do; I think you can. And my point is that as a result, you will have not less control but more control; more natural control not unnatural control. [0:28:20.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only feel that I have unnatural control.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean there's some doubt?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just wanted to you to say it. 
END</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE: 
Selection Four is about a twelve minute selection which occurs at the very end of interview 69.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: For some reason I'm thinking of prejudice now. It's something that I don't like against myself. I don't like someone to show it against me. I really think that more than I ever imagined the fact that I wasn't born a boy it bothered me. If I a year ago someone had mentioned it to me I would've said, "Well why would I want such a thing?" "That's ridiculous." But talking with you and really thinking about it, and you know I think my parents thought on the subject, I think that it has really bothered me so much that I probably couldn't admit. And I would like very, very much not to have such thoughts especially since there's not much anybody can do about it. It seems to me though that somehow the value in life that I've wanted hasn't been compatible with what I really am. I find myself studying people and trying to figure out how other women feel for instance. It seems to me that it's very natural for women to want to be mothers, and really want to keep their house, and really want to please the husband. And I think that some of that is in me too but there is probably also that wants to have nothing to do with that. And I can content myself just so long with the things that seem ordinary to me before I want to go off on a tangent. And it seems to me in a sense I have chosen a normal path of life in actuality. I should be able to be more content with it and sometimes I think I am. Sometimes I think I've reached it. [0:32:45.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are changing the subject.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well taking in fact that I suppose this thing that I found is masculine could be a reenactment because I had a couple of very bad experiences when I was much younger. I was afraid. I don't think that I trust men completely even now though I'm married to one. I feel sometimes that maybe I don't even trust him; his motives for things. I don't trust my own father. [0:34:40.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I haven't trusted him. I don't know him well enough to know whether to trust him or not. But I only know that he did what he pleased and he didn't really care about us. And it seems to me that that is the sort of thing that a man can do and get away with. I realize that that is shaded by my mother's thinking. I think I get the idea now that men just have as much to worry about. It's really not true. I've always been a little bit afraid of men I think. Even now, I think, in spite of my experience with them, I don't speak as freely. I always wondered if a man is thinking of me as a human being or as just the opposite sex. I seem to get the impression that if it weren't for women there wouldn't be any moral (inaudible at 0:37:43.3) as a man. It's funny I sort of put Herb apart from the rest of the male population because to me he seems so different. Maybe that was the only kind of a man I could've married. Even when I was angry with him I would attribute to him some of the lower instincts that I would attribute to all men. [0:38:47.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think this is a good point. I believe that you had the need to idealize a picture of certain men, Herb in particular, and you're reluctant to see him as another man and see him in a sense three dimensionally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three dimensionally. The likelihood is that Herb is like other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He doesn't think so. [0:39:31.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He thinks he's very different from other people and he likes it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's probably a very nice guy but there's no reason to think he's an angle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think that I really do. Not anymore. There was time when I really thought so but I have come down to earth pretty much about that. Yeah, I'm aware of fragments of that ideology that is left over. I mean it just happened to come out pretty strongly. Well I feel that if he weren't as nice as I would like for him to be that I couldn't stand it. [0:40:28.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Our time is up now. 
END</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection Five is a ten minute selection which occurs about ten minutes before the end of interview number 71.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's guess that there is hostility involved now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't understand the whole thing. Hostility against him? Not that I know of. Oh, I see what you mean now. Well I certainly had nothing to gain about him. I guess I felt hostility toward most people that I know at one time or another because I think hostility has been with me for so long that it would be impossible not to think it. I have no reason to be hostile toward him because he was really very nice, and I feel that in spite of the one thing that I didn't appreciate that he did, I think that all the other things were sufficiently good to make up for it. I think that he was so interesting, he could speak on so many subjects; he helped me become interested in a wide variety of things. [0:42:59.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What actually did he do that time you became upset?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think I was about 11, its rather hazy, I was ready to go to bed and he crawled in bed with me and he began to fondle me and I guess it must (inaudible at 0:43:32.2) but I don't remember to much about it except that I was afraid. He never actually tried any sexual acts. I got the impression that he was sort of experimenting which I believe made me angry as well as frightened because I felt as if he was trying to see what would happen to an 11 year old girl if he got her aroused. And I wasn't even sure at that time about the sexual act itself and I couldn't understand exactly what he was doing. I didn't want to cry out because I didn't want to condemn him in front of my aunt. And yet I felt that it wasn't fair. And I didn't know what to do personally to him to get rid of him because I knew that I didn't want him to do what he was doing. [0:44:44.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What association do you have to hill of snow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Winter time and art hill and ice cream. We were always buying ice cream when I was at his house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel now? [0:45:39.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I really don't know. I'm trying not to feel very bad. But it's quite true that there's only way for me to talk about such things and that is for me not to feel when I'm saying them, otherwise you would never hear them. If you go back and become an onlooker, another person talking about myself, then I can say the words. It's better that way because at least by saying them if there is any emotional impact later, then I could feel it when I'm by myself and it's alright. But if I were to let myself feel it as they struck my mind, I don't believe that I could talk here at all. I'd probably just be wasting my time. [0:46:51.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No I think that feelings would be more important to words with�</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection Six and Seven were from interviews number 105 and 116. Unfortunately these tapes have now been misplaced although type scripts are available of them. We proceed with Selection Eight which is about a ten minute selection towards the end of interview number 125.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now the so called of this that you referred to awhile ago you said, "And then for the first time I found out" and it's that material? [0:47:48.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just suddenly couldn't talk about that. I don't understand it at all. I had such a good day Thursday. I helped out down at the shop again and I remember that I even had succeeded in winning my father-in-law over to my side, and I was able to enjoy him briefly. Then I seemed sort of at peace with myself. I think maybe I can tell you. I don't know why it seems so terrible but at that age� Well up until then it seemed to me that I had a long time that I didn't masturbate but at ten, when all this other stuff was going on, I started to do that again. It was at that time that I first discovered the complete relief that you could have from doing that. And I think this is what I'm really worried about the things that I thought about. [0:52:21.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the thoughts and images you had at that time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thoughts about� Actually they're very mild but thoughts about somebody that would love me. Actually I didn't connect sex with men somehow, but I used to think about somebody that would love me and that I could love. And I guess I just didn't think it was possible. [0:53:10.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of an assembly was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you didn't think it was possible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just being me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you thought you were not lovable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was convinced of it. And I think one of the things that makes me furious too is that it's this quality that is most important to being a woman; you have to be lovable.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in what way were you convinced that you were absolutely not lovable? [0:54:13.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well in the first place the playmates that I wasn't interested in wouldn't have anything to do with me. As far as really wanting me for me, I always felt as if they tolerated me. We had a club and it was in my backyard. We collected bugs. We had a mound of earth behind our garage room and we could climb on that mound of earth and get up on top of the roof of the garage and there were all kinds of bugs up there. And we would collect them and put them in jars. We used to enjoy that very much and just climbing up on top of the garage was fun enough. Things like that and going out on Halloween night I remember as being satisfying. But I remember sitting out on the front lawn night after night and this little boy that I would like to have been friends with because he thought I was real, real nice, I was imagining or hoping that he would think this you see. And this little boy used to sing songs to a little girl; that little girl I was telling you about. Using her name in place of Rose Marie and songs like that you know. It used to bother me. I don't know why at that age it should bother me. Certainly I didn't need any man at that age and I sure didn't need him. [0:56:05.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't need a man at that age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perhaps you didn't need a boyfriend or a lover but why do you say you didn't need a man at that age? Didn't you need a father?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess I needed a father at all ages. That was also the time when mother was going with some man and she didn't like him. But she used to say that it was because of us that she didn't get married because she claims we said something against having a stepfather. I don't know what it was. I don't remember a thing about it. Oh, yes that is the man that even now she says that she didn't trust him because she saw the look on his face when he looked at us and she didn't like that. She figured that he was after something as far as Joanne and I were concerned. [0:57:22.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And was this when you were about ten?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And your mother felt that he was not trustworthy because he was after something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she didn't say it then that I can remember but she says it now.</p>

Selection Nine is from interview number 131. This is a ten minute selection that occurs towards the end of the interview.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Produce an artistic effect. I think I worry about the fact that I like the female form to look at better than I like the male form. I think I'm not quite clear as to whether it's ok to feel that way or not. I guess I always have in a way felt that men were a necessary evil. It's something that I was going to have to get used to, and I never really had much chance I guess when I was younger to gradually work up any acquaintanceships with men. I'm sure that my mother didn't help any. So I feel like I'm sort of neither here nor there that I can't quite add two and two. I can't see what I do like and what I don't like. I think that I feel basically quite feminine and yet I'm worried about some of my attitudes. I think I'm ashamed to be too feminine because it might be a strike against me. I feel that I have to be very practical and try to be logical and I'm not. I feel that I am also discriminatory in the fact that I look upon women as illogical just as I feel an awful lot of men do. I think I'm afraid to show wavering except maybe in fun when I am have sort of a frolic with Herb I feel like then it's alright. But generally speaking I like to appear on the reasonable side. I know for a fact, I've felt it for some time, that I have been fighting a losing battle, and I think I would like to abandon the whole thing to stop fighting. And yet I feel that this is sort of a chance. [1:01:27.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You probably say that in the dream. In the dream someone wants you to fence and you don't want to fence.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean I say that I would like to give up the fight that I know I've been having but what I feel it'll be beneficial to go on and fight it sort of orally and will it get it out of my system? I wondered now other women must have some kind of feelings along these lines. I don't think that you can just walk up to a woman and ask them and get a straight answer anymore than you could get a straight answer on such a subject from a man. Nobody really wants to admit what they think. I understand that some men are envious of women. And I guess that a lot of women are as envious of men as I have been. And yet in my acquaintances I would say that no one that I know would actually say that except maybe they would say well when I was a little girl I was tomboy. Now I wasn't a tomboy incidentally. I don't feel I was. [1:03:21.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were saying a moment ago that you were wondering about something but I didn't catch as if you were about to ask a question.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I just wondered if other women have these feelings. I mean is it normal for a woman to feel that she is secondary and maybe want to be first and then look around her and decide this isn't possible and so I'll have to fit into the scheme of things the best way that I can and do my contributing in the best way that I am suited for? Is that how they resolve the feelings that they have about well maybe I should be a boy? It's really the preferred sex. Most parents want to have boys. What I was asking in this instance is, is it normal to start out with the feeling like mine or isn't it and if it is then is it the normal way to be able to work out peacefully or does everybody have to kind of go through a fight? [1:04:42.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very difficult to answer the question in the way that you put the question. Now I have two answers. One is let's go on and see what kind of answer you gradually develop for yourself because you will. My other answer is certainly one thing that is not normal is for a person to feel unloved and unlovable and that her life has to have meaning only as so far as she can catch the man. This is a feeling that you have had for many, many years. [1:05:14.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it hasn't helped I mean catching a man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's two things, I said unloved and unlovable and that has relatively little to do with the sexes. It could have easily happened to a boy as to a girl and it has to do with your appearance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like the feeling that I get when you say that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't mind saying I felt unloved and unlovable but I don't like to hear you say it that's all. When I say it it's as if I'm using it as a complaint against someone and I feel justified in saying it. When you say it, it hurts. It's like a time ago you said my mother's ideas were wacky and if I would say that then I would feel huh, I have a perfect right to say that my mother's ideas are wacky, and they are and I know it. I can prove it. When you said it, it produced an affect in me that I wasn't even able to show. And I said at the time, well I ought to say something to Dr. Levitski (sp?) about feeling that I'm getting but I couldn't because it was strong and it upset me. In fact I wanted to say something. I mean my first reaction was well you can't talk about my mother like that. But I realized well he's not really and so I didn't say anything. [1:07:23.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have learned ways of saying this kind of thing in such a way that you won't feel it. When I say it, you feel it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that makes sense alright and I feel it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have to stop now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you tomorrow afternoon. [1:08:07.4]</p>

<p>END</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>The rest of this side [of the tape] consists of some material which has somehow been copied onto this tape. I haven't been able to identify this interview specifically but it is probably about interview number 116.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think that I just didn't look too hard. I don't know. I couldn't. It had begun to seem to me as if you know seeing this before everything that I was discovering was no good and so I think that I felt so let's see one good thing. [1:09:52.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But who were saying they were no good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well the way he put it I guess it was supposed to have been but it didn't seem that way to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now, let's look very carefully now. Both last time and next to the last time you had mentioned some sexual fantasies of yours right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you labeled them as being kind of awful. You felt that only a rather horrible terrible person could have such fantasies. And what was my response? [1:10:24.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't think of an honest one. I'm going to rest a minute. How could you tell there was something wrong today?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were behaving much differently or rather apparently controlling something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It always fools other people. How come it doesn't fool you? One of these days I'd like to be able to get angry and not go to pieces. [1:12:02.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know you have said some things. Many times you get angry and it's only later that you know it. And as you say the reason for that is that if you do get angry, you might go to pieces.</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>This is side two of the composite tape recording of therapeutic interviews with Mrs. H. Selection Ten is approximately a five minute selection which occurs at the end of interview number 139. This interview was done on February 11, 1958.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I wouldn't want to be any part of that group again. I mean it's a real strange thing. I've got this idea about the way the world is set up and yet as far as I'm concerned I feel that I'm entirely different. That my thoughts are� That makes something else come to mind that I think because I think against what is sort of the conformist way, that makes me abnormal too. I don't know what I mean. [1:13:57.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be different is not to be normal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well in other words now, I am quite aware of the fact that my mother has led me to believe that the ideal situation for a woman is married, stay home with the children, belong to many clubs, keep a lovely house, have a rich husband of course, and just generally have nothing to worry about; that would be it. Complete support physically, morally, mentally, so forth. Then on the other hand comes me, and I think entirely different. Of course she also has these thoughts instilled in me and yet she lived an entirely life herself. She had to work every day and we were left upon the care of a maid, and several aunts, and different people at different times. And she belonged to no club. She always said it was too much trouble and she resented her life. I sort of don't know whether I'm coming or going where it comes to the pattern that I feel that I ought to fit into. [1:15:32.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you're trying to say that you have anxiety about not accepting the conventional pattern.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cause I've accepted it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not in your thinking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No not in my thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your thinking you rebel against it. But I think you're sort of asking yourself whether you have a right to rebel against it, and also whether you have the backbone to rebel against it, and how you want to do it. We've spoken quite a number of times of your feelings about whether or not you stick to your point or defend yourself when there's an argument. And you feel that lots of times you sort of back down. You don't defend yourself in the extent of which you would like to. [1:16:12.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And interestingly enough in the dream that you were telling today, you got concerned about whether you're going to be cut off from therapy; fifty%. Well in other words concerned about being on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay now when one rebels against a conventional pattern, isn't one on one's own? Or when you get into an argument and stick up for yourself you're also on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know something else I'm aware of, I don't know how exactly to tell you the awareness that I have. Well when I was younger, although people used to consider me independent, I always had the feeling that I would like to have somebody to pattern after and somebody that could kind of tell me, "Well look you want to be an artist, here's what you really ought to do." And then maybe let me think about it a while and let me read on it or something and between the two of us, more or less, figure out how is the best way to go about what you want to do. I don't think I really had that because I don't think anybody else in the family actually thought as I did. I don't like to say understood me because it sounds ridiculous. But maybe I really thought that way too. There was no common ground for anybody else and me to talk. And I guess I still want that somehow. I think even though I am supposed to be a mature woman, and know more what I want to do, and how to go about what I want to do, and I really don't, that it bothers me. Well probably I do know what I want to do, but I think I'm a little bit afraid. Well I'd like to have moral support from somebody and I think that in therapy I kind of get that in a lot of things that maybe I wouldn't otherwise. Well I'm thinking specifically about what you told me the other day. Now I considered it. I guess I jumped on it too much. I considered it sort of words to live by when you said, "If you don't try something well you are disgusted with yourself, but if you do try and you fail, you feel melancholy yes but at least you tried." So at least you can feel that you've done something positive. Well as far as I can remember I don't think I really had any conversations like that in my family. I've had conversations with friends in that way and I have conversations with Herb like that but it was good to sort of get a personal approach to a particular kind of a problem that somebody else had experienced and sort of licked and that I was having trouble with.</p>

<p>Even though I shouldn't really have trouble with anything like that, I do and it was good to have this backing so to speak. I mean I feel like I'll never forget that and even though maybe some day I'll feel the opposite, just imagine, I don't see why I would, but let's say I do, still it gives you something to sort of hold on to and it isn't like being dependent. I don't think. It's more of an attitude and that helps you be more independent than dependent. [1:20:51.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well as a matter of fact when I used the term natural history a few moments ago, one of the things that I had in mind I do now bring up is that you didn't have normal opportunities. I've said this on many occasions for guidance, for having a model person whom you could look up to, feel that this was a person you could be proud of, unambivalently love, and this was a person who in a sense was showing you the ropes. No you didn't have that. [1:21:34.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know in a sense I sometimes did like when my aunt would take over and she's a pretty positive person. And she's probably the one person that influenced me to remain conventional. I mean I was living an unconventional life I think with my mother as a pattern. Even though she talked convention it wasn't actually the norm especially I think then because there weren't quite as many women working and I felt sort of at odds with the world because of it. When I would stay with my aunt, she was so positively a good mother and a good housekeeper. She was this club woman type and so forth, and I admired her. She was a happy woman, and she seemed to get places in the world, and had a lot of friends, and so forth. And I think that I had two patterns to go by, and I probably went by both of them. [1:22:35.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About next Tuesday's interview, there is a chance that it'll be necessary for me to have our interview either at 2:30 or 3:00. Now would it be possible for me to phone you on Tuesday morning and tell you about that and would any of those times be convenient to you?</p>

<p>END</p>


<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection Eleven is from interview number 146 with Mrs. H. The original tape recording has been misplaced but a transcript is available. This is about a five minute selection which occurs towards the end of interview 146. [1:23:25.5]</p>

<p>Selection Twelve is about a 15 minute selection which occurs at the end of interview number 148 with Mrs. H.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 1:24:02.7) I am myself more or less. Then at others I sort of close up and I don't know how to describe it. But it's the same thing that happens in my sexual life. Sometimes when Herb touches me I get furious and I feel he has a lot of nerve. And I don't want to have any more to do with him. There's something in me that wants to have nothing to do with a man. Then at other times, as you say, I am playful and I want everything to do with a man. So it isn't very consistent. And the fact that it lasted so long at times, didn't drive out of my mind thoughts that were sort of irresponsible and carefree. I believe the times when I wanted to have least to do actually with Herb that I would go on and have the biggest fantasies about other men that I'd never met; occasionally some that I had met. It really doesn't make sense. [1:25:39.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe it is a kind of irrationality. And seems to me there has to be a connection between your fantasies of being exploited, and mistreated, and humiliated, and the fact that in real life you get so furious when you hear stories that you consider to be exploitation of women by men. [1:26:03.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't understand that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which part don't you understand?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You say there's a connection between my fantasies of being exploited personally and becoming angry when I hear of other men exploiting other women. What connection would that be?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would have to do with the need to have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean that I would have the need to feel exploited?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what� Well that's sort of like having the need to feel sorry for oneself because of something bad that's happening to oneself. Maybe it's sort of like a kid that needs attention that wants to get it at any cost. I know my children do that. I'm not sure I understand exactly why the need is there but I only know that I can think of many instances where I just knew that you couldn't trust most men. [1:28:02.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now it seems to be fairly clear by now that the pattern of suffering is not being confined to sex. As you yourself have said, in a great many connections that you've had the feeling that no one doesn't really live or not really sensitive is one doesn't suffer or if one hasn't suffered. And (inaudible at 1:28:33.3) as you have been able to point out how in many ways you sometimes latch on let's say to a financial crises that developed in the family. Perhaps you react to them in an exaggerated fashion. You've had the feeling that maybe you sort of latch on to the feelings of unreality that you develop that maybe you need them. So this thing seem be going on in a number of spheres in your life. And now it's as if you need men to mistreat you. [1:29:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I want to correct that because it isn't now that I need it, it has been that I have needed it. In fact I had very little of that sort of thing going on in my mind except that which has been stimulated by such conversations that I've told you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the fact that you continue to have the same reaction of fury, anger, suggests in some way the problem still exists.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel as though you've thrown something in my lap now and I don't exactly know what to do with it. So I have a problem of having to suffer, but I've seen this in so many ways so I don't know what to do with it now. I mean I'm not really aware of the fact that I wanted something. It reminds me of this slave in (inaudible at 1:30:34.8) where he kicked the shins of the guy who was trying to help him and he wanted to suffer. I thought of some of the things that we had been talking about here when that happened. And I thought of an aunt of mine, Sarah, who does exactly that almost every day. She wants to suffer. That's my Uncle Harold's wife incidentally. And since he has died leaving her quite well fixed she has dissipated all of her funds by one foolish thing after another in spite of the advice of well-meaning people and has rebuffed every kind of advanced carter to help. This has gone on in my family. I mean I've been a witness to it for a good many years. I have another aunt who's now dead who was the same type of person. She knew what could help her to be better off in her marriage, and so forth, and so on. She had moved to a different city and different state but she did nothing toward correcting the situation. Oh, I can think of a million people in our family practically like that. My sister's one of them; much more severe or at least much more out in the open than I am. [1:31:55.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel that your sister has a need to suffer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you say if you told her you had a need to suffer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would she say if you told her you had a need to suffer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I told her?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. If anyone told her or if anyone told your mother you have a need to suffer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would I do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. What would they say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What would they� Well�</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They'd say you're nuts. I don't have any such need.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know they'd say that. Well I'm not telling you that you're nuts if that's what you're inferring. I'm telling you�</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I find that it's a difficult insight to make sense of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm willing to admit that maybe there is the need there. But I am still not completely aware of when it happens exactly. And I can't understand why people want to do such things. I mean I feel that it's sort of inbred. Perhaps I'm wrong in trying to blame it on something but dog gone there's bound to be something besides just the way that I have thought. I feel that I've been surrounded by it for a long time. [1:33:09.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I feel you have too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel personally that I probably have more sense and sensitivity about it than most of the others that are around me and that I object to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so too. You do object to it. There's a good deal of it in you and the way you have handled it is with sufficient feeling that you don't want this to become a part of you that rather than living that way completely as many of your family, you have developed symptoms.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was that what happened?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe they're better off. I feel like after all of this talk and all these months and everything that I know so much and yet I don't know exactly what to do with it. You don't just say to yourself ok, from now on I'm not going to have any (inaudible at 1:34:43.2). And you don't just say from now on I'm not going to have any of these feelings against men. And from now on I'm going to like all the things that I don't like and probably should like, and I'm going to be happy and so forth. How do you say that? I can't do that. I mean I just feel like it's utterly impossible. [1:35:10.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I don't think you can say that. I don't think anyone can say that. But I can only say that in a rather complex way and in many little ways one learns to make use of this kind of insight. Of course, we don't stop there, and I know a couple ways of which you manifest itself in your daily activities. We also don't understand more of what its doing there, what service, what function. Pardon me.</p>

<p>END</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection Thirteen is about a 12 minute selection which occurs at the end of interview number 165.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems to me I was started out on one thing but ended up on the other. The only light that I feel like that was a true question was put before me that I have feelings that other people wanted me to be something that I wasn't. And maybe I'm intellectualizing a little but I feel that its right enough that maybe in the meanwhile I didn't know really what I was that's all. I think I'm mad about it too and I� [1:37:10.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're damn mad about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know I feel like well in a way it's not right to be mad about it because nobody knew (inaudible at 1:37:19.9). In another sense I feel like well I kind of have the right to be a little bit mad because he wasn't being exposed to that but getting my attitudes. Even though they couldn't help themselves, still I maimed more or less and it hasn't made it very easy for me and I can't help being mad from that angle. I don't feel altogether right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't you feel altogether right? I mean if you were in front of a kid, you say about yourself right now that in some respects you were difficult to like as a child. You would take your dolls and smash their heads together. You would negativistic and this and that. So you were already angry, rebellious, and resentful as a child. Right now as you think about it you can't permit yourself to be angry; to be justified in your feelings of anger. How come? [1:38:29.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why. I really think (inaudible at 1:38:30.0) This is being perfectly going against myself in a way. It's because of Wendy because she will display a lot of things like that and I see my part in these things. I feel that with her possibilities, and with my possibilities, and Herb's that we can help her. But I feel responsible because there's one traumatic experience, and I'm sure that it was traumatic, that she had when she was about three years old on account of me that would definitely have egged this feeling of rebelliousness on in her. And it was because the first extreme neurotic expression that I gave out. I mean most of the neurotic things have been held in but when it came to the children somehow I began to let them out. It was because of that that she suffered, and I feel that ever since then she has suffered a little bit at my hand, and I feel goofy about it. I can't help it. [1:39:51.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it was right after Randy was born and I was completely harassed. I was tired, I was nervous, I was unhappy, and on top of it I was living in this four-room apartment and we didn't have room for anybody. There were three kids and us in four rooms. They were not large rooms you know so we all piled on top of each other and it was a gloomy place, and the neighbors were old, and they didn't understand children, and they were constantly making me nervous about keeping the children quiet. The children were so young I couldn't keep them quiet. I really couldn't. So I was very antagonist toward the neighbors too. I see my part in all of this now but then I felt completely persecuted though and my actions became worse and worse. I mean as far as the children were concerned I just could hardly stand them. [1:40:47.9]</p>

<p>And this one day, it was right after Randy's birth actually, I guess he was about six weeks old, and I wanted to go downtown, and I had to get a whole bunch of things for the family. I hadn't been downtown for months and we needed this stuff. Well in order to do this, because Herb was then still making around $50 a week and then he didn't often cash his checks, I had to leave my children with my cousin. This meant a journey over to her house on foot, which just so happened I didn't have the car that day which wasn't so terrible, but at any rate with three little kids, the oldest three and a half, it wasn't easy either. And I had a whole bunch of junk to carry. Well I had packed up this little stroller that I had with as much stuff as the baby needed for the day; diapers, and canned food, and bottles, and so forth, and so on. There was one bottle though that I was holding in my hand for some reason and� Well first of all I have to tell you that I got the two girls all dressed up, and I was dressing the baby and getting all this junk together, which took about an extra half hour, and it took loads of planning incidentally, I turned around and see the two girls coming in covered from head to toe with mud and there's no time for me to do anything about it because there was something I had to do downtown at a certain time. I don't even remember what it was. Anyway I completely lost my temper. I had never lost it like that before with Wendy in particular. Lori was too little to do anything to. I felt Wendy was the ring leader, and I spanked her harder than I've spanked her in her life. And I screamed at her, and I cried myself sick practically. And it was all in front of her. I just was carrying on something awful. I went to pieces, that was the answer. And then we all sort of grabbed ourselves together, and we started down the stairs and this bottle in my hand broke into 10,000 pieces. And, of course, I was in pieces again myself by this time because I had to clean it up. There was another child upstairs and she might get cut and so forth. [1:43:13.0]</p>

<p>Well by the time I finally got to go downtown, I was really in some state. And that was sort of the beginning. Of this way that I acted to Wendy was sort of the beginning of the unleashing of my cognitive fury and it was against her. It didn't happen often, but I think that she was old enough and I feel so guilty about it. She was old enough to know very much about it because she has mentioned it many times, the day that mommy cried, because it's probably the only day she's ever seen me cry. And I know she was a rebellious child to a point before that but she was much worse after that. I just feel responsible. I feel also that I'm capable of changing some of these feelings but not completely yet because I still have so many things that are bothering me that I lose patience. And I know she loses patience almost as much as I do, and I guess this is really what I'm referring to when I say that I have nothing left over because the other two don't need it nearly as much. They're easier about themselves or worse they don't have the fears that Wendy has. She's sort of an echo of me. I see myself in her all of the time the fears of storms, her fears of dogs, her fears of things happening around. She falls down very frequently; she always did. She's always cutting herself very minorly but nevertheless drawing blood and getting rather hysterical about it. When things bother her she can't sleep well at night sometimes. All these things I understand. I mean I know why, and I know what I have to do, and I don't feel like I have the wherewithal to do it. [1:45:08.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know what you have to do and what is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I have to show her more love. That's what she needs. She's constantly asking me for it. She in fact is very aware of it herself. She says, "I want you to care for me more." "I want you to care more when I fall down." "I want you to care more when something happens to me." But you know I feel like I'm carrying as much as I possibly can. I feel like in some ways that I shouldn't care too much because maybe I'd be doing what my mother does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wondered. You know I must say I don't find that too interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you want to care more for Wendy you would fall into the kind of error you feel your mother made.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no. I don't think she cared too much for us, but I feel that she fussed over us too much. It made us so aware of things that can happen to us physically that it still happens to me. [1:46:17.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that isn't what Wendy's asking for is she?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm saying fuss over me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's asking me to love her more and I'm still not capable of it and I know it. You see I feel that it's easy for me to show enough affection with the other two because they simply don't require it so much. I mean they're very happy with themselves. The little bit that I give them is enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel we have to look more into the relationship between yourself and Wendy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess you're right if I'm going to get a very positive affect from me. (inaudible at 1:47:09.6)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I decided meet Friday at 4:00.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Is that part of the thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [1:47:22.1]</p>

<p>END</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection 14 is about a ten minute interview occurring about in the middle of interview number 194. This was recorded on August 28, 1958.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just worked out so ideally because I don't have to worry if the bus didn't come and take them to my house on time. They're not living with us and that's definitely an advantage. It means I can leave early. I can come home late if I have to. So if I can find the right position now, I've got everything set up for me in a beautiful way. [1:48:14.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You seem to have been rather busy since then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel so original. So now my next step is to try to find something I'm qualified for. I hate to do this but I think probably I'll get something that'll give me return quicker and I really intend to go on record for those commissions and just do that sometimes and see what happens. I know that's not full time. Everything's rolling. By the time I'm 60, who knows, I may be another Ethel Barrymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is the first time that you evidentially have the feeling that one can come to this interview and not just be in a position of taking the lid off the garbage can, huh? [1:49:08.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now that you say it; that's right. I'll tell you the truth I'm a little bit shy, a little bit reticent about telling you these things because I always get the feeling that when I show my true direction in life, if you really put it along side somebody that's straight and narrow, I feel that I don't exactly sound right. That is doesn't exactly sound intelligent. I don't know. I always think that somebody that would want to do the kind of thing that I just did had to have so much on the ball.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Now let's see, where does this idea come from? Because what you're really saying is I am being relatively free, original, not so terribly conventional, I'm kind of having fun, and so I wonder if I should tell Dr. Levitski (sp?) all these things because although on the one hand I feel this is wonderful, on the other hand I'm a little bit fearful that maybe I should still be walking on eggshells. But why do you have the feeling that to be free, and expansive, and original is not quite right? [1:50:40.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Well I think of the term crazy artist first. It's been applied to me for many years from my family. I take some pride incidentally in being original but I get calmed down when I see people around me who live according to their roles. Of course, I imagine a lot of that I think sometimes. I set people in molds just like I expect to set be in a mold too. I actually put you in a mold in a way come to think of it. [1:51:29.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, who is another great mold setter in your life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well watch out how you behave, what you do, what would people think. Let's keep up appearances.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's sort of ambivalent. My mother is funny this way. She enjoys when I do something unusual but she doesn't want anybody to know in the meantime. If it turns out good, fine, but if somebody should happen to look in the window while I'm doing these preparations, she's not so happy about it. My favorite expression is nobody does it so why do it or everybody does it. That's another big one. Still doesn't explain everything; it really doesn't. I lived away from my mother over the years. One of my earliest experiences were for instance, mostly with a maid, with my grandmother, with my aunt and uncle. The one who I did spend the very good part of my youth with my mother but I've had a lot of other influences. And somewhere along the line I guess some of the healthy ones got through. [1:53:11.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you have a good point there. I don't think it does explain everything. I'll tell you what I am most struck by in today's interview. This is the first time in which you permit yourself to be and are comfortable with being charming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I'm glad to hear it. I wasn't thinking about anything like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the first time in which you are really relaxed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I had something good to tell you for a change.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not only that but the way in which you tell it. The way in which you're telling and the way in which you're being, you're saying its fun and fine to be a feminine woman. [1:54:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly it. I'm feeling real good about it. If I weren't what I am, I couldn't have done those things. I feel that way. If I didn't have all these little things in balance, if I didn't have the kind of personality that I have, and if I didn't have the background that I have, and all the feelings that I have, I couldn't have done it. And so therefore, being myself is good. It's very good. But I can't help feeling a little bit uncomfortable in a way because I'm worried about some of the things that have happened. You know where I suddenly wake up to see where I've been sort of fooling myself and all (inaudible at 1:54:59.0) A lot of times I mean I'm quite able to talk myself into being what I'm not. What is it really? Is it really me or what I've talked myself into? It's not what I've talked myself into this time though. It was too sudden and too spontaneous. I didn't even think about it. I just did it. I had no preparation. I didn't think about it all night. I didn't think about it all day. All of the sudden there I was talking you know. I think really best of it is the affect that it's had on the way that I feel about being married and about having Herb for a husband, and not feeling that I am going to be hog tied because it's something that really will round out my life and will help me rather than hurt me; something that's in my favor in other words, instead of a deterrent. And it was an awfully good feeling to be in sympathy with Herb for a change rather than completely antagonistic. You know it is awfully nerve racking when you live in a house with somebody that you're completely antagonized by. I think I'm not over with a lot of things for instance, a lot of the way that I feel about child care. I still can't quite cope with a lot of things in that department. But you know I feel so guilty about those things. Maybe this is another field in which I have no business feeling so guilty. [1:57:51.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>Selection 15 is about a ten minute selection which occurs towards the end of interview number 202. This was recorded on September 30, 1958.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've all this time. It's been ten years I've been living with a man who was quite willing to let me be and do whatever I wanted to be, or can do, and I couldn't even see it. I really couldn't see it. I see myself so differently. I see myself differently from the inside out so to speak. I see myself from the sexual point of view differently. I see myself from the abstract point of view differently. And now the only thing that I lack is the actuality, the work. And now if I can only accomplish that, then I think I won't have worry about any neuroses or anything. I feel that I'll be a person and I won't be afraid either. There's so many things that I could do you know. I'm just talking about little menial things now. So many things around the house for instance, that I'm quite capable of doing and because I think that it is Herb's duty as a man to do them instead, I will wait for him then. I will sit back and wait. [2:00:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think we can see that something else is involved don't you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Involved in your waiting for him to do it. I think it has to do with the fear that you will be or appear unfeminine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I've been too anxious about that you know. Maybe I have always thought that if I appear here in any way masculine, that I was lacking in something. And actually I've always been just as feminine as I have to be. But I have aggression in me and an outgoingness in general, and I have lots of quality about me that make me� Well I have strength and health, and I have a good mind, so I am quite capable. But this isn't like I think I should be; hiding under a barrel or something. Well look at my mother. I see it so easily now that she is that person personified in detail and in great� I mean I don't know how to express it. She is so absolutely feminine and she will not allow herself to be able to pick up a basket. I remember, and she used to rely on me for that, that was another thing. She used to take out her femininity on me making me feel at the same time like her son. And I can remember her saying, "You are taking the place of my son." And at the time she's saying that she's telling me but don't let anybody know it but that you can do these things. [2:01:55.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At the same she's pushing you to go out and get a man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, all these things at once. And after I am her son, I go out and get a man and I'm not going to be his son. I'm going to be his wife. It just doesn't fit. And I guess I've always worried about myself being a little on the masculine side and I wondered is this something that I have to watch out for. Am I destined to be abnormal because of it? I can remember, for instance, thinking that I didn't like the way men looked so very much. There was a certain type of man that I did like the looks of but he wasn't maybe the most masculine kind of man that you think of. I mean maybe a little on the effeminate side as far as masculine beauty is concerned. And that used to disturb me because I thought I actually don't want a man, what I want is a woman. And I used to be jealous I remember of Herb because he could say to me that I was nice looking, that I appealed to him in an attractive way. And I felt that I couldn't say that to him. He's a nice looking man. There's no doubt about it but there was something about it that I couldn't see any beauty in it. The masculine form was sort of spoiled for me. All I saw in it was some kind of a violent attraction but no real beauty. And I felt that I would like to see some beauty in it, and I just couldn't. [2:03:56.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very interesting. I don't understand that yet why you aren't able to see beauty in men.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm able to but not in the men that I've had close contact with. I mean somehow it just hasn't been beautiful that's all. It's been exciting and it's been satisfying but only because of the violence and not because of anything that attracted me� Well how can I say it? Well you know the funny part of it is that I used to see beauty in men at one time. I remember I liked the way that Lenny's face was shaped and I used to enjoy looking at him, his face, and yet I didn't feel that he had a very good body. I mean as far as his physique was concerned, it was not good. But I thought his face was nice and I used to enjoy looking at it. And I can remember a soldier that I used to go out with that I admired because he was tall and very muscular. But if I wager that if either one of them had ever taken off their clothes that I might not have felt that way. It was alright as long as it wasn't right there. But maybe that's what scared me is the proximity. Well maybe the very violence that attracts me repels me too. I mean it's something to be afraid of and at the same time something interesting to be enjoyed. [2:06:20.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the feeling that I have is that for you the idea of violence in your context with men protects you against some underlining fear. So while that you can feel violent, you don't have to have a fear and you can enjoy it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: While I'm feeling violent I don't have to have a fear?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I've heard this kind of thing from many people. They say sometimes I'm anxious and afraid. If I can get angry then the fear dissipates. [2:07:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure if I understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what are you thinking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'm thinking that maybe its just natural. Not the violence, not the fear but maybe I just� Well I know my mother used to always say that men's bodies were ugly. I don't remember whether she always said it or not. She said it in many ways without saying it and she said it directly once when I was about ten and I had asked her about something about a man. And that conversation was the one where she told me that women had lovely bodies, men had ugly ones, and that women were always on the market. And I can remember that feeling I had, on the market, displayed, on the market. You know I think it's remarkable that somehow, somewhere I have seen what is really natural in me and have wanted to try and bring it about. Of course, I haven't been able to but the fact that I've always felt very natural about my sexuality, really I have, and at the same time I felt guilty for feeling my natural side. This feeling of being displayed and being on the market had something to do with the spoiling of the feeling of being natural about everything. I think besides hiding my masculinity I've hidden my femininity too. [2:10:34.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite right. Very good. Which is really what I was kind of implying when I was saying that the violence and the excitement can serve for you to cover up anxiety about being feminine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now when we're talking about feminine, we are not talking are we about something weak and able to be used. We are talking about a female person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. Well that is probably what I was trying to hide because the fragility I have had to make use of many times. I thought that it was absolutely necessary for preservation to make use of it and of course, it's all wet, ridiculous. I can't get over how I could� Well I know how.</p>

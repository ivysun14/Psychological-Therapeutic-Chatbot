<p>PATIENT:  (Sniff, silence)  Well I was remembering, uhm, what I was thinking about yesterday and trying to uhm, I suppose it would really be admit that I do imagine that there is somebody, some woman in your life.  Uhm, and then I immediately thought of BBF uh, and a particular thing today because I think for the first time since I've known her I saw her with her hair down.  Uhm, she has very long hair and always has worn it up.  It's not exactly in a bun, but it's uhm, not really, I don't know, I di—, I was surprised at how long it was.  And I was just thinking about, you know, the, there's just a certain atmosphere about her this year.  In many ways she's the same as before, but she is more relaxed.  And I was thinking she would never have let anybody see her with her hair down last year.  Uhm, I don't know so, I suppose in a way I was thinking just how I feel, I have a better feeling about her this year and, and she's less of a threat to me, I suppose in a way.  Or at least right now I find her less threatening than sometimes I did last year.  Uhm, well I don't know why I think of it, unless somehow, uhm, I mean yesterday I was thinking of fighting all these women and then today I sort of thinking of allying myself with one, in a way, I mean because that's sort of, or accepting a certain kind of partnership or something.  And, an— uhm — (sniff, sniff, pause)</p>

<p>In fact I was just thin—, thinking of another one, I just realized, because uhm, I just started thinking about FYST, the secretary at school, and uhm, I suppose in a way, all fall things have been better between us because I was just determined that I couldn't stand having the same kind of relationship that I had with her last year.  And I realized certain things that I probably have do—, had done to contribute to it and so I was trying not to do them.  Uhm, but today was one, one of the days, and there have been not that many, but one of the few that we've been most relaxed with each other and then I was using the mimeographing machine after school and usually I have no trouble using it, but today I forgot to do one thing when I was uhm, setting it up.  So all the liquid ran all over the place and it happened to run into the inking side of uh, one of the dittos that I hadn't yet run off so that that be—, the ink began to run all over.  It was really a mess.  And FYST was really  nice about helping me.  And so I, again I was thinking about uhm, I don't know, working together with so—, a woman that last year I'd been uhm, well, with FYST last year I was really fighting with her in a way.  It was all kind of undercover but we were very hostile with each other.  And uhm, (sniff, pause) I guess I just don't know why I'm thinking of it in this way today.  Uhm, unless it's sort as if I've decided well I, uhm, I can't have you.  If I think of you having a woman somewhere else, a wife or something like that then, anyway, a woman that you were close to, that would mean then that my fantasies can't come true.  And so then I have to uhm, I don't know if I somehow think I'll, I'll work things out so I get what I want in the end or if it's some sort of a compromise, lining up with women.</p>

<p>But uhm, I mean it makes me think of how, for years, I've you know sort of sought to be with women rather than with men.  At parties I'm only comfortable, I'm getting less this way, but it used to be that I would be horrified if I were, you know, alone in a conversation with a man.  I, I only felt comfortable if women were there or, and I don't think it was totally because I was thinking every man were going to do what I was probably hoping he would do, when you know, attack me or something.  But I really uhm, turned to women or females and away from males.</p>

<p>And uhm, (pause) I don't think this is quite the same thing, but I began to think of the fact that tonight I'm going up to FSO's school for a meeting and I don't know whether it's for parents of all the different classes or just for parents of her class.  Uhm, but we're meeting in her classroom, so as far as I'm concerned, I'll only probably be seeing the parents of her class.  Uhm, and the mother of one of the girls that goes up to school with her asked me a while ago if I were going, and her husband can't go and MSCZ can't go.  Uhm, so she said, "Why don't we go together?" which in a way I liked the idea of because I don't know any of the people at all.  And so in a way I'd feel more comfortable, but on the other hand, this is FNAZ krl, and she's very outgoing and uhm, this is her second child.  Her other one is a lot older so it's been a while since she's had a child at YXB.  But, anyway she's much more at ease in these situations, both because of her personality and then she does already know a number of the, uhm, mothers, and she also goes up there a couple of times a week.  So she's seeing people, and, and uh, you know it would just be more comfortable in any case.  And in a way I'm I'm thinking what will I do if she can't go because I think she's going but her daughter is sick right now, so you know, it might be possible that she can't.  And uhm, then on the other hand I'm feeling well in a way it would be better for me if she couldn't go because I have this feeling that I'll sort of cling to her, hide behind her, or tag along after her.  And uhm, you know, sort of that I won't be myself, and, and you know sort of do things on my own, because she'll be there and it'll be just easier, to follow her.  (Sniff, 2-minute silence, deep breath, 11/4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, I think I, just thinking of a couple of things that just seem so unimportant.  Uhm, I was thinking about, I suppose after mentioning FNAZ krl and I had asked FTM if she had called today because, uhm, when I had spoken to her last, she thought her daughter would go to school today, and she said, "no," she had called the LFM's, because they were the ones taking the children up, which was sensible.  And then I was thinking that I don't know if I've given FTM their telephone number in case she ever had to call them.  So I should do tha—, be sure I do that.  And then i was thinking about, uhm, well I can't, oh I know, that uhm, we were going to be baking some things for a block party uhm, Halloween party this Saturday, and FTM said she'd like to do the baking and was going to do it on Friday night when MSCZ and I were going to be out, and she'll do it with FSO.  And then I was thinking about the fair at her school, FSO's school, which is quite a big thing.  And uhm, they like to get as much help from the mothers as possible, and I really can't do too much because a lot of what they do they do during the school day.  They borrow one of the rooms, I guess, the mothers go there and work.  And then some involve some talents that I don't have and, so, you know, one of the few things that I can do is cook again.  And I, I feel sort of, I guess I'm feeling as if I'm not contributing as much as I should.  Uhm, and I'm thinking about that in part, I guess, because I filled out a form that they gave to everybody, and, and am taking it up tonight, uhm, so it's on mind right now.</p>

<p>But, oh I know, and then I remembered something that I haven't, I didn't remember until now, that uhm, well, it must have som—, I don't know how it fits in, but I mean it's part of this whole problem that I'm having.  Uhm but last night MSCZ wanted to make love and he announced this quite early, you know, by saying his usual way of "Let's go to bed early."  And my feeling was well again I can't say "no" but I don't really feel like it but I don't really have such an intense feeling against it that I can say "no."  Uhm, but it was after that, I don't know whether this would have happened anyway, but I had diarrhea last night.  And we had something for supper that sometimes does, you know, sort of get me inclined to be like that, but, but not really.  I mean I was having it badly enough so my stomach was constantly uhm, working and, and, I had to keep going to the bathroom.  And uhm, I was quite uncomfortable.  So we didn't make love in the end, because I couldn't imagine doing it, feeling the way I did and, and thinking oh, I might have to jump up and go to the bathroom.  But, uhm, I don't know, I did wonder too if given a natural situation I didn't somehow get my body to respond, over respond, because uhm, you know, it, it was sort of, I wasn't thinking well now this meal always makes me a little bit you know, inclined to be, have loose bowels, really is, is what usually happens, and but then it's over.  And uhm, and I did ha—, I don't know whether feeling that I did do that on purpose and therefore I'm feeling guilty, that you know, even though it worked and we didn't make love I'm feeling guilty that I did it, uhm, let myself have diarrhea, or you know somehow, I don't know how I do it, but somehow get my body to respond that way.  Uhm, I just was aware sort of a vague feeling of something at school too, of uhm, well I'm not even sure, except that I know at one point, we, we were supposed to be goin—, making a trip to the store this morning, and then we couldn't have FMF with us in the morning for the most part, because some other teachers were out and, but she could join us near the end so we could make our trip, at the end of the day, but then it had to be rushed because it was a lot less time.  Uhm, and so in a way I was feeling well it's hardly worth this trip also when we got to the store they were, they didn't carry a lot of things we were looking for, uhm, which was a surprise because you would expect them in any store.  But in any case, those two things were making me wonder was it really worth doing it, but on the other hand this was the day I had wanted to do it, and I had planned it so you know it was like I couldn't readjust and do it another day.  Uhm, but then I, I was feeling, FLMZ was talking to somebody after we got back and I was with the children and I had this feeling that she was criticizing the fact that we'd gone, that how could it have been worthwhile, the way we did it?  And, because I was feeling guilty.  (41/2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I, I don't know I mean, it's just I think in a way something to think about other than what I could be thinking about here, but I got onto it, I think, by thinking after uhm, feel—, you know, uhm, thinking about it at the end of the day when I was feeling guilty at school.  Then I was thinking about after school how I had that accident with the machine or, you know, mistake, or whatever you want to call it, and made a, I made quite a mess, and it took me longer to do what I was doing and I didn't get some other things done I had wanted to.  And uhm, but what I was doing was making up one of the sheets I want to use to check on what level various children are on in terms of you know, different activities I'll be doing with them this year.  And uhm, and then I just started thinking about the, the whole thing of what I want to do with the, you know, sort of readiness test that I'm making up.  And uhm, how I'll explain it to them because I want to do it individually, and it means taking them out of a poi—, you know, time when they probably won't like to be taken out.  And, the fact that some of them are being tested by the ERB people and so, you know, it's kind of like a lot of testing all at once, because that's how they'll, I mean it is a test.  In a way it's a test of what level they're on and their uhm, they'll see it very much as a test with, you know, all the feelings of failure and fears of failure and everything, and so how I'll deal with that.  And uhm, (11/2-minute silence, sniff, 2-minute silence, deep breath, pause)</p>

<p>Well, I feel as it I'm just wasting the time here today, because I, I don't know, I just, more things I can't see why I'm bothering to think of it here unless I'm just avoiding thinking about, you know, more things connected with yesterday.  And uhm, because I, I mean I don't even remember what some of them are now, but I know one was that next uhm, Thursday, to tomorrow I</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So, so why do you think you are then?  Thinking about these things that you regard as trivial?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I just have this feeling that I'm, I don't, it's almost like well, I, I can't even uhm, at first I was going to say because if I continue thinking the way I did yesterday then it'll sort of you know, ruin the fantasies that I've been having about you, because it means thinking more about if you have a wife and uhm, or at least a woman somewhere in your life that's important to you.  And uhm, my fantasies are based on the fact that you are available to me.  But then I, I stopped because I didn't feel that was quite it either, and then I thought well maybe the whole thing of, if I think anything at all, no matter what it is, it'll get me that much closer to being ready to be finished.  And uhm, (pause) I don't know that seems more likely, but — (pause)</p>

<p>Well, I just thought of another thing, that in talking about last night I didn't say this, I didn't really even think it, and I haven't consciously thought it today, but it must be very much on my mind because I know once I get home after the meeting tonight it will be.  Uhm, but when I had the diarrhea last night I as— and asked MSCZ if he would mind if we did not make love because he was still thinking well we could go ahead and make love.  And he probably was in part believing I had created the whole situation.  Uhm, (clears throat) but in any case, I asked if he would mind waiting until tonight, and I think I was feeling very much I just have to put it off.  Uhm, and so now I anticipate my attitude tonight will be well I, you know, it's sort of like a promise that I have to keep.  And uhm, the whole feeling that I had with him, I guess was Saturday, is not there.  It wasn't there Saturday at the beginning either.  But uhm, you know I don't have this feeling that it could be there or will be there.  And uhm, I don't know if it's affecting what I'm doing here except I know, I think I very much have the feeling I don't want to think about it until, I mean if it's something I have to do I'm not going to to think about it until I have to do it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, what do you mean "you don't know" if that's affecting what you're thinking here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I don't know somehow I separate you know, that kind of an attitude toward MSCZ, uhm, and my feelings about you, even though I can see how well, I don't know I, well, I mean sometimes I can see how you come between us, or, or having these fantasies about you come between us.  Or, I don't know, I just still get everything, you know, I can mix it up, or keep it vague.  And uhm, and somehow to me right now it seems like it's two separate things.  (silence)  I mean I don't know, but then thinking about it I can see one feeling I would have is that if I, uhm, think about anything here that helps me be able to approach making love with MSCZ tonight, wanting to more than I do right now, or you know, feeling more receptive or something, more loving, whatever, just, you know, having a better attitude about it, then it would mean moving away from you.  And so I can see in that way I've just you know, tried not to think about anything so I can keep the same feeling about you because then I'm trying to keep a distance with MSCZ.  And uhm, it's as if I want to keep this feeling that I have right now about making love with him.  (31/4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, I started thinking about this meeting tonight and the fact that I feel as if I'm going alone and that I won't be going with MSCZ which I would prefer.  Uhm, and just because even though MSCZ kept saying, "well you've gone as a teacher so many times, why are you feeling at all uneasy?" and it's just that it's different.  And uhm, I don't know quite how they're running these.  And but then I was just thinking well in a way though I feel, I know myself well enough now so I don't think I would really be uhm, that disturbed by it.  I mean, you know one thing that bothers me is that I won't know anybody and if they have it in sort of a free-form thing where everybody is just milling around talking I'll feel uncomfortable.  (clears throat)  But uhm, I don't know somehow I feel well at least for here that I'm using it to think about it, and not really as concerned about, I'm not feeling completely comfortable, but on the other hand I'm not as concerned about, I'm not feeling completely comfortable, but on the other hand I'm not as concerned as I might have been a couple of years ago.  And uhm,</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, and uhm, it's also striking that you're not at all disturbed about the distance you feel from MSCZ and that you anticipate feeling tonight.  You don't want to have intercourse.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That doesn't trouble you at all.  In fact, you like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah I, I think I was, I thought something, it must have been that, because I was thinking I can't imagine, uhm, because as I said I didn't feel that way initially Saturday, but I was in the kind of state of mind or feeling or whatever so that it, it did bother me that I wasn't feeling that way.  And it occurred to me that tonight it just isn't going to bother me.  Uhm, so that, that's one reason I can't imagine being able to respond, because I can't imagine even being bothered enough so we talk about it or something happens so that then I can respond.  And uhm, and then I thought, I think when I thought that, and I uhm, well, I don't know why I didn't say it when I was thinking it, but I thought then well maybe it was because it was Saturday that I was able to care, and I wasn't going to see you the next day, so you were more distant.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   When did you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, just a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you didn't say.  Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) I'm not sure whether I was thinking it as I was saying something else or you know if I just I mean, I clearly, I thought of it in a way that I'd either thought I'd well I'd hadn't really, I don't understand the point of this.  I don't know, I mean I just, I didn't even think well I'm not saying it.  I sometimes I think something and then I am aware that I'm not saying it, but uhm, (pause) I don't know, there's something else that I was just thinking, and it seemed to me the way I thought of that, well it wasn't exactly similar because I know I was quiet after it, thinking it, at some point where as this I've been talking while it's been on my mind, but uhm, when I said that it seemed to me that the reason I was able to respond to MSCZ Saturday was because I didn't, wouldn't see you Sunday, but that I'll see you tomorrow.  And then I immediately started thinking about the fact that tomorrow when I plan to go shopping, I have had this feeling today, I, I feel in a way I don't want to do that, but there are some things I have to shop for and it's better for me to do it then than on a Saturday because I often have FSO and it's not a good thing to have to do that much with her.  And uhm, and then I, it just occurred to me, when I was just talking about this attitude toward MSCZ that it's almost as if my feeling about tomorrow is that I will have left school, I won't be going home, and I'll be just marking time until I come here.  And that I don't think of it as having the opportunity to now go shopping for some of the, a lot of little things that I need, uhm, personal items and stuff like that.  That uhm, you know, it's just sort of I have to get them, there's no fun in getting them, but on the other hand it's nothing difficult, there's no real choosing.  But that I have this feeling that once I'm out of school, and I'm not going home, that it'll really be, you know, feeling well I've just got to be doing something until I come here.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, time's up.</p>

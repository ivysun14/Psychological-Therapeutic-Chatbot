<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence)  I was just thinking about how I was feeling today, and how in—, I guess in many ways it was similar to the way I was feeling yesterday, except yesterday I'd already planned to do something that got me out of the house, and once I'd made myself do it I—.  Well, I was busy so I didn't think about feeling that way, but today I could have done things around home.  I mean there were many things I could have done, but I just felt as if somehow I were saving my energy for something, and I'm not sure whether it was for coming here.  And I keep thinking that the things that I'm talking about here this week are things I feel on the surface as if I want to talk about them.  But there's something, I know, bothering me about it all underneath.</p>

<p>And then the other thing that I kept thinking, well, maybe this is part of it, although yesterday I was feeling this way and we didn't have this to do last night, was, uhm.  Tonight we're going to the house of a couple that—, I've spoken to them before.  I don't know how much I really like going, and I don't really know—.  I like the fellow I think pretty much.  I don't like his wife, and I always feel uneasy, as if somehow I'm on trial and I'm not doing very well.  And I've always had this problem, and I think this is the way I've spoken of it before, too, of just feeling well I can be myself because—.  I think part of it is—, well, I know she in particular sees things differently than I do and values things differently.  And I somehow I think I'm feeling always I have to hide that.  And it's always sort of a strain to go.  I think I go more because if I ever say to MSCZ, "Well, why, why do we continue to see them?" he keeps saying, "Well, I really do enjoy him, and why not?"  And—.  (pause)</p>

<p> But I also found that (sniff) usually if I'm feeling that way I can very happily stay home and read and sort of (sniff) escape all the feelings, forget about them, put them out of my mind until I actually have to face up to them.  And that was what I wanted to do today except I found that I couldn't.  I kept trying to read and then I'd read for a while and then I'd be feeling that wasn't satisfying me.  I really wanted to be doing something, but I couldn't—.  But I wanted to be doing something that I wanted to do, and I couldn't seem to concentrate to do anything that I wanted to do, I mean to even think about what I might want to do is—.  Because I essentially didn't want to think and—.</p>

<p>I don't know whether this has anything to do with it either, but at some point, uhm, I don't know when it was either.  It, it just—, today I knew I'd remembered and I don't know whether I'd remembered it this morning or last night.  I remembered a little bit of what I'd forgotten yesterday when I was here.  Not—, I didn't remember the dream itself but I remembered some of the thoughts I had after the dream that the dream seemed to stimulate.  And they were sort of based on what I'd thought of before which I'd told you about, feeling again that feeling that I didn't need MSCZ's penis because I already had what I needed.  Uhm, I started thinking about how so many times the pattern would take place of my refusing him or rejecting him, or showing hesitance or doing something so that then he would withdraw.  And then I would want him, and it—.  I don't know—.  I can't remember exactly what seemed to be true about this, except somehow I wanted to feel I didn't need his penis or—.   I mean it wasn't—, well, I think that was it more than feeling I wanted to have the power to reject it, because I never have enjoyed that, but I wanted to feel I didn't need it in any case.  But I also wanted to feel it was there in case I needed it, and as soon as MSCZ would withdraw his advances, which is in sense draw—, withdrawing his penis then I would feel differently.  (pause)</p>

<p>And also that, well, 2 other things come to mind.  One is that maybe this is another part of what I didn't want to think about, because I didn't do more than keep recalling this thought, which was I don't know, I sort of had it at the end yesterday and then as I left.  It was sort of forming right before the time was up, but—.  Well, I can't even remember what I was saying, so it might have even been said already.  In a way probably it has, but I guess I was just thinking that in connecting the fact that I can't express feelings that are, I don't know what else to use but pleasurable to me, feelings that make me happy, to the feeling of sexual reaction to my father or my brother.  My father probably basically.  And I was just thinking that, I don't know, you kind of generalize then and get a feeling that you can't—, that that was a pleasant feeling.  And if you start expressing pres—, pleasant feelings, that kind of feeling could come out without you being aware.  Because I, I guess I just keep being struck by something that's so obvious, that I have no trouble at all expressing unpleasant feelings.  Well, that's not entirely true though.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I think the way I'm thinking of it as not entirely true is that if I'm feeling angry directly at a person who dir—, right there or if I'm feeling dislike in connection with a person, I don't like to express it.  But then I find other ways.  (pause)</p>

<p> The other thing I keep thinking of is that while I was talking yesterday, and I—, and I don't know, I can't recall now exactly what I was saying except I remember that feeling of frustration and (deep breath) well mixed feelings of what I wanted and, and yet one feeling I felt very strongly was that I didn't want to keep having this relationship with MSCZ and I—.  I keep saying it, but then I keep doing things that maintain it.  Anyway, then I kept thinking what I'd like to do is just go home and have intercourse with MSCZ right away, as soon as he got home, sort of—.  I don't know, somehow that would satisfy me and make up for things or—.  And it was odd because, well, then I continued to feel this way.  He came home and he wanted to go running.  So we certainly didn't—, I didn't carry out that little idea.</p>

<p>But then later in the evening the idea was still in my mind enough, and my reaction to it was such that I wanted reach out to him and get some kind of communication.  And yet it was—, it was a consider—, I don't know, a considerate thing I guess.  I don't know how to put it except it—.  It seems too strong to say there was something desperate on my part, too, but—.  Well, I don't know.  All I know is that I needed to be able to do that, and we did have intercourse and, uhm, I was glad I had—, I initiated it really and—.  I don't know, I was glad it happened.  I didn't again feel that involved myself except that I was glad we were having intercourse and—.  It somehow made me feel better.  I don't—.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about a feeling that I was feeling right now that—, well, it seems part of what I was feeling all today except when I was in my own house and around my own things.  Somehow I could, I don't know, dull the edge of that feeling or not quite admit it or put it out of my mind or something.  But I was just thinking first about how yesterday seemed so, in a way, unclear to me.  In a way it isn't at all.  In a way I know what I talked about.  But in a way I don't.  I get very confused over ideas and—, or feelings.  Or I don't know, just feeling generally confused and—.  And the feeling was just as if—, well, sort of that I was lost and paralyzed, just out in the open alone and—.  As if I didn't know where to go and I didn't want to—, couldn't figure out where to go that—, it was on—.  And my mind was paralyzed more than my body.  (7-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't—, I—, what I've just been thinking is—, I don't know, barely thinking, is sort of recalling feelings and— (deep breath).  All because of—, eh, what it made me start thinking this way was when I was aware that the thing I didn't think would happen, I said first, and then I said, or that you would say something.  You would help me and—.  I don't know.  First I just became aware of the fact that probably I'm playing some kind of a game now, too, or was when I came in.  And then I—, I think I began to wonder well is it just I'm again sitting back and waiting for you to say something and then everything will be alright, which I think sometimes I've felt that way and—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, I don't know, but somehow there's something about my thinking, or my wanting to come here because I think hearing your ideas will help me, but I find very hard, hard to handle and I don't—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, it just strikes me somehow that I want to come here and not ask for your help, but then if you give it and it works, that's alright then I'll—, I can go away.  If I didn't get it or something didn't work, I don't know, I can just always think well I wasn't asking for it.</p>

<p>Well, that just—, saying that just makes me think of what we were saying yesterday about this feeling I have of not wanting to need anyone or anything.  That everything I need, I have.  And by saying that I come because I'm looking for your help is saying I need your help, and I don't think I really want to say that, or think it.  (pause)</p>

<p> And I think—, I think yesterday after I left here, I had some thoughts about something that I'd brought up earlier when I was talking about wondering how you know when you don't need to come anymore for analysis.  And I was thinking of MSCZ, at that time, too.  But this time, I don't know, there was a s_ s_ sort of feeling that in a way you might get to a point where you don't need somebody so much but that, in a way, always need somebody like this, the way I'm needing you and—.  It was—, I didn't like that thought at all.  (silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking, too, that even with MSCZ I can rarely feel that way strongly enough for long enough to express it, to him and—.  I think, eh, it's generally if I do it's—, and, eh, I mean he doesn't do—.  He hasn't been doing this lately.  It was at times when he was threatening leaving me, and then I'd suddenly be pleading that I needed him, but in a different way then, too.  It wasn't—.  It was admitting a need of him, but not in a way I want to feel I need him.  And somehow I think that was part of the feeling I had here yesterday when I was thinking about having intercourse with him.  And then when I got home, it was al—.  It was if I wanted to experience needing him, but yet—.  It wasn't a full experience anyway.  I don't know, it was sort of but— (sniff).  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  When you're thinking about, uh, needing me, what—, what other form does that take?  I mean like coming to see me indefinitely, or that sort of thing, or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause) I don't think it quite does, because well, I mean I can't—.  Well, in a way I could imagine coming indefinitely, simply because of the way I'm feeling that I'm certainly not ready not to come so—.  And, and I can't foresee when I would be or how I'll know, or I mean it's just—.  But on the—, but in another way it isn't—.  I mean I assume that eventually I will know and won't need to come in the same way I do now, but it was—.  So it wasn't that exactly of, of specifically coming here to do this but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Well, it's odd. I can't—.  I don't know.  It had something to do with feeling that—.  Well, I think of this word which I don't like now, because usually it means something, something else to me that is sort of a negative thing.  But I think I was thinking that eventually I'll be strong enough so I won't need to come, but that doesn't mean I won't keep needing to some extent the kind of help you give me.  And I—, I don't know if that makes it any clearer.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe instead of strong enough I should say that I'll know myself better but—.  I think maybe part of—, when I th—, try to imagine when I stop coming that bothers me and I think maybe part of this, although I wasn't consciously thinking it.  It just strikes me now is, uhm, I don't know, that somehow I can slip back, backwards and get back to a lot of habits of thinking and reacting that I'm trying to get out of (hesitates) and that your helping me to see things more clearly or, I don't know, to know myself better is getting me out of.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, if you see me that way, you know as trying to help you get to know yourself better, then how do you account for the kind of reluctance or resistance you hinted at the beginning today and that you feel somewhat and that must be connected with your forgetting things like the dream yesterday and so on?  And another instance, for example, of not thinking about, uh, or not recalling what we were saying right at the end yesterday?  But how do you account for that feeling you want my kind of help at the same time? (pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, all I think is that I'm very aware that—, of another feeling I have, which is more familiar to me and much stronger, is that I want to feel I don't need anyone.  And well I think of MSCZ more than of you here because the kind of need I'd have with MSCZ is, uh, I don't know, a longer lasting one.  And I'm always trying to think what will I do if he dies suddenly or something ha—, to prepare myself so I'm ready so I won't be helpless, so I won't really—.  I don't know, so that it's almost as if I'll never let myself really need him, because someday he might not be there.  (pause)</p>

<p> And I was just thinking again, the fact that when I was thinking about needing you and that wouldn't really end even though I might end needing analysis.  And I wasn't thinking beyond that particularly.  I mean I wasn't thinking that very deeply or, or in detail at all.  But I think just the thought that there'd be some kind of vague need was frightening to me.  (pause)</p>

<p>And again having money, earning money is part of the not needing anyone or just having a job or—. I mean it never—, I never was that terribly concerned about what I earned because I could have worked in different situations and earned a lot more.  But it was somehow having a job and knowing I was earning enough so I could live.  I wasn't dependent on MSCZ.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it just—, I just want to know—.  I was thinking about because this would play into my thoughts when I was trying to handle the idea of MSCZ and my separating or divorcing.  Because there was a point there where—.  Well, first with MSCZ it was very much in his mind.  And then I think the way I handled it was to think that I can't stay married to MSCZ just because I'm afraid of being alone or divorcing him or, or being separated.  That I can't need him in that way, so that that's what's keeping me with him.  I don't know, I thought at the time I was, well—.  At first the idea absolutely panicked me so I thought somehow I was getting stronger about it and being, well, I don't know how to put it.  But now it just seems to me that it, it's—.  It was all part of this feeling that I don't want to need anybody.  (pause)</p>

<p> Well, maybe it did help because I was just thinking that I did feel eventually, which I hadn't felt at first, that I could—, I mean I could live.  I didn't need MSCZ to live, to survive.  But then the feeling I had, which I think made me begin to try harder to change things so that it wouldn't end up in divorce, was that I needed him to be happy, or I did need him in some way.  Except I wouldn't—, I wouldn't think so specifically about it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I haven't gotten very far with this thought either, but I think it was occurring to me earlier, too.  And first I just sort of thought about how I've been spending my time this summer.  And the feelings I've had each day aren't always as intense as like they were today, but yet they're s—, it's all part of the same thing I think.  And how little I've seen of different people.  Some have been away a lot so I haven't seen them.  But even if they were around I wouldn't have seen them unless they made a lot of attempts and—.  I don't know, I just—.  It seems all part of trying to be self-sufficient and not needing anyone, and yet I keep getting this feeling I'm trapping myse—, or I'm already in a trap.  And I don't want to be in this trap, except I keep putting myself in it because I want to z____, I seem to still want to feel that I don't need anyone, which is exactly what puts me there.  (pause)</p>

<p> And also I was just think—, it's sort of like what I was saying about wanting your help.  I mean really needing it except not wanting to do anything open about letting you know that's the way I'm feeling.  And if you happen to offer it, well then—, then I'm lucky or something like that.  And it's sort of that—, that's the way I'm with—.  Well, it's about—, it's probably with a lot of things, but I'm thinking of just people now.  And this feeling of not wanting to need people, or not, I don't know, not reaching out to them, waiting for them to reach out to me.  But yet I do need them.  If they don't reach to me I think it leaves me feeling, I don't know exactly how because I kind of cut off feeling but—.  I don't know I just—, I just am thinking that there are so many ways I am dependent on people.  And I mean this fear of their opinion and what they're thinking and my fear of not being myself. And I can't think why I'd fear that except that I'll do something if I'm myself that will antagonize them, or drive them off, and, and that I really do need them.  But yet on the on the other hand I'm not admitting it and I'm not doing anything according to that need, except in this very negative way.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

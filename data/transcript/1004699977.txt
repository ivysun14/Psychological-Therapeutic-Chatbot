<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see what our regular time this week and I should know by then what my deal would be. [inaudible at 00:00:05] Friday. Great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yes that's fine. No problem. Fridays are usually slow and so if I have anything where I can't make it on Friday...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll be aware (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we'll change it up. Great. Where to start? Okay so [inaudible at 00:00:24] moved out. I helped him way more than I should've and that he deserved but I think I helped him buy stuff, helped him set his little shit up, help him schlep all the crap, all this stuff right? He—I think I kind of felt like if I just help get him all set up and as comfortable as humanly possible maybe he'll be able to give me a little bit of space. But all my friends were saying I can't believe you helped him out. I don't know, they can't—they couldn't really understand it. Of course, they're like—my mom came over on—so we moved basically Saturday, we moved him and set up his little thing the last weekend, [inaudible at 00:01:08], a week ago, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday's [inaudible at 00:01:10]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And so my mom came over Sunday. I went out with her on Saturday night to a party, which was fun, I guess, I don't know. I got drunk but maybe I needed to. And then Sunday my mom came over in the afternoon to kind of help me set some things up and there was still a huge mess left from his shit. He didn't really organize it, he didn't really—he left a lot of trash and shit, left a lot of stuff still in drawers as opposed to putting them in the closet like he was supposed to do. And so my mom kept going on like he shouldn't be doing this, why did he leave you with all this shit. And when I think about it, it is kind of fucking obnoxious. It was almost as if well I'm the one that's, again, he is such a martyr. Everything is so horrible for him so for you to clean up this you shouldn't have to complain. Whatever. I wouldn't have even brought it up. </p>

<p>But it felt kind of good to just go through things and get his stuff all in one place and purged of trash and other crap. So I spent the weekend just moving and trying to organize stuff. I met the roommate on Monday of last week and—was that Labor Day? God yes. [00:02:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Last, oh last Monday was Labor Day. Yes, you're right. Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And met her, she's nice, gave me the check for the rent and stuff. And then I took Wednesday—I—I mean I could've been a mess because I've been non-stop and I literally been doing everything for the house, the cottage, [inaudible at 00:02:44], getting stuff ready for the roommate to move in, all the work, and I haven't really done anything for me. I took Wednesday off to finish my organizing and stuff and go get my nails done and take some time for myself, which was really nice. </p>

<p>And then she moved in on Wednesday night without suitcases, like a sleeping bag, and I said do you want to use my air mattress and so she said hello, whatever, and that was nice of me. But again I'm always doing stuff—like I'm literally—I can't—I really—and I literally thought about him a thousand times last week. I mean I guess I was kind of missing him, but also he's really acting like depressed, putting on Facebook anyone want to get dinner? Oh, this house is so dirty, I had to clean the whole house because they're slobs and all this stuff. Then I ended up having to take care of him. Okay, so then in a weak moment...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Actually you don't have to take care of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but I end up feeling like I have to—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I have to take it. It's so engrained that I feel like—well anyway. And in a weak moment I said do you want to come into Chicago with me this weekend because I want you to meet my goddaughter and stuff, because I was going up to see her so I could finally hold her because I didn't get to hold when I first saw her because she in the NICU (ph) and all this stuff. And I was kind of like shit. And he started asking all this stuff like I can't really a vacation [00:04:13]. I didn't want it—I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. [00:04:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. That's helpful. So then on Friday, at work, we're G-timing (ph) and I'm saying to him how—he—first thing in the morning he messages me, so can I ask you a question? I said sure. He said do you feel like we're slowly coming to an end? And so I message back, I said I hope not; I'd really like to work on things but this time is definitely needed to figure some things out. I tried to say it in a neutral way that wasn't promising anything but wasn't necessary like yes, this is how you [inaudible] to not be dramatic. Why are you asking me this first thing in the morning on Friday after the hardest week in my life? Are you fucking kidding me? It's just so typical in terms of the self-servingness that's he's been kind of doing this whole thing. It's all about him, it feels like.</p>

<p>So, okay that happened. Then we were g-timing (ph) and I don't remember how this came up but I was saying how I just feel between the move and between Mindy coming and moving in and all this stuff and work being so busy, I feel like I haven't really had a moment's time to absorb how I feel about things, how I feel about being alone in the house now without you, how I feel—how I want to think about things. And his reaction was, yes, well maybe I shouldn't come to Chicago and I'll just stay home and I can feed the cat because I was paying Jules (ph) to do it—the cat sitter that we hired—and maybe I should also stay away a little bit more. [00:06:02]</p>

<p>And so my reaction at this point to that statement is okay because I just don't have the energy. Okay, if that's how you're going to respond to me saying something about how feel and what I need by just saying that then okay. </p>

<p>So later that night I messaged him about, I don't remember. He was complaining about having—maybe I shouldn't go to practice because then I don't have a washing machine any more so my clothes will just get all mildewed and I really won't have to wash them in the shower and then lay them out. So he's complaining. So I'm whatever. I said well at least come and keep me company. If you want to do laundry you're welcome to. And he says oh so you're sticking with that, huh? And then I said I'm confused, what are you talking about? He says well you know that I'm not going to come to Chicago. You're just sticking with that. And I said you said you shouldn't come to Chicago and that you would stay home and feed the cats. What am I a mind reader here? </p>

<p>And so then later that night he calls me and so I said hi and so come to Chicago then. I said okay, fine, whatever. That would be all right. You said it just—I can't even deal with [inaudible at 00:07:20] nursery. Now I just thought I don't feel like even fighting anything. It's so absurd. I really should be putting my foot down more but I'm not and I'm in this awful cycle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of curious. I mean I wonder what keeps you from putting your foot down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: His overly dramatic and self-serving reaction, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't think so? What do you think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, these aren't helping clearly but there's something going on with you, too. I mean you could not have invited him to Chicago, you could say you can take it back. I mean change your mind, don't think it's a good idea, it's not going to work for me. Or when he says oh so you're sticking with that you could say yes. [00:08:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like he demonizes me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder why you care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do too. So when I—about the whole Chicago thing, I would say how come, if you still wanted to go to Chicago and you're telling me, you're acting like I'm a mean person for accepting you're saying you're not going, why did you say that earlier? Was that a test? And his response is, well if it were how do you think you did? I said are you fucking kidding me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no evidence that I've heard that he really wants to discuss any of this with you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you keep acting like that's what's going on. You keep responding to him as though this is a conversation where he wants to know what's actually going on with you and you want to sort of have some mutual talking about things. But that's not really what any of this is as best I can tell. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you also keep pretending that's what it is, as near as I can tell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I had a conversation—so we did go to Chicago this weekend. And yesterday there was some party that happened to be 20 blocks from where we were staying, where Amanda (ph) lives, that his friend was going to, some—whatever. I don't care what it was. And so he went to it. Great. So me and Amanda (ph) had some time alone to talk and she was really tired of him and being very nice to him, especially in front of her daughter who loves him and every time he comes in she's all over him. So, fine, she's not [inaudible] of her life. [00:10:13]</p>

<p>But when we were talking she said honestly Trina, first of all I don't think that you'll ever get over the not trusting him thing regardless because I don't think he's ever showed you that he's trustworthy and I'm not sure he really feels it so I don't want you to have to deal with that. She said secondly, I hate the way that he's treating you, that he's blaming things on you and he's not letting you have things. He's not understanding what you want from this; he's only concerned about what feels good to him. And she said, she sent me back with an assignment. She said here are your assignments for the week. Don't talk to [inaudible at 00:10:47] more than once a day; don't [inaudible]; don't let him guilt-trip you into anything; and go on a date with somebody. That was my assignments for the week. I said okay, I'll try. She said you really need to figure out what it's like to be without him and be in your space. So I'm trying to keep that in mind because it is good advice. I shouldn't be talking to him, and she said you shouldn't be sleeping with him, you shouldn't be sleeping over. This is what a break is. If he is sexually deprived, then that's his fucking problem, he shouldn't have fucked up then and acted like an asshole. </p>

<p>And so I feel a little bit refreshed this morning, today in general. It's a new week, events are starting this week, the semester's in full swing. I have a temp coming in to help me out with events and system stuff while Mindy's transitioning, so that's great—this [inaudible at 00:11:39] incidentally. He's the same temp that's done this the last two times in this part [inaudible at 00:11:48] but he's great and I don't have to train him, but—and I am trying to keep that in mind. And what I really—one of the big things that this feels like to me was Trina said if his feelings are hurt and he's acting like a dick about it to you and making you feel guilty, you need to just hang up the phone and be done. This is not your problem if he feels bad that he's in a small room or is on a hill or doesn't have laundry. That's not your problem any more. And I think it was helpful to hear that from my best friend. I mean she's obviously was saying—I mean you're obviously going take all of your friends advice with a grain of salt because we only know as much as you tell us you know more intimately what's going on. And I said you know almost as much as anybody. [00:12:32]</p>

<p>But it was really helpful to take my friend's advice and I am going to just keep that in mind because I'm in this awful cycle of not being able to let go of his judgments about my feelings and how I'm dealing with things. And being scared to tell him [inaudible] I think I really need some space, I really need to limit how much I'm talking to you and not see you as much right now. And I think it's partially honestly there is a fear of him having his usual over the top reaction which is well then let's just break up right now, there's no point. This is not going to work. I thought we were supposed to be trying to work on things but...and I have a fear of that just because I think it's not fair for him to do that. But at the same time, at a certain point, I have to kind of just say if that's what you want, then that's what it's going to be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But those are questions as to why you would want anything different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I'm struggling with this issue of feeling like this is 100 percent done, not knowing how to deal with the heartbreaking feeling of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about it. In other words, what heartbreaking point did you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just being sad that somebody I thought I would be with forever I may not be with any more. It's just a hurt feeling to think about all those plans. That's just sad I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What plans? [00:14:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Getting married and having a house and just spending your life with somebody. I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you picture?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something other than what it would be with him but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you picture?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I pictured getting married within the next year, so working to save for a house and thinking about having kids in a few years. But I think part of the sadness is also not only having to give that up and think about somebody new in the future, but part of it also is sort of sad that I really couldn't have the life that I would really want to have with him. I just don't think he's able to give that to me. And Amanda (ph) said Trina obviously you love each other and you love him and stuff but what do you feel like he offers—what does he offer you as your partner, as your future husband? And the list that I came up with was he had goals, he loves me, he supports me when I have difficulty with some things, and then I kind of trailed off. And she said well what do you have to offer him? And I was kind of like stopped, that was the [inaudible at 00:15:33] for 15 minutes. And she kind of just looked at me like okay, you just answered that question. She said I mean—and I think it's just sad that I do love him and there are a lot of good things about him and there are a lot of good things about the way that he treats me and stuff but at this point I just don't feel like it outweighs the stuff that I don't like. And I feel like I've been struggling with that for a while now and this whole situation has made it become really clear that he's not the right person for me. [00:16:12]</p>

<p>And I feel like I've been using the whole I'll never be able to trust him again thing as the excuse for why we might not get back together because I don't want to tell him because of all this other stuff. And I'm up for [inaudible at 00:16:40] for my guests. I don't want him to feel bad but at the same time shit happens, I guess. And he really fucked up and even so he's still like friending random girls on Facebook if they have provocative pictures as their profile picture and it's just like why? What is the issue like you can't not do this? I just don't get it. If you're really that serious, why is that still going on? </p>

<p>And then last night—so he had said that Chance (ph) this friend that he was with was going to drive back from Chicago to New York. So I was going to leave at five, I said let's leave at 5:00 or 6:00. He said he wanted to have a good time at this party, I was enjoying with Amanda (ph). It got a little later, I said why don't you and Chance (ph) take a cab over here because—I was down. But the way that I go is from her house is hopping on the Parkway and that's just a quicker way out of the area because she's closer to the other side. And he was about 20 blocks up, the other direction. And so I said if you guys could take a cab that would be easier because I'm going in the opposite direction. He then says Chance (ph) is no longer coming so I'll just walk towards Amanda's (ph). I said don't walk; I'll just come get you because I don't want to deal with the difficulty of trying to find him, stopping on, figuring out where we are, whatever. I said don't walk, just stay there; I'll come. And he text me back okay well I'm walking towards Amanda's (ph) now. I said all right fine. I'm in the middle of the [inaudible]. I'm ready to leave now so just make sure no matter what you stay on this road; just make sure you're always on that road.</p>

<p>And he's calling me, he's not on it any more, he doesn't know where he is, he's giving me cross streets, he says he checked in on Facebook so I should see where he is. I said I'm driving I can't look on Facebook right now. I'm looking at the map, I have to pull over, all this stuff. He walked—he's drunk. And meanwhile, not even realizing how irritating that was because granted I would have driven by myself anyway this weekend. If I could've drove you, you could at least give me the fucking courtesy of driving one of the ways, there or from. But he's drunk, walks the wrong direction and some place on Metropolitan down some side street. And then he's frustrated with me when he gets in the car, angry drunk, not like shitfaced all over the place crazy, but I could tell he was drunk. I could smell the liquor on his breath. </p>

<p>Frustrated with me, well you were going to leave earlier and I didn't know where we were going and I said I was walking and I told you I was on that road- and trying to blame me. I said are you fucking kidding me? Really? I mean he's again bringing up the I thought we were leaving earlier. What the fuck is that oh I didn't want to get back to New York this late. You're complaining? And then he says—I had a slice of pizza that I brought with me because I got hungry and I said here's a slice of pizza. Eat the slice of pizza because I said you're really irritating right now; get something in your stomach. And then he's knocked out snoring. And I said this is fabulous. This is great. It's raining. Thanks for being conscious. </p>

<p>Wakes up and I thought he was awake but I guess he was still half-dreaming, half-drunk, talking something crazy about part—I don't know. I think he was thought the dream whatever dream was real. And then I was confused I didn't know what was going on so I was asking questions and he's yelling at me for asking questions and just let's continue on what we're doing. I said just go the fuck back to sleep, and he said that's fine, I'm going to stay awake but he's looking out like this. I said just put your fucking head back so your neck doesn't hurt and you'll complain about that too. And then he woke up sober and I told him what he had said to me and all this stuff and he apologized. He felt bad for this weekend and got angry and half-dreaming and he said well I feel I could drive. And I said fine, I just want to tell you what happened, whatever. [00:20:41]</p>

<p>But during the time he was sleeping next to me I was just—that's when I was thinking about how this ties in to the ending of a relationship but just feeling so frustrated. For all the good ways, like yes he supports me and he loves me and he deals with me when I have temper tantrums, and soothes me if I'm whatever, for all of that I want a boyfriend that if they're going to go with their friends and get drunk, they're going to—I don't know. Just someone who's not going to pass out or can drive the other leg or that thanks me for buying the gas or that thanks me for taking him with...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that takes responsibility for stuff and is appreciative of what you do for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And I really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where things are more equal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, you know? And I do so much and I really haven't heard a really proper thank you. It's almost as if he feels like he deserves for me to have done this stuff and helped him through the move because I'm the one that told him to move out. And that's the reason he's in this crappy apartment so of course I should help him. Which is so not the case. I did it because I'm nice, well partly because I nervous about dealing with his drama. It's just I guess I'm figuring out—I don't know. [00:22:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to be careful. There are a lot of people who spend a lot of time incredulous about how someone could treat them the way they are in a way that keeps them in the situation of being treated that way...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't want it to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...where it becomes 5,000 times can you believe this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Well it's an abusive relationship in a sort of a sense, in that sense, not being able to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For my part I wouldn't say he's being abusive, I would say he's not treating you well. I guess I wouldn't describe—it doesn't sound like he's being sort of willfully cruel or certainly I think there's nothing physical going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, certainly not. But I think just in the sense of kind of, I don't know. I mean I do feel like he has been I don't know if I would call it mentally abusive or emotionally abusive but manipulative and exacting and—yes, manipulative I think is the best word. But, no, I do have to be careful about it and I think that's why Amanda was kind of saying I'm putting my foot down; this is what you're doing this week. Stop, stop. Why are you being so nice to him? Stop. And because she's seeing the same things probably don't get sucked into this. Yes, I can't believe he's treating me this way so I feel like he's done it for a while now. This is not out of character. Yes, I can believe. She said honestly I wish I could just sit him down and say listen [inaudible]. You f****ked up, this is your issue; you need to give Trina her space. Workout whatever you need to workout. I wish I could shake him and I said yes, but he has to do it himself, otherwise it's not... [00:24:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there are two people with problems here. I mean his and, the one who's talking about that. But you've got a pretty significant one here as well which is that you continue to be involved with him this way after you said many times that this is not something you're going to put up with. I mean this started with his being chronically untrustworthy, or chronically inaccurate portraying of your trust in him in a pretty clear-cut way, in a way that you were in denial of for a while. And then you agreed to stay in touch with him and consider getting back together with him if he really made an effort to work on things, which as far as I've heard he's made essentially zero effort to work on any of the things that really matter to you in any kind of sustained, ongoing way. </p>

<p>You keep letting him crash through all the limits you're trying to set for what you'll put up with. And that's your problem, that's not his problem. And I'm not quite sure why you keep doing that, telling him or telling yourself or telling somebody that you won't put up with X or Y or Z and then continuing to put up with it over and over again. I'm not sure why you're doing that. I mean you mentioned wanting to keep sort of his good impression of you in some way or you mentioned being really sad to lose him and lose what you'd hoped for with him even if you know you're not going to get it. I certainly think of your history and your taking care of your mom in ways that you weren't being taken care of that you had wanted to be. [00:26:54]</p>

<p>I'm not sure why but I guess the first aspect of this seems to me to be doing it really clear that you keep setting limits. I mean there was moving out, there was having presumably meant him dealing with his stuff and where he was going to live, there's—and also not spending time together and I assume sleeping together, there were the requirement that he work on things if he wanted any hope of making things work out with you, there's your not wanting to put up with his sort of bullying crap, there's your saying things as though you're having a meaningful conversation, in other words the expectation that he's going to kind of listen and meaningfully respond to what you say. You keep having these expectations or setting these limits for what you will and won't put up with, and then you keep putting up with everything he does anyway. And that's really your problem, that's really not—he's got problem enough that he doesn't at all but you do too and I think it's hard for you to look closely at them. [00:28:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: For sure. Yes, and I think I don't know really know how. I don't know how to look at those issues. I don't know why I feel like—this is bad for him. Personally he's being a martyr or making me feel bad about things but I don't know why I actually do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's just the main part of it, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [I don't know if] (ph) this is a friend of yours who's—boyfriend or quasi ex-boyfriend—who's treating her this way, I don't you feel that bad for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and that's why all my friends are incredulous about why I've been helping him so much, like I don't understand Trina (ph). I mean I think it's—I think some of it—I don't know, I really don't know. I really don't want to be having those issues. I don't want that to be my problem. I have my own problems. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would say these problems of saying you're going to draw the line somewhere, saying you're not going to put up with something and then putting up with it, I think those are probably your most pressing problems right now. [00:30:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course there are other things you want to work on, but in terms of what's going to give you trouble this week and what gave you trouble last week...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, it's that. I think that—I mean also [inaudible] he's just very black and white about things. So if he were to say, let's say, do you want to get together tomorrow night after practice, have dinner, watch a movie, whatever, and if I were to respond by saying I don't know, whatever it is—no I don't think that's a good idea, I have other plans, I'm not free, no I don't want to—that he's going to be—so he's so black and white in a sense that if I say anything around that, or I'm going to spend this week, I think that we should—or whatever. I can't even form the words. I can't even think how I would say to him because I'm afraid that he'll—I think what I'm afraid of is he'll just say well then let's forget this then, which is really unfair because he should be giving me what I'm asking for. But I'm not putting my foot down because I'm afraid if I put my foot down he's going to take it over the top and not even give me the time I need and just be sulking about the whole thing. </p>

<p>But saying it out loud, it's kind of like—saying it out loud, I literally if he gives me that reaction or something, I'm going have to be if that's what you want and that's what this means to you, then okay. Then let's not work on it because it's not right for me to feel this way and it's not right for him to make it seem like I'm an evil—he was basically telling me that why haven't I moved past the whole Betty (ph) thing. Well that was in the past; that's not what we're working on now. That has nothing to do with it. And not giving me—what do you mean you need time to figure—you haven't had a chance to really sit down and figure out how you feel about things? We've been dealing with this for over a month now. That hasn't been enough time? I've been working on so many things and you don't even see that. What? Those things are the things that he says to me. [00:32:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think there was your shift into incredulousness. I think that it does seem like the harder thing to look at there is how you say he says oh let's go out tomorrow night and you say no. And he says well why not and you say I don't want to. He says forget it, forget it, forget the whole thing. And that's going to freak you out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there's this side of it that yes it will freak me out and it will be upsetting. But on the other hand there's a small breath of relief I think maybe too which is scary. Well all right, well I didn't have to do it or something because the whole trying to explain—like you said trying to think—thinking that I'm going to be able to have a conversation with this man that's meaningful about this stuff—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't heard you [inaudible at 00:34:03].</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen. He doesn't understand how to do that. He doesn't understand it. I mean I can't—there's no such thing about as having that conversation because he doesn't give me permission to react the way that I want to react to things. The other night I—he had...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other thing, Trina, is you have a very hard time in these sorts of situations with him. It's not just that he doesn't let you have your reaction, it's that you get intimidated or feel guilty in a way that really shuts you down and prevents you from really even thinking all that clearly in the moment about what's going on. And that—those aspects of this are really on your side, they're not on his side. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So how do I work on that, because I really don't know, I don't know what to do. Besides I think putting my foot down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think most of that stuff occurs because you don't want to put your foot down because you're afraid you'll lose him. So I mean more or like all of this is sort of ways your—I don't mean to be critical but I do want to be direct—ways you're putting your head in the sand to avoid seeing what's going on. See how clear it is that this could never be what you want for a whole bunch of reasons. And I think you keep doing things pretending it could be. [00:36:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, pretending that this is something that could...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Including...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...follow throughout things and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So if I agree to go out with him to dinner tomorrow night then at least we're not breaking up right now, as though...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and maybe going to dinner is we're working on things because we're going on a nice date. When in reality it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something you didn't want to do in the first place where you're not going to have the kind of conversation that you want to have. Where you're not going to have that kind of break that you want to have. And where it's sort of still perpetuates this fantasy that you can have the kind of relationship you want to have. I think those are sort of ways that you're, yes, you've kind of put your head in the sand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I would agree. I mean another thing I was thinking about was just how much has changed from the beginning and what I thought would be with him and now what I see really clearly will never be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, there is that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean I don't really—not just because Amanda (ph) said it but because it's something I need to do for myself this week, now that all the moving, now that this is done, the short week is done and all this stuff. I really don't want to see him this week. I don't; I don't want to. I want to be at home by myself or going out with my friends or maybe even going on a date, whatever. And so, yes, I think Amanda (ph) giving it to me as an assignment assigned by her is okay, whatever, kind of silly, but at the same time I want to use it to help motivate me to follow through with that. [00:38:10]</p>

<p>So, yes, that's what I'll be working on this week and have a [inaudible] with a Monday and a Friday this week. So I'll get back to myself, yes. It's difficult for me to use heartbreak (ph). I do think it will be easier on myself if I stick to my word and feel good about it no matter how he reacts to it or how he tries to make me feel about what I'm saying because that's really not my concern because I'm just being me. And I have to do that, go grocery shopping by myself, all this stuff. When I started my class—yes, I saw you—no I didn't see you—I started my class last week, Social Change...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what was it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Social Change, with the same professor I had over the summer—those are the only two courses he teaches and I really liked him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't quite different over the summer was it? [inaudible at 00:39:21]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: World Religion. So he teaches that and then d Social Change, and he's just this very kind of hippie, Buddhist guy, he's a white guy, whatever and used to be a Meth-head and very nice guy and very nice professor and I'm really looking forward to that. I'm looking forward to having more time to do everything and stuff at home and be alone. So that's something to look forward to as well. I'm excited about the whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up. [inaudible on [00:39:48] on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll see you at 12:30 and then after that you'll let me know. 11:55 has been your time for sure. Okay. Good to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care, Trina.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. [00:40:02]</p>

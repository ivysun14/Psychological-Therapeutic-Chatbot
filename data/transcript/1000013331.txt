<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just wanted to touch base about scheduling to remind you that I am going to be away. I will be here this week and next week and then gone for three weeks - three Wednesdays I will be gone. And you had said something about your schedule. Did you want to meet when we resume in...I guess we will meet then again on September 3rd?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes that is fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then did you have a sense of when we want to meet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I may be able to. I am not sure what is going to be happening with the evening job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so we can just play it by ear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am hoping that I have two and a half more weeks left because if that happens and I don't have it, then we could meet at, like, five.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why don't we go ahead and schedule that first September meeting at 4.30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, that is fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I see in the meantime that it is going to change then I will call and let you or we will just go with it and change it afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything else?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was thinking: why don't I pay you every two weeks? Make a payment every two weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every other week, sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next week I will pay and I will pay the following week so we don't have the time in between.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well next week will be the last time we meet until September.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ah, okay, fine. very good. Ooh, good vacation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it is three Wednesdays, about two and a half weeks but it is nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I need to decompress for a minute - running over here. Any questions from last week (chuckles)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you want to ask?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that just because you don't know where to get started?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it is a stalling tactic!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or if you do, that is another stalling tactic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are the stalling tactics?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am just thinking: "Oh I don't know what I want to talk about this week."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need something like a hill starter to get started? (2:42)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Part of it...having a couple of things I may want to talk about this week. But I was thinking - coming over here and kind of replaying last week - what I got into about growing up in my fantasy life and having a certain feminine mindset and there being an awkwardness for me to talk about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I think that it seemed to me that it is like a continuous coming out process for me. I am sure part of the reason it is there is because I could never tell anybody that growing up. That was totally...I was the only one who knew about it or thought they knew about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say the reason it is there, you mean the inhibition or the sense of shame?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that is still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe because it was such a secret?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it also probably played into me realizing I was gay so there was that element there a "Well, I am doing this so, therefore I have to hide it away - it wouldn't be accepted - therefore if I am gay and I am like this, will I have to hide that away too? I have to be ashamed of that." The funny thing is that...that hadn't occurred to me - I mean, I thought about it before but it just came to me - I am not sure exactly how it got started. I remember when I was little - maybe five, six - dressing up in my sister's clothes. Or my mother dressing me up in my sister's clothes. In a certain way it seemed like...I told you I had a twin brother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I was my sister's playmate and my twin brother was my older brother's playmate. I remember getting a doll for Christmas. I remember my sister got a bride's doll. I thought I got a bridesmaid's doll.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You stress "I thought?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems to me - my memory says - I got a bridesmaid's doll in a blue dress. I don't know what happened to that doll. I don't know if I got it and they decided: "Oops, this is the wrong decisions." Or if my sister got it and I thought that it was for me or I wanted it for me or whatever. I don't remember. I just know I don't remember that doll existing anymore. I don't know. (6:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some way or another, you have a sense that that was your doll?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Do-do-do-do (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What seems to...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing, just the doll. It is just the fact that the doll disappeared. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, but I remember at some point it was cute that I did that - that I dressed up in my sister's clothes or whatever. And then at some point I remember being told: "Little boys don't do that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So initially, it wasn't something that was secret. You would dress in your sister's clothes and it was...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes, I have photos of me in...actually I think it is one of my mother's skirts. My mother - knowing my mother - she would have thought: "Oh that is funny - let me take a picture of it." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you got some...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got attention from it, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it was pleasurable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your memory of it - as being pleasurable? That attention?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It seems to be. It seems to be, yes, that it was kind of...my mind is jumping ahead here...I seem to remember it being like fun - it getting attention; it getting, I don't know, laughter or something. And then it seemed I got scolded for it. Like I was enjoying it too much so that got taken away from me</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is kind of your sense of it - that you got scolded for having too much fun or enjoying it too much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And in certain ways that is how my mother can be. You enjoy things but you don't let things get out of control which I understand in a lot of ways. Not necessarily emotionally - I understand it intellectually - but I also find that I am on guard, I think, because of it. I don't want to enjoy something too much or I am going to be told: "No, you shouldn't be doing this. You are going too far." I know there is a real element of that in me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is not the activity itself so much - it is your experience of it and that you enjoy it. Like the enjoyment of it could become excessive in some ways. (8:52)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I thinks so or in terms of...I think part of that is also tied into we could be having a really good time at home and my father would come home and the nature of things changed. It was like oftentimes you had to quit. You had to go and work. He always had something for you to do. Or if he came home and was in a bad mood, he started yelling about things. It was like, don't trust the good times. And I know in certain ways I see a repetition of that, certainly with the men I see there is that. "Don't trust having a good time in bed with them because as soon as it is over they are going to be up and out." They are not going to be taking care of my needs. So in the back of my mind I am observing that level of enjoyment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you say "don't trust," is that kind of like you sort of saying to yourself "don't enjoy this much" or "don't want it too much?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is more "don't want it too much."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "Don't want it too much because it might not be available."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But also "don't enjoy it too much." I think that is kind of also like it is going too far. I was invited to a party on Friday night and I went. I had a wonderful time and I was very glad that I went but part of me was watching how I was. I ended up I had a good time - I danced, I spoke to a couple of people. It was more of a sit-down dinner party but it was a restaurant - a lively restaurant - and I had a great time. But I was also aware of a struggle of letting myself go to enjoy myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you could feel the tension?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Exactly. Telling myself it doesn't matter what I do or what I say I am there to have a good time. People aren't going to be critical of me and if they are, so what. I was invited.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you almost have to reassure yourself it is okay to have fun or it is okay to enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of almost coaching yourself along?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can let down - you can let go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and if I think about that...oh that sounds so horrible - that I do that. (11:59)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What just happened to undermine why you felt so terrible? Or sounds terrible?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is...the word that comes to mind immediately is frustration. I don't have to do that - I am conditioned. I have conditioned myself to do that and to feel frustrated about it. Other people can go out and just go with whatever and not worry about the consequences, where I am much more uptight about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like...frustrated, angry that you...it sounds in some way this feels like a risk or a restriction or a...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At the same time, I thought I also heard an aspect of...almost like a judgmental aspect like: "Oh, this is terrible." And also self-critical. It sounds like I heard both of those things. As you corrected yourself, you said you are conditioned as though you were saying: "There is a reason why I adopted this strategy." But at first it sounded like there was a self-criticalness, like: "How awful that I engage in this."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Both of those are there. And the self-critical part is like: "Yeah, you're right." It is like: "Yeah, how awful it is that I do this."
COUNSELOR: Were you aware of...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mind if I switch chairs? I am finding this...it is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is not comfortable? Maybe the others - I don't know if that is more comfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is comfortable to sit in but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The arms are a little funny. I don't know how you find it. I find the arms are...is that better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is better. I also think the lift in the seat is up a little bit more so I can't find a comfortable space. So be critical of the chairs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckles.) (14:23)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That critical voice won't allow me to enjoy myself a lot. And I think a lot of that is very much...what I am hearing in that are aspects of my mother. My mother has a tendency to be naggy in a lot of ways. My mother talks a lot - it is funny. I don't realize it as much until I am away and then I got to visit her. She talks all the time. And her aspect on things is being negative. She sees the negative sides of a lot of issues - a lot of situations. I am being rather vague there. I am trying to think. I don't know. I am also finding that I am holding back a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With you, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, part of it is: "Okay, I have gone over these things before." Not with you but the last time I did the short-term and for numerous years also. so I am thinking: "Okay, dig a little deeper here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which things did you...when you say: "I have gone over these things before." The sense of not allowing yourself to have fun.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I have gone over that. Most of the things that we have talk about I have gone over before. I have a different perspective on things in some ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the holding back then is a kind of reluctance to...tell me more about that. Do you sort of feel that this is something you don't want to be talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, no, no. I think I am looking at: "Don't just look for me. Don't just look at the easy things - go a little deeper."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So at this moment you are kind or urging yourself on. You are pushing yourself to go a little deeper?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that is there but also some fear of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And fear of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that is there also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of that fear? What the fear is like or what the fear is about? (17:40)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think there is a little fear disapproval on your part with me because as I was sitting here and starting to talk about Mom, I edited out the phrase, something like: "I love my mother." I didn't say that because I also thought I don't need to say that to you to justify. In the past if I was to be critical of her...role back the film here of how my mind works (chuckles). What I also edited out was - you know, it zipped through my mind and I thought "oh, should I have got into that at this point" - when I said that my mother can be naggy. My mother had four children to raise and my father wasn't around a lot. Plus, not only did she have that, but she oversaw things on the farm. She oversaw a great deal. and I thought: "No, don't bring that up yet. I can go and do that later." But that is going to sound like I am justifying things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if it did sound like that, what is your concern? It sounds like you have some concern about how I would react. You said something about my disapproval.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was afraid that you would think "he is just justifying being critical of his mother" by saying those things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you would anticipate that I might dismiss that as something. Criticize it - in some ways devalue it. Can you say more about what gives you that sense that I might do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In terms of you personally?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well whatever you thing is relevant. Yeah, in terms of me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably part of it is I still don't know you yet but I do see someone who is very bright an you have a real tape recorder going on. You are coming back at me and I don't mean that in a negative sense. Your comments back to me clearly show you are listening to me. I like you are listening and you are questioning and you are digging a little deeper with your questions. So that is there. (21:09)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But something about...you say you don't mean it negatively but the idea that I have a tape and I come back at you. My sense was that it sounds almost like I might be listening too attentively...it sounds like you want to be a little careful about what you say as though I might jump on something. It sounds like you are aware that I have a tape recorder so you want to be a bit more selective until you know me a bit better. That what I am taking in...I seem to come back with things and maybe you are not prepared to be, I don't know what exactly, to be pushed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think there is some of that there. I am just thinking: "Oh, what is there?" In that, what is causing that fear?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are analyzing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little bit. Probably part of it is that I may be afraid of looking at some aspects of myself or changing some of my habits. I think that is there. In that, yeah, there could be. In that, I think a part of that I don't get the feeling that you...I think you have a strong personality... I am thinking: "Oh, what if I use too strong of word here." If you want to push a client, you push a client to get them to work on something. Intellectually, I like that idea. Emotionally I am probably afraid of it. (24:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so there is some fear about my...something about my personality that seems like I could push. Do you have any sense of what it is...that fear? As you say it, are you in touch with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what popped into my mind - which is actually going back to the earlier conversation we had - is that to a certain extent in very broad terms, going back to the idea of enjoying something. If I am enjoying something, and not trusting it, that it is not going to...ah, let me turn that around a little...it is, like, not going to last. Alright? I think it is why I am mistrustful of new situations. I am used tot the old - I have gotten comfortable with the old. This is a new situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is what you are saying too - that there is some way in which it is hard to let yourself go here or to enjoy something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not feeling settled yet. The chair is probably an indication of that, although last week I always noticed it. "Am I comfortable in this chair?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it is interesting. When you talked about not being comfortable, you sort of shifted to slightly a different position. I don't know if there was anything with that shift. Was that indicative or did that feel like anything to you? You were talking about the discomforts - I am wondering if you felt it in your body? You are kind of suggesting something about the chair. Is there a physical sense of being uncomfortable? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, there can be. There can be a certain emptiness to it. It is just not relaxing. (27:03)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I am also kind of aware of the camera today. Last week, I really wasn't much at all. I am a little bit today. Usually I can kind of come in and forget this - sometimes I get used to it. Also I think part of it is, I don't know how we are going to...what the basis of the structure is going to be. Like it seemed rather awkward - which is why I asked you if you had questions from last week, how we are going to start the session; where we are going to go with it; that kind of thing. I mean, we kind of talked about it: "You would come in and say what is going on with you." Kind of in the here and now. And so that I think can be a little bit, perhaps, difficult, if...well, it is going to be very difficult if I don't want focus on something. It is going to be coming in here and: "Well, what do I want to talk about?" And I think it may also...well, coming in in a good mood may seem different than me coming in in a less good mood. It may seem more difficult I think to focus in on something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So today you feel like you are coming in in a good mood and something about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am in a relatively good mood, yeah. I have a little bit of energy today so that is good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if that has anything to do with your sense of...your worrying about my disapproval. You are telling me that if you enjoy things too much or if you are having a good time, you can judge yourself or you have experienced that before so I wonder if there is any sense that I might in some way scold or that that might invite some reaction from me. That being in a good mood almost makes it fell less comfortable for you? (30:03)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think in that manner. No, I don't think so. It also occurs to me that when I have been in good moods before and come to a therapy session that it...sometimes in he past it has just been difficult to remain in a good mood. For me, it is like I need to talk about something that is heavy. I need to talk about something that is a problem with me. As opposed to maybe looking at why I am in a good mood because for so long, I just couldn't see out of the barrel I was in. Everything was a problem. So that is kind of different also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but one thing I hear in that is worry that you might be...this mood might be punctured in some way. My sense of you wanting to regulate how you are in here and maybe our inter-reaction and some way perhaps wanting to preserve something that is really good. It sounds like an understandable reluctance to lose a sense of well-being. It sounds like the worry is you could leave here feeling deprived of that. Come in in a good mood and leave in not such a good mood.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Let me think about that a minute because I think you are putting it in a different spin. I think I was kind of thinking that but in a different way. More in terms of me telling myself I don't always need to look for something negative. I think we could be approaching the same point with that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It looks to me like you have a sense that we are on different wavelengths on this in some way - that we are understanding it differently.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I don't know. It is funny. (32:57)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of...because I get the sense that we are both trying to figure this out very...get a conceptual handle on this. I wonder what you are sensing or feeling about what is happening right now. Do you have a sense of what you are feeling right at this moment as we are talking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I am having some frustration. I think the part of...It seems to me that it is very natural in this kind of a situation for me to have questions regarding: "Oh, who is this person sitting across from me and how does she react to things etc?" It also seems very...now it seems very natural for you to be sitting there asking the kind of questions you are asking. And it is just a...it is probably just a little frustrating thing we have to go through</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say more about the frustration - what it is that is frustrating you specifically? Something about my questions maybe?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you are asking me some questions I don't feel I am ready to answer yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I am ready to answer yet because it is a little of the stopping and the thinking about it. And I think maybe I am feeling: "Oh, I could have an answer for you." That, I think, goes back to judgment. You are asking me something. I am kind of feeling I cannot give you an answer or I am not understanding the question - or that kind of thing. (36:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If I am understanding you right, it sounds like you feel some pressure to deliver. That you have a sense that I expect you should be able to answer the question. It sounds like, in your own mind, you are having other feelings and thoughts about it like you are not ready or you are not clear but maybe it is...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am not sure. I think maybe it kind of goes back to the structure. It is like: "Okay, come in. Start. Where are you? Oops. let me ask you this." And: "Oh, well I hadn't thought about that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost the way you just said that, it feels like an interruption at times?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, which is okay in a lot of ways. I think it is me dealing with being questioned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are saying it is okay in certain ways but it sounds like in some ways it doesn't feel okay. So maybe we should try to understand what doesn't feel okay about it. And you are saying you are trying to deal with it but I wonder what feels...there is something about it that feels bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is happening right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right now it is happening with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you say what is happening right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think it is like: "Well, how do I respond to that? Do I need to say anything? Do I not need to say anything?" My feeling is: "Well yes, I am afraid you are going to be somewhat critical of what I may say but I have already said that." And at the same time I am thinking: "Alright, you are kind of chipping away...'let us go a little deeper; let us go a little deeper'."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is your reaction to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in that sense I am kind of telling myself: "It is okay." In that sense...I will make a statement that will come back...there, in that sense it is like me getting to know you. So I can realize: "Oh, alright, so you want to go a little deeper with things." That is your style of questioning. And to look at that - that that is your style - you are not being critical about what I have to say. Or if I haven't said enough, you are not being critical - you are saying let us go a little further. (39:27)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And for me, it has been very difficult to realize that is what people were doing because what I hear - what I interpreted it as - is you haven't gone far enough. You haven't done enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. So the additional question implies a kind of a criticism that you haven't given me enough. You haven't answered it sufficiently. And it sounds like you say to yourself: "No, there could be another meaning to it." But it sounds like your real experience is a feeling of being criticized. In some way your experiences are being evaluated or judged. That sounds like an uncomfortable kind of place to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I am also thinking - and this may be me just making the situation somewhat safer - I do say: "Oh, you have got your job cut out for you (chuckles) if I am going to be on the defensive when you are going to ask questions."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm-hmm. It is like you try to imagine it from my angle?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel concerned that you are going to be difficult and make my job hard in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your experience of yourself? This being...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It depends on the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like in here. Is that your sense of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It can be at times because I can be very stubborn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And right now are you in touch with that? (41:46)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think the past 10 minutes have been pretty good, you know. I think I have looked at some things and said: "Oh, this is what I am feeling." Not what I am thinking, per se, but what I am feeling. I can be stubborn in the sense that what I just went through. It can be more of a sense of frustration. Like: "Where are we going? What am I really feeling?" All too often I "think" as to what is going on. Or I "think" I am confused as opposed to really looking at something. And in that way I think it can be difficult or if it is a more emotional laden subject, I can be stubborn because I don't want to go back and feel those feelings again. Because I think I am afraid of some of those people. And I am probably afraid potentially of the person that I am discussing it with. What their interpretation of it may be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or in this case, what my interpretation is. So a couple of minutes ago, you said it is happening right now. What you felt like we were doing - what you were describing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt like there was a block between us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A block?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I was feeling uncomfortable with not being able to respond to you - I was closing you out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you felt I was pushing to get in in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems important that you are letting me know that this is a sensitive place for you. I hear you say you want to go deeper but there are some fears about it and that your worry is that I might not respect some limits that you may feel. That you may need to go at a certain pace. The worry is that I might kind of bulldoze through to something that maybe you are not ready to get into. (45:07)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if I am putting words in your mouth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You are putting a slightly different spin on it. I want a safe environment - that is for sure - but I also want you to know that you may have to chip away at least some. I think it may be a little bit more of that. No, I think it is dangerous for me to come in and say: "I want to be treated with kid gloves." That is not what I am here for.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe you are also giving me...trying to fill me in that this goes on for you. What you just said sounded like: "Yeah, you might want me to know that it might be difficult at times but that you are concerned - you want to get deeper but it may be a back and forth kind of process.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know I can...as I said earlier I can be stubborn about things - I can close down - and maybe that is me coming in testing you on what goes on. I know I am doing so much better than I used to. I am doing so much better in talking about things in therapy. I used to literally put my therapist to sleep because I would close him out so much. I might be talking but emotionally...like one time he said: " I might just as well have my face up against this wall because you are not giving me anything." I know I have gone beyond that - a couple of inches out from the wall!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you say you might be testing me, in what way? </p>

<p>PATIENT: You keep coming back with a question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we keep enacting this thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it is something we are going to revisit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I know there are a couple of core issues I want to deal with and they are the core issues that are difficult for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But just at that moment when you said there is another question, do you have any sense of..."it is another question," right (chuckles)? (48:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it is another question. Alright, what are we looking at here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me what are we looking at?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is what you are reacting to: "What are we looking at here?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt that we had covered that topic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh okay, it sounds like you were questioning the point or you were feeling...it sounds like maybe you were feeling a little critical of that moment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like: "Didn't we go over this already?" Like: "Enough already."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so something about that felt frustrating. Like: "What is he up to? Doesn't she get that we have been over this ground before?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or: "Didn't I make myself clear?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't you make yourself clear. Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that is like: "Didn't I do enough?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that thing that we started, we were talking about then...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And the thing is I can point that out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That sounds important that you can point that out - recognize that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it does sound like again in that moment, you know, the sense of like: "Didn't I explain myself well enough?" Like: "Aren't you satisfied?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: That or I think it is also, it is like: You are really not hearing what I am saying."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that your experience? That I am not really hearing you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it is not. I am not thinking that. I maybe be feeling that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that distinction is a key one for you. Like somehow your thoughts are not at that place but, you know, some sense that you might be feeling that I am not hearing you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I can...yeah, that can be a problem for me. I don't feel disappointed or I don't feel frustrated that I am really not being heard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In some way that you really like to be heard?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm. Because what happens is, it does become frustrating that you reach a point that you think there should be an understanding of communication and it is not there. And where do you go with that? What are the boundaries? Do I give up what I feel about something and give them to the other person or do I say: "No, no, no, no, you don't understand - this is what I mean." And hope they are going to listen? It is kind of like at one point, you were saying - I don't remember exactly what the topic was - something about enjoying yourself and that coming to a stop. And you said something afterwards and I was having a similar feeling about: "Yes, that starts to approach what I am talking about but it is kind of different." And it is like: "Where do you go with that?" And that is when I get frightened and pull back and say: "Where do I go with that?" And I am also looking at time. (52:00)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just to comment on that last thing: it sounds like at those moments where you feel...my understanding is just that it is close but it is just off. It sounds like the dilemma is...can I say that you are not quite getting it and try to get you to understand it more or shall I just accept that as close enough?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it may feel like a risk to continue to say: "No, that is not quite right." You are talking about what the boundary is like: could you be going too far with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I think it is also...the three or four things that popped through my mind as you were saying that, it is often why I find business conversations so difficult because you really have to put a lot of time and energy into to arrive at a compromise on things and a lot of people don't want to do that. A lot of people I have worked with don't want to do that. I am also thinking that it just becomes disappointing. You look like you are going this way, then all of a sudden you turn out. Well, you are not making that connection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It felt like you were heading towards a connection.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it is not happening. What else popped into my mind was like...it is when I...Reiza, the fellow that I see occasionally called me last night and wanted to come over. I was too tired and I said: "No." I would have liked him to come over and I know it pissed him off but I felt too damn tired. But what I am thinking is, someone like him, where it is not a nourishing relationship but when we are in bed together, it comes together - there is a certain amount of passion that is there and then it just breaks away. It is like our bodies are communicating in one way and then like, no, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess one of the things we may want to try to understand is what parts of us are in communication or in contact and what parts of us don't seem to be. To then trap that because it sounds like it is a central kind of experience; that sense of disappointment when things go off-track is quite profound. It seems meaningful to look at that. Okay, I know you have got to go. (55:08)</p>

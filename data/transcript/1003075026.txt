<p>Transcript:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And is she better or worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, don't know what it's called.  You know, um, I say the first thing before I forget any conversation or any part of this is, um, dreams, fitful dreams that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nightmares, you mean?  No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I think night, um, nightmares are one of those things that make me want to get up and run out of the house.  I don't want to be that strong.  But it does —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I'm like, no, I'm not claiming, claiming that, uh, but just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Upsetting dreams?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would say upsetting, but I don't know what the, uh, the, the context of the dream is, I can't remember what it's about, but it's enough to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, wake me up and then I sit there all antsy about going back to sleep.  So, you know how I was saying how, uh, I guess what, it's last, what has it been, a couple of weeks or so, that I just had no get up and, and go, you know.  But when —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I do make it out of the house, it's like when I get back home, I get to my, my favorite comfort zone and on the couch in the family room and I'm, you know, there vegging out on TV and the dream, you know, the, how long I've been dreaming, I really don't know, but it's like I'm aware of them now, okay?  Because it's almost like every hour I'm, you know, I'm —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And trying to remember might give us a hint.  Now some of these antidepressants can make you dream more vividly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, and, when you say —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That must be it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  When you say vivid, because it's, you know, it's, it's, it's real, it's —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> High definition.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know, I just started using my high def channels on TV [INAUDIBLE].  You've got the stations turned to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't see, I didn't see any difference in it, but the only clarity he could show me was on the football field.  See how green the grass is?  Well, I don't watch football, so I could care less.  But, I mean, I know there is a difference, but, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not what they make it out to be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that it's, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean if you had a good TV to begin with, it's —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, hey, it's what, what I was watching before was clear.  But, you know, so how long I've been dreaming, I don't know, but it's definitely at a point of okay, and I'll say I'll spend a few minutes trying to figure what were you dreaming about, you know?  I can't, I can't —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pinpoint what is was I was dreaming about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try to.  Take notes or something because in your dreams you're trying to work out your problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not really as simple as that but —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As long as I'm not taking an ax to my husband.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  That is, or he to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Was this just happened more since we increased the Wellbutrin, you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I would, I'd say yes, and I don't know.  Yes to the part —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I, I'm aware, I seem to be aware of it now, but the I don't know is I don't really know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How, you know, how long I've been dreaming.  I never considered my, you know, I've never really been a, a dreamer.  I mean, you know, 1, 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I mean at sleep dreams.  I mean, I can daydream like I'd like to be on that, on that there [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, everybody dreams, even if you think you don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But once you start paying attention to it, you'll probably be able to remember some of it too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And that is what I'm saying, so yes and I don't know.  Because, uh, if everybody dreams, I know I'm not outside that norm, but I am more aware of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of something.  Because, you know, I guess when I wake up and I'm kind of tossing and turning like what, what woke me up?  You know, after I had ruled out, I know the foot isn't hurting anymore, you know, the back is, you know, it's, it's not bothering me, or is bothering me, then I start —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Kind of back tracking, okay, well, what is it, you know, okay, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have a whole folder full of dreams from post office people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  You could imagine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, and I tell you —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It covers everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, huh, it does make me think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's reminding me of something, there is a, uh, huh, huh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Retirement party that I was invited to.  Maybe that is what I'm antsy about?  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who is that for?  Oops.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well, she's a, a, um, a neighbor family friend, just also happens to be postal, postal employee.  Matter of fact, she was the one that retrieved me out of the hall when I had that panic attack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, you know, that took me out of work.  Um, and you say she, I mean, she's, she's friendly by all get out.  I mean, I probably need, I need to call her because she's like, "Well, you know, I've been there 40 years and been there to help you out through this and the other."  Which, which she has.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  When, when, when is the party?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Eh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The [DATE], this, this Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this Saturday.  And I remember when I got the invitation, you know, it's RSVP, and I said, okay, I'm not going to wait until last minute to do this, you know, I'm going to do it and low and behold last minute was knocking on my door, you know.  Another, uh, uh, friend because his, you know, [NAME OTHER], um, he used to be manager at [DEIDENTIFIED] there.  He goes, well, [NAME OTHER] was wondering if you were coming, she didn't get your RSVP.  And I'm like, oh, dag nabit, that is the one thing I said I wasn't going to do, but, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've made a commitment to go and I don't like breaking my commitments, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Come heck or high water.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's bitter sweet.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know, you know.  My husband bribing me, all right whose on that list because this is more of a personal, her personal family and, and friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Acknowledgement.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not going to be a big —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  They're, for her it's going to be big.  But the one that they did for the postal, for postal employees was a luncheon and, you know, and I told her definitely not, I'm not going to that one because I would've, you know, I would've seen, you know, my ex manager and other folks.  I know I definitely didn't do that one.  But, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, even if you see them or people bring up, just, just focus on the physical stuff, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you limp in and out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that won't be a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Believe me.  And I've been, have been, uh, walking at least 4 nights a week.  And, um, go out to walk last night and my husband goes, "You've been walking now for a few weeks and you're limping worse now."  And I say, well, I, you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's worth explaining to you.  I mean, you know, I think, I guess things get out of wack and it's a good day today and the next day it's like, because I pulled my heating pad out and I hadn't had that out in a couple of months.  I pulled it out the other day.  I'm like, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you got to constantly figure out what is too much, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And using your old self as a comparison is not the way to do it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know.  So, actually, I guess, I've gotten new, putting new, new parameters that I've got to —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've got it, you know, sort out.  Because I know because it is, when I think, when I think back to, um, it's been years that I was [INAUDIBLE] burning it at both ends and putting a couple of matches in, in between those, um, those ends there trying to get it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, if you, if you pay attention, I mean, I, when I, like if I know I'm going to wax the boat —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or work down in the hull of the boat, which is actually leaning —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Under the floor, I can now say, okay, I can do that for, you know, 15 minutes —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or waxing 20, if I go over 20 minutes, I can do that and go do something else —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or rest for an hour or 2.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go back and do 20 more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But if I go over that, man I pay for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just got to, it's got to get like that, you know.  Walking, I don't even attempt that anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, you know, if I go 2 blocks it's going to start on my back.  But I can swim, thank God.  But, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I can't swim, so I got to lean toward, toward the walking.  I, I, you know, I'm trying, thinking that the walking, which I do enjoy it, um, because my husband and I some, you know, spend some 1 on 1 time outside of the house, we walk the neighborhood.  Um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm his cool down walk because he'll get about 3 miles in at his pace, and then we, we get to [NAME OTHER] and her slower than snail's pace.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that is okay, yeah.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I figure —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is a better way than starting out with, I mean drop it back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, that is, hum—um.  I see the pace that he takes off and, oh my gosh, I mean, there is no way I can keep up with that one.  But I was happy to, to have it, you know, it gives me something to look forward to, you know.  Okay —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got to get up and, you know, get, get our walk in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, maybe you can't do it every single day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm, I'm doing, um, Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  So I may have to it, it might be those that the Sunday and Monday back to back —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I have to give up.  I need to do, um, you know, you're on that there worldly regimen of you, you know, every other day, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Because he doesn't walk on Saturdays, you know, he just because he's [AGE]?  Yeah, he's [AGE].  I need, uh, I need to rest my body too.  So I may have to cut it down to the —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To the 3 days and get that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I could swim —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Regimen up a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I could swim 2 days in a row, but then I got to take the next one off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Even though you feel guilty about it in a way you don't do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It ain't worth it.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I, you know, when, and my husband is, he's better at a, um, acknowledging where I am than I am because all, I'm still in that trying to push myself too.  Well, all we're going to do is we're just going to do a mile, you know, and it's a slow pace mile.  Um, so even last night we were cutting it up because well, at some portion, depending on which way we go, we got an uphill.  I mean, it's a slight uphill, but you can, you can tell the uphills.  As soon as we started with the incline, up, let's, let's turn around and go back the other way, and we'll, we'll walk it out this way.  And he's like, "Yeah, you know, are you hurting?"  And I'm, I won't answer.  So, which is just as guilty as answering.  He says —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  You already did it, so you got the answer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  He said, "You wouldn't tell me if you were would you?"  So, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, in every arena it's up to you to tell the people, the kids, him, okay, I've reached my limit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And nobody cares.  I mean, uh, because they know you've got to protect yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And then, then, like I say, they're actually better.  They're better for me than I am for me, you know.  Okay, come on, stop, no we're not going to do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, you know, I just got to just try and pay attention to the dreams a little more and see if I can remember what it is I'm dreaming about.  And, uh, just say get through this phase of recuperating where I am.  You know, the dreams they, they did kind of bother me because I can get, like I say, there was, uh, a startling, you know, kind of —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they're crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean you just got to accept that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I'm like, okay, so what is going on.  I, I obviously didn't dream the magic 6 numbers, so, it's the lotto or.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, you never know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> My daughter swears she did do that —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she did it playing —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And hit 5 numbers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, okay.  And couldn't remember what that sixth one was, huh?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess not, you know.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She swears she dreamt them, though.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess it could happen.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything is possible.  So, it's all, you know, hanging at the, the Deplin, I need, that is what I need, I needed some more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I need another script for the Deplin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so far, our friends we got the Deplin 5, you're taking a half of an Abilify.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Half of the Abilify.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is about 2 mg.  Lexapro, 20, Wellbutrin 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because that is 2 of those.  And the, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One thing —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think the Ambien I take that with a, I don't know, it must be like a, like caffeine for me now because I, I'm waking up out of the sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you may just be anxious about the —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going to this party.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The affair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> This is the, this is the first thing you really did with, that might involve post office people and all of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know, you know, being on a larger scale, I still, you know, I still meet with my coworker, we try to do lunch once a month.  And, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is 1 person?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's just 1.  Maybe, maybe 2, we just started with 2.  But I see the second one at church, so that is not a, I mean, you know, she's common, common to me.  But definitely no, no thread a nerve antagonist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Well, were you close to retiring anyway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, hum—um, no, no.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:16) apartment to. It's because he doesn't work. (inaudible at 0:21) I lived in a house in where the heater, the furnace was just not very old and didn't work very well and the landlord wouldn't fix it so I mean it was a really cold winter. We needed to have space heaters going full blast to get it above 60. It was between 60 and 64 the whole winter. It's cold. [00:01:04]</p>

<p>Our property management company seems to actually do their job, so nice change. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Your smiling like] (ph) you're pretty near the school right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I am, yeah. (chuckles) (inaudible at 1:23) (chuckles) I knew I had a reason to be very quiet (ph) (chuckles) Yeah, students like their coffee. It's good. (pause)</p>

<p>But I talked to dad yesterday, and not for very long. I was just getting off of work and I was calling him back because he has called twice and-just couldn't pick up his phone. [00:02:04]</p>

<p>That's all and we chatted. He said he had been helping Jason and he is thinking about not getting his certificate, which he was planning to stay an extra semester and yeah get his licensure. I said, tell Jason get his certificate. Like I'm 27 and I'm working at a coffee shop. He wants to get the certificate. (pause) I don't know, I'd rather hang out than-he is very intent on not being negative you know you got to do this always be grateful that you are working, which is an attitude that I share most of the time and I understand and I'm grateful to have that in the back of my head but yesterday was not the day for it. He is like how much are they paying you? I'm like 9 bucks an hour. [00:03:02]</p>

<p>And he is like well it's a lot better than nothing. I was like yep yep, not enough to cover the rent but it's a lot better than nothing. And I'm living in a studio. And he says oh yeah it's amazing how much just how much stuff you accumulate right? I just had to (inaudible at 3:22) I'm not feeling, I'm not doing well, I got to go. I had to get rid of stuff and I really like my stuff. There is a reason I have been carrying most of it around for the past 10 years moving every year because I like it. It is part of me. It's important to me and-but it is more important to me that we live someplace-that where we live be livable, so we are going to get rid of stuff but I don't want to have to be happy about that all the time. [00:04:01]</p>

<p>(pause) Gratitude for what I have is really important but sometimes (inaudible at 4:19) is worth it. Is it where I want to be? So that was fun. (pause) Working hard so I'm just physically really tired. But I don't go in until 3 today, and (inaudible at 4:56) I have tomorrow off but I'm tired. [00:05:04]</p>

<p>(pause) I don't like feeling guilty that I'm not-that I don't have a better attitude towards (inaudible at 5:35) but I do feel guilty. (chuckles) (pause) But (crosstalk) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, thinking about her looking for a job, this is way better than that. [00:06:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I probably shouldn't have anyway or I shouldn't have said it. But I'm tapering off the Xanax finally, which is good because it's not doing anything. It's crazy withdraw symptoms and (inaudible at 6:53) I don't find myself psychologically addicted to it at all, it's more like I forgot to refill my prescription and I don't have any and then I go into withdrawal and-[00:07:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How long as the process been tapering off?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two months. (inaudible at 7:13)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't started yet. I pick up the prescription with the little tiny pills today. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could have started two days ago but I didn't get around to it. (pause) I forgot where I was going with this. (pause) Oh yeah just Dr. Vaughn (sp) said something to the effect of well we don't want to make to many changes while your life is in such a peephole and-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is a new normal. I don't see this changing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:08:01]</p>

<p>You know what, I guess I am-I don't have most of the things in place to get more stable over time but I'm not trusting that those will work out. You know, any day now another China (ph) thing is going to come along and I've just to deal with it. What? (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I guess it's a little dramatic (ph) but there is this sort of [psychologic events] (ph) called pre-action formation. Have you heard of that one? [00:09:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know the term but I can't remember what it is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is from Freud and the sort of type of sample (ph) is the new sibling is born and the older sibling who loves the newer sibling and also wants to throw it out the window lavishes it with affection wanting to throw it out the window. You know what I mean. Like the feeling is one thing, the actions are the opposite. And I think sometimes you say-it could be with anything, it doesn't have to be about a sibling but you know where one feels one thing very strongly and then flips it on its head.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such as-I think sometimes you favor that more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles) [00:09:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know you were just talking about how this isn't normal as bad as (inaudible at 10:05) it's really not. People this is expectable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There is no people. It's just that people is what I feel like I aught to expect but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how, you know you can see that there are things in place that will contribute to some stability but you're kind of waiting for the next thing to come along and I sort of just stopped about there. I was sort of anticipating and fuck everything up again. And you sort of paused and said, I'll just have to deal with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which [at the time] (ph) it appeared to me like I'll make the best of it when it does. I mean I'm probably sure you're feeling a little bit but-</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. [00:10:59]</p>

<p>(pause) Yeah. Yeah, I feel on the one hand very strongly that my life is completely fucked up in one way. And on the other hand that there is not really anything I can do that's more useful and I got to keep going. [00:12:11]</p>

<p>And acting like this is all manageable helps me get through, which is usually not manageable. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nope. Now we're not normally dead (ph) most of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. (crying) Yeah. It doesn't seem to be-that doesn't seem to indicate that I'm managing it very well. [00:12:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) [In my eyes] (ph) that is a very different statement.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. (chuckles) Yeah, I think I was intending to say something more like that seems to indicate that it's unmanageable but you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk talk. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) (inaudible at 13:47) stop up other things that you are feeling kind of in their tracks a lot of the time. [00:14:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The problem goes from being [kind of being an awful in guard] (ph) to having not manageable or how from how disappointed that angry you are to be working at The coffee shop to how you're not consistently not appreciative enough to be working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crying) I hate going to The coffee shop. I have to say I hate it because it feels like lanchisting (ph) and I don't like that. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>But yeah, I was very consistently trained into being-you know my first job was weed eating. Like running a weed eater on a friend's farm. You know that was a shit ass job, that was not very much fun. But I was 15. My dad was really clear that I was old enough to work and so I needed to spend my summers working. I needed to be doing something. And I was really clear that yeah I wanted spending money and I wanted to be working. I wanted to be financially independent as much as possible and so yeah. [00:15:55]</p>

<p>But there weren't very many jobs in my town. And at first I wanted to that my dad suggested, I said no I don't want to do that and that wasn't okay. I didn't want to work at the convenience store down the road. I think he saw that as snobbery and because it's kind of-it's just a very wide division between people that are fucked out of money (inaudible at 16:44) with no money and people with real money has gotten to e-store (ph) and worked there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But really I don't want to work there because every time I went in there, people are weird at me. I didn't want to do that but I couldn't tell my dad that that was why I didn't work there and also no (crosstalk) I don't know. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a fair answer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. He was really uncomfortable with my sister not hating (ph) puberty. I think he just did not know what the fuck to do about it. And basically anytime anything that had to do with me becoming sexually mature came up, I got yelled at. So, I just wanted to stay out of the-(pause) every time I went shopping for clothes, you can't be (ph) here. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>When I went to college, I had one set of clothes to wear and one set of clothes to wash, and I hitchhiked to college because my parents wouldn't bother to drive me. And that was (inaudible at 18:14) hitchhiked to college that was nuts. Until I got a motorcycle, which is another story. </p>

<p>And I knew that papa worked construction jobs as a young man. That was the work that you could get, that is what he did and I just all of it is be thankful for what you have rather than unhappy that you don't have more is just really hardwired at this point (crying). But I'm not very good at. [00:19:03]</p>

<p>I've spent a lifetime feeling guilty. (chuckles) So, papa is not very good at it either, which is (inaudible at 19:13) to be. Aubi (ph) once said I guess over a year ago when I was still talking to him, I was talking to him about being depressed, I think it was in a letter or something. He was trying to say, I'm so sorry, but at the same time he has been very depressed also. He knows that both of us are, like have it really good comparatively in terms of depression. It gets a whole lot worse than this. [00:20:17]</p>

<p>And that might be true but almost certainly true, but I really don't want to hear it. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I mean congratulations your depression is pretty bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Thank you. I expect my award anytime soon. I have a friend who decided in a Facebook comment once, it's kind of embarrassing but one of the best quotes for me in the last few years comes from a Facebook comment but whatever works (inaudible at 21:03) anyway. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>She had written a post about-she writes for a theology blog and she had written a post about suffering or having some problem and someone said, commented goodness, I don't even want to bring up problems that I have had because yours are so much worse and she wrote back. She was like no absolutely not. We do not want an Olympics of suffering here. I said that before didn't I? Everybody's suffering is valid, but that phrase Olympics of suffering. I just really liked that. [00:21:54]</p>

<p>Yeah. But then on the other hand or the fifth hand or whatever, it really pisses me off when I tell people, I'm depressed and they say I was depressed once and I felt really bad for a few weeks and they use that, or I feel as if they use that to say, you're just kind of a wimp because you really should be able to just push through it because I can just push through mine. Yeah, I don't like people telling me that they know what I'm going through when they really don't but I also want to-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I sort of got (inaudible at 22:45) but I think after a point the be thankful for what you have is total bullshit. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there are always children starving in India though. But yes, it's total bullshit. (crosstalk) [00:23:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, they might take it compared to what job they have but it's not what they want. They wouldn't want to be whacking weeds. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sucks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it might be the optimal thing to do given the situation, I'm not, it seems bad I need to do it but it's better than having to take the last next last good option but this is bullshit if you're saying it's like a good thing in itself. I guess it kind of sucked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What the weed eating? [00:23:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it wasn't so bad, but it was hard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't actually remember whether it was bad or not. I remember it being very physically tiring. But I was alone for most of the day and so that was nice. (pause) But I made a friend out to, a woman who went to the farm with her son who is best friends with my brother, and I later found out that she was just like amazed that I stayed longer than three days. So most of the time it wasn't an option. [00:24:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, okay at least (inaudible at 25:00) say about it. The thing that seems like bullshit to me is the idea that sort of in context being appreciate let's say that you did have that job and in that it was the best option doesn't in any way cancel out all of the other feelings you would have had about having that job such as hating it or hating being tired out by it or being led to be alone most of the day or wishing you could have been off reading instead or thinking about the kids who were learning to drive the new Porsches on the other side of the tracks. I don't know, but-you're only allowed to have that one feeling about it. That's the thing that I really have an issue with. [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crosstalk) Thank you. (chuckles) Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I can see how working at The coffee shop beats the shit of interviewing at temp agencies. I would guess from what you said that it usually does. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yesterday was a miserable day. It's so hard to be nice to people when I'm really unhappy. But not even nice, it's easy to be nice to people, it's hard to be outgoing and interested in people and willing to talk about my fucking Tanya Poppins hat, which is awesome by the way. (chuckles) (crosstalk) [00:26:56]</p>

<p>(pause) But it's really hard. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what kind of work is done when you felt better and it makes you much happier, I think. It is much more fulfilling. It felt much more in the direction of what you wanted to do with your life. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, that's happening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's completely unfair that you can't do those things because it will have an (inaudible at 27:58). [00:27:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) Yeah. The degree to which I buy that, the kind of diffuse rhetoric or model rather is fluctuates a lot and-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go for it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, it's very useful to explain myself to other people. But I don't know that I believe that. (pause) (crying) It's just I say to other people, I can't do this because of this depression because I have this. But in my head, it's the difference between can't and don't want to, like there is not really a difference. [00:29:08]</p>

<p>I don't know how many time I've talked to myself, I cannot go on living and I am still here so (crying) I don't know if I get to cut myself that kind of break. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear you because-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your welcome. Because the stakes are different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if you decided not to go on living, the stakes are higher, I mean I could elaborate but simply put. [00:29:58]</p>

<p>Whereas, let's say you give it just about everything you've got not to be dead sometimes that's probably true even (inaudible at 30:09) had.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know staying in grad school might not be worth that. You know giving it everything you had and then some. Staying alive might be. Staying in grad school maybe not. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've not thought about it. Thank you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so-</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then it's still not, I can't do this. It's not worth it to me to do this, which sounds very different. But also okay. [00:30:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you had to stay in grad school until it stabilizes around you and make sure you have done it. I guess-(pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really clear to me that the things that I do or don't do hurt myself are choices. I would like for them not to be choices very much but they are choices. And so then, I just have to say well my choices got me where I am and I don't like that. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>(crying) I don't know if that leap makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you want to feel awfully responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I do feel responsible. I would like to not feel responsible. (chuckles) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not so sure in that that would make you quite more helpless. Or I could think of another way. I'm aware that consciously you'd like to let some of this stuff go and not feel so responsible or so or simply (inaudible at 32:47). But I think unconsciously that is very difficult. When you do because it makes you feel [passing through hell] (ph) was, I think it is very frightening. [00:33:12]</p>

<p>I mean the other aspect of this is through limitations. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) What about them? (chuckles) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might be dead if you tried to stay in school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. [00:33:58]</p>

<p>I mean making choices that work with my limitations rather than against them seems to be what's been useful to me but-(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who cares whose fault it is? I mean, you know if you plagiarize a paper and are kicked out of school and couldn't be doing the kind of work, I mean I'm sure holding that up for the moment at the time, I'm not sure how true that is to the point, but whatever. (inaudible at 34:59) [00:35:00]</p>

<p>Even if you had to or you blew off your schoolwork to go urailing (ph) for a semester and failed out of I don't know what. I think you'd still be upset that you couldn't do it. And not just with yourself, I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So what you're saying is that emotions are there whether I want to say they are or not. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's true. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:35:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I also hope it's clear that I in any way expect that by saying to you-(pause) would change how you are about it. It's not like I'm going to say it, I'm able to cycle (ph) out for you and you're going to say your right. I just have to let go of this and I better not leave-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but thank you. Yeah. Like (inaudible at 36:43) You know sometimes you say things and then they do help down the road. I can't remember the example that I was going to use but anyway it happens. [00:36:56]</p>

<p>Yeah, last time that I don't, it's not that I don't have-it still says that my brain doesn't go their and more that I kind of observe it going there (inaudible at 37:13) forcibly sometimes. But sometimes it doesn't so. You know. (pause) [00:38:02]</p>

<p>Yeah, I can't think of it. It was like yesterday. I can't think of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean, you had a thought about it right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (crying) I'm so bad at remembering things. We were moving the other day and between walking from the apartment downstairs out to the van, I said I should pick this up at the grocery store. I'm going to write that down as soon as we get to the van so that I remember it. I got down to the van. James hands me a pen, I'm like what. (chuckles) [00:39:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We were talking about-</p>

<p>CLIENT: It looks like moving forward, I'm more an example of something you said that, it's [tough to quit] (ph). You know to make you feel better. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you particularly want to help make me feel better because it had to say with what I was saying that I was trying to help you. [00:40:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) No. I think it was-I think it was because I've been feeling more alone but particularly recently that this is helping but it's not helping in ways that are really concrete and it's hard to pin down how it is helpful and so that was nice for me to say here is something that is really good. But I also, I don't know to what extent you've seen this as helpful for me. So, make you feel better. It's not-(pause) [00:40:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have thoughts, ideas about the extent to which I think this is helpful for you? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I feel like we have kind of stalled a bit, at least in the last six weeks, not six weeks but I don't know. You know there is always the fear that you will say, "You know things really don't work anyway, we should stop." Which I know is counter effectual and so I just mostly don't even voice it. (inaudible at 41:40) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That upsets you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is-(crying) that you know, I guess I don't know, you will say "well, if you feel abandoned by this". And no I don't but like I do. [00:42:10]</p>

<p>I am really scared that the people who are taking care of me are (crying) you know somewhere and they'll die. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I wonder if-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to get things right. (pause) (crying) [00:42:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean that sounds pretty central and important. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It strains what you can say and what you think and feel here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which by the way, (inaudible at 43:22) reflection of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But you know, it's kind of like, oh Tanya has been an issue. Here is a fucking surprise and so I don't even talk about it. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you asked early on about transferring maybe, if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's it right there. That you've got to be good. You've got to work hard and you better say the right things according to whatever standard you have in mind as far as (inaudible at 44:02) I'm going to leave. [00:44:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that I think, that one right there I think is a pretty central (inaudible 44:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I work for the other (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would much rather that people leave because of something I did than that people leave because of their own reasons. You know I wouldn't actually rather that but if it is the former I can do something about it. I can't do anything about the latter. People just leave. (pause) [00:44:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We just (inaudible at 44:58) also flag your thoughts about things that we are kind of stalled here in the last few weeks and I'm sorry (ph) about how I think things are going or where I think things are going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:45:29]</p>

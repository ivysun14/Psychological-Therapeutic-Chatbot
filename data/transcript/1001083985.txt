<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm pretty good.  I'm getting over being sick for over a month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh no, whatcha have?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, it was, uh, sinusitis and the other thing I had to get a CT scan, in fact, I'm gonna see the ear and sinus specialist today and, uh, I think some of it could have been stress related because of the trip I was gonna go on to Europe, that my brother's treating everybody to so I cancelled out on it because I felt, I felt, I didn't really want to go and I may have created myself getting sick so I didn't have to go.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's part of my pattern and, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you find yourself really stressed and worried about it or thinking about it and obsessing about it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, actually to be honest I was afraid of flying over the ocean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you ever done it before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not flying over the ocean, no, but I've flown and since [DATE] I haven't been comfortable flying and, uh, so I went to Maryland for a week, spent time with my daughter. She was house hunting or, uh, you know apartment hunting for when she retires from the Air Force and we did find a place, a lovely place and I noticed I was getting more better each day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was after you told your brother?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I was try, I was working on reducing my stress and, uh, when I came home, after a week of being away, I felt pretty good.  When I came home to my apartment I felt sick again, like I had been before, so I realized it could have been the heating system in my apartment so I went out and bought myself a humidifier, which has really made a big difference.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, I'm feeling pretty good.  Not totally one hundred percent good, but feeling pretty good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, I got back into being involved in meetings at AA, which I had gotten away from and I even got a sponsor in AA and, uh, I feel refreshed and renewed in my program of AA, yknow, I didn't pick up a drink when I stopped going to meetings or went very infrequently, but I got into this stinkin thinkin thing, you know what I mean, like they say if you don't go to meetings and get the benefit of the meetings sometimes you get into that alcoholic thinking.  It's kinda self destructive of everything.  So I have a sponsor and last night I went and saw a movie and one of my big vices is that I steal movies.  I go to the movies and only pay one fee and then I stay for two or three movies, but last night I decided not to do that.  I just saw the one movie and I decided if I want to see two and three movies, I'll go when it's only four dollars and I'll buy three tickets, so then I will be not stealing the movies.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Major breakthrough cause my daughter, who's in the program too, who's in AA she always said oh mom, you know you're in AA you're not supposed to be doing those kinda things.  So I called her up last night when I came home and I said I stopped stealing movies, but uh - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So actually I mean you actually go physically to the movie theatre - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I pay for the, I pay for the thing and then instead of going home after the first movie, I stay and see a second or a third.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You go into another theater or something like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I even know the best theater's to do it in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] is the best of all.  And, um, other than that I'm working on my hobby things.  I told you I make those tapes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And, uh, I'm doing more for getting my thoughts across on the automatic relaxation responses and, uh, I'm scared.  I'm as afraid of success as I am of failure and it's been a long time I've been working on this.  Um, I'm getting a little more aggressive with it.  I put, I'm advertising in the Yellow Pages.  I'm gonna be advertising in the Yellow Pages.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For the tapes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I updated my copyright.  Instead of what I had before, call it, win, win stress management creates, um, sanctuary and a position of power for us and a degree of healing for others.  That's what I decided on and, uh, so in June the Yellow Pages will have it in it and I have the business DSL, that I have to get somebody to help me with the web page and my telephone numbers, I have two telephone numbers, I have the eight hundred number and a regular number and I have the message on there so I'm progressing with it.  It's just something that is my passion and close to my heart and that's that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Still making it to the center?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pardon me?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Going to the center.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, I haven't been there for a while because I was in Maryland for a week and I feel real good that I decided on not going to Europe with everybody.  Of course, they're all still going.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your family, your kids.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fifty seven of them and I was the fifty eighth.  My five children, their spouses and my ten grandchildren, they're all going to Austria with all of my nieces and nephews and my other siblings.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many people total?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fifty eight my brother's treating to Europe.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> His family and your family or fifty eight in your family?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fifty eight of his family, which includes me.  Which includes me.  My, uh, five children and the one's who are married, their spouses and my ten grandchildren, they're all going.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That would be twenty.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then my nieces and nephews and my sister, my two sisters are going too and their children.  I just decided it wasn't my cup of tea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When are they all going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's not too far away.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It came to me when you're a cripple, yknow, you have to accept your limitations of when you're a cripple.  You don't join a race and run a marathon and that's how myself, you know, emotionally and what my, yknow, what my interests are.  I'm not going to Europe and trudging around Austria.  It's, yknow, going to a good meeting, going to a good movie, having a good meal, those kinds of things are my happiness. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean you started off using the analogy if you were a cripple.  I don't know I mean it sounds to me like you just made the decision that you didn't want to go.  I wouldn't say I mean, it's not your cup of tea, I mean sure even in the Boston Marathon there are people in wheelchairs, yknow, that complete the race, but there's always people with disabilities that are, you know, showing that they're not, but there are things they want to race.  You know they want to be in the race.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, could I say limitations?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or just that your interests are, you don't, you don't want to travel, you don't want to see Austria.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  I thought I wanted to go because my kids were all going and my grandkids were all going and then it dawned on me, not wanting to go was really primary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, how did your kids react to your not going?  What did they say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My one daughter said I support you in your decision.  The other one said whatever's best for you, mom.  Some of the grandkids said why?  And I explained to the best of my ability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, it sounds like they understand and I that's the important thing.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They do and I've had a wonderful time with my children, all five of them were together recently because, uh, we got through getting her daughter her place pretty early so we came up north, you know, and, uh, all five of them were together and uh, I feel very blessed.  I'm getting in touch with the fact that all my children have turned out to be joys, I mean absolutely wonderful.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you've had the opportunity for them to be all together to have like - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the one who's retiring from the Air Force she's moving to the east coast, she's moving to Maryland.  [DEIDENTIFIED], Maryland is a lovely place, very lovely and she got the kind of apartment that I wanted her to have.  That, you know, in the beginning she thought she had to stay in a low priced thing and, but I kind of influenced her to get a year's lease so she'll be locked into a certain price and not have them look for a house right away and she got the kind of apartment that has the pool, has the exercise room, has all the amenities that I wanted her to have while she was in first retired and lovely, lovely.  The Residences at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's so nice, it's a luxury apartment house.  It's three buildings and absolutely lovely.  So it turns out she ended up with exactly what I wanted for her and that made me feel great.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And now that I'm back in AA I find that and I'm going to meetings on a regular basis and the sponsor, I used to call her every day, but sometimes I skip a day and she's [AGE] years old, she's been sober twenty three or twenty nine years.  She's lives in public housing, yknow, as I do in a nice place for the elderly and she is divorced so we have a lot in common, too.  I call her, I call her usually every day, tell her what I've been doing, if I went to a meeting, sometimes I meet her at a meeting. So things are pretty good.  I'm still working on the weight issue.  I'm working on getting rid of my obesity.  And I have some thoughts on it, but I haven't you know, implemented it yet.  And when I decided not to go to Europe, I didn't call my brother at all, I called my sister, I cried to her.  I told her that I was backing out and I let my sister deal with it, deal with my brother. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Have you tried - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't want to do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you talked to him since?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he's called me for my birthday and sang happy birthday to me.  No, I haven't talked to him.  It's a thing where he doesn't really return my calls.  I annoy him or I cause him pain on the phone because I just do and, uh, my oldest son even said having a conversation with me sometimes he gets a headache.  So my brother doesn't call me back and I don't know if that has something to do with me not wanting to go too.  I felt disrespected and that's why I didn't call him and tell him I wasn't going.  I called my sister, let my sister deal with it and she took care of it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She did?  I mean is the discomfort with your brother more the issue or is it really the flying and the not wanting to Europe. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Combination of everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cause it sounds like, okay, if Europe's not your thing, your brother's still your brother, so at some point.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I love my brother.  You know, we're both flawed and our flaws kinda rub each other the wrong way.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you tried maybe writing out what you want to say to him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, you can't make somebody respect you?  You know what I mean?  It's a case where if somebody doesn't value you or respect you, you can't insist that they do. You kinda have to roll with the punches and get out of the line of fire. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I mean even if you feel that he doesn't respect, if you were feeling uncomfortable about not being direct with him, needing to go to your sister.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then maybe there's a way to look at that, you know, of doing all that you can do yourself.  You know what I'm saying.  Um, finding a way to be able to communicate to him in some way directly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Card, I'm gonna buy him, her and him birthday cards.  Her birthday's this month and his birthday is next month and I'm gonna go to Hallmark up in [DEIDENTIFIED]really pick out some fun cards.  Oh, I did ask him, I think I told you when I had that psychotic episode that I wanted to stab my sister in law to death and you said I was angry and it was okay that I had those thoughts, but I didn't act on them, which was good, but I had told my brother about that.  I had, yknow, discussed that with my brother and they started sending me cards about our family history and like it was always referring to well at least nobody got killed yet and I felt he was, he was kind of bringing up the fact that I was gonna kill her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or that you talked with him about that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, when I called on the phone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That was how long ago?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I left a message.  Well the last card that said at least nobody's killed anybody yet I did, when I called him on the phone about something, I did ask him not to send me those kind of cards anymore.  Because it made me uncomfortable.  It kept on,  I said it brings up my last psychotic episode, but I never heard from them or anything.  He only invites my sister down to Florida.  He hasn't invited me down for ten years.  Not that I would even go, but I feel, I feel bad sometimes.  I don't think he invites my sister, [NAME OTHER], either.  It's just that my sister, [NAME OTHER], is like the surrogate mother to all of us.  We kind of really love her as the matriarch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I think given everything that's been happening, it's probably is a wise decision not to spend that whole period in June.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So in place of that I'm getting operated on for a hernia on the [DATE] of this month and I'm hoping that by the time those things occur, that time period, I'll have planted a beautiful garden in the back and the front and that's how I'll use the time, constructively.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well do you need prescriptions today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don't think I do.  I think I still have some, oh, prescriptions even though I lose them I take them in case I don't lose them, um, the samples I don't need because I think I have some left over from what you gave me before and I'm trying to be more honest and not, uh, not do, not do the wrong thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're okay with the Risperdal and the Zoloft?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I think the combination of the medicines that I take.  I did go back to taking a whole yellow pill of the Klonopin.  I had cut back to .25 and now I'm back to .5. I take a whole one - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When things get a little stressful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because it said on the bottle take as needed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.  And it works with one.  Up to one.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Cause you never misuse it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I don't even take the whole.  It's .5, it's the little yellow one, I take.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, I think we actually just called in renewals on your prescriptions, but you know what I probably should write them for you cause I'm not sure how many refills were there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'm gonna keep that in the car underneath the mat so I won't lose them in the apartment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm thinking the last two weeks maybe two of them, I forget which two were called in but - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The Risperdal, I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And maybe Klonopin.  I don't think it was the Zoloft or the Neurontin, but - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They give me a generic brand for the Neurontin.  Gaba something, gaba.  That combination of the medicine I think, I think it's really done well, except I had that one psychotic episode when I got mad at my sister in law.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like it was pretty brief and things fell back into place pretty quickly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes and my children were very supportive.  I told you my son, my son said they don't even sell switchblades anymore so we don't have to worry about her getting one and stabbing her.  But the realization of how happy I am was how my children turned out, my grandchildren.  That's given me a lot of pleasure and happiness.  I had a time that I was in the presence of my ex husband and his wife too, on Christmas, I don't know if I've been here since Christmas?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You were here in January.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right then I may have told you that I had a good, a good meeting with them. They insisted on coming when it was my time with my son.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I didn't leave early because of it and it turned out very well.  She even brought me a present when she came, but I didn't go, uh, she brought me an Easter bread thing, which was very nice of her.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She gave it to my son to give me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like you have adult relationships and that you have a connection with your son still.  That there's a respect that's there despite the differences from the past. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I think he realizes that, uh, in spite of my limitations that the children were raised in a good way.  They bonded because of how they were raised with the deprivations and things like that, they did get some, you know, good things from me and, uh, they are so close to each other, they're so supportive.  My daughter who is driving in from California to Maryland in late August, her sister, you know, my other daughter is flying out to California to drive in with her and they're gonna have a road trip from California to Maryland.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which I didn't want them to do cause I think of serial killers killing young girls on the, well they're not young anymore, and uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You've been going to too many of these movies.
PT; No, no, no.  It happens, and, um, but guess what, they vetoed me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, your daughter's in the Air Force, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your daughter's in the Air Force?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's retiring.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right from the Air Force?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's been military?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twenty one years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's really institutionalized.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But she's pretty independent and can take care of herself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.  I'm sure serial killers kill those kind of people, too. I just didn't want them to take a road trip.  I wanted something else.  I wanted her to sell the car out there and fly in.  But they vetoed me.  I even called my sons to tell them to go out. I thought a man being with them would be better.  I thought if she asked her father to fly - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Men get killed by serial killers, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not as often.  Not as often.  But they vetoed my concerns and they're gonna have a good time making the road trip.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep and you'll probably hear very good stories when they get, when they make it here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let's get you on another visit here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Thanks for doing this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, that's fine.</p>

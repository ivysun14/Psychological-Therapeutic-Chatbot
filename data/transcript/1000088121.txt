<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>THERAPIST: Interview Number 5, January 21, 1971, Client 0222-115, Interview Number 5.

Did you go to work?

</p><p>PATIENT: What?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Did you go to work?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, not today either. The dude is in Springfield that's supposed to start the job so he's found an excuse for at least another day. I did get notice that I got a reduction in the charges for the amount of therapy though. I don't know who that went through. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well it goes through, there's [anomaly of a fee committee] (ph) and then one person handles all the business for a certain amount of time. So it's usually quite automatic. 0:01:20.6

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: That's the machine. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, the squeaking. Oh yeah, I'd hope so. Wow, if that was one of those plants I'd really [be freaking.] (ph). 

</p><p>THERAPIST: If it were, it would probably be that one there. [The grungy one. I think that's a whiner.] (ph) 0:01:48.2

</p><p>PATIENT: What, does it grow rather rapidly? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, I don't know. Not as fast as this one.0:01:53.5

</p><p>PATIENT: But that one doesn't look like it would make a squeak. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: No. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I see. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Or a high pitched whine. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Oh, uh, I had thought that it was because of the government's little brainstorm of moving holidays to either be on a Monday or a Friday so that people could have a long weekend, (inaudible at 0:02:30.5) weekend. But I noticed this in February on Lincoln's Birthday came on a Friday, the following Monday was Washington. Now is that where they are normally? Are those the two proper dates?

</p><p>THERAPIST: The following Monday? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like the 12th and 15th or something. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh no, of course not. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't pay any attention to someone's birthday that has been dead for 6,000 years. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: No, I think the reason why that sticks in my mind is that it is one of the items on a test I was taught to give was when was Washington's Birthday. So that's indelible (overlapping) 0:03:04.4

</p><p>PATIENT: I failed! (laughs)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Some people don't know it. A lot of people don't. I'm just kind of a dutiful citizen type, I guess. Or I was when I was when I was little. No, (inaudible at 0:03:18.0) No. 

</p><p>PATIENT: What is it, the 12th and 17th?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Wait a minute. They've got that on this calendar. February 15th, Washington's Birthday. Well, it's not right. It's February 22nd. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Ok, good. Because I've been planning since Christmas to make the trip to Boise during that 4 day weekend. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Clearly that's what they've done. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I was speaking to Joe Cobb (sp) last night and he said "well, I don't care what they put on calendars. Those aren't the ones where you'll get vacation. They've split it so that you'll get two different Mondays." And I thought, my God, now why would they change the dates to make it handy and then change them again and make it less handy. But he being in the Governor's office I figured he would know more about it than I. I hope he's wrong. (chuckles) 0:04:06.9

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well, it looks like (inaudible at 0:04:10.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: Good. And I found I'll probably be leaving for Boise a week from tomorrow. On about, it's going to be the damndest thing I've ever done. There's a guy that's all hepped up. He wants to go down to Boise to meet some of the guys that he's heard me talk about. And he also loves to drive. And we want to go down to Main Port and we plan on picking up three keys nice and cheap from my old friends back in Boise. So we were going to take off Friday night and drive down there. It's a 12 hour drive so we'll probably get there just about dawn Saturday. And do whatever we want on Saturday. Then he sprung on us the little surprise that he has to be at work noon Sunday which means we'd have to leave at the very, very latest at 12:00 Saturday night. 0:05:13.7

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: So I don't know whether I'll quite accept that or not. I think what I may do is go ahead and go down with him and Josh and I will come back in Josh's car a little later. Get at least one stretch in there. And here I am all tired after 12 hours sleep again. I swear I've got a terminal case of boredom. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: That was (inaudible at 0:05:46.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I get out of the house once a day. Usually as far as the mailbox. And seldom ever farther than to here. And that's been going on since December 30th. (chuckles)

</p><p>We even had a huge slice taken out of our record collection lately while this guy is taping a bunch of them up on the North side. So I can't even get lost in music like I used to. Happens to be the better half of it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: What's that feel like during the day? Or the times that you're awake? 0:06:34.6

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm just in kind of a daze. I've learned not to get too aware of it. I just kind of get lost in the moment and just kind of trip through it. There's really not much to do. I sleep to hell noon or later every day. Doesn't hurt. It used to be I would have spent the day in a doped up daze, but I don't know. Between the first of November and about the second week of January I was stoned almost constantly. I just kind of ran out of willpower lately. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure I catch that. You ran out of willpower. What does? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean ran out of, it's hardly worth it to get stoned anymore because being straight is almost that much of a difference after being stoned that much. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometime I would like to compare two tapes of these sessions. One when I'm in a mood like this where I just kind of sit in a daze and hardly say anything. And one where I'm talking constantly. I don't know what I'd find. It would just be interesting. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you get they'd be very different. (inaudible at 08:04.0)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, no doubt. No doubt in the world. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:08:11.3) if you're saying something like it somehow bothers you just to sit here or whatever, however you describe the non talking state. 

</p><p>PATIENT: In a way yeah. After sitting here for about three minutes and not saying anything and nothing should come to my mind. And then I'll kind of realize that I was here to talk so I'll start kind of just turning the pages over and deciding what comes to mind. Like I told you about before what I can say something about and what I can't. But usually But usually I get tripped (ph) into that and end up not saying anything anyway. 

</p><p>What are those?

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh they're just little cigars. Would you like one? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I have a hell of a time keeping from it but I don't. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You have a hell of a time?

</p><p>PATIENT: Keeping from it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Keeping from smoking? Did you once smoke? 0:09:26.6

</p><p>PATIENT: No, you see I quit smoking about last October. And I've smoked on and off for several years now. The hardest part of smoking is getting out of the habit. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: After I've forgotten the garbagy mouth that it would leave me with after three packs during a night and all the rest of that I still have the habit left. There's not even much defense against it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I had to wait quite a while after I stopped smoking cigarettes before I started smoking these. I've always been afraid that, and I really have the feeling that I could go back to it so easily. [At the current time] (ph) I just want a cigarette, right? 0:10:08.2

</p><p>PATIENT: It scares me too. I don't know. I've considered going back to smoking a pipe a couple of times. But I don't know if it would be a good idea or not. Good idear? Did I really say that? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Good idear?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's what it sounded like the first time I said it. I don't know. It had to be a sloppy tongue. That's not part of my normal dialect. 

</p><p>Have you ever noticed that people often play games with willpower? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think you'd have to say a little more (inaudible at 0:11:27.7)

</p><p>PATIENT: Like, I remember when I was in high school. Oh, high school is like the last three years of school in the public schools where I came from. And it was kind of a game that I knew a lot of the kids that weren't involved in a lot of the normal social activities. In other words they didn't make it as jocks and they weren't exactly beauty queens. So that left about three fourths of the school to be completely by themselves. Strange way of putting it but that's the way it was. At any rate, I knew that it was quite common. It wasn't something that was talked about very much but I remember that many of the people had kind of games that they would play with themselves. What reminded me of this, is I remember Josh talking the other night about how he used to go for, see if he could go for three, or four, or five or six days without sleep. And I've known people to do the same with fasting, without water and things like that. I was wondering what it was people are supposed to teach themselves with that. Or if they're doing it just out of the interest of completely no gain just for the hell of whatever comes from doing it during that time. 0:12:50.5

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think there must have been kids that I was in high school with that did that kind of thing. I have vague recollections of it. It was more boys that did it than girls. But I can't remember anything specific. But it sounds like, I heard some quizzical note in you voice that made me wonder were you thinking that's sort of an odd thing to do if you do, if you're not doing, just to do it? Or it seems strange to you to do it that way or?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it's like. I was wondering if maybe, whether conscious or not, the reason, the thing that would interest a person in that kind of thing would be that to the effect that some day I will have to go without sleep. Or it will help teach me my limits or something like that. Or are they just going "wow, it's interesting. I'll see what it's like to starve to death and go without food for four or five days." I don't know. But I've done things like that and I just can't even remember myself why. Evidently it didn't have any purpose. But then again, I've run into situations afterwards where I would be without sleep for many days or food or something like that and I remember looking back at the times when I did do it and didn't have to. 0:14:32.7

</p><p>THERAPIST: And what you're feeling was that in some way you were more able to...

</p><p>PATIENT: No, usually when I did it out of need I was too much a mess to really find any moral justification for ever doing that at all. The only times I've ever gone for sleep without any amount of time was when I was speeding. Or one time the girl I had been going with for about four and a half years told me that she had been living with some other guy for about three months. And I guess I wasn't in much shape to make a moral quest or any kind of judgments about whether I'd done purpose to it or nor. I had to wait for about five days anyway. (chuckles) 0:15:27.7

</p><p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it happens at very disruptive times for you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah well, anything that pushes me to a limit like that usually is a bit of a strain one way or another. 

</p><p>Oh, I got a letter from Jessica. I suppose a letter is as close, a girl that I go with back in Boise. And it's the most cryptic thing that I've ever seen. It consists of about eight pages of poetry and a couple of two page or two and a half page stories that none of it makes any sense whatsoever to me. So I'll probably blow another wad on a long distance telephone call to see what's in her head. Wow! 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well I hear you saying you're puzzled by it but does it worry you or does that mean to you that there's some need?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. That's an interesting point too. Because it's like I just can't seem to get interested in it. I noticed tonight I was going to write. I decided that I haven't done any writing in quite a while and I used to really enjoy it. So I sat down. Couldn't write. So I smoked a pipe full of weed and still couldn't write. I just. Writing isn't something that I know how to do anyway. It's something that just kind of happens to me when I really feel like I have to do it. And I just couldn't find anything that held my interest worth a damn to be able to write about it. I guess it comes from being bored for so long now that it's pervading everything. I'm just learning to ignore the entire world. Even the troubles that seem to be brewing between Jess and I aren't all that important to me anymore. I figure that there's not a whole lot going to be done about it. It's just something that's going to have to go its course with time. 0:18:03.8

</p><p>THERAPIST: I guess it sort of sounds like, to me as you're talking that you're beginning to feel sort of blunted. Because a lot of things are boring and nothing much is happening so when things do happen sort of don't engage you. Like this business with Jessica. Like sort of you're standing off, you may be puzzled by it but not actively drawn in by it. Is that about right?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, although I don't know whether that. I mean I'm not even interested in whether it's going to be good or bad for me. That's kind of just where I'm at anyway. It doesn't matter to me. 0:18:59.7

</p><p>THERAPIST: What's going to be good or bad?

</p><p>PATIENT: Not being involved in it like I normally would be. Not being an activist. I'm a terrible activist. Usually if something confronts me and if I don't understand it, don't control it, or don't like it, why then I'll do something about. Be it just in thought process or in action. But it's like I'm just, it's not part of me to be involved in it any more. At least for the time being. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's like I have this image that usually you leap up and grab whatever it is by the throat until you've got it where you understand it or it makes sense to you. And now you, well yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine, whatever.

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.0:19:44.8

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's maybe mildly interesting for a couple of seconds but not worth going out and grappling with or something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Whew.

</p><p>THERAPIST: What?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know why. It's only maybe in the last 48 hours that I've kind of noticed this attitude and I've recognized, I can look back and recognize it developing but it could be a thing that will pass away or it could be that I will even rationalize a reason for staying this way if I decide I like it. Now there's a strange thought? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Strange to think you could like such a thing or? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well no. Strange to think that one could consciously and so manipulatively build their own personality. (inaudible at 0:21:07.5) is a better way of saying it. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It's all sort of laughable to say such a thing. Maybe I'll stay this way. Who's got such a choice? 0:21:15.3

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Right. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: So right now you (inaudible at 0:21:26.1) kind of observe. I don't hear you feeling one way or other about it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Tonight I just don't really feel much of one way or another about anything. I've been in just a completely bleh mood all day. Not happy, not sad, not active, not inactive. I couldn't care less. I could have slept through the day and it probably would've meant just about the same thing to me. 0:21:52.4

Do they have any idea what it is they are looking for in their research?

</p><p>THERAPIST: No. They probably know. I don't know. When I'm involved in research, I usually don't want to find much out about it until after I'm finished. I have a feeling that when, you know after the sessions, after this bunch of sessions is over and the testing is over that they are probably going to be willing to talk to you a little bit about it. They usually are. I haven't asked them but I'm sure they would be. Other than that I don't know. Do you have any feelings about being in their research at all? 0:23:33.1

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Not at all. (chuckles)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well this, isn't the day to ask you that, is it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: This, isn't what?

</p><p>THERAPIST: This, is not the day to ask you if you have feelings about being in the research.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh well. I don't care. Nobody's asked me that way before. No it doesn't bother me at all. It's kind of fun. It's like knowing that your phone is tapped. And getting to manipulate. It's like making your phone that much handier. (chuckles)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm. That somehow has negative connotations. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, we used to play. We used to play. Well, it's not that that's a tapped phone. It's like it's an added dimension that makes it that much more useful. Not that much less useful. Like, somebody once had a tapped phone. And we used to have just a real gas giving people fits. We'd arrange dope deals over the phone and guys showed up at certain street corner with a shirt box under his arm. And the other guy showed up. And of course they both had been aware of what was going on. And he was supposed to bring the stuff. So there he was with the shirt box. And that was all that it was referred to as. And the other guy says "well, I'll bring some money." So they got there and the guy gives him a couple of bills and the other guy gives him the shirt box. And all of a sudden 400 cops come flying out of the middle of everywhere. And the shirt box was full of shirts and the guy gave him $12 for it. (laughs) Oh, I never laughed so hard. 0:25:18.4

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmmph.

I guess the image I get is like these people are very seriously involved in what they hear on the phone, on the phone tapping. What they hear on the tape. And it's sort of funny to think that sending them all over Robin Hood's barn or whatever. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like most of my ramblings don't even make sense to me. They're just going to play hell trying to find something in it. Or maybe they will and I won't and that will make it that much more interesting to me. 

This place is even stranger looking at night. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: [Oh, the chapel?] (ph) 0:26:52.3

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. The black backdrop. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's weird. That's one of the better things to look at. It and the Geophysical Science Building. Do you know that one?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. A friend took me, or Matt (sp?) was the one that showed me that just the other night. I was out walking with him when it was snowing a couple of nights back and he took me over and showed me that. I'd never seen it before. 0:27:14.9

</p><p>THERAPIST: I'd love to go. I think it's a beautiful building. 

</p><p>PATIENT: We tried to get in. It was locked up. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I think it's just so neat. It's so unlike this University. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not a gargoyle on it. (chuckles)

</p><p>THERAPIST: No, it's all turrets (ph) and stuff. You know a couple of times you've said this business about making sense. I wonder if you wish you made more sense for yourself sometimes. Or if it was easier for you to get with what you're saying. I'm not sure.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't think that that was what was on my mind then. I was just kind of rambling then. I suppose that occurs to me sometimes. Like if I should have a memory lag. Something's just out of reach to me or something like that. I always wish that I could have a total recall kind of mind where I need never try and where it isn't an effort to concentrate and recall something. But I don't doubt that everybody feels that. So there's no qualms about it. I just think it would be kind of a fantasy nice thing. 0:28:32.0

</p><p>And not making sense is another tapped telephone. I just love to not make sense sometimes. Usually it's obvious that I'm not. And I'm enjoying it when I'm not. When I get really stoned I love to talk crazy. Tye and I do that. In fact we about drove a guy nuts one night because we got really stoned and started talking crazy. And we have thousands of hours of raps that we've gone through that actually have almost precise line for line interplay of nonsensical raps about I just got a new job. I work at the zoo. I'm a duck. Et cetera, et cetera. The other guy replays as a straight man. Tell me about your job as a duck. There's thousands of things like that. 0:29:19.3

</p><p>We used to develop these little raps just to freak people out who hadn't heard them before. It was fun. And you get too stoned to do that or you get to a point where things kind of section off in time. You have a span of maybe four seconds where you can accept things and then they just whiz right on by you. And we'll get to the point where something will come into us. Something will make an impression. A piece of music. Or somebody will walk into the room. Somebody will spill a coke or something like that. Just anything that happens to make an impression on you. And you'll start talking about it. And you just kind of talk to yourself a crazy little rap around that one thing. Just start talking on a spiral and take it, down to nothing. And then you kind of look up and wait a few seconds until something else comes in and you talking crazy again about it. 0:30:07.6

</p><p>Wes I guess was awfully stoned and he doesn't drop very often. We were on acid that night. [He just kind of looked up.] (ph) And we said Wes you haven't said anything for four hours. And he said "well you two haven't stopped talking for four hours so I could say something." And we kind of realized that it was true. So I was explaining to him that we just like to talk. That half the fun of getting that stoned was just to be that crazy. And what's the good of being that crazy if you couldn't let other people know how it was fun to be that crazy. And talking was just another way of doing it. 

</p><p>So Tye who is probably one of the ugliest people I know. It's a shame. He's one of the nicest people I know. But he is ugly as sin. And he came walking up the stairway. And he has real curly hair that just stuck out all over. And he looked at, I had just been talking to Wes and he hadn't been there when I explained that we were talking crazy. And Tye came walking up and I said something and Wes said "there, you're talking crazy." And Tye says "Yeah, man we just go crazy!" And he fell on the floor and started laughing and giggling and clapping his hands. I guess Wes just thought we really were crazy but he never got out of it. So later that night he kind of got into the idea of what was going on. But he was quite convinced that Josh and I really were completely flipped out there for a while. But that was the fun of it. Wow, that's a long rap to get around to it. But not making sense can really be a gas sometimes. 0:31:52.8

</p><p>I told you about that game that we played called double rap or double talk or whatever. Where somebody says a short phrase and you have to say something as unconnected as possible. 

</p><p>THERAPIST:[Yeah, I remember that, yeah] (ph) 0:32:07.9

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, about this time last year when I was living back in Boise and especially on a weekend, but every night there were bound to be anywhere from five to fifty people running around. And there'd usually be from five to twenty people that were stoned on acid. And we'd get together sometimes and start doing that double talk and everybody would get too ripped to keep it going all together because everybody would be talking at once at first. And you'd break down into little groups where you can handle it easier. You can't keep track of what 20 people are saying but three or four that's fine. And it kind of comes to a, it's like a game of wits to see who can be best at it. And if somebody mentioned a color, it gets to a point where you can't even not mention it right after, but you can't mention it for maybe four more phrases or something like that. You can tell how intricate it is by how long it is before common things get renamed.

</p><p>Well then you get broken down and people have their own order of what's safe to use and what isn't according to which group their in and what's been mentioned. And then you start drifting from group to group. So that you have to fall into a new group and learn a new order of what's been used and what hasn't. 0:33:41.7

</p><p>Well, we got into that really heavy one night and a friend came over that was, well he was not straight but he was a straight. Didn't know that we were dopers. Wasn't supposed to know. And we'd gotten into that so that we couldn't talk normally. It was like the talking was an effort after doing that. We got so patterned at it that we began to do that by habit. And the poor guy got so confused. But I talked to him later and he had thought it was really one of the coolest practical jokes he'd ever seen. That all of us should catch on and be able to be so good at it just like that. But he thought as he walked in that we had just decided to play a game on him. He didn't understand that we just couldn't quite manage to make sense to him. Not making sense. Now who would have believed that when I flipped to that little page that I had so much to say about it. (chuckles) 0:34:56.8

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess what that says to me is look there are a lot of times when I really enjoy not making sense. It's part of something I really like. And what I was asking about was, not this time when you said it, but when you mentioned it first. But a couple of other times I had some sense that you might be uneasy about it at times. And that's what I was asking about. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Uh.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Now I'm not saying that I suspect there are. Or I know you don't like it or something like that but really I'm just wondering. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Wow. Ponder that one. I suppose if I felt that what I was saying wasn't being connotative. That we had different. Yeah, I've been hyped up before by the inability in reality of an abstract thought being broken down into a thought form and then putting further into a word form. And then having to be broken down into a different set of thought forms. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That because of my inadequate vocabulary or just the inadequacy of vocabulary that the idea isn't getting across, sometimes I get frustrated. But usually I'll make it clear that that's what's bothering me. I'll just say, well wow it's hard to say it. Or something like that. 0:36:32.3

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Ok. That sounds different. That sounds to me like sometimes it really bothers you when you can't convey what you want to. And you know pretty well what you mean.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:36:49.8)

</p><p>PATIENT: I've found vocabulary to be a big problem in that a lot of times that emotions are often far more real to me than many other things. I don't deny the existence of a chair there on normal levels. But emotions at least seem to be more of what I act with, what cause my world to move along than other real things. And vocabulary is probably most lacking in the communication of an emotion. Solid objects it can handle with ease because they're almost an abstract in themselves. But, well, yeah in a way. I don't know how I could say that even. But at any rate it can handle a dimensional thing more than it can handle a, and here I have to use the term again, abstract of like an emotion. 0:38:28.4

</p><p>THERAPIST: What that made me think of was like if you try to describe an object it is contained. It is self contained. It has its limits and you can describe those. But emotions aren't so, it is not so clear what they are. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. I can't think of anything that has less meaning than love. And yet it should have so much. Because it is just too many, it goes from one extreme to another in what it could mean. Just in everyday language. Of course you can put it in context and it might mean a little more. But it is still a wasted word. 

</p><p>Spring. Warm weather and green things don't really start showing up around here until May, do they?

</p><p>THERAPIST: April. It begins to get semi-decent around April. That is, I'm lucky enough to have a garden. You can see the green things coming up then. But in terms of [planet balminess] (ph). That sweetness in the air doesn't come until May. And then only when the pollution's not bad. (chuckles)

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles)

</p><p>THERAPIST: Seems kind of far away now, huh? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm going to have to start planning at least this far back so that I can be sure to get out of the city for a week or so around then. Where I grew up, always having access to being out in the country and just being by myself out fishing or something like that. I haven't done it for four or five years now. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It really takes a toll. You don't realize how much you miss it. And then, in this city it is like, I don't know. I've lived in cities before and when you went outside there was something much (inaudible a 0:42:06.4) around New York. And it is very, it makes me very anti-Midwestern. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I love the Midwest. I just don't like Midwest, well I don't like cities anyway. I don't mind the country. I don't mind the climate. I'd much rather be up in the Northwest. The prettiest thing I ever saw was the Oregon coast. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: I have a friend who really deeply loves the Oregon coast. He says there's nothing like it. 0:42:41.8

</p><p>PATIENT: I've only seen it once and I'll just, wow, remember it forever if I never see it again. Just beautiful. It's the ruggedest country I've ever seen. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: You know, talking about that made me feel like I wanted to get on a plane to go out to San Francisco and work by the beaches. Have you been hearing about that? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, the tanker ripped open again? Jesus. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And all these people out there trying to, sounds like in some ways, a futile effort. But it sounds really great that there are all these kids out there. You know, young children as well as..

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hm. I don't know what they can do to clean that crap up. I heard today on the news where some company got fined a quarter of a million dollars for a huge oil spill that they caused somewhere that probably did 400 times that in damage to the ecology. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: That could be a dime. (chuckles) Nixon's laws. 

</p><p>What is that plant? 0:44:12.0

</p><p>THERAPIST: What? That plant? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Um hmm. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: It is a cutting from that plant. And it is called ecolius (ph). A very common plant but they come in zillions of colors. And this one just happens to be really green (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can't even remember what it looked like. I guess it had shiny flatter leaves. But my mother used to grow a real colorful plant called Joseph's Coat. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Oh I haven't seen that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It reminded me of it. It had a leaf about that size but it was flat and shiny, I guess. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Hmm. I'll have to look that up. I'm growing this for someone but I want to get it to a decent place before I give it away. It kind of looks raunchy. I may try another cutting. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Why are both those people in those pictures holding their hand up by their ear? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Well it is the same person. He is making faces at the camera. You mean that? 

</p><p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Just being silly. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I wonder if this thing is recording that squeak. 

</p><p>THERAPIST:I don't think so. 

</p><p>PATIENT: There, you got a good shot at it. (chuckles)

</p><p>Wow! What is today? The 21st? 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Yes. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Ok. Whew. I've lost track of everything. It took me 20 minutes the other day to find out what day of the week it was. (chuckles) Finding the delights of just being a slob. A mental slob. (chuckles)

</p><p>It got warm today didn't it? When I came down here was the first time I got out but I noticed the snow was melted and such. 0:46:35.3

</p><p>THERAPIST: [It did try.] (ph) 0:46:42.5

</p><p>PATIENT: Over 40 even. Damn hair tickles my ear. May as well close up. 

</p><p>THERAPIST: Ok. 0:47:33.2

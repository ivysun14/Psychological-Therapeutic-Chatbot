<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) disaster</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Apparently it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I had to - I waited for a bus which was very foolish. And I didn't walk because two buses were trying to get down the street at the same time. I got out and said thank you very much. It's only like - normally it's like a half an hour walk. But Chicago is fine. It's great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like so civilized. I have to get my shoes fixed. Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hi.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't bother to dig out my (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Dig out what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Dig out the car to start. I just walked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I've been being transported with Humvees. They were - because I was volunteering at the hospital so few people could make it in. So I've been getting out that way. I didn't have to walk for two days so I was kind of surprised. It's okay. I used the time left even though I was frustrated. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were feeling frustrated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because it's taking so long to get here. I mean (inaudible). It's too early for most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do when you're frustrated?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I stopped being frustrated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You stopped?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I concentrated on being frustrated. I said forget this there isn't anything that you can do about this. You know if you want to walk, you walk. So walk. And once you get on the path or something and stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was ... I don't - I don't let myself get frustrated that way anymore - not by that kind of stuff. I think I got it under control. I got. So I was thinking about last week. I had a couple of things that I thought of. I talked to you ... I talked to - here you know when I - we were driving and I said I think I found something that I have a praise now. I think - and he said what is it? I said I think I'm not worth it. </p>

<p>So oh course he laughed and he said I think you're absolutely gorgeous. And in this ... teasing way and I said - so we talked just a little bit more about it. Because I don't really like to talk about the - my therapy sessions, I think about them anyways. That doesn't seem to bother me but - or even to enquire into that but ... the next morning he - I said I'm going to go make a doctor's appointment. I have to change something. And I think I will find out from him. [2:59]</p>

<p>So I was trying to decide what - how to budget this - my money. I decided I would go to see - I would go to the most (inaudible) and see her. And then from her see if I could get a referral to get a number. And I thought oh well I don't know why I'm going to do this. </p>

<p>And George had put on the telephone please don't call the doctor. You're just not worth it. Because he knows that when he gets to me sometimes just to be ... just to ... not for myself (inaudible). That's the sad part. I mean it was - it was to say - and he knew he could do this. He's done this before. He'll say - he'll say the opposite in order to make me - he completes my sentences or completely agrees with me in order for me to see so clearly the other side - another voice.</p>

<p>And I was thinking that's really helpful for me. It irritates me but in the end it's helpful because ... when I hear myself say those things ... I believe it. You know I believe the other voice that says you know I'm worthless. And so I kind of push forward and say like you're not that person. You're also me. It's like forced to kind of - I made other appointments with doctors. And I thought it seems like such a significant thing but I know it isn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And how does it feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It feels good. It feels good. And ... and it feels comfortable and it feels like okay you're going to go to therapy and then you're going to go to the doctor. And you'll just find ... you know when the kids need money I always find it somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I decided I would take care of my kid who is me too. And I'd say okay I'm going to take care of you. And I will go to the doctor.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I thought that was really great. I was really glad that you didn't push me on this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What did it feel like when I pushed you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was like another part of myself pushing me because it wasn't just accordant really. It was hard to hear. But it wasn't discordant. It was like ... you know it was really you saying what you - what part of you has been saying anyway. He's just telling you in another voice and just kind of like George did. And you told me in another voice what I knew but couldn't say to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [5:52]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know he thinks so why don't? You know just do it. And if I could say to myself just do it. Don't ... don't think of your (inaudible) by the people that needs to be taken care of first or that you're not worth it or ... because what we - if you don't have your health then you won't have anything. If you don't at least take care of yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm very bad at taking care of myself - very bad at taking care of myself. So this was good. And the other thing that happened was that ... a modest what I call appetite in terms of wanting to eat stuff for comfort wasn't there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it was kind of like ... okay. So I mean just think about it instead of just - instead of just comforting yourself by eating. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you get this way? Just so you'll know. You had more willpower.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I know it has something to do with ... I know it has something to do with feeling better about myself. And ... being engaged rather than floating - being engaged in. I don't know with what exactly because nothing's been more - but I've been trying to ... I've been trying to do a couple of things as a result. I've been trying to ... do some things like remember my dreams and associations. </p>

<p>And I'm having some luck. But they're all very much in the day of a reflection on the day. And ... I've just been trying to go inside more. I'm trying not to be ... so out centered - so centered on the outside. Like what other people are doing and trying not to - not to be so observant. I mean I love watching. I love watching. [8:38] </p>

<p>But I think I'm beginning to make this something - maybe watching is - it's certainly an entertainment and it's certainly informative but watching is also not being ... with myself. So that's been kind of interesting. And I'm still wondering how you avoided (laughs) or what was going on when you work with me anyway - much more with me than with you. But how you avoided allowing me to do what I wanted last week which is just to lie down and not be talking to - I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like I avoided the whole ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't lie down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said I want to lie down again but I'm not (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right. So I can think okay now ... so I thought that was kind of interesting like after I thought about it. I thought is that different from what I would A. ask of someone and B. was it different that ... you didn't take me seriously about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: About that I really wanted to do it. Or - there were lots of little things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just - did - when you said you didn't take me seriously, what were you feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That you didn't take me seriously. That you didn't take me seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [10:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Curiosity. Like how come? You know? Did I - because I usually make myself pretty clear. And I usually ... get from other people what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing - not the important stuff I mean you know like I mean I don't change their lives or anything like that but. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I usually get what I want from people and I didn't feel - I didn't feel angry about it. But I did feel curious like how did that happen? We got to the end and you said to me something about you feel I care about not having ... but I didn't. And I think I said I'm not so sure I feel okay about that. I think it was what - it was what happened between us that was both at an awareness level and completely unaware that I was curious about afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're saying - and what is it that happened between us that you're curious about? How it is the reason why I don't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I think that I thought that was important to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I might let you take the lead on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't say you're not listening to me. I want to do this and then we'll talk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I thought - well what happened was authority came in and said (inaudible) as you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Authority came in and said I don't think that will work. Or it won't make a difference or do it my way and see what will happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... but without confronting you about it. So I thought hmmm okay so what's - you know did something change in that - did something change in that ... give and take or whatever that was. I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I obviously let you take the lead on it. And I don't know. I don't really know what was (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what - are you aware of any feelings right now regarding this ... in terms of me having taken the lead?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel ... I feel like - I feel as if well he knows better so let's go with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other side says but this is for me. And I think that would have helped.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [13:07]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So why didn't I say is this your therapy or mine? I'm lying down. (laughs) And so I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say that at just.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a kind of assertiveness like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like hey this is for me. What are you doing here?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you can have your way this time but next time ... I'm going to you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that I've tried it and you said essentially that's not important or whatever that was. I say okay next time I feel like doing it I think I'll just say either I do it or I'm going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know that at that moment I didn't need - it's what I was saying before I didn't want to social thing. I'm good at social stuff. I'm not good at private stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I'm good at private stuff with my best friend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what - unless I can be private - I mean unless I can go where I can't go in social situations then it seems to me that that's what therapy does. Therapy is about going inside because I'm competent on the outside. But I'm not competent on the inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I guess what I was trying to do was I was trying to go into a feeling level that wouldn't be the barrier but socialize and so forth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't know how to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) I was curious about why it didn't work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think you ended up feeling like I'm not getting what I want. I didn't get what I asked for.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not quite. I end up feeling like ... I didn't get what I asked for but ... I didn't feel angry about it. I felt like okay let this go and yeah, obviously he knows better than me. But the other side that was ... I think I know what is right for me right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would have been better to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that - on that day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I thought you might have been angry. There was - it - but you're saying you weren't aware of any anger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was ... well does it sound angry when I say hey this is my therapy not yours?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's something there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean there's a push there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what would you mean if it was angry? Would that be - what would it mean to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that would be okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [15:49]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I think that one of the things that I want to do ... I was thinking about this on the way over. I think that one of the things that I want to do is experience those things. Because when I get angry with George he gets terrified. He gets very frightened by it. And I don't think my anger is like that. I think my anger is like hey this is me and that sort of stuff. And it's - if that - when I feel angry angry it's hurt for me. I mean anger is hurt ... of the kind that I'm afraid and then the kind of anger that I express more easily is the kind of anger about injustice or.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some doctor screwing up a patient or - that's another kind of angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you feel like to [be standing up] (ph) right now? Because.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a part of you that wants to lie down? I mean that's (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not now. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Last time I really did because last time I needed a transition from something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I needed to go inside me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't - now it feels okay. I mean it doesn't feel (inaudible) but I feel more - I feel more aggressive today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel more ... assertive and more protective of myself. Gee I felt really vulnerable last week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt really, really vulnerable. I was really scared. But I felt vulnerable about what would come out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel vulnerable right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yeah. I feel like ... something wants to come out. It wants to come out. And it's a strong feeling. And it's ... it's ... I'm worth it feeling. But it's tenged (ph) (sp?) with I'm worth it question and it was like the dream I had about the tigers and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About - when you told me about the man that said you're not going to die.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. This was a dream I had a couple of weeks ago after I was beginning to get well. I had a dream about ... oh I guess I just wrote it down. I had a dream that my car had been ... I was in Chicago. My car had been stolen. And it was - it's George's car really because it's not because it's quite a bit (inaudible) and had been stolen in (inaudible). And then I had looked everywhere up and down the street. [18:53]</p>

<p>And there was a street with construction on it and there was a park on the other side. And I had come to take some (inaudible) and some ... somebody stole the car. And I was walking up and down the street looking for it and I found it on a construction site with the tires gone and (inaudible). And I looked into the construction site which - and there were a bunch of Mexican guys all playing soccer. And I knew that they had done this to my car. And I was really angry.</p>

<p>And I thought how will I do this? And I looked up and ... jumping over the wall of the park which was like a - not a zoo but like an open air park. I think they had a zoo in it. (Inaudible) It had nothing to do with the - it had something to do with animals but not the zoo and came this tigress. And she bounded over towards me. And I said oh she's (inaudible). We'll go get them. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where was she out of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's huge. She's part of my dream like. She didn't have a name. But she's a very strong and very long and strong like and she jumps over (inaudible) and I was (inaudible). She's appeared ever since I read ... the Snow Leopard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible) we have about five more minutes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to - you said that ... it's like you want to go inside and there's a part of you that wants to come out. Now see I have the sense too but this - there was a moment in the last session when you said ... what the hell do you know? I said do you feel sad? And you said actually it's a little anger like what the hell do you know about being worthless?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or feeling not worth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. What do you know about feeling (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you come into this today and you're talking about feeling like you weren't taken seriously. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm wondering if ... I'm wondering about that anger and that assertiveness. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you wonder about it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it - I mean part of the way I'm thinking about - like I'm - it might be helpful to bring some more of that out or I wonder how in touch with it you are. Or if there's any part of you that's scared to be in touch with it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In touch with what do you know about not being worth it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No the feeling that goes with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I mean. [21:54]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Their - that's the stuff that comes around that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feeling - that (inaudible). I think that I - I mean I think that's part of the working through the whole stuff about ... being a woman. I think that's part of working through the stuff about ... this stuff that I got from my mom. And I thought a lot about that statement this weekend. I thought one of the things - I'm not angry with her about it. I'm frustrated but when I think about it really - when I really, really think about her I think of her. I have that message from her for sure. </p>

<p>And the interesting thing is that George said you always had that from her. You always talked about this for years and years and years. And when I'm not angry about that I'm angry about what it does now. You know that's done. It was okay. Whatever it is it's over. But now I have to ... get some kind of strength to say ... what are you ... and I think when I say what do you know about it? The anger comes up with how come nobody understands the pain that goes with it and the self destructiveness that it makes me feel so (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like ... how come you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How come you - how come you don't know about this? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How come you can't feel this? This is all about my feeling level (ph). How come you can't feel this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How could you - how could I be - how could you be feeling so much and I not be able to feel it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. And ... that comes with ... I mean that's why women's groups are so good. Because other people say I knew - I know what that feels like. It feels like shit. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I've been helpless (ph) back at all of these levels. So what we need is like (inaudible) to take the sadness which I feel strongly I would say - to take this and turn it into something that's useful so that I don't have to feel this way. You know I don't have to feel. I mean what does it matter whether you don't - you know or don't know about what it feels like to feel this. Because it's what I have to do with it. But not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you'd like to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's where I want to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you - it sounds to me ... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're saying right now and you feel more like right at the moment. [24:47]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - right now I feel alone with it. I feel saddened by it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel vulnerable in the wrong ... vulnerable like I can't fix this myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. (Inaudible). Already well we're going to have to rap up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But let's - can we talk a little bit about why you were (inaudible)? Why you were (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes. Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So what do you know? </p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you know about feeling worthless?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you an expert at feeling worthless or what - feeling what people feel like? Have you felt worthless?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure but that's - I'll tell you I'm hearing in two ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm hearing you in a social way which is you're asking a question. I should give an answer. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but - yeah I want an answer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean you can say yes or no. I'm sure everybody ... well I'm not sure everybody has but I would imagine most people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But have you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Felt worthless?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me just say it in both ways how I hear you. And then I'll.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I want to answer you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's - it feels like you're asking to like can I be with you? Can I help you ... or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know no or like ... do I even have a right to help you if I haven't been there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't really feel that. Because I think that you must be smarter than that. I don't think that you have to experience being a female or worthless or any of that stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least I don't think so. I don't think - I think I trust you more than that. But I need to know if you've experienced it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it seems to me that if you haven't experienced some aspects of that then when you asked me about my feeling level you can identify the feeling as I ... as I can myself which is sad ... sad I guess - scared maybe that nobody else feels like that. But I know they do - intellectually I do. And the ... where am I going with that? I'm not sure where I'm going with that except that if you felt like that then I'll know that ... that you're real. [27:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I think that we need to - I'd like to spend some time in this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Good. Me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't know what happens if you don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't how that happens if - because if you don't then I just feel as if ... if I don't feel that you - that you know that then you're just an observer. And I don't think a therapeutic relationship is merely an observing one. But I don't know. I don't think so. And if it's intellectual on your part and I'm not sure (inaudible) say this. And if it's intellectual on your part ... then I want - I don't want feeling from you. I want advice. If it's at a - you can give me some advice let's go for this. If something else is supposed to be happening then I need to know that ... that part of your experiences includes ... what feels pretty (inaudible) to me which is my experience of feeling worthless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is so incredibly painful because it's so self destructive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well see I think there is much more than intellectual here. If...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you think so. I think I - so let's go back to this because we're at - obviously you're leaving.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

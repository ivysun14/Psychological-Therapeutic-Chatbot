<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(Background noise: radio with rock music)</p>

<p>February 3, 1971 Carrie's [sic] third session with Tyler.</p>

<p>NARRATOR: This is actually the fourth interview. This is Interview Number 4.</p>

<p>(background noise: radio with rock music)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you get a chance to look over any of that stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've already started.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Change the rules?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not yet, not right now, no. You know, I just was really like so upset after this morning's session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened? I mean, you don't seem upset now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. I - I know I am, kind of; but that's just really - I couldn't think of anything else, like I really couldn't study or something like that. So I guess I really was upset. Then I was thinking about why I was. And I think there were, like, a lot of reasons. One is that - like, and I noticed that. Like the first two sessions, you know, really got, like I just really, really liked you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then when she came in, like - and she started criticizing, not really criticize-discussing, criticizing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, whatever. [0:01:49.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, some of the things that we're doing. At first, I found that, like, I really sort of resented her for criticizing you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I got sort of angry at you, because you had things that you - that, you know, that you were being criticized about. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that I accepted her -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that, that there was something in you that, you know, should have been criticized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, I should be perfect.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not. I'm good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs). But you're not perfect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. And I have weaknesses. But I have strengths. One of my strengths is that I know I have weaknesses, I think. And to do that is painful for me, too. It was for me, anyway. Criticizing me, not you. I don't like the word "criticizing" very much, because I initiated the process. And - and what we call it is "feedback". Criticizing is when, like if somebody (walked) (ph) that neither one of us knew very well and didn't want to see, and came in and laid it on us - like, that would be criticism. And I'd throw him out so fast it would - . OK. But the feedback does sometimes change (you). It could - it can be painful initially. Have you ever been in a group, by the way? At all? [0:03:15.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Gestalt) (ph), you mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, just that. That's right. Just that group. That's all, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Well what we were getting was feedback, which is different from criticism. OK. But I want to get back to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So - . All right. And then I just - you know, I just felt that -. Like I said before, you know, everyone else is manipulating me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how to really deal with it very well. And, you know, it hurt me that I thought it was happening in here, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. That's 'cause you were - you've heard us using all those terms (inaudible at 4:01). Is that what we were doing? I didn't know that. I guess - I got the sense that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Well I - you know, I just - it was just - I really - it was just from that first image. Like I said, it was just [boyfriend and relay] (ph). Everything else was sort of secondary. I just kept on filtering through that image. [0:04:12.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. The way this is different than a lot of other psychotherapies is that I'm not only trying to do psychotherapy here. I'm trying to teach you how to do - teach you how to do it, too. (clears throat) You are probably the first client that I've taken off the waiting list here in the last six months. And I did it just as a favor to (pause) - did it as a favor, OK? Ordinarily, my - I have my own personal private waiting list. And on that waiting list, I don't differentiate between clients and therapists. It's the same waiting list for people who want to be therapists and want to be clients. And the reason I do that is because I think it's - for a number of reasons. One of the reasons, I think that they're not different kinds of people. And as long as you're doing this, you might as well learn how to do it, too, at the same time. So you can do this with somebody else, if you want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you can - . When you go out of here, you won't be able to call it psychotherapy. You won't be able to call yourself a psychologist. But that doesn't mean you can't do those skills. [All right?] (ph). And moreover, you can do that in a classroom, too. [0:05:25.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for you, since you're going to be a teacher, I'll give you a whole series of things that you may want to try in the classroom, which is -. It breaks the process down and gives you more alternatives for classroom use. And I'll start giving you those next week or the week after - if you want them, or when you're ready for them, if you want them I'll give them to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now I - I liked that when I read it. I really liked that. Or I liked the thing of, it wasn't client stuff. This was husband/wife -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's [the point where] (ph) [0:05:56.8] -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) That sort of thing. And I just thought that was really, really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just that, you know - . Now I feel guilty, like having reacted the way. I just feel like I - you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's, that's a common thing for you [aren't that type] (ph) [0:06:15.4]. You feel - maybe you feel that it's - [like for a guy] (ph), for example. And then you react. Then afterwards you felt, well maybe you were too heavy or something. You feel guilty about us at the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah,, well I just feel like I - yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, my only - my only feeling that I didn't like that I had - and I didn't </p>

<p>want -. I liked the feeling I had, but I didn't want to let that feeling go until I was sure that the situation would change. And that was my feeling of - like you might fly. You know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not come back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That, that was a big fear in me. 'Cause I - I see that it's your basic, very strong tendency. That's a guess. That's just a guess. And I (don't) (ph) just see that in you. I see that in - in a lot of virgins, (inaudible @ 7:12) 22-year-old virgins. There's a lot of them around. Some of them are virgins even after they go to bed. (inaudible) And that's true. I mean, somehow it doesn't change in their head. I know one girl who had six relationships and still considered herself a virgin. And she was, psychologically. OK. So that it's very common. I mean, going to bed is just - it's correlated with being a virgin, but it's not necessarily psychologically the same. [0:07:36.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of what I'm saying is, a lot of people go through what you're going through now. It may be more intense in here than in other places, though. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just - you know, I just - . I don't know. With me - I - I don't - . I want to - . No. I'm - run away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. I was - I didn't want you to leave me, OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not for 20 minutes. That (inaudible at 8:12).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (almost laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not until we both feel like we've both come to a kind of a termination. Then it's OK. You could leave at seven hours. You still have 13 left, or something. That would be OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then another thing I want to tell you how I feel is that - just, like for one minute, that I really felt left outside. I just felt like everything was just - everything was just such a big hassle, 'cause - I didn't want - . I guess that's (why) (ph). I didn't want anything but to just crawl into a little eggshell all by myself. Like that's the only thing I thought I could ever handle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I knew that, see. And that's what I was worried about, that - . Not that you had to feel things, but that you would do that. And you would run away from me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'Cause it's really just safer here than it feels, I think. It's OK for it not to feel safe, but we should talk about why. Maybe I can do something else. I mean, that's the point I'd like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm. (pause, 16 seconds) OK. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, there's one thing in those rules that is different for you than it is for anybody else I've ever seen. I mean, you're paying for this, aren't you? OK. And that's because somebody else - I was doing this for somebody else. I don't have control over that. But you - you, you have the privilege of paying. Not that I get any of that, of course, but still - .</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, like I feel like - that's the one thing I was - . At least I'd like - I think, to have [that - wishing her] (ph). Maybe because it's new, and I'm still frightened, kind of, but - . You know, I - I feel like I could be very not - I don't - you know, like - . (Sorry) (ph). I'm all right. That - [0:10:21.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Let it come out, and then you can take part of it back if you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. You know, like I - I don't even think of it sort of as I - I guess I - I'm trying to - it's hard to sort of express, you know, what I -. You know, how I want to go. That's what I think we were talking about this morning, you know. Like, no I'm not - you know, I want to say something more. </p>

<p>You know, I find (temp) (ph) ? [0:10:49.3] Well maybe she's - I don't know if it will happen or not, but like, it happened [when I was in the act of] (ph) stopping. Like I get worse instead of better. Like I get more withdrawn, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that how you are now? Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean I feel really sort of - you know, like I - I know I have so many other things to say, 'cause I really want to come back. I was so upset when I left. And I just don't feel like I have anything (yet) (ph). And I know that's not true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. </p>

<p>(pause, 8 seconds) Well, just talk about anything. And I'll help you, with anything. Or be silent for awhile, too. That's OK, too. You don't have to talk in here, either; that's another thing .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>(pause, 14 seconds)</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about, like - my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's just - just sort of the same thing happened. I mean - when there's someone that like I just - and I do this in relationships, too, that - initially I just really, really like for some reason, I consider that they're perfect. And as soon as I find that they're not, I don't like them at all, anymore. But I can't -. Like, my older sister, you know, is sort of - so objective in the criticism of my mother. And what I find, I do that. It really hurts me to hear her talk that way about my mother, you know, objectively. And then I go back, and I think I'm harsh on my mother. It's (as if) (ph) I'm punishing my mother for having something that - it's, it's really (valid) (ph) in being criticized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, let's work with that a little bit. That sounds like a rerun of what happened earlier today. Can you remember -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doing anything? You were mad at me for not - .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was just - yeah. [0:12:59.6.]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. A part of what you're saying, it's very hard for you to take criticism.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's incr - yeah, it's very hard. I can't take it very well at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you ever asked for it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I honestly do. I think I only ask for it when I know it's going to be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you might - you know, you might -. One thing you might do - is, when you know your with someone who loves you, or something like that, you might ask, "What is it that" - . See, you don't want to ask them, you know, "What's bad about me?" You want to ask it like this: "What is it that I do that makes you feel bad?" Or, "What is it that I do that you get a feeling of wanting to run (everywhere) (ph at 13:47)?" [It's it?] (ph) And they'll probably say, well I don't know. I mean, it just feels, you know. It's hard for people give good feedback. Good feedback has to be very specific, with specific behavior. I mean, you're not a bad person. You may do things that have people run. But that doesn't mean you're a bad person. Usually, there are very specific things. </p>

<p>Another way of saying that is to ask people how they feel more [off stage] (ph). Your kind of [weakened with off stage.] (ph) [0:14:14.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um. Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's embarrassment more than anything else, I think. 'Cause that like, all I'm asking for you in my (downstage) (ph) is to paraphrase what I said. And that's not so hard. It's just that - it's not hard to do as a task, but it's hard to - it's really new, in some way I think, for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. OK. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact, I just - you know, I do - I find it really hard to take criti  - . It's, like it's really hard to take criticism. So I do two things. Like, I - I just don't go near it anymore. Like, if I know that person's going to criticize me, I make up things to my selfs [sic] and tell him that's why it's not worth anything, anyway, as if they don't know what the hell they're talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like - I just feel like that - there, I guess, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. That's helpful to me, what you're saying so far. Say some more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, now I was thinking like, with my mother, I guess. You know, like my sister just feels that she's really good at - she said, really good with having us brought up as children, but not as - that she's not good as relating to us as adults.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. One other thing - . See, I don't see anything you bad at feeling. Nor do I think you're bad at knowing how I feel. I think you're good at how you feel, and you're good about how I feel. I see you being weak at not being warm and wonderful and all that underneath, and being able to do that. But having trouble communicating it. Trouble not doing it, not communicating. At least, to me, how I feel. Like, do you really know? And the way you do you that is to perfect my feeling. Put it into your own words and give it back to me. I think you're weak on that. And I think you'll find if you start doing that, it'll keep a lot of pressure off of you. I mean, you won't feel like you're so bad and evil, 'cause the person will be talking more about himself. If you think about it, this person talking mainly about himself, not you. [0:16:37.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'Cause even when I - if I were to criticize you, I'm saying at least as much as about myself as I am about you. You can do two things with that. You can react to that in any number of ways. Or you can forget about it. You know, you can go over there and forget you're there, you see. You can get out of your body and go over there and be so, "You're supposed to [Jennifer, and"] (ph) say, "Hm, I wonder what that is for me inside." OK?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's really hard to do, tho, 'cause I take it so personally, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's OK to take it personally, but you ought to be able to - you ought to try doing it both -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Both ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've been doing it first thing for 24 years. Maybe you could try it another way for awhile. (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder why that is, though. See, why should - why should an intelligent beautiful girl feel like she can't take criticism? 'Cause if that's (inaudible), you know, it's a puzzle for me. (pause) Something happened in your home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, it's - my parents just - I think - I think that, like, I (always) (ph) - think like two kind of fucked-up daughters and (weights) (ph) 'cause they're bad. It's what they're saying. But for some reason, they're so successful with, with me, you know. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounded like you have two successful ones - </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Two -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Two fucked-up, and then you - .</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they don't think is fucked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. And there's - they have two they do not see that's fucked up, and you're the fucked-up one. Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. They consider them fucked up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're the good one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm the good one, they think. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, of course. I mean - so therefore, like if you were criticized, if you wouldn't be perfect, you would let them down. All right. And you're carrying all the responsibility to be the good one, right? [0:18:28.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it's - no, you see it's funny. I - for some reason, like - my younger sister always was just able to kind of rebel right from the beginning, you know? And just do what she wanted to do. I mean, I think she need - you know, has a lot of problems. But she's always been sort of more blatant and open about them. And Janie was, you know, she's older. And she just seemed - like now, being more, you know, in tune, so - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) So you haven't had a place where you could say what your problems were. Is that it? And be safe about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I - yeah. Well see, I have a - like I have a hard time. I mean, I just feel really hurt every time I think of my parents - 100 percent wonderful, kind of, you know. It's - it's like - it's hard to exp - . You know, when I'm away from home, like it just seems such a nice sort of relationship, everything. Then I go home, and it's really never that at all. So every time I go home, I just get sort of depressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't need them anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I -. It's hard for me to accept, kind of. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's what I was saying, that it's hard for you to accept that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's why I kind of - I mean, I feel like there's something almost morally wrong, I guess, maybe, even about - oh, I mean little things, like - . For example, we were home at Christmas, you know, and like, no one goes to Mass. And my mother has a fit about that, you know. She really does. Well Rose just said, you know, "I'm not gonna be - ." And I decided that that was ridiculous. I never go, and I just can't go at home. And my mother was just - I mean, literally heartbroken. What she was saying was, "I don't really care if you don't go."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so were you. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I get - I just hate to hurt my mother, you know. And so - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 'Cause it hurts you, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. It really hurts me, you know. So I ended up going. Then I felt like I was just really weak-boned and had no guts, kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I give you some feedback on your personal style? You're too damned responsible. OK?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then - that's true. But, you know, I'm not with, like, who counts. That's myself. That's what disgusts me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm saying. Now - not, "How about for Jennifer, now?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs). Yeah. For Jennifer. Well, I don't know. You know, I think I have - one thing is that I just really want everybody to like me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everybody! Can't just be you. Everybody, right? Won't work. Sorry. You don't have to have everybody to like you. [0:21:21.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really find that hard, kind of, 'cause I always - you know, sort of (idea) (ph), like in high school and college and stuff, you know. Just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Did you live at home in college?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>You see - now that's another thing that's really funny. Like - my parents just always went away to school. I was hardly ever home summers. You know, I really have very little contact with them that much. It's sort of what they - you know, and I can't talk to my father at all, and that just really upsets me. Like, I never talk to him, you know. And I can't accept the fact that he's - he really has a problem. It's too bad he can't communicate very well. He can't express his emotions at all to us -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) That's important.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really on to it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And, see, it hurts me to kind of - you know, have to look at that. I - see, I - I - . My sister finds it so easy, you know, and I fi - I can't - I don't like listening to her say that. And my younger sister is just - you know, things were all horrible for her. You know, she just sort of, "I can't ever do anything. No one can." So I just - so I don't listen to her as seriously as I do my older sister, just sort of really kind of subjectively looking at things. Just so - . My father does all these things over and over and over again. And every time it hurts me just as much. Like, I was in Florida last January for independent study. So when I was coming back, I called them, you know, from Miami I guess, and I said, "I'll be back, blah blah blah" So he said, "Well, are you going to come home for a couple of days before you start classes again?" And I felt, "Well isn't this nice; my father wants to see me." And so I said, "Well, yeah. I guess so." He said, "Oh, good, because then Mummy and I can go away, you know, and we'll have someone to take care of Dan." That's my brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonderful. [0:23:15.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like that just really, really hurt me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why I [why with you] (ph) being hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so that really, really bothered me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It still does. Like, right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it happens all the time, and it hurts all the time the same way. It doesn't get less.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Feel the pain. Yeah, they really got you in a double bind. That's - . It almost sounds like you didn't have a chance to be a little girl, at least recently. I don't know about earlier, but - . When did you - were you kind of (dull) (ph) then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't - it's not a little girl. It's, I don't - . I feel like at home, that if were one or the other, like I could sort of emotionally express myself all the time, or intellectually express things, you know? But see, but my father never asks me what I think about what's going with [his (inaudible] (ph) education or anything like that. Yet he's in it. And like, I'm not worth anything as a mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yet, you know, superficially it's like the - I just feel like there - that part of us, 'cause we've sort of done well academically and not for what we are, kind of. My mother doesn't like that. She says, you know, she doesn't understand a word (about) (ph) - . Every once in awhile she gets really angry. She says, "I just wish I - you know, you all just went to a nice Catholic college and sort of all got married." And then, you know, "Wha - wha -" Where did I fail?" [0:24:59.3] It was their own ego that pushed us to go (where) (ph) we went.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Definitely. Definitely. You know, it was a - a big thing for them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they ought to damn well live with their - what happened. You're getting to be a person. You're a person in yourself. And they ought to respect that, now. I mean, after all, that's what - you know, they were probably responsible for that.</p>

<p>"Listen to me." I hear you saying, "Listen to me!' or saying, "Listen to me intellectually."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then like I said, I think, just a little bit in one of the other sessions, is like when my mother writes me letters, I can't stand to get (them) (ph), so  - . Just these idiotic things, you know, that go on and on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, they're short. It's always like five minutes here, five minutes there. I mean, I don't know what the - . She doesn't work. She doesn't - I don't know what the hell she does with her time. She does, like, hospital aide work and all that shit. But the letter always looks like she kind of pushed me in. You know. And then she said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I don't have time for you."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see, there's also another thing. It's 'cause I have a brother who's ten, you know? And I just feel like, it's those three now. And we're nothing, kind of. And that really - you know? That really bothers me. Like - for some - I need them, still. I don't think they need me.</p>

<p>'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling that they need you. You feel you need them, and you feel they don't need you. [That's it.] (ph) [0:26:57.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I - I feel, for example, that they're uncomfortable. They don't know how to handle us. But they're - and they're fine with a ten-year-old boy. They were fine when I was ten. They were good at reading stories and going out and playing games, you know. But then also, you know, when we're adults they really don't know what to do with us. And so when I go home, it's like I'm intruding on a family, like a guest. And when I leave, I feel almost like going, "Whew." There's a sigh of relief, you know? </p>

<p>Then like, my s - my younger sister. I mean, she's just been unhappy at school she was gone. She's at an all-girls' school. She really doesn't like being there. She's completely into drugs. She pushes. We all know it. My parents won't even talk about anything like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother finally said to me on the phone the other day, "She's doing, like, taking this -"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) What kind of drugs? I was just (kidding) (ph). Go ahead. Don't - don't listen to me. Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother - said, "You know, I sat down and talked with Tracy, you know, before she left. And like, it's really good, she's going to [Washington for] (ph) the semester. Because she really has sort of been unhappy, you know, at school." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My God! She's - it's her second semester of her junior year. You know - everyone can - I know she's unhappy. Everyone knows. They wouldn't look at it. You know. They just won't face - and that sort of scares me, 'cause maybe I think I have a tendency to do that, too. Kind of. [0:28:30.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not face things. I guess that's one reason I didn't want [it to come very far] (ph) my mother. [That's why] (ph) I guess I'm here. (Shit) (ph) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was too much in there. I got flooded.</p>

<p>(pause, 13 seconds)</p>

<p>Yeah, your feeling is - that we're with your parents anyhow. That they'll use you in order to - so they can do other things. You could be a baby-sitter. But you can't be you intellectually; you can't be you emotionally. And there's no place for you there except as a slave. That's maybe exaggerated, but that's somewhere like -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yeah. Somewhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. OK. Can we talk about what to do about that? What do you think we should do? What would you think we should do about it?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, when I was home, like I had been in New York all summer. You know, I - and I came home in August. And it was just - you know, it was really hard. Like, I had always been used to spending summers like sort of at the beach. It was hard for me to be here. Only [trouble was] (ph), I had so much work, and it was so goddamned hot. You know. Things - so I got home. And I just really felt that very strongly then. And I - I said it to them. And they - . My father always reacts like we're fucked up and just damned selfish brats. My mother kind of - they - they got visibly upset. (inaudible at 30:23) It's really funny to look back, and - . The three of them - . It really hurt, and that's one of the few times that I sort of said something. And I think they really felt deep down that I was right. So the three of them, my brother and my parents, often went out. Like the little family (luck) (ph) kind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. OK. I want to try to (drum) (ph) something. Where do we say - like, we - I wish I could say whatever I want. OK. I want to say something to you that - that strikes me as being true. You can't help them with their feelings now. And - maybe not for quite a long time. And I don't even know if this is a good idea for you to do it, even if you could. (inaudible @ 31:10). You can't do that now. </p>

<p>You can't help them with their feelings at all - their hurts. You can't help their hurts all. And they'll live through their hurts. OK. Even though they (won't) (ph). But - my mother went through all kinds of things. She did everything to keep me in my - my place. She was dying. She was - hung up on me on the phone for [most every] (ph) night. Every time I took an initiation step, she would die. One way or the other, she would die.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She got physically ill. Everything, she did almost everything. She talked about suicide, everything. She knew that. Before you can help them - before I could help her, now I'm finally starting to help her with her feelings [of suicide] (ph). I'm 31, right? She went through all that hurting, and I felt terrible. And oh, I was killing her, right. And it's crap. You can't help them with their feelings until they accept you as a person. What that suggests to me is more competition. That is, "Oh, oh, can I come home?" "Yes." "No, I want to come home and see you. But I'm not to come home to be a baby-sitter. Sorry. No. I don't feel like that's what I want to do." You have to be straight about how you feel. And they have to come to learn to accept how you feel. And they're going to hit the wall. [Pardon me] (ph) . (chuckles) They're going to scream and yell and moan. They - all their tricks, they're going to do. They're going to invent some new ones. They'll probably even get together and invent some new ones. But you just can't [be there] (ph) . You've got to keep trying to stay in touch with what's best for Jennifer at this point - what's best for Jennifer. And if that happens to just hit with what they want to do, fine. If it doesn't, they're all going to have to take care of themselves. OK?</p>

<p>See, they've put you in a double bind. The bind is, you're supposed to take care of them, and they won't let you. You're supposed to be in that - you're supposed to help them with their feelings, and they won't even accept you as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't - . I wouldn't do therapy for a moment, whatever helping, whatever, with a person who thought I was - with a senior faculty member here. A senior psychologist. "Where do you go?" What I'm into here is heavy [confrontation issue] (ph) with the chairman of - with the chairman. I've had fights with those guys. [I mean, ] (ph), "Fuck off." You know. And meetings? It's a matter - the only way - a helping relationship is a relationship where two people meet and need each other as equals in some sense. And you can't do it with them. You're not going to kill them. OK. That's the end of my mental health lecture number two. What kind of reaction are [we at?] (ph) [0:33:50.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Yeah. Underneath that all, you know, I - what really, I guess [bothers me] (ph) - I just don't think they care, kind of - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One way or the other. You mean, like if I just never came home again, they'd wonder about it a little bit, you know, but I - . I should - yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling that you're feeling is, you've been thrown out and they don't want to see you anymore, really. Like, they don't really care about you anymore. They have something else to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: In the - the - see, that's the whole - my - the whole - you know, that whole responsibility thing, you know. Like, I don't - I can't - I can't say no. Like - the way they show their love is always through money, you know? Like, they'll buy us anything, you know, that we need and stuff like that. Or - you know, things like that. And it - and so I mean, I know - I mean, I obviously know that they love me. My God, I know that. But - it's just never - I mean, I guess I see why - why we - . I don't remember ever being happy with them except before adolescence, sort of. And it's not like - I don't know if I will be happy again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm thinking there's a possibility that you may. So I figure. It won't be for awhile, though. I'll think they'll come to respect you as a person and finally come to ask you for help at some point. They wasn't say it in those words, but you'll have a sense of that's what they're doing. But it won't be for awhile. It probably won't be until your brother. Let's see, who's the younger one? [0:35:42.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Brother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The brother. What's his name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Dan.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It won't be until Dan is - is - has left. And then they're going to need you like you can't imagine. But - but before they can accept you as -, you're going to have to let them know that you're a person. Which all it simply means, not doing anything with them or for them unless you really feel it's for you, too, at the moment. They're going to have to learn to hear you, respect you, as an adult. They haven't learned to accept you as an adult. You're a baby-sitter. You're, you know, you're an adolescent girl who has daffodils in her head, and you [going to] (ph) - the best that you can do is go to school for two years and then get married and behave yourself. Right? And that's not who you are anymore. And they're going to have to come to accept who you are. Otherwise you should tell them to go to hell. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They won't go to hell, though. (inaudible). And secondly, you don't need them. They need you a lot more than you need them (obviously) (ph) [0:36:50.8].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I - You know, I - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Even (Bedelheim) (sp) says that. I don't think - I think that's the only good thought he's ever had. No, I don't mean that about (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of think that [on terms of that.] (ph). I mean, like, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have too much pain. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're being rejected. You don't want to be rejected now, thinking about the future. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See, I also like, it - I had a really hard time ever kind of trying to critically look at my family, you know? Because like, I - I can't accept criticism of people I love, you know? And - yeah, I just - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me ask you this. Let's work on that a little bit. How did you do when Linda was criticizing me? How did you think I felt? (All right) (ph) What was your fantasy about how I felt? Make some up now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) I - oh, I thought you were uncomfortable. I don't think you were hurt, like pain or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still don't - I mean, [un]comfortable a little bit, but like one percent. Ninety-nine percent of all that was, I felt very good. Like, "Aha." That was very good. I mean, that was a very good session for me. [I vaguely] (ph) - [0:38:19.8] Since then I've felt that - I talked to another very experienced fantastic psychologist about it. I said, "Hey, it was really great. You should have heard this - this three - this tripartite session we had." And that illustrates actually one that was really exciting. It was really good. I mean, I was very pleased. I said there was [sic] some unfortunate qualities to her. [I'm feeling some here] (ph), anyway. And I said - then he talked about his son and how he said he had to do it. And that - . </p>

<p>Well anyhow, the point of that was, it was very good for me. Very, very good. And I didn't feel - . Well you - and you haven't seen me really uncomfortable yet. And you don't know what it looks like. </p>

<p>(crosstalking) I really get into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You - there won't be any doubt. I mean, you won't have to, "Well, I think you were - ." No. No. I may have you - I may invite you to into a group I'm doing, sometime. And then you'll know when I'm uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I - I thought you'd be more (uncomfortable) (ph) . [0:39:20.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Like I said, the only - see, the point I'm - the illustration, I was not. And don't protect me, you know. Don't protect them. I mean, you don't have to protect me. You don't have to be responsible for me, either. I - hm. There's two ways you could be that. One is, with her you were going to protect me, right? You were going to give me some chicken soup, 'cause she was criticizing me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there's - there's a bigger thing that's going to be harder to get over, I think. And that is, you're going to protect me against you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope not by (flight) (ph) . I mean - don't do it by flight, anyhow. [0:40:04.8] Any other way. If you have to protect me, do it by pouting or something, or something else (inaudible). I think once you face that enough, you'll find out that, you know, like I'm like other people [don't do you.] (ph) "I'm going to die because you don't accept (inaudible at 40:18).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder why do I just so - get so destroyed so easily when I get criticized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the "When did you stop beating your wife?" question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When did I what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "When did you stop beating your wife?" type of question. I'm not - there's an element of that. I mean, you're really not being criticized that much. There's something in you that wants the criticism. It's not - . [The seeds] (ph) of this - this sees feedback as criticism. And you were seeing feedback as criticism. I mean, why do - in other words, another way to ask it - what's in you that's needs to be criticized? What's that bad something that really is no good? Do you get feelings of [deeper feelings] (ph)? Obsessions about, you know -</p>

<p>(Interview interrupted. Continued as follows:) </p>

<p>NARRATOR: This is Interview Number 4 carried over from Side 1, Track 1. This is the end of Interview Number 4, carried over from Side 1, Track 1.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it really is no good. Your feelings of, I mean, deeper (feelings) (ph) [0:41:37.4], obsessions about - I mean, [comparatively by obsessions] (ph) is the constant thought of how really bad you are underneath. If I ever told anybody that, they would never talk to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How long did - yeah. Well I  - . Well I'm just not that good. You know, I'm not - you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you know they're good? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not that - very good person. I mean, this - you know, a lot of things that I -you know, feel and think about people are just - [to the] (ph) few that aren't very, you know, not very nice. I - I have this feeling that sometimes I come across as - sort of an innocent in life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And underneath this -</p>

<p>PATIENT: [It's under us all] (ph) [0:42:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. How many people have you shot lately?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shot? (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, that's how you're talking. I mean - . Another thing you - you don't know is, everybody has those fantasies, by the way. But it's like - again, that what you're saying is, underneath you have very bad feelings about a lot of people. A lot of bad feelings about, like things you'd like to do that are not good. Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, for example -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well just - you know, sometimes I really, you know, enjoy sort of having shown someone up, or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Watching someone else squirm in a comical situ[ation], you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's OK. That's good. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's wrong with that? OK, there's two things. You feel a feeling of - of it being bad, right? That's - . See, there's a lot of strong, powerful something there, like (anises) (ph) that are very antisocial, OK? I think that's part of what you're saying. And you kick yourself for that. You don't have to kick. Everybody has that. The only people who don't have strong feelings of being antisocial are people who kill people. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm saying is, if you don't - [feeling joy] (ph) @ 44:07, OK. At least for me, I feel OK. Anybody who [ought to] (ph) to know if it was great gets those feelings. But there's more than that. That doesn't solve it, yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot more.</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's - there's something more that you don't even want to tell me about. And that's OK, for now. But you should sort of try and tell me some more of that bad stuff in you. That stuff that you "think is bad."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I am of the -. One thing's - it's not - it's really not, like sort of bad and good. But one thing that just really has always bothered me. I just never am ever satisfied with what I am, kind of. You know? Whatever I am, I've got to sort of, you know, I don't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I want to do something better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's more of that. It sounds - it's not just dissatisfaction. That's part of it. It sounds - another part of it is - . And you ought to be guilty about that, too. (inaudible at 45:19) not so guilty about not being perfect or not being satisfied. It's not only that you're not satisfied, but your guilty for not being satisfied.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm - you know, I - yeah. I'm guilty, but also in a selfish way, though. 'Cause I figure, you know, I'm not going to be really happy 'til I am sort of content, at least with what I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you not, that you'd like to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have some - I have some - always sort of really ambivalent feelings. Like, you know - . Like, I scoff at things like - . (inaudible @ 46.08) </p>

<p>(pause, 11 seconds)</p>

<p>Well, like I - it's hard to - . Like, for example - (sighs). I'm thinking of all these things sort of coming in and out. Like for example, I could - I would never (largely) (ph) think of myself as just being a teacher, because I'm sucked in - by it really. And I hate myself for feeling (or failing) (ph), but it's true. Like, sort of what society considers a pressure, 'cause I consider myself a fairly intelligent person. And I - and though I can bullshit all about how education, especially in the secondary level, is really necessary, and all this innovation and stuff like that - in the back of my hi - my mind, I'm saying, "Well you'll be, like, for a year, then you'll off for your Ph.D. in English." But I have been thinking, "Do you really want that Ph.D. in English to get to all that shit of 'publish or perish' if everything goes on there?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And see, that's another thing, also. Like I've sort of - denied a lot of like, the personal things in my life, what's really important. Like, I find myself (mulling) (ph) things, that maybe I don't think. Like, I'm saying, well, I'll never have any kids, because, you know - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe your mother's right in part. [0:47:37.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you do want to get married and have some - have kids. That's part of - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - no. I cannot say I do - I do. You know, I would - love to love someone. I could that I (couldn't) (ph) now, because after [some days] (ph) I think that that solves all your problems, and it doesn't. [0:47:56.7]</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So it would sort of an unreal - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, thing for me right now. But I would - I would like something really stable, because for one thing it's that, you know, it's like I - I don't feel like I have anyone. I don't have my family, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And - I don't know, I just see - it just seems everybody is so - so unhappy, kind of, around me. And I'm afraid I'll - I'm just like that. And I don't understand why everyone is so unhappy. Yet I was just as unhappy -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Oh. That's another thing. Right. You're [definitely ? @ 48:34] (ph), right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. (Please) (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) No, it's not that bad, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it's terrible. It's worse than that. It's not just terrible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, honest to God. It's - she's coed now, so things will -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Oh it is coed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. They had -</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh well, that is - that is a - a definitive shift. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They have, like, maybe there's 15 guys there. You know, so it's - it's - it's much better. Like for evening meals, it's not always sort of bitchy girls.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [OK. or ?] (ph) . [0:49:02.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Unless like I [file it] (ph), and she just [run to cackle (inaudible] (ph) . You know, I - (pause) But that - you see, there's this - . The guy who is on duty at night for my early shift, he's really young. And so if I was talking to him once, and he said to me, "You know, I just don't understand why there is [sic] so many people who are screwed up who live here." And I said, "Well I don't think there is [sic] that many that are really screwed up and stuff." And so he said - (background noise of microphone clicking) that, for example  - .</p>

<p>Yeah, this really does bother us, actually (inaudible). [0:49:48.5]</p>

<p>But he said there are about six girls who have come down and asked him if they could come up and go to bed with him after he got off duty. And I was shocked out of my mind. And I thought they were sort of more in touch with their feelings than, you know, I am. 'Cause at least they're not denying, you know, their sexual drives and stuff like that. And they have guts enough to ask him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're right. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - and I just felt that he was telling me 'cause he felt that I was sort of normal in an abnormal (boopen) (ph). I just want to say, you know, "No, I have as many problems and just as many hang-ups." You know, I think it's people don't think I do, and I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You cover it very nicely. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess I do. Why do I feel I [want or] (ph) that need to cover it so much? [0:50:44.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had to be a good responsible person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I'll just keep on hurting myself -</p>

<p>(crosstalking)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to be strong. You have - you have to be strong. What I'm doing is giving you the (Varig) (ph) I think you've gotten in the past. Not that I think you should do that, right? I'm arguing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean - I mean you should break  - . Break some rules, will you please? That's what I'm saying. There are too many for yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I  - . But when I break the rules, you know, like I guess the guilt gets so much that it's sort of not worth it breaking [the game] (ph), you know. See, another thing, I guess, is that I always sort of felt myself a pretty strong person. Like if there was, you know, certain things I felt strongly about, I would really, you know, defend them kind of, and that sort of thing. And one thing I could never stand was what I considered sort of wishy-washy people, you know. And now - and now I just realized I think that's what I am, a lot. By that I mean I don't honestly stop and say, "Jennifer, what do you really want? Where do you really want to go?" And the hell of it is, you know, not like - other people's concept of -of what you should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Now what do you want? What does Jennifer want? You don't even know what you want at this point. That's - that's to be expected, by the way. Just painful and nevertheless. [0:52:08.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, I don't know what I want. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I - let me - . Could we do [it onstage] (ph) for a moment, here? (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (whispers) Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I'll [fall Peter] stuff. I feel very good about and very hopeful about - about what is going to happen with us [especially when we're] (ph) here. I feel very, very good. Because there's going to be a lot of (dialog) (ph) I do, a lot pain, [and you may be] (ph). I feel very good about our (inaudible) [0:52:40.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel very good about it. I - maybe I'm crazy, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do [of course] (ph). But I feel - I have a good feeling for [it, deep in my gut.] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why, though? You just feel it? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a lot of reasons why. The major - the important part is that I really feel, and I sense it. And I really trust my feelings. And I act on 'em.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, that's really good, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. But there's reasons for it, too. Because I - I - . I feel very strongly for (?) (ph) . Give - one, I feel my - mainly, one of my major expertise is an area of dealing with crazy girls like you. (chuckles) I mean, I have a lot of experience in it, including personal experience outside of these - as well as professional. </p>

<p>Secondly, you have the kinds of problems that are - that people have written about for - for years, that are the easiest things to solve. At [the most] (ph) - that best prognosis, OK. Those things together, you know, (inaudible @ 53:50). </p>

<p>And the third thing is, I really like the way I am with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's important. I feel like [you like one] (ph) too. So I'm giving you some chicken soup, now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's great. (laughs) I needed a - drink, just [for that] (ph), now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>(background noise: microphone crackling)</p>

<p>And I have to stop. I want to know - when do you want to see me again?</p>

<p>(background noise: bumping, papers shuffling)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I want to know when - when do you want to see me again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Monday?</p>

<p>(background noise: bumping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, when do you want? - Knowing you, that's a question. Now you're asking me. When do you want to see me? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Monday, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. That's important, for you to ask yourself first. And then check out with me. And I say, "Well, maybe I don't want to do it then at all." I'll say if I don't want to do it, believe me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. [I'll check out] (ph). 'Cause like I would like to see you all the time, kind of, you know? 'Cause it's good, but - </p>

<p>(background noise: paper shuffling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. OK, that's helpful (inaudible @ 54:58). That feels right to me, too. Monday feels good, too. I'd like to see you a lot more, too, but I'm not going to do it. </p>

<p>OK. Eleven o'clock? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now I want to put you in my phonebook, and I'm trying to figure out how to do that. Should I put you in my phonebook under your code name, or should I put you in my phone book under your real name?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well see, it's your phonebook. (laughs) Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, there's almost only me, but still - . But what difference would it be [to me] (ph) ? I could deal with a code name, but - what difference would it make? I mean, I have a lot of people in my phonebook. I mean - I'd only have - . I don't think that - . The phonebook is virtually sealed, but I think I have only about four or five clients in it at this point. So, I mean, you (couldn't) (ph) even look in my phonebook and say, "Aha! That's my crazy book, and I have all the crazies in there." No one would know. If I - I suspect I should put you in there just regular. Like, I would know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was - when I'm staying sitting here, I was thinking of things that might be useful. I might call - call you, some - I want you to read those. I want you to really get familiar with that business, those chap -two chapters. Review them a couple of more times to get this in your head.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Given that you're - given that you're - . Like, there's two things. See, your knowing your own feelings is not so much a problem for you. That's part of it. But part of it is, having practice. Just plain practice in helping other people with their feelings. Not helping them, just respond - you know, reflecting them. Being empathic with them. And there's a few things I'll give you to read, and a few exercises and all of that. But another way of doing it - I'm willing personally sometime to call you up and ask you to help me with my feelings. It wouldn't be your hour; it would be my hour. I don't know about that. I've got to see about that. That's - that's a lot of (mutations) (ph) on that. That's - I'm just, like, fantasizing to somebody, I'm not trying to - </p>

<p>PATIENT: (interrupts) Right. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And another thing, somebody might come to me and say, "I'm having some bad time with X. And I might send X to you and [hear you try with X and see what happens."] (ph) </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. [0:57:42.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a lot of ways that (goes) (ph). (pause) I (fairly) (ph) do -. The reason I may not - that I really have to work on this in my own head, just figure it out. It would be very easy for me to fall in love with you, OK? If I did that, I'd have to be very careful. 'Cause I don't want to do that. It's too easy [for me] (ph), you know? It would complicate my - it would complicate my life. No way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. So that would be like a major reason I wouldn't do that, I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I also got - that - I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I started that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um. I have to read that again. I haven't read that in a [lot of years. (inaudible] (ph) . </p>

<p>6426 Harper, right? [0:58:37.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) (ph). Yeah. Our phone number is - oh, it's my own. It's not the hall phone, it's my own number. So if it doesn't ring, it's 'cause I'm not in the room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ***-****.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. That hall phone uses something else to get somebody [else to] (ph) -</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(inaudible) So where's your diary? Of your last session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - I don't have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's OK. (background noise: microphone, paper shuffling).</p>

<p>(whispers) OK, we'll [do it next time] (ph) . </p>

<p>I don't want this to ever become a chore. Like - (crosstalking). If it becomes not helpful, then we'll not do it. </p>

<p>(background noise: microphone, inaudible whispering, paper shuffling)</p>

<p>I won't even - I'll put down - (background noise: microphone, bumping, paper shuffling, writing.)</p>

<p>And don't sign it (out) (ph) . [1:00:20.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I won't do that until I finally put it in the folder. (background noise: microphone crackling, paper shuffling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm glad I came back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So am I.</p>

<p>(background noise: microphone crackling, paper shuffling).</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you. </p>

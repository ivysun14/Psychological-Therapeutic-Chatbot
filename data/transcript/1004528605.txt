<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey. I actually feel like myself again today. After a long of just blah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just there's always the nagging anxiety and that you know this will end and I'll go back to the feeling blah. But. That was my advisor we talked for four hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two hours of which was trying to transfer as much knowledge as can be done in one meeting to the student who will be taking over. Who thankfully is not a naive, bright eyed, fresh out of college - he's actually a manager at (inaudible) he's my age. He's going back after a career in industry so. He does his undergrad thesis with my advisor so he knows what he's getting into.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [00:01:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, that's - I'll never feel guilty about that. I had a really good conversation because, you know we'll it's just me and my advisor talking about my work. A lot of it her saying but I don't understand how the circuit works. Can you like go back to you know sophomore year in circuit theory and tell me how this works. Well it's really frustrating for me but this guy has the level of background knowledge on the subject that I do. It's weird and actually having a quite interesting discussion about the actual research. He disagrees with my methodology of course. (Laughing). Well that was good and then it's another two hours of working on a report for the person that still has open (ph) fund this next (inaudible) research. It was just he was like, you don't like to write and getting you to write is like pulling teeth so we're going to write this together sitting next to each other, and that sucked but at least it got done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:02:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I worked for a little bit after that running around campus. Got some paper work taken care of. Still haven't done the important piece of paperwork which is. . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The transfer credit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Transfer credit. But, at least I - I squared away the class that I dropped this semester. It turns out that my drop request from the online registration didn't go through so I had to run around and correct (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pain in the ass.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Got that done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now that will show up on my transcript as a W for withdrawal instead of F for didn't show up after the first - after the third week of class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Praying I looked for the grade on the transcript but whatever it just needs . . . yeah I don't know. (Pause.) [00:03:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That all sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I have an interview tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My phone interview yesterday. About the end of the interview he said I've really enjoyed this conversation. You know typically our hiring process is four or five weeks you know maybe you could come out and see our facilities. I could show you my product and we can you know talk more about your technical background, I don't know, next week or the week after and I was like, well. Actually I have an offer that I need to act on by Monday. Not this Monday but the next Monday by April 9th and he was like, oh what's your schedule like tomorrow?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing). But actually. . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Didn't know you had an offer. Congratulations on that too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I just got it yesterday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfect timing. They build computer components. [00:04:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was where you last time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. Is it a good offer? Are you pleased?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want more money (laughing). They're offering me less than what I asked for which is to be expected. Every job I've ever had I've just taken what they've offered me so I don't know how to negotiate a higher salary but all my friends tell me I should because I'm a chump if I don't so that's causing some stress. I'm waiting to see how the interview tomorrow goes before I return to their HR guys but I can at least say you know whether I have a strong prospect or not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Who's that with? Who's the company?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a startup. They use micro electro mechanical shutters. Like little microscopic like camera shutters almost instead of using LED's. [00:05:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What stage are they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They are - they've been around for two years and they just got snatched up by about a month ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they're not a startup anymore I guess but - but yeah they have two recs opens. Both of which are interesting to me but are different career paths. They might be angst next week over which career path I want to go with when they make me an offer. Trying not to think about that right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have anything else out there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sort of. I've gotten an application at the map works (ph) for - that the technical interview - phone interview Monday went very poorly so I don't expect them to act on that. I interviewed with [inaudible] but I haven't heard from them in the last month so I'm assuming they're not going to pursue it further but I have a friend who used to work for them and he said when he was hired it was like four months between when he interviewed and when they responded to him so. . . [00:06:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what I've heard about them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess if you're them and every scientist and engineer in the country wants to work for you, you can afford to be diggish because you'll still have a huge tunnel pool to draw from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (Pause). It's so funny like my assumption was different. It was that newly bureaucratic over there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If I just some - I mean they just move slow in every which way. Pretty much saying must be getting more pleasant for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also like if they've made a decision not to hire you they don't tell you they just. . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah so no response could mean they're slow or it could mean they've decided against you. They don't say. Which is really (pause) really frustrating and really bad behavior on their part I think. But again like everyone wants to work for them so they're not losing talent but having a crappy process. [00:07:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm asking this question is what I think to hear but do you have a sense of when you'd be likely to start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably the end of June.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: End of June, okay. I just didn't know if we've be able to meet at different times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sort of quick for me to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How far out that would be. I think that would be (pause.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah unsurprisingly I showed my Advisor the results of fake experiment she asked for three weeks ago. I finally just forced myself to get it done. I stayed up until two last night finishing it. So I'm a little out of it now because I haven't had much sleep and predictably she was like well how about you do yet another set of experiments. I'm like thesis's are due April 13th like I really should be writing by this point and not dicking around with doing yet another experiment, Jesus Christ. So that's super, super frustrating. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So like (pause) I guess is not in the realm of technological advice but just a normal grad school advice feel free to completely disregard it when it were to tell her you'll run some collection of experiments after you've written the thesis. Like other words can you say look I'm going to be writing for the next few weeks because it's due really soon but if you'll let me do that I'm perfectly willing to run some of these experiments after that's done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I did tell her that you know I want to start writing and you know I'm happy to keep working with her collaborating over the summer until Colin the new student gets up and running so she'll have these results if she wants and she was like well I don't think you thesis will be complete without them. [00:10:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but well. . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am so sick of this project and working on it is like pulling teeth because I don't want to be working on it. It's a stupid fucking project and (pause) yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't have really anything pressing I want to talk about. I don't know are there any threads from the last couple sessions you want to pick up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would say like at the risk of being extremely repetitive just talk off the top of your head. Like whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Talk off the top of my head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever comes to mind? Whether it be un-important you really (inaudible). [00:11:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well what I was doing for the last hour before I came here after I gave all them luck for the afternoon was researching fountain pens. My dad loves fountain pens and is convinced he can't afford one so he has his one (long pen) that he got as a gift twenty years ago that you know it's very special and he keeps locked away and never actually uses because he doesn't want to damage it. But I when I was a kid he would let me try using it on rare occasion and when I was in the third grade the school I was at actually had (inaudible) gifted and talented program. I hate that moniker but that's what I called it. I'm sure you know what GT programs are for elementary school kids. They gave us all like cheap $15 paper fountain pens and taught us calligraphy. I thought that was fantastic and I used that shaker pen throughout elementary school, middle, high school. Did all my writing with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:12:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My teachers were confused to say the least because we changed school districts. We moved to a school district where calligraphy was not part of the standard curriculum for nine year olds. When I went to college I just stopped using fountain pens because I don't know. I switched to pencils. I lost things too easily and there were a variety of reasons. But anyway when I was cleaning my desk a couple of weeks ago I found a set of vintage dip pens that my sister got for me when she did her study abroad. So rather than you know fountain pens have the ink in the barrel dip pens you actually have to - they're like quills almost except with steel, you have to dip them into a bottle of ink. So I've been re-acquainting myself with the calligraphy forms I learned you know 20 years ago and my form is terrible because I'm out of practice. But it's been lots of fun. I decided I wanted a fountain pen because dip pens are just really fussing and you can't take them on an interview. But I've been researching fountain pens and there are just so many choices and I'm doing the thing that I always do where I want to get the very best one and optimize for all of these different properties that of course I don't have years of experience using a variety of pens and pens cost money you know anywhere from $15 to $500 or more if you want to be really absurd. So I've been driving myself crazy for the last couple of days reading reviews and comparing things and putting together spreadsheets of different pros and cons and properties and of course when people write reviews you don't know how much credit to give them. Like do they actually know what they're talking about so. . . [00:14:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course my suggestion was just buy two or three $20 pens and see what you like about them and what you don't like about them and iterate from there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing.) But I want to find. . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How really impractically and completely un-fun is that? Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I want the find the very best one and make the right decision and get it right and it's actually very upsetting to me this notion that I might buy a pen and not like it because that would mean I didn't do my research properly and .. . Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I feel like you're almost trying to conceal it in a way but you're like quite enjoying this. [00:15:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hold on a second. I'm catching you (out interesting).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing.) I love the sense of - of knowing things and being able to, to speak intelligently and correctly about the differences between you know two different options you know I - and this drives Dave crazy. He's just like buy one. I think I must have spent months researching cars and going on test drives before I bought my car and he was sick of it. Long, long, (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go ahead. What did you get?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A Toyota.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come? [00:16:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it had good gas mileage, good reliability, long term average maintenance costs were low, it was inexpensive. I liked the way it handled. I mean there were cars that handled better but they were not in my budget</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing.) Ferrari's and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't test drive a Ferrari. Thinking more like Audi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Manuel transmission because I am this should come as a surprise something of a control freak. [00:17:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Neither or the two think they're theirs. I usually look at being a control freak with being really anxious about not being in control or there is some degree of that but I (inaudible) you're also referring to a kind of pleasure of being in control which I don't think of it as quite the same thing yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you have both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you going through all of these things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got advice like. . . [00:18:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also take a great deal of pleasure in being skilled at askewer skills for lack of a better word but you know things that require time and training and practice and experience like spinning or knitting. And I when I dry up wedding rings I always definitely an exercise and yeah but I mean that takes a great deal of skill and most hobbyist wouldn't be able to produce such a thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey (inaudible) sounded pretty comfortable for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And on one hand I take a great deal of pleasure in that in having these skills that are very difficult to master but on the hand there's still a part of me that denigrates that because I'm not creating the designs myself. I'm just implementing them. [00:19:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's the same with my calligraphy. You know I still need a great deal more practice. I wouldn't say I'm very skilled but I can you know repeat forms from a copy book or you know mimic someone else's font but I've never designed my own font. My handwriting is very much textbook. There's very little originality to it.</p>

<p>(Pause.) [00:20:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel safer in a way if I'm the one who keeps pointing at the more positive or enjoyable aspects of these things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean by safer?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Less anxious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at. [00:21:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I like - you keep emphasizing more negative aspects of the pursuits you're talking about in various ways and I keep pointing to you a way that like - a few times you've acknowledged but also other times it seems almost is more covert about how you're really enjoying some of the thing that you're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:22:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if it would - it a little less anxious for you if I'm the one who keeps pointing to the positive part and then it would be as if you were really talking about both sides of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't think it's a matter of anxiety. It's just (pause.) Hold on a sec. I don't know. I have a much easier time talking about the negative sides of anything on the positive. I don't know why that is. Maybe that's something to explore. But I guess maybe - and I don't think anxiety is the right word but there's definitely something that makes it difficult for me to talk about the positive aspects of these things. [00:23:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any thoughts about what that might be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, do you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean the way I was saying it, it was like - it was in more danger of being criticized or quashed if you were focusing on it then if I was focusing on it. But it's not that. (Pause.) I'm not sure. [00:24:49]</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess another thought I had was that it could feel unpractical or useless to focus on more positive side of things like things you talk about morganuos (ph) like that's the thing you need to do something about. You think, or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I might be a part of it but actually sounds like the kind of statement I make or yeah. [00:25:53]</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a hard time with giving and receiving compliments also. Seems to me like something that might be related to this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thought I would throw that out there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. What do you tend to do when you get done? What would you like? [00:26:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) but like no, no, no that thing you're saying about me it's not really true because XYZ</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's hard to have a sense of why you sounds like kind of reflectively do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause.) I mean (pause.) in many cases not all cases but in many cases I have a hard time believing that the person saying positive things about me actually means them but it's some kind of ploy to get something out of me. (Pause.) And most of the time it's that I just can't - I have a hard time seeing myself in a positive light and so I can't imagine that anyone else would. Any maybe part of it is that as a kid I got so much praise from teacher over things that were in hind sight essentially meaningless. Like, oh good job you got all A's. Well, not shit I got all A's my parents would - I don't even know what they would do. I was terrified of what they would do if I didn't get all A's so like why are you giving me - why am I getting a fucking gold star for doing what I was expected to do. I probably wouldn't have (inaudible) as a fucking gold star when I was 12 but. . . [00:28:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing.) That was what you were feeling.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I have the urge of a like a screen that like often things that are good coming towards you like if it can't pass through it. [00:29:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause.) [00:30:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if there's something going on there to do with actually keeping people at a distance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I have certainly been accused in the past by friends, roommates, housemates, of you know keeping people at arm's length. For other's sake. I don't know. I mean I have a tendency to over share a lot especially when I was an undergrad. Like I don't - there's very little that I consider private. Maybe because I grew up as part of the Internet generation but I just - you know we'll feel very free about talking about conflicts with my parents or you know what's going on in my life with you know friends, acquaintances, on chat or on Facebook or in person but I've certainly been told by people that in spite of how much detail of what I'm doing that I share there's an emotional distance. (Pause.) And it's certainly not something I do deliberately but I don't know. I've been told it's there. [00:33:02]</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're not - you have no sort of feeling or awareness that you're doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I think we talked about this a little bit last week but it's with my - the friends who I like the best there's a - I have a great deal of fear that I'm not being open enough or being a good enough friend. That there's a sense of - there's some kind of gap that I don't know how to cross. So that might be what my friends talk about when they say there's an emotional distance but like A I'm not doing it on purpose and B with some of my friends I want to close that gap but I have no idea how. [00:34:10]</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is that gap feeling like? I know you've talked some about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure how to describe it other than (pause.) I mean again most of my models for friendships come from books that I've read not from actually learning how to be a friend ahead but I have the sense that with close friendships there should be more than just being mutually entertaining which is what many of my friendships are founded on. (Pause.) And I guess you know when there's you know there's something terrible going on in my life or my friends you know. I have one friend who is - his parents belong to something of a cult and they're horrible people. You know essentially cut her off and that was very painful for her. You know the, the thing to do is to you know, offer a shoulder to cry on. Let her vent. Take her out for a couple beers, right. But it - I don't know. It just, it feels like I'm following a check list and not doing things out of you know an impulse of knowing the right thing to do but you know I read somewhere that this is what you do when a friend of yours is going through an emotional crisis and so you know because this is my friend I'm going to do these things that I read about and it just, it feels very inauthentic to me. [00:36:25]</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have anything in mind that would feel more authentic? Even if it didn't feel like the right thing to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. No. Nothing in mind. (Pause.) Also, completely unrelated to this but something that I just realized. I'm a lot more comfortable when you're asking me questions and I'm responding to them then being asked to just talk about whatever comes to mind. [00:37:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's very important. (Pause.) What is that difference like for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think when you ask me to just talk about whatever comes to mind there is a - I kind of feel this tricky feeling. It's the same sort of feeling when I'm presented a blank piece of paper and asked to you know write something. Like you know write a short story or you know whatever or like being in art class in middle school and being told just draw something. Be creative. I almost feel like any thoughts I might have had leading up to this session just kind of - it's like trying to grasp grains of sand like nothing. I can't grab hold of any thoughts. And I mean sometimes there will be something that's been bothering me that you know I'll make a mental note to myself to bring up and then you know there are things to talk about but if there's not something pressing that's bothering me it's just, I don't know. It's like facing a blank campus and not knowing where to start and that's very panicky for me. [00:38:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which . . . yeah I mean the way I'm understanding that is that somebody that is doing scribe. It makes you anxious in a way that disconnects you from whatever you're stream of consciousness might otherwise be. Does that sound?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Pause.) Being true to form here as a psychologist I'm going to say I think that does relate to the other things that we were talking about. I'm sorry to be cliché about this but (Pause) it sounds to me like a lot of this is to do with sort of worry and lack of familiarity with feeling sort of close and positive. Like close and supportive. Close and having faith in. . . Close and thinking well of another person. Instead the idea of just saying what's on your mind makes you worry and I assume that's on my (inaudible) about. The vulnerability, the possible judgment, something like that. [00:41:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean there's certainly that. I mean I won't be that I'm not concerned that you might be going home and thinking man that girl she's just a little bit crazy. (Laughing.) Which you know I mean my dad used to come home and talk about his patients all the time so there's - I don't know but there is a contract which means I feel much freer talking in this space then I would talking to a friend or even to my husband. Do I think it's more about that panicky feeling comes from you know what if what I have to say is completely irrelevant and wastes time or you know kind of takes us off on a side path that's not going to be useful towards fixing the problems that I have. [00:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (Pause.) Yeah I guess, I guess I didn't let anything probing positive like you feel like a really strong imperative around productivity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a real worry about not being productive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not being productive but also apart from productivity doing things wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like to get things wrong. (Pause.) I might have mentioned my SAT scores at one point. They wanted to question (inaudible) in the entire thing and I shelled out for the question and answer service to figure out which one it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are we going to stop for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll talk about more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hope it goes well tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yea.</p>

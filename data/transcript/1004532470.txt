<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Can I have the comfy seat?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I was asking Jessica if I could have the comfy seat.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [inaudible at 00:00:07]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Hi. (pause) Oh, let's see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I said, so let's see. Um, I guess I can get more things done with my therapist now. I think the first few times we were just like my background and stuff, ya know. She wants to know my background, but now I think I'll accomplish more when I meet with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel like you weren't accomplishing as much the first few sessions?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, but I think that's normal. I guess they've gotta know where I'm comin' from (chuckles) or something so...I mean I guess well that's normal for me anyway. It apparently (chuckles, unclear)) that way. Cuz I know I still need to figure out, um, how to explain, like how I've changed my I guess views of our marriage or marriage in general. Not that it makes up for the past but it can help the future so...(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that something you and Michael have been talking about?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, not exactly.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But hearing her say it now resonates with me. I understand where she's coming from. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have the two of you been over the last week or so?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um, well...we...first couple of days after we left you last time we had big arguments and then we got spoken to by Ken Latterner.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Uh, that happened since...we saw you last Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, last Monday.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No that happened last week and then our landlord like...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, it happened last weekend. That's when it happened. [00:02:31]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It was?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm hmm...or Monday.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And then he called Jepardo on Tuesday and we didn't go in or something. Or we did go in...I don't know, but it was after we saw her because I remember talking to, with my therapist...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I spoke to...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...who I saw on Wednesday. Right and didn't go to work Wednesday but I went to my therapy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I think the Jefferey's talked to us on Monday afternoon, evening.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think they talked to us Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, you're right. No, you're right. (pause) Yeah, we had huge arguments. Like in Jessica's defense mechanism I guess or whatever is just to scream really loudly so apparently some of our housemates complained to our landlord. Our landlord said we had to move out but they didn't give us any time that we needed to move out by. It was sort of hollow, not threatened, but...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And we figured out how to be quieter since.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And we haven't been being loud to each other, so [00:03:40]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:03:40] said anything.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's just not an option to argue...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...vocally there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you screaming about?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, it was just...I mean I know I did very awful things but, um, eventually I get tired of being called a, called names.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: By the end, it wasn't just that flagrant. I was just bringing up issues you didn't want to hear about.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think maybe you were doing it [inaudible at 00:04:16], maybe not. (pause) Well, cuz if he brings up an issue I want to be able to listen to him and then think about it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: There's something about the room that we stay in...not the room but maybe the enclosed space or something? Cuz we didn't have any of those issues when we were walking around or on the bench.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe I should really give it a rest, cuz like I'm tired of being angry or something, but it doesn't mean I'm not thinking about it all the time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know, I am too, but...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah. [00:05:03] (pause) (sighs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys seem more disengaged than you seemed in the past.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Disengaged?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like from each other.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean but the whole thing is for the last what has it been since we were arguing on Tuesday then?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Since really Thursday we've been going to work, we've been getting along pretty well honestly. I don't think it's cuz we're disengaged. I don't feel that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that had a little bit more of a negative connotation than I meant but like you come in here and you were angry at each other and getting into it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you're not doing that now.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Uh, yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Doesn't mean we won't be next time (chuckles) I'm just sayin'. Maybe it doesn't.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My stepfather up in Vermont who's..he's a lot of things. He's one of my parents, right? With my mom not there any more. It's like for example I hated comparing myself to her but it's just like [inaudible at 00:06:27] or like wait for me to explain when I don't need to explain. It's like you're mom died, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But the person that's left, the other parent...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...is her actual biological father. She knows he cares about her unconditionally, and he does.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, and he loves her very much and would support her, and I mean thank goodness, ya know, no matter what happens between the two of us she can count on his support.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, so like...that makes me feel good, better, ya know. It's not like (clears throat) if we separate or something like that she's going to be left totally high and dry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because a lot of, I mean we received a lot of financial support from my mother and my stepfather historically and, uh, like for example my stepfather is paying for like at least half of these sessions, so...or, ya know, half of these. I don't know exactly how it breaks down at this point but, whatever. The point is my therapy, he's covering all of that, so it's just like your dad's covering your therapy.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is my point is that historically they have provided a lot of financial support and...I forgot the other thing I was going to say.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, the parent that's left for you is not your biological parent.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, the parent that's left for me is my stepfather and he is...I have a lot of issues with him. This is more of my personal thing but it affects me and it affects us, and I'll tell you why in just a second. I'm trying to make this not too longwinded and cut to the chase. Um, so my stepdad is the executor of my mom's estate. My mom left a substantial amount of money in trust for myself and my sister and with that money before I found out about all this bullshit with Jessica, um, (mumbles, inaudible [00:08:30], uh I had plans to start a business in Vermont and then I was going to get a loan for like $50,000 out of this trust from the...it was going to be a loan but it was sorta like if I don't...if my business fails like what's going to happen and all that stuff. Dad's gonna die and repay the trust that way because it's like $50,000 compared to the total sum total of this thing, it's like it's nothing, so, um...I mean it is. It's a drop in the bucket, but like whatever. (sighs) He is being a real asshole right now and it seems to have started right after I went up to Vermont and I think it was before we saw you the first time or had we already seen her once?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Probably not. It was the first weekend after we, um...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I found out about this shit, right? And I was beside myself, and I had planned to go up to Vermont anyway because I had an important interview with the guy that I was about to rent this shop from, right? Shop space. It's like perfect space. Really it is. Still is. Um, and uh I went home and my sister was there and my stepdad was there and I was just fucked up, ya know. I didn't get there until Sunday. I was supposed to go up on Friday cuz I was so angry and sad. Like I didn't feel like it was safe for me...it was not safe for me to drive up there. Like, I was crying the whole time. It was really fucked up. Um, or I was angry the whole way. It just that it wasn't safe for me to drive. Anyway, I got up there and I did fine on my interview thing and my stepdad and they were all being supportive and then the last day that I was there my stepdad said—and my sister had gone back to her house—and was just like telling me about like...oh, yeah. Mentioned Jordan on our first appointment with you. There were three things that he was upset about Jessica having done. One was the affair and he was like it's not a big deal...he's like, he even played it down a huge extent because like at that point he told me that he had chewed on my mom and told me about specifics like where he was, in Europe in 2004 and like ya know it's like how is this helpful for me to hear, cuz my dead mom—she died in December—it's like this is not helpful for me to hear from this person. But like ya know he almost was being...he said...he made a point to me like I'm not excusing the adultery but it's not as big a deal as you think it is because, ya know, maybe [inaudible at 00:11:04] if someone in their, ya know, mid to late 70s, which he is, but...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But he's on his third wife and did he even tell your mother? [00:11:08]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No. He's on his third wife. I'm sure he had more than the one affair. It just was like hard for me to hear. I was just like why, ya know...anyway. We need to hurry along. Um, ya know the line he hit me with is like adultery, ya know, it's not that big a deal because it's like adultery is what...it's what adults do. That's why they call it adultery. I was just like what the fuck is this? Okay, anyway. And the second thing is...yeah right? And the second thing he was upset...he like said he was more upset with Jessica about the fact that she was using drugs at the time.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, you told him that, even though you were too?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: What ever. He knows I was.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not the point so much. I didn't tell him everything, ya know it was just like...and I've learned that anything you tell my sister is like a sieve which is really, really frustrating and I can't tell my sister secrets. I found this out recently.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: She wouldn't answer...talk to you either. [00:12:04]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I don't know what's going on there. Um, and a...and oh, but now you're supposed to be looking for a job. These are the two things he really cared out, or mainly the job thing. Because apparently for him it's all about the bottom line. It's like these millions of dollars and it's not even fuckin' his, ya know? And he benefits from the interest off the trust. That's his income. Plus his own pension and everything. So, I mean his life is all set. He's doing fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was this your mother's money?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: She inherited it from...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She inherited it like I think like about a year before she died.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Great aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: My great aunt and uncle who were unable to have children so they were effectively my grandparents when I was growing up because my mom didn't have a good relationship with her parents.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is my maternal grandmother's sister and her husband. (pause) Wonderful people really in every way and that's really cool people. Um, and that's the reason I don't have any debts from school and this other stuff but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they had been...before they left her money they had given her...given you guys money?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: They covered all of our college expenses and then left me enough money so I could have gone to grad school. [00:13:27]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I mean they both had their PhD's. They were really into education.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Florence had her master's but...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, ya know, and they basically made it so any of our children or any of my sister's, my sister's child, their college is paid for already. They were just [inaudible at 00:13:40] people. But, anyway...it's not easy...scratch...and it's like I'm talking to my dad last night and this is what I wanted to get to. Cuz this is about like our real...like something that could happen for us in the future and I don't know if I want to. It's really difficult. But my stepdad, my actual biological father was telling me last night, he's like, ya know he's like, like stop like, forget about the money. Stop worrying about the money. That's what my dad said to me. And the germ of what he was saying, and I understood that. I talked him for about 45 minutes. The essence of what he was saying was, um, that I need to be self-reliant. I shouldn't depend on my stepfather or give him the power of having control of my situation, ya know? It's like I shouldn't have to work. It should be a nest egg which is something else. We should be self-reliant, but between all the different things that I've had to contend with recently and I've been getting less consistent work, and I don't know what's going to happen, cuz our job is ending. Our job —we both work at the same place —it's ending like maybe the end of this week, maybe the week after, whatever, it's ending soon, and when it does, uh, we don't know what we're doing. But the plan that we had was for us to get this loan, and like I was going to incorporate like all this energy I'm spending on this stuff is stuff I should have been spending on putting together, like incorporating an LLC and putting together a business plan and all this stuff so my stepdad could green light giving us this loan so we could—she could get a job up in Vermont that would hopefully afford us health insurance—and I would have a job working at the shop that I'm supposed to be, supposed to have...but anyway my stepdad ever since he...and I think it's something that clicked in his head, honestly, um...something changed. Like I mean I was upset about him saying this stuff about my mom but like I'm not in any position to voice anything cuz he can cut me off of the trust for any reason or for no reason at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't seem legal. [00:15:48]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It is. (pause) So it's the dynamic with my stepdad is all fucked up and I know I should be self-reliant and not depend on him and like..and therefore...and then it wouldn't be an issue. I wouldn't have to go...it wouldn't be an issue. He wouldn't have anything on me because I'd be like yeah, I'm takin' care of myself. Whatever. And I get all that. But something clicked in his head after, I think since he told me that he cheated on my mom. That was his deal, was his issue. I was upset by it, but like I didn't even voice it, ya know. I just felt like okay, that's fucked up dude, but like I can handle that. She's dead. It doesn't really matter, but...something clicked in his head and he just did a one-eighty on all of these plans that we were supposed to go pursue.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And he doesn't want us to move to Vermont.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He doesn't want us to move to Vermont. He told me I'm a carbon copy of my mother, like, in so many words. It's just like...he's just being...he's a fuckin'...he's an asshole in all his ways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was supposed to be an insult?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Just a reality check for me, cuz he thinks he is like...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I think that was supposed to be an insult.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...he like thinks he's King Shit of Fuck Mountain, like, ya know (chuckles) it's like Slime Gun King. Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I think it was meant as an insult. [00:17:04]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know what it was meant as. It was unsensitive as hell. Ya know if I get at a point where I honestly think about all of this shit...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he said figure...figure your stuff...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, you get your feet on the ground in New York.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where it's more expensive to live.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, where it's more expensive to live. It just doesn't make any sense, although we do have free health care. That's the one thing he can hold over my head...he's been holding over my head is like I don't think you should move anywhere where you don't have health insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so you're gonna apply for a job.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. There are a bunch of different solutions where we can be...we can be proactive and everything but like (pause) I guess one of the fucked up things is one of his obligations that's in black and white as a trustee of this money is that he has to cover my health coverage. Ya know (chuckles) it's like I can't believe he's holding that over my head because it's one thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was one of the four things that...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't want this to be a big thing about me, but anyway my dad and my stepmother—and you don't know this because I probably didn't talk to you about it last night, um, my stepmother thinks that we need to have some space. (pause) I have been saying a lot that I wish other people would share their opinions with me. That way I wouldn't have to make these hard choices, or we wouldn't have to make these hard choices, but somehow or other the onus seems to fall on me more. Which doesn't make sense because you're the one that did what you did and I didn't have a choice.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, but the...I think it's because I don't want to move to Virginia and I'd rather be with you, so...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's why it's [inaudible at 00:18:48]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And I made my [inaudible at 00:18:51]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, but like she just lied about it for you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She didn't know I mean. And you just get back from Virginia, didn't you think when you cheated on me that maybe we'd separate and where you have to go back to? Where would you go? Virginia.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I didn't know what my future was at that point.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Your what?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I didn't know what my future was at that point. I didn't have a job yet.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. But when you were supposed to be looking for one you were like...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...[inaudible at 00:19:13] someone else. It's just bullshit.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It wasn't the whole time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You're just bullshitting me. Anyway, you, you were in that situation. In that month. Whenever...whatever time period it was. I have no idea. You were being fairly fuckin' contradictory and you were lying to me all over the place. Like to my face. Like you didn't say our relationship wasn't good, but it might have something to do with you sneaking behind my back and lying to my face and sending me misleading texts so you could clear like a couple of hours of time to go have sex with someone else, ya know? It's just...this kind of shit makes me think my stepmother is right, ya know? We do need to separate for a while and if it makes us miss each other and want to be together, then maybe we can get back together, and then if it...if you feel indifferent and it just kind of crystallizes like my feelings are...anyway whatever. She _[inaudible at 00:20:16]. My stepmother and my dad had made me this generous offer of letting me stay up at their house until I get my feet on the ground. Didn't have to pay rent or anything like that. Won't have health insurance. But to hear my dad say it, it wouldn't be long me looking for a job. I'd get a job and would have health insurance. [00:20:32]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, but not, not if you work at that guy's job.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I wouldn't be working at that guy's job.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: This is the don't-rely-on-Jim-for-anything approach.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah. So you'd have to apply for some place like or [inaudible at 00:20:44] or like that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Barney Clapton has spaces in his shop. He's a big carpenter. I've got a bunch of different in's, like in Vermont I've got better contacts that I do in New York. I would get a job actually. Um, so whatever. The point is but insurance benefits don't kick in for like three months usually anyway, right?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It depends on the job.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Depends on the job.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know that that one job I was looking at it kicked in like the first of the next month, ya know...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ....the very next month you start.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And there could be a time period where me and him are residents in New York. I mean [inaudible at 00:21:33] options in Vermont, even if I was technically like sleeping in my dad's house, that's not technically a couple-week visit but it doesn't mean I move away from New York and find a job that has health insurance and then you're like okay figure it out. But that would involve you moving to Virginia...or doing whatever you want to do. You can do whatever you want to do. I'm not trying to dictate what you do, but...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. If I already had a job in New York then my dad would probably help me for a little while to stay here but...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Could you stay at the Jefferey's house in that one room? You know it's not so bad when you're there by yourself, honestly.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Or you can move out. I don't care if you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you guys trying to figure out your options?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean we have to. [00:22:18]</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, we don't...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean this is between a rock and a hard place. Like everything is like jobs ending, like need to get work, figure out our future. The people who have...the guy who's been telling us what...like he was the one that gave me all the recommendations to go look at shops in Vermont.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Who?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Jim.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. And he's, he's just completely...he's totally bailed on us as near as I can figure. Aside from the fact he's gonna pay bills like your...ya know like, like treatment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your stepfather?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah. He's gonna continue paying for treatment. All psychological stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe I'm being too like concrete at the moment, but usually trusts mean that they're yours...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It is mine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean usually you can have access...you don't have access to the trust?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, because he's the trustee until he dies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Cuz he is her husband.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Got it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And there's like several things that could be taken out for like emergencies, medical or something..I don't know. [00:23:16]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, right. And even when the money does come down the pike to me it's not like I get like...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It all at once.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...a million dollars all at once. Kind of over ten years I get infusions of...well, whatever money, ya know...who knows what the economy is going to do and what the different investments that the trust holds are going to do between now and when my stepfather dies, but whatever the number is...whatever the amount it is at that point, it's going to divvied out in 10 percent every year for ten years until I actually have the whole thing.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: This isn't important, but I don't see how it would increase if Jim uses all the interest.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well the interest isn't cutting into the principle. I understand the responsible thing. He doesn't want to cut into the principle of the trust.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's what a good like trustee does. Don't cut into the principle because the more you cut into the principle the less there is to accrue.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Because it's got some high-yield investments [inaudible at 00:24:18]. It's all new to me. I thought when my mom died I wouldn't have to worry about money any more and now I've got this guy I don't trust from my childhood who like almost left my mom like ten times, being the dude who's like in charge of everything, and he's not...and, and he was being really supportive, but ya know also holding out to...I mean I shouldn't have that money all at once.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like I should, I should be...have someone saying no, you can't just get...go for a free ride and do whatever you want. You need to be responsible. (whispers) I don't know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He sounded wounded too. He's so delicate.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: He's so fuckin' loony. Ya know you have to be so careful around this person. It's all about him. It's really fucked up. And the thing I'm [inaudible at 00:25:08] is like, it's just stupid that when he dies in five, ten, whatever years it is that he dies, like I can be...like I can travel around the world like three times if I want to...whatever, ya know. Low stress. Go to Spain and fuckin' chill out for a week, which I really like right now, thank you. But right now when everything is fucked up and like I'd...I'd have a nervous breakdown, fuck it. Have falling...I lost like half of my friends...which we haven't gone into with you I don't think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Like, whatever. There's this legal thing where like we were caught in a situation where someone else's pot—marijuana—was in our possession but it wasn't ours, so we flipped on this dude, which we would have gotten arrested otherwise, so basically we gave up this guy whose weed it actually was...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He never told us to do otherwise.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, as a result we were considered narcs by a whole bunch of our friends. So I think we lost all of our...I can't even tell you how the impact of that has been without going into too much detail. It's just too longwinded. Told Alex Frazier all about it, whatever. Like lost half of our friends, both of our moms have died, and then I find out she's been cheating on me. It's like...in like, what like October, like lose all your friends. January first fuckin' have your mom get hit by a truck, and then like a month and a few days...a month and a half later find out your wife's been cheating on you with this dude who was one of your best friends and became a complete asshole to you, and she's been doing it for years. And it's just like, ya know, I can have a nervous breakdown. Fuck it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All bets are off. [00:26:49]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I might just as well! It's gonna be like, have him realize that like he's being stupid and cruel. Maybe I should be allowed to just take a fuckin' break, ya know? Cuz man that's all...I don't think he gets...that's just like not...it's not the point. It's just like this whole like idea that I need to hunker down and stuff and I'm just like dude, fuck off.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: He's being harder on you than when...than before.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean all through fuckin' college like...last time I went to Europe was in 2000, the summer of 2000, before 911, that time period. Before that...how old was I in 2000? Like 22...21?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Was that when you graduated?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah 22. Like from birth to 22 I went to Europe like 15 times, 8 times, shit kind of times, right. Eight times, something like that. And then like the last decade of my life as an adult it's like I haven't been allowed to do that at all.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But that's kind of...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it's just it's...fine! I'm just trying to say it's this whole structure of this wealth. It doesn't make any God damn sense to me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, and after you got old enough to be independent from your parents, that's when you haven't been able to go to Europe.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get all that. I get all that. It just doesn't make any sense to me because right now is when we need support. I'm just...this is the crux of what I'm sayin'. It had nothing to do with money. I'm just sick of people not meeting me fuckin' half way. I'm just tired of it. My stepdad's not meeting me halfway. My sister's not meeting me halfway. You never...you didn't meet me halfway for the majority of our marriage.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Like your sister was the one person you said that had your back. [00:28:22]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She does have my back. She just hasn't...she's not returned my calls lately. Maybe she's been busy. But like my stepdad doesn't have my...like he hasn't met me halfway. You haven't met me halfway for sure. Like...I'm just tired of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's talk about how you feel that Jessica can be meeting you halfway and how the two of you feel like you could be meeting each other half way.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I think we've done a better job the last few days. (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I agree. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's changed?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I gave him more back rubs.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Snorts.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Chuckles) It might just be because we were forced not to yell (chuckles). I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, like if we yell one time in that room, like we'll get kicked out for sure. Or you yell. I don't yell.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, but one morning I just woke up and like I just...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You were having a bad dream or something.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just saw you roll over and maybe you were making a face like you had pain in your back but I was just like uh! Cuz that scared me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, what scared you?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I had just woken up too, so I was probably having a bad dream and then...and then I saw his face making...his face was...I mean it looked angry to me but it was more...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: There have been situations where I've woken up from really bad dreams and sort of attacked her but didn't mean to...I wasn't awake. I was just having a horrible dream where she was being an asshole or something.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So anyway...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: So that's not unprecedented. Oh shoot! We forgot about that paper!</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I gave it to her.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Oh, okay. Cool. [inaudible at 00:30:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, oh I'm...you know I'm terribly sorry. I said that to Jessica...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, she asked me if it was time to start?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm really sorry. Is that okay? If you didn't know I can...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I signed the paper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But if you didn't...I'm really sorry about that. You should not be recorded if you don't think you are. I can erase that if you want.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well...we don't save the money off the treatment (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but, yeah, but I...I...I feel terrible. You should not be recorded if you don't know you're being recorded.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't...I didn't know that. I should know...I know it's only my absentmindedness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: It is [inaudible at 00:30:34]...in retrospect....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Keep your cool.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It's cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think about...I'm not going to do anything with it cuz that really feels like that's not cool with me, if you...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, well whatever your standards are. I don't care. Like I know I appreciate your having really particular standards about that. I think you should, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we can figure it out.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's what I'm...yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll figure that out. I wonder what brought that paper to mind all of a sudden, though. You said oh, we forgot...I don't know why that came to mine.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Laughs). Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know. I probably just remembered. [inaudible at 00:31:08] well I'm sure that I don't know. Let's figure it out.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That's like...when you do laundry you're like what made you think that? (chuckles) Like you thought your feet...like your socks smelled and I said no, I just saw your socks and they were like the purple fuzzy ones, so (chuckles)...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That I wear...they were sort of his slippers and I shouldn't be wearing his slippers (laughs).</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So I just said I don't (mumbles) [inaudible at 00:31:29] cuz his feet stink. (pause) (hums) I mean I have been home more often. I haven't been doing as much volunteer stuff. Maybe that's made the difference.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I really don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I have a couple of thoughts. I think one...first of all no one should be recorded if they didn't know, but I think that also this...you're talking about how few people you can trust and so I think that's why I reacted so strongly, like oh my God, you're being recorded....</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: (Laughing).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and you don't even know. You don't even trust any more and you can't come to your therapist and trust her to do, ya know...so I...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: That's not how I feel...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I know...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...you know it's...make it subconscious. [00:32:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I...well I don't know if that's how you feel, but I think I was especially sensitized to it because of that, cuz that's what you've been talking about all along and that's what...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I appreciate that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...we've been talking about today, so anyways, I think I was...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And that's a good point, isn't that the root of what I've been saying? Meeting me halfway translates to who can I trust? I guess so.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Cuz it is a trusting of sorts. Like (pause)</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um, hmmm...forgot what I was about to say. Oh—I was just curious if you had talked to, um, Becka May...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I did. I got a chance to touch base with her real briefly.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um, and did you give permission for her to talk to Jack Meyer?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He had done that....I had talked to him like two or three weeks ago. Well do you have any other particular questions about that, or...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No, not really (chuckles). I don't think so. Maybe that's why I thought of it, though, because I had questions but I can't remember right now. [00:33:14]</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Usually around anxiety. Because we've got to figure out what the hell we're doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear that.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And like really soon and like the whole thing about it is like the obvious question anyone would have which is totally reasonable and it affects what we do is like are we going to do it together or not?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right. Which was my question, right?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that's the thing. I always want people to have opinions. My stepmom had an opinion.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: She always has an opinion.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, but that's the whole problem. So now somebody gives me an opinion we need to be separate and I'm like oh that's really, really challenging. (chuckles) Have someone else give me an opinion. I'm sorry, I interrupted you.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, I just was saying cuz I didn't know if we can make any...I mean separation is not permanent but it feels like...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, I mean they're two different things. I mean if you're married there's like legal separation and then there's just not being around each other.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: So anyway, I was saying that...I don't know if we could figure that out in a week, so maybe we should just move on together and then continue to figure it out.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right. That's the whole principle on the woodshop is like if you like...when in doubt, don't. If you have some question about whether or not you're supposed to do something, don't do it because at the very worst...at the very best you could with dumb luck get it right. At very worst you could be unsafe and cut your hand off...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But by not making that decision you're also making a decision...sometimes.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Not making a decision, you're making a decision. I think that's true in this situation. I'm saying like most of the time you'll just mess up what you're working on. Sorry. But the whole thing about it is that...yeah, it's like staying with the status quo, hey, right. But it's a different situation altogether.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you guys want?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: (whispers) I don't know what I want.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Ultimately I want our relationship to be awesome (nervous laughter) but that would take a lot of work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What comes to mind about the kind of work it would take?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um, he needs to be able to trust me, and I need to be able to show that I'm sorry, or...ya know I think he...like I said at the beginning, I think one way he could trust me is if I am not the same person that would cheat on him.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I just don't know how someone changes and like...like I think it's sort of contrived, Jessica.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well no, I mean, you can change your outlook on things and act differently. That's easy enough. Like my nephew became a pesce-pollotarian.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: pesce-pollotarian ...I mean what do you eat.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Stopped eating meat (chuckles).</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Ya know, I mean ya know it's like don't even get me started on that. Fuckin' hell. (sighs). I don't know what I want. Sorry, Jessica. I don't know what I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See, I think like for you Michael I can certainly hear the conflict more and sort of the feeling more. I feel like I believe you Jessica that you want to be together and make this relationship work but I don't always feel like in the tone of your voice. It feels very casual and not like oh, my God I want nothing more than to see this marriage work. So I'm wondering what the disconnect is between what I really believe you want and where the feeling is behind it.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: That might just be because, um, I'm not outspoken with my feelings. I don't know. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel it intensely that you want this to work?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Yeah, I mean was reading online about similar situations and many of the couples that stayed together said that their marriage was like stronger and more open than ever, so...that sounds nice (chuckles)...that sounds promising and that would be awesome. (pause) Like I would want to stay together in the hopes that our marriage would be even better than before. Sounds like it'd be hard to reach that. [00:37:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think the hard part is? What comes to mind?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, it's hard to imagine that our marriage could be better than before I cheated on him, I mean cuz it kind of breaks the whole like dream of having like one love your whole life, ya know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that's gone. Fuck.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I know, so...so that's hard to imagine but it must be possible cuz it's happened to others.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the...I want to get to you Michael. I don't want to leave you out, but I'm wondering what that dream is.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Just being really, really pleased and happy with your marriage and your life. (pause) And I mean that's what...the way my parents were anyway. They were both really. They were both really happy people. They both loved each other a lot, so...(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you right now, Michael?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, like okay then dude why do you put that all in jeopardy, ya know? Okay, that was the example you grew up with. My example where I grew up was totally fucked up. Like, ya know, it's like what...just because...I mean it's like what gave you the right, Jessica? It's like fuck off. I mean honestly, seriously. It just sucks dude. Don't want to be here having to deal with this conversation. Marriage counseling in general —good, right? Good to do. But like this is, this is like...it's like this is different. This is forced. This is something that had to happen because of what you did. I think it's something that we want to elect to do that's going to make our relationship better, ya know? I don't want to deal with this. I don't want to have to be like a fuckin' person that's an example to other people about some fuckin' — ya know know what I'm saying? It's like I don't have a problem....it's like the point is...dude I don't want to be a fuckin' case study, alright?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: You signed up for it.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know! It's not the fuckin' point!</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I don't want to deal with this shit!</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And if you'd done what your fuckin' supposed to do, and like agreed to the shit that you promised. I mean for Christ sakes, he was one of our groomsman. He promised to uphold our marriage too! You suck in the ceremony and I like I thought it meant something. It's bullshit. It's all fuckin' bullshit. She's lied to me for years. For like years. The majority of our marriage you've been lying to me.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Not like...I wasn't like...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Okay, then figure out when the fuck you cheated on me. Alright, I'd like to know about that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I'm just saying...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You don't even know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...I wasn't cheating on you the whole time.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But you did it since like 2007, 2008, what year was it?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I did it once then and...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, dude...the point it...the point is like even if it was more recently, like it was one isolated event, like maybe I can forgive; her mom just died or she just got out of recovery from, from, ya know, from drug addiction. Like, like oh I want to emphathize with her on these...ya know. It's like...or maybe even including the one back then. Like there's something in there where I can be like gosh she was really confused, all this other stuff. She had moved up here....like I can get it, ya know, and try to emphathize with you and support you to realize how to be, ya know, better for yourself and better for others, and I need to be better for you and better for others too. Like, but there's just like, there's just like this breach of fuckin' trust. It's like this fuckin' whore...like this thing. I can't get the imagery out of my head. I can't get it out of my fuckin' head. I'm sick of fuckin' thinking about this. I'm going to the rest of my life. I know I am on some level. Like enough time, I'm gonna get over it. I'm not gonna dwell on this the rest of my fuckin' life, but like if I stay with you, I'll think about it...occasionally, for the rest of my fuckin' life. I don't want to fuckin' do that. It hurts. [00:42:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you thinking, Jessica?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Oh, well, um I'm thinking about the difference...well Jack said that he shouldn't get all the details.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I...(frustrated sound)...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But I think he should.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, it doesn't...I don't want that dude because I know what the fuck happened. That doesn't matter. I mean I know what the fuck happens when someone gives someone a blow job. I know what that is, ya know, and what the fuck! Fuck you! It's fuckin' outrageous to me. Maybe we should get tested for STDs. Christ! Fuck you! That's how I feel. That's the part of me that's angry and the part of me that'd be like yoh! Straight up and get the fuck out of my life.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: But then you say you'll miss me.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Right, I will...terribly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: How am I supposed to feel?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Um, how do I feel about the way he feels? [00:43:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anything.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: She's put me in a shady fuckin' situation and I'm gonna miss you more than anyone.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: I just feel regretful and...(pause) um...(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And? You look really sad...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...scared or like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you scared about?</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Change, maybe? I don't know.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: You mean the change if we get actually to separate and stuff like that.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, and I'm also scared of the change in our relationship if we stay together.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Why? I thought that was supposed to be really good.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: No...hopefully it's supposed to be good, but you're always gonna have to think about this, so...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: It fuckin' sucks.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: ...I would feel sorry...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, why would you do that to me? You see?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is actually more feeling than I've seen you have in a year. I don't think I've ever seen you sad like this.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Well, I've gotten that way before. When he's really upset cuz I hurt him I guess.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: See, like I get to react to her having a good time? By being so angry and so hurt, and it takes a certain amount of this for her to actually reflect and be like oh, I'm sorry for having a good time? You're still the one that's angry and hurt? And then she has to worry about my reaction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But she has to react to my react...it's just bullshit. It's like I'm just...I'm just made to feel like a total asshole. I hate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think, um...I'm not like trying to take away your anger but I don't think this is just Jessica having a good time. I know that that....</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, no, no...I'm saying, I'm saying what she did when she cheated on me. I understand this isn't good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no. That's not what I was commenting on. I think...I know your feeling is, at least some of the time this is just about Jessica having a good time. I just, I don't think that that's true. I don't think Jessica thinks that true. I think that it...when....it's like the most painful interpretation is that Jessica's just having a good and time and here am I getting fucked over.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, on some level that's like what happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. We're gonna to need to stop in a moment.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But um, I know, and I mean part of I can help you with, although it sounds like there's so much up in the air, but one of the things that I could help you with going forward if you guys are gonna stay together and gonna stay here is to sort of get a more...sort of nuance story than Jessica's having a good time, for both of you. I know...you're a very bright guy, Michael. I know that you don't just think it's just that and that's the end of the story. I know that and you know that and Jessica's knows that. But I know when you're most pissed off and most hurt, that's where your mind goes. So I'm reframing it in that way. I'm not insulting any of intelligences by assuming that that's what you really...that's all you think that's there.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I get that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, so...I...do you, um...God there's so much up in the air. Do you want to try to meet another time this week before you leave? Before you go to Virginia or what would you like to do? Or just wait till next week.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: I mean we're gonna stay around here for a little while. I'm not gonna be able to make a decision about this. I'm just...I'm just...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: She's just asking about the decision whether to meet with her...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, let's meet later this week and see you next Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: And then we both have our individual therapies this week....</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: And I've got my individual therapist, individual therapist tomorrow afternoon, my gastroenterology appointment Wednesday morning, Dr. Patton my addiction psychiatrist Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: See, I think with the amount of work that we have to do (mumbles, inaudible) maybe we should...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what would you want...to schedule something now or do you want just e-mail me if you want to schedule something. What do you think?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Let's meet on Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's schedule something now cuz at least I'll know what works with your schedule and your appointments.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Thursday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could something Thursday. And I'm not gonna do anything with the um...you guys talk about it...I'm not doing anything with the tape right now. What I'm...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Well, that recording right there I'm also sensitive to was I talk about a bunch of financial stuff and that makes me a little uncomfortable...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, well...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: ...but maybe it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we need to...it doesn't. I mean if you really, cuz I mean...</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: All they did is transcribe it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...you're Joe in Minnesota who, ya know, I don't know is a factory worker, ya know.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Their file that they keep doesn't even include our names, or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't include the location or even the country. But you have to be...like if you feel like you're going to inhibit what you say because of it, this is not a good idea. Like this is not...if you're very self-conscious about it, this is a bad idea. I do not want this...this is the way, ya know, I do not want this interfering...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Intellectually it shouldn't matter. But if I think about it like rationally, like intellectually, like it shouldn't matter to me because it's like all this stuff you're saying. The location. Like the worst thing that could possibly happen, is the best thing is I could help someone else, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's the idea.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, no, and I get it. Like that's cool, but I mean..</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: No, I signed the thing. So I'm really actually cool with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll just make any noise.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But like I don't know if it's gonna be like like subconsciously if it's affecting me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well that's why we need to...cuz it...</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: But I don't...it's just this whole point of subconscious stuff. You don't know if it's affecting you (chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, right. But part of my job is being the protector of the treatment. That's my highest priority.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, let's talk about it a little bit next time too, cuz anyway I'm sensitive too, because I've had your feelings about it. So I actually do have a couple options Thursday. I could meet at either...do you want something in the morning or afternoon?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Depends how early in the morning or early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Afternoon I could do something at 3:50.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Naw...that's our middle of our...like for us that's prime work time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What time...cuz Thursday I have some flexibility.</p>

<p>FEMALE CLIENT: Do you have any morning?</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Yeah, right...24 hours ahead of time if we're gonna meet...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, if you could actually, cuz I don't really have a 24-hour policy.</p>

<p>MALE CLIENT: Let, let, let, let, let us, let us talk to...pencil that in or whatever if you can do that. Let me talk to our employer. That's what we need to do.</p>

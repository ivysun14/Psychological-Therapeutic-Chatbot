<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you find that people plan for these sessions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like they sort of say, "What am I going to say today?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I don't plan them. Sometimes I think about what I'm going to say. And sometimes, up to the last minute, I really don't know. Well. I know, I want to, there's something I wanted to ask you.</p>

<p>You said something last time that I really liked and that was, you expect that there's no, we shouldn't place value judgment on emotions. I never thought about that. Mostly the things that have been happening with me have been with friends who will run into guys that don't call them back. 0:01:24.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and discussing all of that. I don't want to sound too preach or self-righteous (inaudible). I just think it's right. And a couple of times, a couple of friends didn't wait around, you know, wait for the call or whatever it was. But sometimes I wonder— you know, I don't talk about that too much because I don't think women accept that too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Accept what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That fact of not judging themselves by what men think—like, you know, like we were talking about a friend last night who has a boyfriend who's really treating her rotten and she says, "Well you," a friend of mine said well, you know, "She can't drop him because she doesn't want to because she's too shy to go out and meet somebody else." So I said, "Well maybe it would better to not have anyone than to keep one that's mistreating you." And she said, "Yeah I told (inaudible)." But it sounded like this person wasn't convinced and if, maybe the way I'm feeling is only right for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Inaudible (noise).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could be. I (inaudible) attract men you don't feel that you have to put up this (inaudible). I'm really, you know, put your strong defense up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that feel like a defense (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it's a defense. You know, I really I believe (inaudible at 0:03:12.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it does something to you when other people don't seem to feel that you're right is what I'm saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it may. Well, well it doesn't dissuade me from what I feel. It's just that I don't understand why they're still in that. The only thing that I think about it is that, well, I think I'm right but maybe this isn't right for them. Maybe if that's your way of life—because you've heard of Gloria Steinen?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't remember that (inaudible)—Gloria who?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Steinem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know I have but I (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's a big woman in the Women's Lib.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, I've heard the name.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I read a statement of hers where she said, "If men's standards were the only standards, and they were not natural for me, then I wouldn't be (inaudible)." And I know so what does that mean? I mean I think what's she's saying is that if what men think was the only standard and she didn't conform to that, then she would be able to accept, she wouldn't be anybody. Maybe it sounds like (inaudible). But I find I've really come to the conclusion (inaudible at 0:05:02.1) for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) have your own thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think (inaudible) (noise).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's as if you're finally (inaudible) that way (inaudible) (noise).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) (noise).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) does it really make sense (inaudible) believe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it makes sense. Well I was talking to my mother about it and I said, "Well why isn't it obvious to everybody?" And, you know, we sort of decided together that maybe since I've been more ignored than other women (inaudible 0:05:44.1) have gone through a more—maybe you have to suffer more to, you know, to realize it. Maybe as long as you've got one boyfriend after another you never, you're never alone enough. If you've never come to the conclusion like have, that you probably have to get alone without the approval of any man. (inaudible).</p>

<p>Did I tell you what I think about another objection to the word respect, well as far as approval? Maybe since I've come to the conclusion that, that, you know, it could be this way the rest of my life, I may never find anyone who was attracted to me, then maybe I really find such a strong attitude or a position necessary where maybe somebody else feels that it's a matter of time they'll get a boyfriend next week, maybe they don't feel strongly about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're probably saying, your background and kind of hardship or aloneness and dealing with that might continue is because the struggle with some of these issues, how important is a man that maybe other people don't struggle with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I think so. And I think that attitude would make me more open. The thing is I can't stop hoping, but it does kind of (inaudible). You know, I still feel as attractive, I still wish, you know, for that, but I'm more apathetic about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well is there—are you saying you wish for it (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I would like, sure I would like to have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To wish for it but feel like sometimes it's provided that you get along (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But still wish for it. 0:07:53.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not wish or hope (inaudible)—what I mean by wish, not in an anxious, not—without anxiety.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know what since I've met you I have a friend that met somebody else, you know, he called her the second night after they met. Well, you know, she called him the first night. He calls her up at midnight, you know, would you come over my place, and she doesn't even know him hardly. And she said, "No, but you can come over here." And then he came over and then he, you know, and then the next he stayed in her apartment and she went to work. And then she never did hear from him and she's disappointed, you know, "He doesn't ask me out." And it's sort of, sort of incredible to me to see someone going through this. It seems so obvious that she shouldn't have been so available so soon after their acquaintance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible). I can't really, I can't deal with—I just can't relate to that anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't understand why they don't understand certain things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The fact she would do—well she's sorry about it but, I just can't—no I, no I don't understand her being so available. I don't understand (inaudible) such a, you know, fool. Not fool but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It (inaudible) very foreign to you right now. (inaudible at 0:09:54.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, of being that, being that vulnerable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you could be that available.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though last year it seems as though I was, but I have since that—but even though, even though I was that way last year I came to you about it, I didn't continue in that way. (inaudible). You know, I did turn that person down (inaudible at 0:10:28.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying that shows that I'm (inaudible) (noise).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But do it, it doesn't seem (inaudible) why I feel the same way. Why Sherry stay home or he might call. In fact, no, if they call it's the last minute unless it's a prearranged thing and they (inaudible) job, you know, if it's a doctor or something, you know, just to be available when they call at the last minute (inaudible at 0:11:18.8). I know I'm talking about trivial (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't feel that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just feel—maybe I am feeling self-righteous because seem like I've changed so much that I feel all the girls are (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like looking at (inaudible). 0:11:45.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Looking at (inaudible). Right. I had a friend, you know, she's (inaudible) living with guy (inaudible). And when she first met him, he wasn't paying too much attention to her, and she actually blamed herself, "I need anything make him fall in love with," as if he were—as if he were God and her judge and the fact that he didn't fall in love with her was, you know, (inaudible) (noise) with, had something to do with her (inaudible). 0:12:17.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). Well it's kind of like you're feeling (inaudible) all those people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I felt this way. No (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More what, more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I just think my experiences are different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The more experience to a certain respect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In that respect, more experience in being ignored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, therefore, better able to cope with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More (inaudible). Why do you think—well the only reason I might doubt what I think is that—do you think that there, that maybe women shouldn't feel like me, are they right? I mean, is there something—am I being... 0:14:17.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To feel in what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...is my attitude too rigid?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which attitude?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the attitude of not being a doormat, being wrong, being more independent? I don't mean not being cold and not being friendly, not being over that, I don't mean at all. But just feeling at least as good as it feels. 0:14:45.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it is if you keep doubting about yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't doubt it. Well certainly it makes sense to be without somebody when you're being mistreated. Like some women feel, you know, any man is better than none and I think—I can't cope with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way I feel about that, what you said is like, do I feel that it makes sense to feel that you are (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think maybe (inaudible) people's situations, maybe some people, maybe they would rather be with somebody who mistreats them (inaudible) I think there are some (inaudible)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what's important to those people. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They might be (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They might feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe they are getting something, maybe she is getting something (inaudible) she didn't get, that she would miss (inaudible). What I'm saying is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought, excuse me, all right, yeah. Yeah I thought of it, and there must be something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm saying is, just because what she doesn't choose to do, is to be without a man, it doesn't mean the guy has the right (inaudible). But everybody sort of (inaudible) with more different choices.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I don't feel rigid about it. I think sometimes they requested of a man (inaudible). And I think probably the way you should handle it is probably—like you said, you gave me a clue about—and I never, I didn't—I think I'm beginning to understand it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...which I didn't understand it at first. You kept saying going back to ones feelings. And I think you're probably right, even though you might work out things logically, I think you should guide, be guided by your feelings (inaudible at 0:18:10.3). You might say, "Well the guy doesn't do this, he does that." Well maybe it depends on how you feel about him, about how much you take. If he only visit you and doesn't ask you out, and he does seem to like you as a person, well some man you might care and some others you may not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It all depends on what both people want from the relationship. Well this is what I told my friend that I thought that it depends on whether they both want the same thing from a relationship. If it's important to you that he only comes over or calls you once in a while, and doesn't want to take you out and doesn't talk to you, treat you like you're a person, then she's more miserable than happy with it so maybe she shouldn't see him, or maybe it was somebody else. Like, for example, there are some men that I know that I can accept a purely plutonic relationship with. And with somebody else, I feel insulted or well, you know, I'm not going to go out with someone who doesn't care for me. And yet, and I know that if was somebody else, I wouldn't even think that way. I would feel used or I wouldn't feel or that they're just taking me out but they don't care for me or anything like that. All of this comes from feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It depends on how you feel about that person. 0:19:43.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: How you feel, that's right. And so with some people I can't accept plutonic friendships. But maybe my not deciding not to see that person is right, where with someone else, to go along friendship, is right. In that situation where maybe to go along to tell myself, "Well it's okay to be friends with this person because I shouldn't expect anything else." But then if you don't really feel that way, then maybe it's best, you know, for your own feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rather than, what would you—you're (inaudible), rather than what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I (inaudible)—I kept telling you a few months ago that I should feel this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you kept that, "But how do you feel?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I used to— you know, I think I'm beginning to learn how to deal with this because at first...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I used to tell you, "But I don't know how I feel."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you mean you didn't, is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or either I denied my own feelings or I was putting value judgments on the way I feel, so I kept denying them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kept denying the ones you didn't want to have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like, for example, the one—the guy who I came to you about last year. Well, you know, I can see that that's hopeless, but I also know there is some attraction there. And I don't want to go to a party where he is because he might talk to somebody else and I'll be jealous. That seems very childish to me, even though I've been to parties where he was and it wasn't a tragedy. But I felt, but I still feel that way and it's taking a while. So maybe I shouldn't tell myself, "Okay, go to the party and deny that you feel this way." Maybe I'll just chicken out and won't do it. Well I mean I wouldn't do it if it was real important but it's—now how you feel about just giving into feelings? It's one think to recognize them, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there I feel is that it's kind of a choice. But I think it's important to (inaudible) to recognize those feelings. And then you kind of give him a choice like, for example, take that situation that you're talking about at the party. Well you can either choose to give—to let your feelings rule what you do, in other words, not go to the party. In that sense you would be happier because you wouldn't see him talking to other women... (Laughter).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and you might be sad or... well I don't feel it's ridiculous (inaudible). But you'd miss the party, you know, you might miss that other part.</p>

<p>Or if you choose to go but still, even if you go, you don't have to deny your feelings. You have to say, "Yes I (inaudible) jealous, but I'm going anyway. I think that's the choice. But the important thing is to, in a way, not to deny your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe I was decide on how much I want to go to the party. One party that was given by a close friend and I thought it was more important to go to a friend's party than to miss it. And besides this other person (inaudible) I had a date too, so that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this other (inaudible) I figure I don't want to go because, you know, the principal was going to be there, and I wouldn't go anyway with her. But, I mean, nobody is going. And well he may not be there. I'm just, you know, telling you about (inaudible) these parties that have come up and different situations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe with some I think it's worth going, than others, I sort of wouldn't go anyway. 0:24:09.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, which I'm not a party person. I don't go to too many, so that's sort of explains it too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I think the other considerations too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know I have, I sort of have other problems that I don't bring up too much with you because they aren't too important. They aren't, you know, aren't depressing. Sometimes that troubles girlfriends in a sense that I'm not always sure if they like my company, but those are (inaudible) things, they're not ruining my life the way...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They aren't base, basically upsetting problems and psyche things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they are... but you think they aren't as difficult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well sometimes I'm thinking (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) and feel that maybe people don't like (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just the feeling that people don't (inaudible) or worrying about what they think. I've never felt that it's important enough to talk about it in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah just when you're talking about it I can here it, you know, you kind of (overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to discuss it in analysis. It's always been the problems throughout the sessions, really got me down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How could these important—deeply imbedded in my psyche— I don't know what the language (laughter) my psyche or whatever it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is deeply imbedded in your psyche? (Laugher)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I made that up, I just made that up. 0:26:00.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But is that because you want to spend your time talking about more basic issues or you think it's not appropriate or what (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I haven't (inaudible)—they're only daily things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Surface things (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh they're very surface things like Lucy seems to be angry today. I must bore, a boring person. Well the next day I won't feel that way. It's a basic (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it comes and goes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I think everybody (inaudible). Everybody I know talk about their other girlfriend to me and (inaudible), so I'm sure I'm criticized by my friends (inaudible). 0:26:53.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that makes you uncomfortable?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes, yes it does, but not that much. Because even, you know, even if I'm talking to my mother when she, you know, when she closes the conversation and she says, "Oh I thought you had to do something," and I feel, oh now I've talked to her too long and I've been boring. And I fell, I feel inferior for a while. So why do I bend people's ear with this, all of my talking and boredom? Why don't I bow out or say good-bye before I bore people to death? I don't know if that's a basic, I think that's a basic part of my personality being sensitive. 0:27:45.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you get kind of worried a little bit about what people think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Think of me, yeah. Yeah I think that has been a problem with me for, for a long time, because every since I can remember, what people think of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going way back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder if that's what makes my problem, this wondering what men of me, would that be connected I wonder? Certainly my reaction to my own popularity with men must be part of my basic personality. The fact that I'm sensitive anyway, the fact that I, that I care what people think. You know I think that, you know, like you have problems, well like if you have a physical defect that's the same thing. I think that some people are more sensitive about the defects in other people probably because of the, because of the way they feel about themselves or how strong they are (inaudible at 0:29:01.8). Like if you're already weak and you already have a background of feeling inferior, then if some monumental problem comes along, it's going to affect you differently. So I sure there's a way, the way my problems with men have affected me have something to do with basic character, my basic personality.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has something to do with how you feel about people in terms (inaudible at 0:29:36.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Even though I read that people are pretty vulnerable in that area of, of opposite sexual attraction (inaudible at 0:29:52.2) and this, this is what bothers people the most.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you saying what does that mean about what you were just saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I wondering if I feel, why I've had such little self respect, well self-esteem because I haven't attracted to men or because, or because I haven't, or because my reactions to not being attracted to men are so severe because of my feelings of inferior. 0:30:35.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then, then there's the physical thing, you know, I'm sure that has something to do with the way I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel more inferior too, don't you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it still does, I don't know, certainly it's not as bad as it used to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of all these floods came running together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think—but then, you know, I was thinking last week that with the way my mother reacted to me; I think my mother made me feel worthless when I was growing up, she criticized me a lot. I couldn't do anything right. And then developing the physical thing and then perhaps as a result of that, not attracting men, which is important to a young girl growing up, then having a physical—I think, well, maybe—I feel well that's anyone of those things preferably could almost destroy a person, and maybe I've done pretty well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you had all three of those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible). But then I guess there have been compensations too, having an opportunity to go to school and getting nice grades, being praised by people. So maybe I have some things to feel good about (inaudible at 0:32:02.0). So may that's helped. Maybe that sort of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is what you're telling me (inaudible) why is that (inaudible), how well did I do given all I've had to contend with, both good and bad? 0:32:02.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then there, you know—you know my friend, tonight, was telling me about a family where all of the kids have muscular, muscular dystrophy, yeah just, just a horrible thing, you know. And I know some people who have horrible lives. But then I also meet people who have more problems that's, you know, that's physically beautiful, they have talent, and they feel worst about themselves than I do about myself, I'm running into this.</p>

<p>One example was a girl who was vulnerable, you know, to men and, and you know I talk to them enough to know that they're not feeling, they don't feel good about themselves. And when they get boyfriends, they're no better off than me because they're so scared and so insecure about keeping them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, (inaudible) your question is the thing that even, even they feel insecure and they don't have the relationship problems that you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe feeling inferior has nothing to do with having (inaudible at 0:33:54.5) or maybe it's more, you know, something that's deeply embedded (inaudible at 0:34:01.8). Maybe it has nothing to do with men, because then I know handicapped people who feel very good about themselves (inaudible at 0:34:14.7) who's fat or they might be fat or sorts of things. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) fat—oh that's an example about (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They might have all sorts of problems and yet they don't seem to be less secure than people (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds as if, (inaudible) that's my question, how insecure does a handicap make someone? (inaudible at 0:34:47.7) individual person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It depends on, it depends on how secure you were as you're grow up, emotional security. (Overlapping).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it depends on what kind things you have in your handicap (inaudible) and how important to you those (inaudible) things are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Okay with me I tell myself that the only thing that it interferes with is attracting men. So and I tell myself that's very important, at least I've always thought it was very important. And I only see my defect in relationship to attracting men; I don't see it in any other area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I guess you're saying that because of that one pretty crucial area (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes attracting men becomes less important when (inaudible) the defect (inaudible). 0:36:08.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible). That was pretty important (inaudible). Well that's an example of having a handicap that prevents you from, because I think (inaudible) he would rather, you know, not (inaudible) he said he'd rather be (inaudible) (noise). So like you said it does depend on what the handicap is, you know, it's a barrier, what it prevents you from doing (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it also depends, I think, on how the treatment that you got when you were young happened (inaudible) people that are important to you (inaudible). And your family, how your friends react (inaudible). 0:37:27.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't have any trouble with my family. You know it's only been with the man thing. And yet I know what the particular thing that I have, have not prevented every woman with it, from attracting with somebody (inaudible).</p>

<p>My stepfather has a friend, male friend, who has the same thing and he has a wife. But the reason that didn't affect me, or didn't have any influence what I thought, is because I figured he's a man and that women care less about how men look than men feel about how women look. But I've been meeting a lot of women lately who care a lot how men look. This is another thing that annoys me that that they blatantly admit that looks are important, so that the guy is good looking. Personally it's not important.</p>

<p>Oh you know what I meant to tell you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Remember I was telling you about this friend who's really hung up on looks and she had—her boyfriend's friend come in and she chose this real cute friend of mine to go out with him because she figured he'd like the cute one.</p>

<p>My friend, the same one, we talked about that once. Well we didn't talk about the fact that she chose her, we just brought up the fact that, that she really have a thing about how, about looks. And she said, my friend said, "Yeah but you know that she called me and told me that this guy was a little on the heavy side and would I go out with him." This was the girl that's so cute now. She said, "You know you were right about her because," And she said I expected him to be fat, and she said he was, he was just stocky, which is actually what I kind of like, you know, rather than skinny. You know I don't care about looks but that would be, but I find stocky men attractive. And she said he was just stocky that's all. And she asked me, "He's a little heavy, would you go out with him anyway." So that (inaudible). I though you'd enjoy that. 0:40:02.3</p>

<p>Well, of course, people that are like—so there are girls who—so maybe he had—so maybe this friend of stepfather did have a hard time because apparently women love this particular, or there are, there are a lot of women who care about how men look.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you ever talk (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't know him well enough to (inaudible). I've only seen him two or three times (inaudible). 0:40:28.3</p>

<p>My stepfather told me once that he asked him about his wife and did he have trouble with (inaudible) because of his deformity. And I said, "Well what did he say?" And can you follow me when I'm saying to you (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Not even if I mentioned his name, you wouldn't know the difference. He said, "Well, I won't tell you what he said." And I was so mad, you know, you can tell me about getting information. That's an example how hard it is to get information. I said, "What did he say, did he have trouble?" (inaudible at 0:41:20.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you should have said, "Why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was so young then, like 15. Whatever anybody told me (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And somehow it makes almost sound like did have trouble doesn't it or he would have told you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess he didn't want to hurt me. But this man is married. 0:41:40.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I see what you're saying (inaudible). It seems unfair (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't have—looks are not important to me and it's not because I feel that well I've got physical problems so—it's really not important and I'm glad because it gives me a much wider choice of people to choose from.</p>

<p>So that's all I've been thinking about. I still feel (inaudible) never be anybody. (inaudible). I might actually be afraid of the thought (inaudible) because I know there are a lot problems that I never had to deal with that would come up. 0:43:44.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know I've been doing something lately. I've been sort of putting myself in the places of women that have husbands and boyfriends; and I can see they probably get a lot pleasure, but I don't. I can see (inaudible).</p>

<p>But I can also imagine—but maybe I'm looking at it from the point of view of feeling insecure that (inaudible) they never know from day to day if the guy they're with or married to is going to become attracted to someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or they might leave them at any time...</p>

<p>PATIENT: They might leave them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that (inaudible at 0:44:24.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It might worry them and it might not, I don't know, it depends on how secure they feel. I've talked to friends who are not getting (inaudible). All of their interest is sort of—and I wouldn't want to give up everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to give them up for a marriage (inaudible at 0:44:52.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course maybe you're so happy with him too, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter) To me (inaudible) I think (inaudible) somehow I feel that it would be helpful (inaudible) to talk to some (inaudible) with other people who has had (inaudible). 0:45:19.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should have called that doctor. You know I never felt (inaudible). Maybe I shouldn't have felt that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes you (inaudible). 0:45:30.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then after I had waited so long I was actually ashamed (inaudible). I think I waited too long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh you can still do it. You can still do it. I'm sure (inaudible). In fact you can always do it if you felt comfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think—I will tell you, it's hard (inaudible) to expect (inaudible) cause you're different. But I think it's been helpful to me (inaudible), going through so much to show that, that's why people do it. I think (inaudible) in graduate school, college years (inaudible at 0:46:13.1). And I don't know (inaudible). She called me up about a month ago (inaudible) because she just wanted to talk to somebody else whose in the same position and she felt really discouraged and she wanted to say, can it be done, you know, sort of, can you really get through, you know, and how do you do this and how do you do that and little stuff like that (inaudible). I hope (inaudible) that can really understand (inaudible at 0:46:53.8). But that may or may have not the right man but (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just that—I have a friend who is 40 years old, she's in her 40s, a woman friend and she's a friend; how looks were important to her. She thought—well she liked a man who's smart, she also like looks, especially the Italian type (inaudible) and all of this. Of course she's been talking differently since I (inaudible) I can't believe that I had an (inaudible) but, you know, I used to be very gullible (inaudible) but now I argue with her so now she, you know, (inaudible). She was saying so I asked her I says, "Would you marry someone with a handicap?" And she said, so she said, she said it would depend on what the handicap was.</p>

<p>Now, that goes back to something I noticed that, but what you have affect men differently from (inaudible). So the, so since people—there is a possibility that people react to different handicaps. Some handicaps are more, present more barriers to finding somebody of the opposite sex than others. But I thought, perhaps, someone with the same thing would have the same problem. 0:48:47.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). That's why, that's why I encourage you talk to—on the other hand, they would have some difficulty, because I think it's also true that different people would react to different handicaps in different ways. But that woman (inaudible at 0:49:03.9) might marry somebody who was deaf but not somebody who is crippled. Or there might be someone else who would marry someone who is crippled but not somebody who is deaf.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, you see the thing is—what she saying, why I want to marry somebody with a handicap, you know, giving a whole lot there. They have a disability and (inaudible at 0:49:35.4) so that is a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Now the thing is with me there is no sacrifice in that sense, I live a normal life. With me, it would be a visual thing; it's only a visual. So what—some people are turned off by the visual (inaudible at 0:49:54.4). Other people are more influenced by—this is a—sacrificing themselves in having to go, the person presents more problems to them and they're more tied down. So she was saying, yeah, you know a man doesn't want to marry a woman with a handicap. Sometimes he might feel he wants a good cook, he wants a housekeeper. She was going through all of these things why a man would want to marry a handicapped person, because see this isn't a problem with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then on the other hand some men want a good figure, and so it depends. So it depends on, you know, what bothers them the most. So suppose I was—that was behind my wanting to talk to somebody with the same problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Yes. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What people— you know, would it be easier if (inaudible at 0:50:59.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me a question?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm not asking. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible). I know a girl who was a librarian and she's a terrible (inaudible) and she's married. But then I said well that's not visual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then she would have a problem with reading (ph) (inaudible at 0:51:31.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: She started to get bored or something like loose patience.</p>

<p>My mother's theory is that they're more affected by the visual than anything, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does she mean, everyone's more affected by the visual?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She thinks in percentage wise more people are affected by the visual...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The visual than by what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then by the actual handicap, handicapping, the degree of handicap, degree of disability.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:52:10.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure that's true. I think (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah (inaudible). I think, but the thing is it's sort of (inaudible) how you feel your handicap but you think how they feel about (inaudible) (noise). 0:52:27.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see I've had all of that in the back of mind but I kept say, "Well if nobody has been attracted to me that means I didn't have personality or anything to make up for it because someone would see it." Well this is what I've been telling myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (inaudible). But first (inaudible) no one has ever been attracted (inaudible) quite true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they didn't show (ph) me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that many. But I must not have any—I been figuring, I must not have anything else to make up for it. But then I thought—but if my personality was so that no man could like me, if it wasn't enough, than I wouldn't have friends either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what it does is make you feel bad about (inaudible at 0:53:48.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I figure that, well, there should be some people around who would overlook that if I had enough other things going for me (inaudible at 0:54:04.0). So I figured, well, I must not have anything going for me because no one has been able to overlook it. Maybe that's (inaudible at 0:54:14.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's how (inaudible) you really have no (inaudible). 0:54:28.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I don't know how to deal with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I (inaudible) that if you see people on the street (inaudible 0:55:29.7), that's the kind of people you want to talk to, (inaudible). I've had people come up to me (inaudible) my brother is blind (inaudible) I really need to find out something about (inaudible at 0:55:49.1). I'd like to know (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sometimes people do things like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll try. I don't know. (inaudible at 0:56:47.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you need to try that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If it's possible, I would like to. (inaudible at 0:57:17.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you do after the research?</p>

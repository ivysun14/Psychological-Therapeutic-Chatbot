<p>PATIENT:  Once I knew I was going to be late I became very nervous about it.  And I was trying to, well, I was thinking about why I was feeling quite so nervous.  And aside from my usual feeling about being late, it, I think it was mainly because of what I'd said yesterday and the angry feeling I'd had when you kept me waiting, if my watch was correct, for just a few minutes, whereas I kept you waiting for quite a long time.  And so then my inclination was that I'd have to apologize.  And I felt very strongly that that was the only way I could solve this problem of the way I felt.  And then after that I, I don't know, I began to have the reaction that I, I will often do if I'm late with somebody that I know, which is to sort of laugh about it and sort of laugh at myself.  Almost as if you could laugh at me now because look what I'd done after how I'd reacted yesterday. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think last night I was unconsciously thinking more about how I can have such a strong feeling about being late or being kept waiting and yet so often I am late.  And it just suddenly struck me that — probably very obvious and it made me feel sort of foolish but also very guilty — that it's just a very selfish attitude on my part that if anybody's going to be kept waiting, I think it should be the other person and not me.  But then I'll convince myself I'm doing everything possible not to be late and I just had, things I did took too long or I had too much to do, when probably I could have cut short what I was doing. (Pause)</p>

<p>And sometimes when I'm early, I think of being early in terms of compensating, even though I don't come in here early.  But somehow it makes up for the times that I'm late, in my mind.  (Pause) And I was just thinking about cutting short things I'm doing if I wanted to ensure that I wouldn't be late and thinking about my teaching last year as opposed to this year and how it's better this year because I realize there is just certain things you can't be late for with the children.  Or there are certain things that are important to them and you shouldn't cut into that time with something else, that I used to do last year.  And then it made me realize how the reason I cut into it and, in a way, was being late with them, was I couldn't select what was important to do and even of the activities I was doing previous to the time that we'd be late.  It just seemed like everything had to be done.  And that's often what makes me late to lots of places, that I've set up certain things I have to do and I just am rigid about it, I just have to have them done.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was it today?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, it was the hairdresser today, which always makes me feel like, well, I can't blame myself.  But in a way I do.  In fact, I didn't want to say what it was today because then I felt as if I'd be excusing myself.  (Silence) It was just occurring to me that, well, I was thinking again about feeling last night how selfish I was to sort of almost know I was going to be late but keep on doing the things that were important to me so I could get them done.  And then all I, I keep having these images of, or the recurring feeling that I have when I am going to be late, knowing I am, of being very tense and nervous and driving myself terrifically.  I don't, I don't know.  Whatever was occurring to me isn't very clear but something to do with, almost as if, if I've really driven myself to do all these things that I'm so compulsive about, then that kind of makes up for being late too.  Just like today at the hairdresser's, after it became obvious that I wasn't going to get out on time, I just was in a, I was just so nervous I really felt like walking out with my hair uncombed.  And almost as if, seems I was compensating for the fact that I was now going to make you as angry as I felt yesterday.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And then I'm not sure what I do with this idea but every once in a while, if I'm significantly late here, I'll start thinking, well, I don't know why it really should matter to you anyway because the hour, or what—, the 50 minutes that you'd be spending with me and so it really doesn't matter to you if I am late.  It's me that it matters to or it should be me.  And I think that's because I want to feel that you won't be angry.  (Pause) But I was just thinking too about times when I know somebody will be angry, like MSCZ.  And at the times when I thought you would be, my thinking today, and I'm recalling other times, has been convincing myself that I couldn't help it so I can convince other people.  And it used to be with MSCZ that I'd become actively offensive and be convinced that there was no reason for him to be angry because I couldn't help it.  And we'd usually end up having some horrible fight.  (Pause) And I think I must have been doing that today a little bit because when I came in, I, and started talking, I don't know, the way I said things I felt as if I were very angry at myself.  But in a way, perhaps I was feeling angry at you because whatever you were feeling I was thinking you were feeling in a way that made me feel uncomfortable.  And that made me angry at you for feeling that way.  But then I didn't dare get angry at you. (Pause)</p>

<p>Because when you asked what had kept me late, all I could hear was the way I'd said whatever I said last and the sort of angry note in my voice.  (Silence) And then at this point I've remembered something I forgot to do at school.  It wasn't something I would have been doing to make me even later but (pause) well, actually it would have been because the whole day kind of backs up on itself.  When I am late leaving school, then it makes me late getting to the hairdresser and it makes it harder for him to finish me in time.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that sort of an indirect way of saying you were late to the hairdresser?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, there was still time but I know he gets busy at the time he has to comb me out.  And so I like to get out early and then I go do something else before I come here.  So in a way, I mean as far as foreseeing what would happen, I do feel responsible.  But then I get around it by asking him, does he think he can and if he says — and I ask him to please say no if he can't and I'll make another appointment.  And so then I sort of get myself out of feeling responsible.  (Pause) But I think basically I do feel very guilty about it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And the thing, too, that bothers me about this is, not only am I feeling so totally guilty and at fault, and I keep trying to talk myself out of feeling that way, I'm also feeling as if, I don't know, almost as if I never am here on time at all.  Or, your anger will be strong enough so that, however much I'm here on time, it won't really matter and that there is no excuse and, well, no forgiveness. (Pause)</p>

<p>And what comes to my mind then is, well, my mother and just thinking of her as being grim, and the experience I've had as a teacher, too, of treating a child who has done something that really is annoying to you or putting you out of patience, the next minute as if, well, that's over and forgotten with and how important it is to do that.  And when I think of how grim the impression of my mother is, I just wonder if I ever had the feeling that she did that.  I just feel as if everything well, I, the thought came to my mind that everything would be held against me.  And I think I've sort of had that feeling in my family.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I'm even doing it now at school to the extent that — in, in the past they've always asked people if they want to come back as a teacher the following year around this time.  And nothing has been said to me yet but I, the girl I teach with, not the, my assistant but the other teacher, mentioned that she had been asked today.  And, ah, I don't know that it signifies anything but my first thought is to think, well, maybe I'm not going to be and what have I done that would be held against me?  And not, I just don't have any confidence that I'm doing anything right particularly.  And so I have to kind of pinpoint all of the things I've done wrong to see if it would add up enough.  (Pause) And also this girl was going to go to the supervisor with a problem about a boy that is the kind of problem I would mull over myself and work out myself.  And she said that even though she's — we talked about it and she came to some conclusions and said even though she was fairly sure of what she'd do, she was going to talk with the supervisor.  And I don't know, I just, I think probably it's a good thing she is but I don't understand it.  Because it just isn't, I just don't have that feeling that that's the kind of thing you take to anybody.  And yet, I will take it to a co-teacher, in that I will use them as a sounding board to talk a about it and listen to their advice too.  So I don't understand except that it's admitting I'm failing or that I've made a fault if I take a problem like that to my supervisor.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I think I've suppressed this quite a bit but yesterday, when I was making up some tests in the room, a boy who was on the roof with my assistant was hurt, and badly enough so it was a question whether he'd have to have stitches in his cut.  And I think underneath everything I'm feeling extremely responsible and guilty about that too and that this would be held against me as a teacher by the parent and perhaps by people at school.  So my immediately, my inclination was to be annoyed at my assistant and sort of attack her.  Luckily she wasn't there so I couldn't.  Because I might, I might have been that mean.  But (pause) and I know, when I'm on the roof I have such a fear of that happening that, ah, I rarely allow any situation to arise that it will.  (Pause) But it's done more for, for my sake than for the sake of the child in that you're helping him keep a calmer situation.  And I tell myself that's what I'm doing but I'm really just doing it for my own sake.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact, in the last day or 2 it just seems like everything I think of makes me in the end realize that I'm very selfish and very self-centered.  (Pause) And I'm, I just thinking about my attitude toward getting along with other people and cooperating and everything, something I've thought more about since I've been teaching, and how it has always seemed to me that people are just nice to other people and will share or whatever because they want that same thing themselves.  And, and then I was just thinking about how you can feel any other way and how to help children feel any other way.  And, I don't know, there seems to be something about really feeling how the other person feels so that — because you have felt it.  But still you care about how that person feels.  And it just made me realize that even there it's basically my attitude why I respond to people the way I do.  Because if I'm nice or sweet or gentle or anything it's because I want to be treated the same way. (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact sometimes, when people have made a comment about what they, their impression is of me sort of in those terms, it's made me very angry because if I'm being honest with myself I know what I really am and it's just a fear of letting people see it that keeps it under.  And that's not very nice.  Or it's the wrong reason for being nice if I am nice.  (Pause) And I suppose that's why I've always felt people are basically selfish, which used to bother me, I know I mentioned it before, so much when I was in high school.  And at some point we studied Albert Schweitzer and everybody was talking about how wonderful he was and all.  And it just seemed to me that what he did was good but, still, he was doing what he wanted to do.  Because that's all anybody ever did, just what they wanted to do.  But I, it still seems most people do.  And when I'm thinking about other things that are, seem like self-sacrificing things that friends of my parents have done or friends of mine and in the end it, it's all because they really want to do it.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you doing?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been a rough two weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really, what's happening?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Listen, I've been in bed for twelve days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the pain or something else?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exhausted.  My back has been throbbing so bad and yesterday was the first day it didn't hurt as bad.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B>  Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I mean this medicine they finally gave me so</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What'd they give you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Opana, it's O P A N A.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> ER.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know what kind of medicine it is?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Opiate based.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Is it helping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The pain subsided substantially, it's probably down to maybe 3 and that's only when I get up usually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the problem is that I'm so tired I can't do anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All I do is lay down.  I get up and do something then all the sudden I'm just beat and then my heart rate and blood pressure has been going up and down all over the place.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now is that better since we stopped the Prozac or is it still fluctuating?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No sweating.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The shaking is almost gone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So the sweating and the shaking have gotten much better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The sweating completely, that stopped after about two days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That's good to hear and the shaking is almost gone.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It comes and goes but that can be from my thyroid at this point or from the Opana.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it better or is it staying the same, the shaking?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not as bad as it was, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay but the heart rate and blood pressure as still fluctuating?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, two nights ago, I don't know if you ever been where you almost fall asleep and jump up, I guess I'm doing that.  I'm like what the hell, so I got up and took my heart rate of 138.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's laying in bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I took my blood pressure medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And a half hour later I was relaxed enough to go to sleep, so I don't know what the hell was going on there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And remind me, you said, I think that you were going to go back to [INAUDIBLE] but you were going to go up to the [DEIDENTIFIED], do you know how soon you can get in to see someone?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is taking care of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, good because the problem with endocrinologists, you know, they're so hard to get in to see but, you know, with the Grave's disease, I hope you get into see someone soon.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was no help, her attitude, as I told you, and I'm not happy with an attitude like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I understand.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm getting real dry mouth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, probably from the medication, yeah, okay.  So your pain level is under better control but you're just wiped out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's the best my back has been.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good news.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been that way for yesterday and today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'm laying down all the time.  I'm not getting my housework done at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which is driving me nuts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that because you're, is it sleepiness or is it fatigue.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fatigue.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Big time.  It's like I lay down but I can't sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, okay, are you sleeping okay at night?  Tossing and turning?  Okay.  How much sleep do you think you're getting at night, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now when you say, I just need you to specify, do you mean all at once or do you mean totally?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you add up the pieces of sleep you're getting, how much do you think, total do you think you get?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is horrible.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been rocking, like I did before, I've been rocking and rolling all night, I mean it just.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How's your appetite been, not very good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you know if you're maintaining your weight or if you're dropping?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It kind of fluctuates from 225 to 227, so I mean it's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In the same range.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not going to say there's been a huge fluctuation.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A huge fluctuation for me, I'm going to have to say, would be 5, 8, 10 pounds to me to make a difference, two or three pounds to me is nothing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How's your focus and concentration?  Not good? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I did actually, for the last two nights, have played my call of duty, which you know I love playing, I actually went and played it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that's good and were you able to play for like an hour or two or several hours.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> An hour but the problem is I started sweating.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't usually do that.  You've never heard me, you know me, I love playing my game but I'll get up and I'll have a little perspiration on my forehead and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't know if it's the game or if it's the thyroid or what the heck it is</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't answer that but I'm just giving you all the little things that have been happening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Have you been having anxiety?  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] and I think that could be because my blood pressure going down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I could be, you'd know better than me.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's hard to know because there's so many things that could be triggering that, now the Grave's could again, could be causing the anxiety, the pain.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had my thyroid tested three weeks ago.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, how was it, do you remember?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> 0.31</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your TSH was?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's still, TSH is still low.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which means I'm hyper still.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And did they make any recommendations about what to do?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They dropped me down to 100 mcg.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You're taking Synthroid?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No Levoxyl.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Levoxyl, okay.  That was three weeks ago, have you noticed any difference in the way you feel since you reduced the dose or is it hard to tell?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's hard to tell and the reason I have to say that is because now I'm getting so bad, it's making me so damn tired, I've got such a, I've got so bad knots in my back that it came across my chest, I couldn't breathe real good, I started, you know me, I worry about everything.  I went and saw a massage therapist.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she worked on it and they disappeared.  My back is killing me now from her -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Digging with her elbow but there's no pains in the chest now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  And which doctor prescribed the Opana?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it Opana or Obana?  I'll look it up and see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> ER, extended release.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and I'm sorry, which doctor did you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm a little concerned, you know, I called him up, I could barely walk on Saturday, I could barely get out of bed and then I couldn't, once I got up, I'd walk around, I'd go to lay down, I could barely lay down again and I called him up and said I've never had my back hurt this bad, there's nothing I can do, you can to the hospital.  Pay a couple thousand dollars to get two hours of relief, he goes no, you'll get six.  Okay, never mind, that's all he could do for me and then Monday came and my back started feeling a lot better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And on Tuesday it really felt good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, so</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But [INAUDIBLE] again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well I'm wondering if, with time, if that fatigue will get better if you adjust the medicine or not, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Me neither.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you have an appointment to go back and see him in the next few weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have to call him tomorrow.  This medicine you cannot just stop.  It's not an as needed medicine, it's says right on it, this is not an as needed medicine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you have to take it every day and be very careful with it, okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm taking 40 in the morning and 40 in the evening.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how about your mood, how's it been through all this?  Have you felt down or doing, you know, in the middle or irritable or sad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'd say about the same.  I mean it's not big swing either way.  I'm not hollering at anybody and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you're not feeling in the pits of depression but you're not jumping for joy either, somewhere in the middle.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Are you getting some enjoyment out of daily activities or do you feel like you're just kind of going through the motions?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I'm going through the motions, I know that for a fact.  Like I said, it's a strange me, I take her to work in the morning and then the kids and this and that, it's a struggle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For me to get up and do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I do it but it's just a hell of a struggle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Are you doing anything during the day like for fun for yourself, any hobbies, interests?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't do anything.  I've been, you can ask [NAME OTHER], I've been in my bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just stay in bed all, most of the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I get up and get showered but then I'm just laying in bed.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I make [INAUDIBLE] in the morning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't watch TV or do you</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I turn it on but I don't even watch it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just for background noise?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And do you doze off during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But nothing major, it's just -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just kind of drift off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know if somebody comes in, I'll hear them walking, I'll wake up, so it's not a deep sleep at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what the hell, I don't know if it's this Opana.  You can tell, can you tell how dry I am right now?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Okay.  Let's see, what else?  And medication wise, besides what you've already told me about, any problems with the Xanax or the Clonazepam?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I've been taking the Xanax but that has been on an as need basis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And about how often do you need it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been about every other day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It depends, maybe one, maybe three during the day, not at a time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I've been taking the Toprol more.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know which I should be taking.  I called the doctor and he never called me back.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, the Toprol will be better probably for the physical symptoms, like shakiness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, it's better for those.  The Xanax is probably a little better for the like worrying, the kind of mental symptoms of anxiety.  It'll help some of the physical symptoms too but Toprol will probably be a little bit more effective for the physical symptoms.  It's what's called a beta blocker, it blocks adrenaline.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been taking that for two years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On and off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And so tell me, I'm sorry, tell me once more [PATIENT NAME], how often do you think you use the Xanax?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About every other day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I use the 0.5's, is that right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, they're 0.5 and it's effective when you take it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how often are you taking the Klonopin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't been taking that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Haven't needed it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not since the Opana, I've been very cautious.  I was very, I even went to the doctor, my other doctor to confirm that I should be taking it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know me and this medicine, you know who I am, that's very clear, I'm not real happy about taking this, yeah, I'm getting, I can feel the results are good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For my back pain but what good is that, now I'm on the other side of the coin.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right and you're wise to err on the side of caution because some of these medicines, you take too much and they can have other harmful effects, so I'm glad you're being cautious with them but you always have been.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I actually thought I was going to go to the hospital.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I was feeling that bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you can use the Klonopin at night for sleep, as long as you just don't, as long as you don't take too much because the two could have an additive sedating effect.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which two?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Klonopin and the pain medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because they both have some sedation effect.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so at night that's not a bad thing as long as you're sleeping okay, as long as you don't take too much, you know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I never do, people who know me, I probably don't do enough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, exactly, you're probably on the side of under utilization.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And this is way, now I'm, I told you, I 'm going to do what the doctors say to a T at this point.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it's doing exactly what I thought it was going to do, great, the pain is getting a hundred times better but you're not functioning.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that's one of the problems with these pain medicines is they take away the pain but they also then sometimes take away your quality of life because you're so wiped out you can't do anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What pissed me off, you can ask her, I mean the dishes aren't getting done, the vacuuming, the laundry has been sitting all folded up in the front room that I folded, I just didn't have the energy to put it away and that's just not me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  I just was thinking, you said you went and got that massage, do you get regular massages?  I wonder if that would help.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've already thought about doing that.  I was going to call the insurance company and see, they may not do it but I'm wondering if a doctor, because of my, my upper back started because my lower back was hurting so bad that I was picking myself up off everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Do you have a good massage therapist?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh this lady did a heck, she did a deep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Who is it, what's her name?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's down at, on top of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's a massage place there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She did a hell of a job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm telling you right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what you need, somebody that's going to get in there and really work on those muscles.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had four knots, huge knots and one side -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And a big one on the left, that's still</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I have thought of that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's only thirty nine bucks a visit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it may be a lot safer than taking some of the medicines.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was for my upper back that she did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, how long did she work on your back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> An hour.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that's a good deal, yeah, it might be worth it just to get the knots out and then still have, you know, the alertness and wakefulness so you can function.  And what I understand with massage is that sometimes if the doctors recommend it, some insurances do cover it now, they didn't used to but now they're realizing that it's -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cheaper that then -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's less expensive -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A hospital visit, it's so knotted up that you feel like you're going to have a heart attack.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, it's cheaper than one ER visit, you can get a lot of massages and be a lot healthier than one ER visit, so, okay, what else, that's plenty, is there anything else going on, any other stresses right now, any other problems?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm just, I'm very stressed out.  My biggest stress is I'm just not able to do everything during the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At least with the pain I can go do something for an hour and then go lay down.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then get back up and do it but now I'm just washed out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it bums me out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, yeah, it probably sounds like the best thing to do is maybe give [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] a call and see if you can get back in to see him soon, just to see what other -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have thing that says call him, don't do anything until and tomorrow's the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  Yeah, see what he suggests.  I don't know if they can adjust the dose to help control the pain but not make you so tired or if there's something else -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It did it from day one -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I started taking it, I'm just telling you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been on the same dose all along?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, he just upped it the day before yesterday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And see, my back started feeling better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I've been tired since then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Before that I should say.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Well, the other thing to think about today is do we start a different antidepressant but I don't have the sense you really need one right now so much, do you?  I mean as long as the pain is under control, the depression seems to be manageable.  I'd just as soon -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm afraid the depression is going to put me, I mean an antidepressant is going to put me even further in the hole sleeping, I'd rather it just as it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I'd prefer not to put you on another medicine if we can.  Now if you start sinking down into the hole, let me know, because I don't want you to get depressed and be hurting and tired because that's not a good combination.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, my biggest concern right now is that I'm just, it's tiredness.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well how about this then, how about if we don't start another antidepressant, let's just work with the Xanax and the Klonopin, the Clonazepam, let you get back and see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], see what he can do with the pain medicine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think he's kind of at his wits end with me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I called Saturday, he was pissed, I could tell.  Maybe I read him wrong but I just could tell he was not a happy camper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME], you know what happens with doctors is sometimes they reach the end of their expertise, they've tried everything they know how to try and different doctors handle that differently.  Some doctors say, you know, I've tried everything I know how to do, let's get you in to see someone else that maybe knows some things I don't and they don't take it personally, they don't get embarrassed, other doctors get mad because they can't help, you know, they feel like they ought to be able to fix things.  Every doctor is different but if you do get to the point where he has nothing else to offer then maybe it is time to get a second opinion from someone else because, you know, different doctors know different things.  There may be someone else out there who knows something different that would work so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, Saturday the boys, my wife took the boys up to the water park.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't go.  I got the dry heaves.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I just, I stayed in bed all day.  They left and came home, I was still in bed.  I mean I get up, get on my clothes and take a shower but then I'm just laying on the bed the rest of the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that the most comfortable position or you're too tired?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Too tired, I have no energy, none.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is what I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], good doctor, he's the only one that wants to listen but, of course, I have to pay him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh man.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Did you get your stuff, my stuff from [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What stuff from [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For my disability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I haven't received anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Really?  Everybody else did.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was disability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Was it like a statement or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I haven't gotten anything.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's weird.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know the problem that happens sometimes is they'll send it to the street address here but they don't deliver to the street address here, it has to go to a p.o. box and so sometimes it gets returned and so if they did send something to me and they put just the street address on it, it may have gotten returned so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I gave them the address off of your card.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Card?  Okay, yeah, if it's the mailing address, so that'd be the p.o. box then so if they call you and say it came back, just tell them to call me and I'll give them the mailing address so -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The stuff I tell you, you don't have to release to anybody or do you?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sorry?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anything I tell you, you have to release or not release?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Only with your permission.  I mean if -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, there's something that you want me to disclose than I can, if you say no, then I don't have to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, like I said, my main thing is to get back paid through disability and then take my class and if I can do my real estate and okay with that, then I can drop my disability at that point.  That's my goal right now, I'm just telling you, I do I have things set for me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds reasonable, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's between us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, so [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not cheating anybody out of anything.  I haven't been able to do anything for two years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's no question about that but now, you have to go for a year from the point that we have filed for it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> A year until -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> From the point that you can't work for a year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> From the time you filed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.  I know, it's a crock is what it is, so I want to, mainly what I want to do is get my back pay and then.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Find a way to get back to work if you can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I've already paid for my real estate school. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, when will that start.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I went to it but I couldn't stay awake, remember I told you that, I couldn't stay awake, couldn't do anything, I thought this is a waste of time, but the first time the kids decided not to go to school, they didn't go to school so I couldn't go and then when I got ready to do the next set up of class, I couldn't even stay awake, it was my thyroid, it was at 15, 17, somewhere around there.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> TSH, which is way too high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I mean that would have been a waste of time going to class.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I can't concentrate then it's a waste of money on top of it too so I want to get everything straightened out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If they can get my thyroid under control and this helps my back and I'm able to function with it then great, then we're on the right path.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well the other thing, I'll be interested to hear from the doctors up in [DEIDENTIFIED] when you go see them, I know [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said she expected you're probably going to have to have your thyroid out at some point and I'm going to be curious to see if they agree with that opinion and, if so, is that going to give you some stability at least in terms of the thyroid.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, my whole thing is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s whole scenario when I went in there was that it's not my thyroid, I have other problems.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Everything revolves around my thyroid.  I mean my back's been jacked up.  Take that out of the picture and things have shown my thyroids been doing this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They can't control it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and if they can't, then again are they going to need to do surgery and will that help things stabilize.  I'm even going to be curious to see if your thyroid is more stable, will that help with your back too because it's got to be hell on your whole system, your thyroid fluctuating like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.  I find out the biggest thing for me when my thyroid fluctuates into the low range, which the TSH is high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can't breathe good, that's when my lungs start hacking all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you smoke, but I mean that's when it just hits, that's the worst part and then coming back down and going back up.  It takes usually six to eight weeks before I can get back stabilized again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My concern right now also is I don't want my thyroid to start going low again, no way, that was just hell on me last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's rough.  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Rough.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Little do you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, let's do this then, let's not put you on an antidepressant.  Let's work with the Xanax when you need it and the Klonopin if you need it for sleep, carefully, and you're on a low dose so I don't have to worry about that.  Just, and let them get, see if you can get your thyroid stable and get your pain under control.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well the pain seems, I'm going to tell you right now, I think he's actually found one that's got it somewhat under control now.  My concern is -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Can you tolerate the side effects?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is this is short term like some medications, you know, you get over the hump then you're fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know much about this.  I even called the company about it, [DEIDENTIFIED], the company.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they gave me to one of their pharmacists that works for the company and they couldn't give me any more information than is on the piece of paper.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I haven't had anybody on that medicine so I'm going to do some research myself to learn about it, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just came out last year.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] is the company name.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If you need it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, great, thanks.  Well any other concerns, questions, problems that you want to talk about today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to be so damn tired right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't blame you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I come in and bitch to you, either my back is throbbing or else I'm exhausted.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it's a hell of a way to live isn't it, where either you can't function because of the pain or you can't function because -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I woke up this morning feeling just great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But then about an hour and half of being up, I was like this -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where you're going back out again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well now, I know another gentleman that had, he's an older gentleman but he hurt his back, had to have surgery, had a fusion, and they put him on pain medicine and he got to the point where that's all he did all day long was sit in the chair and doze on and off and his wife said, you know, what kind of life is this, all you're doing is sleeping all day long, they couldn't do anything and he said I know but my pain is so bad if I don't have the medicine, I can't function because of the pain.  You know, it was really a challenge for him to find a way, over time he has, he's found a balance where he can stay awake now during the day and his pain is manageable so I think that's going to be the challenge, can they find some middle ground for you where the pain is manageable but you can be awake, alert, and do things too, so it just may take time so</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's my biggest thing, like I sit down, it's just the exhaustion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If that's the right word, I don't if it would be exhaustion, what would you, how would you describe that where I'm just tired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Tired is reasonable, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Like I vacuumed yesterday morning, that was it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The rest of the day was just kind of laying in bed.  I feel bad for my kids, not her, she's gone all day, it's the boys because I'm not doing a whole bunch with them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's hard on you and them and everybody so, well, all right, let's set up another appointment, maybe, do you think maybe in a month to check back in just to see where things stand and make sure you're doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This Opana just bothers me, you know how I am, it just worries the crap out of me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not used to this dry mouth like this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's horrible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I get dizzy from it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And now it'll hit about the same time that it actually started kicking in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] later.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's the side effects.  Let me grab a pencil.  I'm looking at a month from now, the [DATE] is a Saturday, do you want to -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Saturday?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Either the week before or the week after.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One of them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I've got times, you like morning appointments or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Remember school starts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So [NAME OTHER] has to be at school at nine, he's my last one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so like a nine thirty time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that'd work great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  I've got Monday the [DATE] at nine thirty.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I did bring my phone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want an appointment card also?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Once I get it in here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just need to learn to take my time putting it in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME], okay when are we looking?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Monday, [DATE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE] at -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nine thirty.  So did [NAME OTHER], did you get your schedule yet?</p>

<p>CG: No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She came with me earlier this morning</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To go to school but then found out there's nothing she can do.</p>

<p>CG: I'm in the options program.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CG: So it's a little different.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<p>CG: Like my schedule for state school I guess.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.  Were you in options last year?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you like it?</p>

<p>CG: It was pretty nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I know some other kids that really like the set up better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think she likes it more than she lets on.  I mean because you're not going all day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she's good, she's a pretty smart kid, I'm telling you right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She didn't get the smarts from me but she's a smart little cookie.  I'm telling you, she gets all of her stuff done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And gets good grades.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now if she'd just rub that off on my boys.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so if you need anything before that, just give me a call, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I got, my Xanax is fine so I don't have to worry about that.  My heart medicine, that's my concern, I need to go see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] but should I be taking, is it my anxiety that's causing this, now you know about this stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Causing which?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If it's just my heart rate is up -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my blood pressure is good, would that be an anxiety attack?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Don't know, could be, could be the Grave's still, so that's where I think again I'd use the Toprol and see if it gets it back down.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you're thinking that if, if I'm having swings back and forth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Where I'm getting lightheaded and then I'm jumping at every little thing, what would that tell you as a doc?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it would be several things.  Again, I'd checked your heart rate and blood pressure and see if they're up and if they are, I'd take a Toprol because Toprol works for anxiety as well as for the Grave's.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So it kind of covers both bases.  Xanax really only works for, again, more for the anxiety but not so much for the symptoms of the Grave's disease so it's not -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Can they both be interacting, I mean if my blood pressure and heart rate went up -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Could that cause an anxiety attack, it's the same exact thing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely, yes, your heart rate and blood pressure going up and trigger anxiety, it can cause people to feel anxious, worried, nervous, because you're, physically your body is changing and you're going through this.  One person said to me, it was like I just ran a marathon and I was just sitting in the chair.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm going to tell you right now, dry mouth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can guarantee you by noon, I will have either taken my Toprol or Xanax because this, every time I've gotten this real bad like this in the last three days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've had an anxiety attack or the heart and blood pressure has gone up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah if your heart rate and blood pressure go up again, I'd just take the Toprol.  If you're feeling real nervous.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am, I'm feeling anxious.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Then I'd use the Xanax and see if that takes the edge off of that and you can take them both if you need to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's weird how I'm getting these now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know what, I'm going to tell you, I'd rather have my thyroid where it is right now, even if it is, TSH is low.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it's less harm, believe it or not, on my body than when it's gone up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When it gets up too high, I'm telling you, my chest hurts, I'm coughing, I just feel miserable.  I'd rather have the anxiety and be able to treat that because I can't treat the other part.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It almost brings like on, they think I'm nuts, it's bring like on a lung kind of infection thing where I'm hacking up crap.  You can say it's from my smoking, that's fine, but look at me right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not hacking, I'm not coughing, but once my thyroid goes up into the 8, 9, 10 range.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's where it all starts and they think I'm nuts when I tell them this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It effects your metabolism when you're thyroid is up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I know but they don't listen, they think I'm nuts.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you need to get in and see someone that'll listen to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] didn't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I think, again, if it's not working then it's good to find someone that will listen and work with you so I hope, I hope it will go better after they see you.  I know another lady that had thyroid cancer up there and she's real happy with the care she got up there.  She had to have her thyroid out and she's been real, she feels like they really worked with her, so I hope you get a good doc up there too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had one in [DEIDENTIFIED], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he was unbelievable.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's like you, they sit and listen, they take an interest in it and then they put all the pieces together, they don't just look at the paper and go man you're nuts.  That's how [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you're not nuts so, all right, well hang in there, okay, and like I said, if you need anything before next month, just give me a holler, I'll be around, okay.  Good luck with school.</p>

<p>CG: Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm starting to shake now again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I see.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just comes on, like I told you, the dry mouth, now watch this and then it's going to go into an anxiety or -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME] when you get home, you want to just check your heart rate and blood pressure to see where they're out, see if you need a Toprol and/or a Xanax to take the edge off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's good that you saw this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wasn't this bad when I came in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, yep, it's coming.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I need oxygen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, listen, hang in there, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I am doc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, all right, [NAME OTHER] it was nice meeting you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Get out of here.  That way.</p>

<p>CG: Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Kids.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.  All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doc, thanks again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, take care of yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I will talk to you next month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, sounds good, see you.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know there are so many times when you come to see a therapist where you're not prepared to say anything because you haven't thought about any of your problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or you think about but you don't always know if they needed (inaudible - 0:01:17.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like to say this that what you told me the last time was really, was really pristine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You kind of crystallized things, that was really valuable because you told me the fact that I could really move as much touch on reality paying too much attention to what I think other people think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And as I can ... because the (inaudible - 0:01:50.0), you do grow up with the notion that you get a clue of what you are from how people react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What about that problem when people react to you badly? I don't have this problem but there are people I know who get bad reactions from people and I know people don't like it. What should a person like that think? Should they still, should they think (inaudible - 0:02:24.0)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess you know people hate a (inaudible - 0:02:33.4). In fact those are the people who seem to be the most secure, they know that they're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:02:43.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like you were trying to get what should you think of yourself when other people (inaudible - 0:02:52.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's the problem because ... this person, especially if you know this person's opinion about others  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and you think their opinion is pretty accurate but say you don't think (inaudible - 0:03:09.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:03:17.5).
CLIENT: Or not a good person or whatever they might thing. Or if they don't like me for some reason, they don't respect me. You know, speaking of the word respect, my mother told me something yesterday. I ended up telling her about and comment that well, this person didn't respect me and she didn't want me to use the word respect because she thought as soon as I used the word respect that gave the person some kind of status or it didn't (inaudible - 0:03:52.0) their opinion by even admitting that they were in a position to respect or disrespect me. Even using the word, this person doesn't respect me seemed to sort of insult them and put them in a higher position or was self-debasing. I don't know that's very interesting conflict that even (inaudible - 0:04:16.9). She objected to the wording.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying that was what you felt when you were using that word, is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:04:28.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why should I even, even recognize that person as someone who could respect me or disrespect me? I don't know it's kind of hard to put across what I think he meant. But I've never run into that before and it's really interesting (inaudible - 0:04:53.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not because you (inaudible - 0:04:55.1) she felt you were putting them up ahead of yourself, where they could judge you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. If you don't even recognize the person as someone to judge you  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - as a person  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - or anything (inaudible - 0:05:10.4), you wouldn't use the word respect or disrespect. Just say oh you're not one of so and so people are something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. How did that hit you? Is that what you're trying to (inaudible - 0:05:27.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no I like that idea  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - I thought it was very interesting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never thought of the very words ... another thing that she objected to that I use to say all the time last year was like am I don't something wrong and she said why do you use the word wrong, never use the word wrong. I don't know where she's getting all this from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know why she found it a little (inaudible - 0:05:57.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you don't use the word wrong I mean you might be different, you might be different maybe that difference isn't very popular or it might be popular. The word wrong is really putting yourself down. There's no such thing as wrong. I would like to have a (inaudible - 0:06:16.5) probably, I was thinking what did I do wrong? I just used the word wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So that's making you question about what do you (inaudible - 0:06:34.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she would even question the use of words.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The use of words and said something about how you're feeling about yourself.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:06:46.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or how, like everything I said has more meaning then the way I put it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose in theory that person doesn't respect me I am putting him on a higher level, or (inaudible - 0:07:10.4) disrespect and respect (inaudible - 0:07:12.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe it could reflect the way you see things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or what it means to me. I think (inaudible - 0:07:25.0) contexts (inaudible - 0:07:26.8), I think. I was telling a friend of mine before I came over here we were joking and she claims maybe she should come over here today instead of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know whether?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I should ... well, we were toying around with the idea of (inaudible - 0:08:01.5). What do you call me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I call you client.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Client.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:08:11.7), yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Makes me more worthy of respect. Talking about somebody else's problems, I don't know. I'll mention this in the sense that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, wait a minute before you mention though. What do you mean should have (inaudible - 0:08:33.8)? You're talking as if there are rules that apply ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I thought that the advice I gave her was based on conclusions that I come myself. Well, I told her that one, I've gotten a lot out of therapy but probably the one most outstanding that I conclude come to that I found out there is so many questions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe she, you know, had an affair with somebody and he doesn't call her and she doesn't know why he doesn't call her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she would like him to call her but she can't ask him to call her up and like he doesn't call. And I just thought that she couldn't change anything, the only thing that she really can't solve the problem and how should she solve that problem? But maybe, I was just saying that (inaudible - 0:09:36.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why are you, are you bringing it up to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why am I bringing it up?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (inaudible - 0:09:42.7). Well, I think it's a little bit related to problems that have bothered me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm just telling you what I told her is that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - first of all I told her that well you can ask him why he doesn't call and you can try to find out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why he isn't calling (inaudible - 0:10:05.4). But I don't think you necessarily find out, he might tell you something. You may never find out for sure why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she said well maybe he doesn't call because I went out with a friend of his firm when he found out. So I said well your friend hasn't told you if he I married or not, the one that she has been going with, sounds like a wild one. And I says well you should go out ... if you wanted to go out with this other person you should have it's sort of like and I says like, like my therapist was talking to me about not having to go for it, having my cake and eating it too, how can I please myself and behave the way I want to behave and yet please everyone else. You talked to me about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I says well I guess I think it's the same thing. You knew before you went out with him that the other person has found out but the question of whether you wanted ... well, what I'm saying is that you wouldn't  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew you were taking a risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You knew that he might find out. Now, you could have not gone out with the other guy like I said you could limit yourself socially  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - because of what he will think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Or you can do what you want but you don't want to limit yourself socially and yet you don't want him to resent it and I was just telling her that she can't please herself and him too, probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think, I think maybe I internalized (inaudible - 0:11:51.5). I can help somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:11:54.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you feel good, (inaudible - 0:11:58.8). Are you saying it made you feel good to be able to, feeling you understood something well enough to help somebody?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, you know I'm still working these things out for myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But it made you feel you had a grasp.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now she has got to solve this problem, why doesn't he call?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And the other part of what you're saying is something about the one thing that you (inaudible - 0:12:39.4) there aren't always answers to everything (inaudible - 0:12:48.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was just wondering why someone find other women more attractive, why you didn't like him, why they never called you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why didn't I trust this man? And I'm just beginning not to ask myself those questions because I'm beginning to accept the fact that I probably can't make (inaudible - 0:13:12.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why someone else might be more attractive  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - to a particular person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You won't know if you find that out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I may, sometimes women can't they don't know why a person has called them (inaudible - 0:13:27.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess what I was trying to tell her that maybe she can't, won't ever know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe he lied if she asked him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And I guess it's like disappointing to you that you can't all know those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sort of. It would be nice to know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just know so many girls that have trouble with men and marriages, like I told you I've been to parties where women would come without their husbands  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and I'm just beginning to think that every women has to be strong within herself to go through these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think that a person should ... this is ideally the person can allow himself to be influenced or to let these things be, have power over him on his emotions and his emotional well being.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess you're saying ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't be prey to every whim or every fickle person that comes along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:14:52.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're still left no matter what happens to you, don't you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like I was reading a Cosmopolitan once that said oh you know you might have, your roommate might meet your boyfriend and they might be attracted to each other. Well, this is a devastating thing to happen but if you really have self-esteem you survive that sort of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:15:22.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like to.
THERAPIST: But it also (inaudible - 0:15:40.4) a hard thing to pull yourself together in order to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think I would still worry about what some people think, especially that man. I can't think (inaudible - 0:16:09.1) that word respect is there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:16:12.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or doesn't (inaudible - 0:16:15.5). Well, even  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it makes you  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: - well, you know what, even just tiny little things, if I unlock a door and he's standing there when I'm in my department  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and if I'm startled or frightened, by the way it's very ironic that when you are conscious of another person or you like him, they see a different side of you then other people. I might be more startled when I see him then I do when I see other people, but anyway when he sees that I'm startled I really feel ashamed afterwards because (inaudible - 0:16:49.9). He's thinking, oh shoot, she's jumpy and she's doesn't really have good nerves, that's not the way a sophisticated women would behave.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm always thinking this that he doesn't think of me  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:17:08.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: - that I'm the kind of person that a woman should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The only thing that you feeling like because if he doesn't like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yet I know mentally that looking at it objectively that there's no one ... well, I had read somewhere that there's no one standard person. That there's no one that sets up the rules and said this is the way a person should be. But I guess all of us want to be, we want to conform to what the person we like would like, we want to please. At sometime in our life we want to, there's somebody we want to please.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would like to get to the point where I don't want to please anyone but myself, that I don't care what anyone thinks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But right now you would like to say, but right now you're confused by (inaudible - 0:18:13.6) then what the rules is what (inaudible - 0:18:17.7)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when you fail because of the rules (inaudible - 0:18:22.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what makes it bad is that I'm probably, he probably sees me at my worst.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whatever that means.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: My worst.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've got the wrong word too, that's a relevant term, my worst. Worst then who by?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then his life? (inaudible - 0:18:43.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Awkward or childish.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But those two in line, that's not (inaudible - 0:18:58.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But it almost sounds like when you're with him like you start to drain away from yourself (inaudible - 0:19:08.8) is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way?
CLIENT: Can I turn to something else? This is a little on the same subject. I told you that, I don't know if I told you that I decided that if he made a pass I wouldn't speak. In fact, he did say something to me this fall. Another thing I told my friend, now I don't know if you think this is better. Sometimes when you're wondering if a person is going to call you or they're going to be friendly or they're going to make a pass, you're concentrating on what they're going to do and I think you set them up as the dominant person in your mind and the relationship between you and that person between the two of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you started to become passive, is he going to call? For example, I use to wonder if this other guy would call, the one (inaudible - 0:20:14.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I found that it sort of helps if you become the active person in your own life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For example, well, maybe if I decided not to go out with him it would sort of take away the question of whether he's going to call me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I'm coining it right, it's sort of like not what is he going to do or  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What am I going to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: - what am I going to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. It's like concentrating on yourself and what you decide and what you want and what you'll do.
CLIENT: Uh-huh. Not just be waiting to react.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that helps. Of course, no one can get past the point of hoping that they will call so that you can have the pleasure of letting him know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That answers then too. But it suddenly helps to make the decision.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. It gives you more power somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You feel it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. It makes you feel stronger.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Unless you really want to go out with that person but I think if you're having trouble with a person and they're not calling and the relationship is not pursuing will be I don't see why one would want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go out with a man because I think that can be constantly frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I don't know maybe it's easier for me to talk this way and make these decisions. So many women have more dates and more boyfriends and I think they're constantly being stimulated by men. I think maybe, maybe I've had more luck or better luck, depending on how you may look at it, so maybe you might say by my having more disappointments it might be easier for me to make tougher decisions and be a little bit tougher about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whereas another woman, well she doesn't feel so ignored by men, she doesn't, I don't think they develop such a hard nosed attitude. I don't mean a hard nosed attitude toward men, I like men, but how (inaudible - 0:22:40.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:22:41.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, tough mindedness in that you're not going to lose or you're not going to be hurt and that the only way you're going to survive is to have independence and self-esteem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. It sounds like what you're saying part is like my disappointment has given me toughness, it's more easier for me to (inaudible - 0:23:06.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it might have. Of course, now ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you hoping that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope it has now, I suppose it could work the other way, say like sometime when people are deprived of something and they finally get they go overboard. But I don't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:23:27.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm afraid but not too much afraid. I have confidence that I can proceed. For example, I think that I'm lucky that I didn't have to go through a long drawn out ugly affair just to begin learning some things that I did. I think that I learned, I think I learned a lot for a minimal amount of experience. Well, some women even have more experience and they can get married and go through a horrible experience and even have a couple of children  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - before they realize that they can't be so dependent on what a man thinks of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's what I can't (inaudible - 0:24:18.9). If you are really say yes I had a bad time but here are the things that are not so bad about it or if you're trying to make yourself feel better by pointing out to yourself these things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably both. I do feel better that I didn't have a worse time of it to learn the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm sure you know some men keep a woman on a string for two years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they decide to forget it and then he called and they never... I think that's the kin to the same thing I'm talking about women that date a lot have a lot of boyfriends, I think they haven't felt the respect to develop that kind of independence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They haven't felt that they had to get along without (inaudible - 0:25:24.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Whereas you have really known how to (inaudible - 0:25:27.3)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really know when you have to be (inaudible - 0:25:30.2) or (inaudible - 0:25:32.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible - 0:25:35.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:25:39.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe that's why with their boyfriends they're not as independent because they haven't had the kind of experience that would make them sort these things out or like I said I'm repeating myself (inaudible - 0:26:07.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That independence or tough mindedness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that in a way you're proud that that kind of (inaudible - 0:26:22.2) that you have developed but also that (inaudible - 0:26:28.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I really think this is the way, I think this is the way women should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's not a man hating thing not at all but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this isn't really the way you think all women  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - are better off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do feel, I know I'm speaking of men as if they aren't human beings and they're a different species but from my point of view they just don't seem to suffer as much as women. They don't seem to be as dependent on women. And I'm not just looking in my case, I'm looking at other cases, I know, every friend I know, every girl I've known has had to content with fickleness on the part of men and I think that women get their idea about themselves from men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. A lot of what you're saying sounds a lot like (inaudible - 0:27:32.8). Is that surprising?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. But I have, I don't think of it along these are my own conclusions but I know it sounds like, a lot like (inaudible - 0:27:48.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope you're putting down that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm saying it sounds like (inaudible - 0:27:56.2). And suffer a lot (inaudible - 0:28:08.8) you feel about them because they put a lot of emphasize (inaudible - 0:28:19.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't like them (inaudible - 0:28:21.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. (inaudible - 0:28:25.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you never see an article advising men how to get a woman, how to please a woman. And it is unfair because I mean we have to be pleased too I mean what about the women's pleasure, what about what she thinks of the men, what about her rights to be (inaudible - 0:29:10.2)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. I guess what I was saying (inaudible - 0:29:15.7), and talking to people about some of these (inaudible - 0:29:21.4) or thinking about it. I mean you're sure to find other people who feel similar to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But you see, of course, I don't talk much about women's lib and so far as the employment  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - equal opportunity, that kind, I just picked up (inaudible - 0:29:42.6). But it's the personal things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:29:46.7).
CLIENT: Yeah, mine that thinking would parallel with them in that sense. There are some things that I didn't want to change the conversation (inaudible - 0:30:02.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah and you're saying you don't agree with all  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - right, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why can't I work and have a baby, maybe you can make a decision so isn't worth a year to have a baby. I don't know sometimes I might sound conservative, but certainly on these issues that touch me the most  - 
THERAPIST: Some are similarities.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I suppose being a teacher and I really feel the disparity between because I know in private industry they (inaudible - 0:30:35.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't touched by them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I've been more touched by the personal aspects.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't feel that I'm being cynical or bitter I just I think what I think is right. I really do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel if somebody said (inaudible - 0:30:57.3)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't care if people say I'm cynical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounded like you did care.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, maybe I do but I don't think I do because what I think the thing I don't think is just right for me I just think it's right for everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:31:21.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah I think it did cross my mind she thinks I'm cynical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:31:31.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'll tell you some of the people (inaudible - 0:31:41.3) in my life, were people that I thought were (inaudible - 0:31:51.1), they were older. I don't like too much cynicism but I don't know I'm not sure of the true meaning of cynicism, of being cynical, I don't know. If you're cynical, does that mean that you're feeling more (inaudible - 0:32:12.9) or bitter about a problem that you should be or is it a real risky way of being, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it might be (inaudible - 0:32:24.7). I don't connect (inaudible - 0:32:33.5). I mean, the way you feel in a situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think it's very, I think it's possible for a girl who is very attractive to men to feel this way, if they think about it enough. I think somebody like Mike (inaudible - 0:33:01.0)  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - who is very attractive, I'm sure she feels the same way. But I've progressed in that like I don't care what the men think about anything that I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or what habits I have. Or else they think I'm too anything, to stuffy or whatever.
THERAPIST: I want to get back to  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - (inaudible - 0:33:42.5). Think that a dangerous situation and (inaudible - 0:33:48.6) to be odd (inaudible - 0:33:50.4). You have never been it's like you've never been taught to your cash value judgment, a certain emotion (inaudible - 0:34:15.3). I don't feel that way, I think that it's just an expression of how you feel, if it's right or wrong doesn't (inaudible - 0:34:30.7).
CLIENT: Well, being ashamed of carrying through any emotion, you're right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you kind of feel, yeah. It's not right or wrong it's how you feel.
CLIENT: I do think that some feelings are more destructive then others. Make you worry more (inaudible - 0:34:54.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, now you're talking about  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know maybe I'm getting the value judgments again but it may not be wrong for me to care what someone thinks but I think it's wrong for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's harmful to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it's harmful, I think it's unnecessary to worry about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well that's a different thing. You don't see anything wrong I think what comes to mind  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - like you talk about a rule sometime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what she, mother meant by wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you sound like you kind of got more personal to you which is in the way of not taking care of yourself (inaudible - 0:35:39.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, there was one thing that I was hashing around in my mind. You talked to me about, we were talking about my being quite and talking too much. I had a talk with a couple of my friends about this about  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - say you're talking with people and say you bring up something about art or any policy thing, or anything  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and people might think that one has been pretentious or one is talking too much and you said well, you said you were worried that I was thinking of becoming more quite and that I should only change my behavior if I want to (inaudible - 0:36:30.5). But in considering whether I want to change my behavior depends on what is my motive  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - for talking too much. How do I separate of wanting to make an impression, which means you don't feel good about yourself and feel you want to change? Because I read in a magazine (inaudible - 0:36:55.7) said they were blabber mouths, which I don't feel I'm like that. And this, I think this psychiatrist said well people that talk a lot have low self-esteem. Well, I related that to myself and I said yeah I'm sure there are incidences where I have talked because I wanted to make an impression. These people won't like me if they think I'm really stupid, they'll like me more if they think I know something about. It took me a long time to realize that I was doing this. In fact, in the last couple of years I've been aware that sometimes I do this. But then I said but then there's another motive for talking too, you really want to share what you enjoy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes the two motives get mixed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm talking in a given situation am I talking because I want to share it or am I talking because I want to entertain or want  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in your conversation sometimes you can't tell?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you don't always know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I'm beginning to get to the point where I can tell the difference more and more. And probably I think the only way that you can tell the difference is ... well, you can eliminate the need to entertain or to try to show off by, maybe this sounds trite, but feeling better about yourself I think maybe you lose that habit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then you will do the right thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or whatever was considered the right thing. Because like you said what's wrong with trying to make an impression. I meet people everyday that try to make an impression.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It may not be in the same way I would do it, but they're doing it in their own way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Are you, what you're saying (inaudible - 0:38:51.4) you're saying sometimes the sense that I don't want to make an impression (inaudible - 0:38:57.6)  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - wait, wait. The extent that you don't you're saying I think I would stop doing that more if I felt better about myself because I do it when I feel bad about myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm worried about what they're going to think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what, the way I do it might bother people. For example, people will hold forth for 20, 30 minutes describing what they cooked last night, nobody cares. And I put this in ... but no one has as much objection to that as if you're talking about something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you're talking about a symphony.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now are you, are you not understanding that specific or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no I think that people are more sensitive. I think if someone, which I don't do this, it's hypothetical, someone sat down at a table and started going through an analysis of some simple, I think people would be much more offended then if someone else sat down and talked about their gourmet cooking, which I think the two people are doing the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Is it clear to you why they get mad (inaudible - 0:40:17.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I think that gets them to this ... yeah I think people are touching it. People very often say to me gee I really done a different culture I should do something appropriate, like I should go to church, they feel that it's something they're suppose to do as part of life. These are one of the good things that you're supposed to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really don't appreciate that, I think people should do what they want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you answer them to the question?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think there's resentment of certain areas.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That people call culture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have knowledge about that. But you are culture and they feel that you're not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, see I've never been personal I mean they feel about the whole area of what is called culture.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether it is me or someone else. But I certainly have never  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me say another thing. Now part of that I think are very true it has to do with if you want people to feel favorably towards you choosing the subject that aren't going to make those people feel uptight (inaudible - 0:41:41.8) when you start talking about many people  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - you get a very positive response. Well, it's partly because people (inaudible - 0:41:50.1)  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - so then it becomes like a choice for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But yeah that's right. But I've started feeling better about myself because I can honestly say that I've never talked with anyone about anything that I like that someone else didn't seem to want to share with me. I don't sit down and bore people  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you feel good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, well, I haven't done that as much I really haven't done that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So you felt better because you've been worried that maybe you hadn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I wasn't doing it. I think what has happened is that a lot of people I have met at work trying to pretend if they weren't like you say (inaudible - 0:42:37.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I talk about them (inaudible - 0:42:41.2). In fact, if someone talks about their cooking, I don't care I'm just as (inaudible - 0:42:50.5). But on that subject I see that other people are doing the same thing and that they're much worse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Or they talk about what their class did this morning.
THERAPIST: So you're feeling better  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - compared to them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh how smart my daughter is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She goes to college and she's really getting good grades. Oh I haven't gotten the nerve, I can't do that, I said how can they do that nobody seems to mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:43:29.0)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's a good question. I don't know maybe yeah I think people are polite. Yeah, that's a good question. Well, in my mind I don't (inaudible - 0:43:59.5), I'm sure that is (inaudible - 0:44:05.1), if someone talks about how smart their children are. Then what happens after 20 sessions, I get another test?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I've changed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think maybe (inaudible - 0:44:40.2)?
CLIENT: I don't know what the test will be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't, I guess what you're saying is you're starting to wonder if you have changed?
CLIENT: Well, I also think about whether, I'm just wondering if I need to quit. I'm wondering if I'm becoming dependent on the sessions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you were that would be worrisome?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's just something about talking (inaudible - 0:45:35.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I'm dependent, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Finish that sentence for me talking about that what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know if I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It isn't the feeling of wanting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like after it's clearer to me if I can wrap it all up and say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. (inaudible - 0:46:17.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, of course, I'm sure that you can decide all this and talk all this brave stuff and then fall apart.
THERAPIST: So that's a (inaudible - 0:46:30.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I want to tell you something, the way I talk like I've come to this conclusion while I'm thinking about this, do people, I wonder if anyone really choose (inaudible - 0:46:45.1), am I setting up some kind of ideal that no one else has ever reached. Has anyone ever achieved complete independence? Does any woman, if any woman ever free of caring what men think of them and still like men? I'm not talking about somebody that doesn't like men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. But well, I might get closer to it because I'll tell you right now I can't, right now I don't see a man in my life at all. I have hope but I just I am so discouraged about attracting anybody at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I'm just getting to the point where I (inaudible - 0:48:05.3) which I think ... I feel pretty discouraged about it as if there will never be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:48:14.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am after giving up (inaudible - 0:48:17.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't see any conclusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm certainly, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's sort of like there will never be a man a good relationship with and that's pretty horrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it kind of looks bleak and sometimes I feel resigned and other times I feel angry, sometimes (inaudible - 0:48:48.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But it likes being down a hole and each time you tried to call out (inaudible - 0:48:53.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel I can't call out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling stuck down in your hole. (inaudible - 0:49:02.2) and say to hell with it. But you're always going to be in that hole.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'll tell you one thing it does, if I stop telling myself that I really have to trust somebody and, of course, the more hopeless I feel about it the more I feel well why bother, the less then I feel that I feel I'm attracted to like I have time to notice how I feel about somebody. I met a young man today that was subbing at school and if I felt that oh I have to try to attract him or I was worried about what he thought of me I wouldn't have ever noticed that I was kind of bored with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I hadn't had that what's the use feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So it makes you feel not so interested in a lot of men, too. And probably (inaudible - 0:50:12.2) you don't have time to (inaudible - 0:50:15.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, certainly yeah I think the anxiety to attract makes you feel that you're attractive to a lot of people that you aren't or I got to get him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. And you lose track of how you really might feel (inaudible - 0:50:35.2). What you really feel is more of the (inaudible - 0:50:41.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But right now I can't separate being disinterested from the feeling of there's no hope.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's a different kind of feeling then it use to be it's not, it's not all, I'm not good enough, it's not that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's more?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's more like well, maybe there are things about me that aren't so attractive well what can I do about it? That's just the way it is, it's more of that kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:51:20.4) and I can't do any more about myself except that I'm just going to be me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, some of more settled you, who you are with your problems. And also something else I think you might be (inaudible - 0:51:34.7)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. If someone is looking yeah because well first of all one of the answers that I think that I can't find is like this question of what is a man looking for?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm tired of  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:51:50.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I don't know if I don't have it I don't have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if I don't ... maybe if I knew but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like you're trying to find a new direction or go somewhere else (inaudible - 0:52:11.8). It's something like (inaudible - 0:52:17.2) with the help (inaudible - 0:52:18.8). And now maybe there's another way to go which is like what do I want and then you also have the (inaudible - 0:52:27.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's sounds good. I think that's probably close to it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: 50 minutes of our time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 50 minutes or an hour.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think there was a book out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence) I was just wondering how much relationship there is between days when I start to deal with things that must be somewhat disturbing to me and then I have a day that I just come in having thought of nothing that I wanted to talk about and feeling that I'll have no thoughts while I'm here.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You suspect there might be a relationship then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just wondered because yesterday what was, things that were in my mind were just leading to ma—, so many other things.  At least it seemed so when I was here and usually when that happens I'll think of other things once I'm not, whe—, when I'm away, and uhm I just don't know whether it's because I was getting into things that I didn't want to think about that I stopped thinking about them or if it were just that I had been very busy since I was here.  And I don't know, today I began to feel again that I wasn't really handling things the way I want to and when I feel that way I just keep thinking about, I don't know, I get sort of — trying to decide what it is I do think about then but I just kind of dwell on the same thing and I work around the same problem more in terms of I don't really know what I'm doing and I have the feeling everybody else does.  Sort of lack of a sense of direction.  I never get off that into thinking other things so I can't tell if it's because of that that I feel that my thoughts have all come to a dead end or if it's some emotional thing that caused it.  Because when I'm feeling this way about being here uhm, even things that had occurred to me I might want to talk about, just don't seem to be anything I really want to talk about.  And it seems to me, I don't know that, maybe I'm fooling myself, but it seems that I judge it according to just I don't feel it really is that important to me anymore or that it will lead anywhere or I just don't care that much, and so I don't think I'll talk about it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you edit it out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  But I, it's not the same kind of editing as when I think of things and think oh, I can't say it yet or uhm, there, or, or a time when there are other things on my mind and, and I'm scaling them according to imp—, to importances.  It's just almost like I can't be bothered thinking about them.  For instance, an example of this is today, uhm, a boy found a bird on the street and brought it in, had some trouble flying and there was a bit question about what to do with it and eventually the boy agreed that instead of taking it home, it was a sparrow, so it wouldn't have been a good pet, uhm, he would let the science teacher find out what the best thing would be for it.  Whether it was sick or could fly, and could go free or what.  And anyway, just having it there fluttering about in this little container we had for it, was very disturbing to me but then when we took it downstairs to see how it would be when it got free uhm, the bird could fly all right when it was flying, but then it would run into things and it would come down to the ground again and let you come up to it and you could catch it very easily, and I don't know, it was very hard to tell if anything was wrong with it or if it had been tamed once or if it were somehow lacking something, some judgment or something, but it just gave me a very funny feeling.  I was just very disturbed that it wasn't acting like a free bird and flying off and being independent.  And so at the time when I was realizing this I was thinking well this might be something that I would want to talk about, but then now, I, I don't know it was almost as if I just didn't feel like talking about it.  And another thing that I had thought of earlier but that now I am talking of it only because it's in my mind as something I don't want to talk about, was we were at a party last night and uhm, this party I enjoyed more than many that I've been to.  But I was always aware when I was talking to people of the fact that after I'd been with them just a few minutes it was a kind of party where there was movement around and so people would probably be feeling that they had enough talking with me and that I should in turn be thoughtful of them and not make it difficult for them to move on to somebody else.  But today that didn't seem to be anything I really wanted to think about either.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know yesterday you expressed the question of what good does it do to say all of these things anyway.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But some days, I don't know, maybe that's why but some days I even if I'm wondering what good it does I still find a certain relief to do it right then and it carries over perhaps for a while.  (Silence) And I think maybe one reason why I said that yesterday is a certain realization because before I'd started I'd probably thought that there was almost going to be a magical understanding of things I haven't understood, or ability to handle things that I hadn't felt I was handling, but I think I'm realizing that so many of the things that come to my mind here and that I talk about and rerelate are things in a way that I've always known so that there is not going to be any great discovery or anything and uhm, I suppose I'm realizing more what won't happen and I'm not yet too sure what will happen and maybe I'm still looking at it, still, as kind, that I have a passive role here and I don't understand yet how I can use whatever it is I'm thinking and saying.  Or, or I somehow feel I have to accept a certain responsibility, I know I've said this before and I'm not sure I yet understand or really admit (chuckle) to myself that I do have to and how I can if I do.  But then I'm not sure either if I'm thinking that because I've always been taught that you accept responsibility.  (Pause)</p>

<p>In fact I've sometimes wondered in just thinking about the fact that when you generally are talking to somebody your instincts are to not say things that will break your image down in their eyes but if anything to build yourself up by things you say about yourself and so I've sometimes wondered if when I'm here I will say something that is really breaking me down and my image of myself and, and what I think my image would be for you and then if I don't, the next time start saying something that in effect is to build me up again, and maybe I say that I have to accept responsibility because I think that that's what you would want to hear or think was right.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Another thought that occurred to me, I know it has in a different form before but just uhm, in conversations generally I have this feeling that unless you're talking constantly or unless there's talk constantly there is something terribly wrong in any silence, I find extremely upsetting, unless it's with somebody like MSCZ that I know very well.  And I think sometimes when I'm here I think if I'm not talking that you must be feeling either very bored or thinking to yourself I wish she'd say something, or how long is this going to go on, or when will this be over or something like that.  Which is all part of that reaction I had too with people at the cocktail party, my feeling they've had enough of me after a short while.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking in terms of well now, now that I've put that together what do I do with it.  And I realize that so often my defense when I'm feeling this way is all right I know I feel this way and so instead of trying to be a person that would be interesting to talk to and therefore enjoying it I would just withdraw and say I don't care and nobody is going to like me anyway.  Or if they like me then they can like me for me and not for all these little superficial frills that I add, which is how I look at everything, at times how I look at everything that people can do to make themselves interesting to be with.  But I also think I have a feeling that I don't want to be doing it because I want to be interesting to be with, I'd like to be interested in it whatever it is.  And then I'd like to feel I didn't care whether I were interesting as a result as long as it was something I was interested in and I think the closest I've come to this is, is uhm my interest in teaching.  And just theories of learning and things like that.  Because when I'm talking about things like that with people who are also interested, I really do forget that I'm trying to make conversation and I just talk about what's interesting to me and things seem to go well then.  When I think back on it things seem to go well, but I'm not thinking about how well they're going at the time.  (Silence)</p>

<p>For some reason I started thinking about the party last night again and there was just a very short incident that I couldn't get my mind off now of when I was talking to one fellow in particular, and I had met him really in the evening and he was a little bit awkward for me anyway, to talk with, because I just didn't seem to be able to hit upon things he would want to talk about and he wasn't the type just to kind of go on himself and at one point we were having a conversation and suddenly ended up in a situation where we were kind of standing in the middle of the room and things were going on at one end and we were kind of just standing there with really nothing to say to each other.  And all I could think of is that if I were better I could think of something to say now, or if I were interested in him, or I don't know, I just felt very ill at ease and unable to handle this and then eventually he was the one that suggested we do something and I felt that I should have been the one to kind of keep that going and, I don't know, sort of responsible and I guess it must have upset me quite a bit because it's the only thing in the whole evening that I think was really disturbing to me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You felt it was your responsibility to keep things going?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that the way you feel here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  (2-minute silence) I just had a terrific reaction to the way you said that.  Because it just sounded like you had a very angry tone.  And this is something that I thought about before too.  Uhm, I, I just don't know whether you do change the way you say things or whether I'm just seeing it differently.  Because sometimes it seems like you have a very sympathetic tone and, again, I have to see it one way or another I suppose.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you say you had a terrific reaction.  You mean you felt, what?  Angry with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like I had to be defensive again and about to cry and I don't know I, I know, I, I, blood rushed to my head, the warm feeling you get from that.  Probably was blushing and just —, I don't know, the only image that comes to my mind, like a little girl who'd really had done nothing that she could see she'd done wrong and was being scolded for it.  But yet thinking that there must be something that she'd done wrong.  Because the other thought that came to my mind when I was thinking of this reaction I just had was that whenever I'm in a conversation with somebody and they seem to be in any way aggressive toward me and what I'm saying or is never really ever, well, this is the way I think and I, I think I'm right.  Because just with this bird today when the boy brought it in the thought that occurred to me was the man, the science teacher was coming today and so that we would keep him in this thing until he came and talk about it and I realized we couldn't keep him in that but I, I thought if he'd hadn't been able to fly then something was probably wrong and that that was the main consideration.  And then a woman walked in and said, Oh goodness, you're not keeping him in that, he's going to be set free isn't he?" or some, some comment anyway, indicating she thought the bird should immediately be set free and not even be kept for a few minutes in that.</p>

<p>And so I then became all uncertain in my mind and thought well maybe I'm doing the wrong thing and even though I told her why we were doing it that way and, and she agreed, my reaction was well, maybe I shouldn't be at all and I suppose this is another reason why I was feeling kind of upset today.  Because every time I ran into somebody who heard about the bird, they had a different reaction and each one I had to assimilate and think well maybe mine should be that way and then I'd qualify it somewhat but I could never just think that my reaction was the way I thought it should be and that that was the way I was going to react.  And I, I guess too, I had to share the responsibility with or give the responsibility to the science teacher.  (Pause) I couldn't stand the thought of letting it free and then if it didn't turn out to be capable of handling itself, taking care of itself and it died I would feel just awful and yet the bird meant nothing to me, I don't know why I'd feel so strongly about its dying.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I think you, you gave some clue to why you did feel strongly.  Because if it died you would be subject to some accusation you feel that you were responsible for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet with any living thing dying I'd feel this way even if it isn't something I had in my care.  (Silence) Although that's probably not true because one year we had a gerbil and over the summer we gave it to a boy to take care of, well, the gerbil I had never really liked, this particular one, and in any case, uhm, the boy's dog got hold of the gerbil and killed it uhm, and I wasn't at all upset when I heard that.  So maybe it is only times when I can either feel a responsibility or imagine that there must have been one and I know I get a terrible guilt feeling when things happen in the room as I think probably I was talking about when the boy bit through his tongue.  Just anything that might not turn out right and then I feel terribly responsible that there was something that I should have done.  And that I should have been able to do that particular time too and so that it shouldn't have happened, that there was some lack or inability on the boy's part or accident or whatever.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well the thing I can't tell is how much they're all part of the thing because something like having an accident happen or a child learn to read badly or have some kind of reading block, they can, people will say well, if Mrs QSE had done a better job then it wouldn't be this way and so then I can't tell whether it's because I'm afraid of other people's opinions or if it's something else.  (Pause) And the same with something dying like that bird.  If I'd let it go and I were the one responsible.  I can't tell whether, what would have upset me was the fact that other people would know and then accuse me or whether it's simply feeling that maybe I could have saved it, I —.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, whether other people, whether you think someone else might accuse you, you've made it plain that you do accuse yourself anyway.  Whether, whether you think someone else will join in or do it may not be constant, I don't know, but in all these instances you do accuse yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what I'm trying to think is well, why do I do it.  And it, it just seems that I do it because I think other people are doing it.  Or that somebody would do it.  (Silence) I can just feel my mind pulling away from this.  (Silence) And I'm sure it must have something to do with the fact that any time anybody would make a mistake at home when my father was around and one that he noticed he would have to say that was stupid.  And so I, I'm sure that some of my attitude is that unless you're keeping yourself from making any mistake, then you're stupid.  And everybody can condemn you and ridicule you and whatever, it would lead to.  But yet I'm sure I knew sometimes that what he was saying was stupid was just something that would happen and that I, I didn't agree with his use of the word stupid and so I can't tell whether it really did have any affect on me.  But just little things like spilling milk at the table or something like that, used it would be just an awful scene if you did and of course if we did, we'd be so scared we'd be kind of frozen there and then after yelling how stupid we were, he'd start yelling why weren't we cleaning it up.  And the other image of him that always comes to mind when I think of something like that is when he wanted to play around, he would he'd love to balance things one on top of the other and then see how far he could walk and one time he, he usually was good at it.  And one time he had things like a sugar bowl and other things balanced and the pile fell and he broke some things and of course then, the a—, then it wasn't anything and all you had to do is just put them together, or clean it up, throw them away and contrast between the way he approached when he had an accident like that and how he used to treat us when we did just made me more aware that there was something wrong there, but aside from the double standard he applied, one for himself and one for all of us, I didn't really know what else I felt was wrong.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And for some reason my thoughts jump from that to a time when I had to eat turnips for several days in a row because I wouldn't finish them up at any one sitting and my mother had, or my both my parents, but I think of my mother in this case, had made an issue of the fact that I was going to eat them all up before I had anything else.  And I went several meals before I finally gave in and ate them up.  Oh, I know what made me jump, because I was thinking of after the double standard my father applied in accidents how he would also, we had to eat everything that we were served and it seemed almost as if he got a perverse pleasure out of giving us a huge helping of something if we expressed a desire not to have that much or any.  And sort of to teach us not to ask for very little next time.  But yet if an adult didn't want something then he would say.  Well that's alright when you're an adult you can do the same and I know to a certain extent this is going to have to be this way for children, but I think it was the perverse pleasure he seemed to get out of it that bothered me and, and the whole desire to control, and this made me think of the incident with my mother and again the helplessness that you feel when all your essentials have to come from the adults that, who are going to withhold them if you don't obey them and do what they want.  And how much more of it did I feel than any child feels or didn't, did I only feel what children feel?  And I've sometimes wondered too uhm how much I, what my attitude toward my parents was in obeying them and I used to assume that I respected them basically and that's why I obeyed them but now I'm wondering if it was just fear and, of course again I have to attach a judgment on it whether that's good or bad.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking of, if it were fear that made me obey them then or be afraid of what they would think, then I was wondering once I was, let's say, in college and after that, what I thought they could do to me if they didn't approve and since I already felt that they had been withholding affection, I, I suppose they gave me some and, and that it was that much that I was afraid they'd withhold.  (Silence) It's funny some days I feel like talking about my parents and today I just don't want to.  (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

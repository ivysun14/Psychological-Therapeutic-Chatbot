<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. A couple of administrative things. I may need to take your time just next Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should be able to let you know in the next couple of days. I'm just trying to give you a heads-up. I should have other stuff on Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And let's see. Also on the money and insurance front. So the good news is I think you're set as far as your deductible. I think the recordings will basically cover it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Okay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're fine there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other news is, so I am going off Blue Cross.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. You told me that you were probably going to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, as of January 1st.</p>

<p>[00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so what I will start doing then is, I think, balance billing you for the difference between the sum of what Blue Cross pays and then the recordings. I'm pretty sure that's going to continue. The last I heard it was. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I imagine will be on the order of about $25 a session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah, I still have to figure out—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, your health insurance situation might be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it might be different, but I think actually the coffee shop has Blue Cross and they have the PPO, so it probably won't be that different. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I won't be eligible for three months anyway. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So it would probably start in February or something].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I'm still working on how I file claims for out-of-network providers, and by "still working" I mean that I haven't figured it out yet. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:02:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will actually—- I can still file the claims.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty easy for me to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'm not positive, but I think that the way it will work is I will file the claims and Blue Cross will pay you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I'll just bill you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The difference. Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, for the full amount because you will get the checks from Blue Cross.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Oh, that's right. Okay, yeah. That's what I thought happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think with Blue Cross—- I mean, it's so easy for me to submit the claims that I'll probably just do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. If you decide it's not, I can figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, but it's like a point and click for me.</p>

<p>[00:03:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (laughter) That's nice. I'm glad it's easy for somebody. (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And that way I think I will also probably get the information on how they're paying out as well, electronically, so (inaudible at 03:17.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But whatever. It's easy for me to deal with that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Good. That's nice to hear about the deductible. I wasn't expecting that. (pause) So yeah, rough weekend. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks for talking to me the other night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday was pretty bad also. It was a no-Adderall day which, you know—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>[00:03:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I basically just like didn't leave the house at all. [I just ate ice cream] late at night with James. (laughter) But I just read. I'm reading Infinite Jest which is all about addiction in competitive tennis. It's a really really really good book. Usually I read quite fast. I've been reading it for two days and I'm 300 pages in, which is very slow, but it's a good book. So I kind of feel like yesterday didn't happen, which is the upshot of it. (laughter) In that I spent the whole day either napping or reading this book that just like sucks me in completely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, in the intervals of not napping and not reading, I continue to keep thinking about killing myself. So I kept reading. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) So the thing that like—- I mean, there are a lot of things that from a certain angle are just very funny in a horrible sort of way. So like my dad knew that he wasn't stepping up enough, that what he was able to give wasn't enough. At least I have to assume so, because he constantly tried to rally forces other than himself to take care of us.</p>

<p>[00:06:08]</p>

<p>So like we had these family friends three doors down who had kids. The youngest son was Amanda's age and two older sisters, older than that. We would go over to their house a lot, and they would come over to our house. They were a fairly nuts family. I'm not really sure what was going on there. Like in retrospect, it was very clear that he was kind of looking for people he trusted and trying to get them to help him take care of us, like in a pretty explicit way.</p>

<p>[00:07:00]</p>

<p>And, you know, the therapy. Like he kept sending us to therapy. Me, at least. I think Amanda might have refused to go after a while. I don't think she—- (pause) Amanda was the person who would kind of overtly say "fuck you" to authority figures who weren't helping her. (laughter) And I would say "Okay, thanks, that's fine." It is what it is. </p>

<p>And, you know, we had babysitters. The first one, whose sister Angela ended up dating my dad for 10 years. Erin (ph) was really wonderful. She was just one of the best people I've ever met. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:08:12]</p>

<p>But she went to Portland after a couple of years and has worked in health care there ever since. Got married. Has two step-kids who are pretty fantastic. [I should have kept in touch with them]. Yeah, it just still really wasn't at all good enough. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:09:07]</p>

<p>I run into the—- like the wall I keep slamming into, even then I knew on some level that it wasn't my fault. And on another level, I knew that it was my fault and I'm still kind of in that same place, and it's very frustrating. (chuckles) (pause)</p>

<p>My clothes were a nightmare. You know, the story—- I mean, what my dad used to say when we went clothes shopping for the beginning of the year—- pretty much most years he said "When I was a kid, I had two sets of clothes. I wore one and washed the other." And I'm pretty sure that was actually true. And it wasn't because his parents were poor particularly. I think they were just negligent.</p>

<p>[00:10:06]</p>

<p>Yeah. He had four siblings, and his father was a country preacher and his mother was an artist who used to leave her husband and kids during the summers and go paint. She just couldn't be bothered. (pause)</p>

<p>But there's also like the—- like he was weirdly uncomfortable—- and maybe this is not actually weird, because I suspect most fathers run into this. It was just that he didn't have anybody to cushion it for him. Or we didn't have anybody to cushion it for us, more specifically. (chuckles) He was just weirdly uncomfortable with us hitting puberty and our sexuality and our femininity. </p>

<p>[00:11:02]</p>

<p>I remember him losing his shit at my sister because she was wearing a boat neck shirt, and her bra strap was showing one day before we went to school. He was like "You have to change. You cannot wear that." It was like, seriously? This does not have the signification that it did 30 years ago. Like, it doesn't. (pause) Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>You know, and we would wear makeup and he would yell at us and would say "That's really not appropriate." But it was like by seventh grade, two-thirds of the girls in my class were wearing makeup. I think he was just totally out of his league, [but also] did not respond very well. Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:12:11]</p>

<p>So there were like—- I mean, I was in some ways lucky because I hit it two years after Amanda. By the time I got my period, he was used to us going to the store and like throwing tampons in the grocery bag and being just like "deal with it." And that was kind of okay. But that wasn't—- like he was never somebody that we could talk to about that. It was just that I happened to be with my mom when I got my first period, so that was good. I was very lucky. And I think that Amanda called Angela (ph). But it was very uncomfortable for everyone. (laughter) (pause)</p>

<p>[00:13:14]</p>

<p>Yeah. Yeah. It was like our sexuality really scared him for a long time. (pause) You know, at the time it felt like, you know, I was becoming horrible in this way that I couldn't control. (pause) He never like—- I think he tried to have like "the talk" with me when I was like 16 or something, by which time I was not a virgin anymore. (laughter) I'd been dating Bryan for like a year. We'd had sex. Yeah, I pretty much—- </p>

<p>[00:14:12]</p>

<p>And I think it went like "So, do you have any questions?" and I said "no" and he said "okay." (laughter) I don't know whether it was on purpose or by accident, but there was this age-appropriate book for like eight-to-10-year-olds probably, called like Asking Questions About Sex and Growing Up that was on the bookshelf, so I got that and read it. I've always wondered if that was—- that he would assume that I would just pull it out and read it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was never mystified by any of this. It was more like—- (pause) It was not something I felt comfortable talking with him about.</p>

<p>[00:15:10]</p>

<p>He was just weird. I must've been about 12. I think Amanda was in the eighth grade and I was in the sixth grade. We were at our mom's house for the weekend and we tried to dye our hair. You know, one week, fades right away color. So Amanda decided on a bright red stripe and she has blonde hair so it showed up really clearly. I dyed my whole hair bright red but since I have brown hair, you could barely tell. And, you know, our mom was kind of like excited like "Oh, I've always wanted to dye my hair too." Like this is a bonding thing. </p>

<p>[00:16:01]</p>

<p>And she like dropped us off home and my dad was furious, like so so angry. Like he yelled a lot. He made Amanda go to get it dyed over, even though she was like "It will wash out in a couple of days." He was like "No, we're taking care of this now." With the result, of course, that it stuck because she dyed over it with permanent hair dye. (laughter) So she had this bright red streak in her hair until it grew out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like "This is not good." And I washed my hair like four times in a row to get the dye out, and then that completely stripped my hair because I didn't really—- like I didn't know about conditioner. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:17:14]</p>

<p>Yeah. It's only in retrospect that I realize most of what I learned about basic personal hygiene, other than soap, I didn't learn until I got to St. Margaret's (sp?). Like how to iron things. The existence of slips over stockings. I didn't know any of this. And so a friend of the family—- and I was just like really distressed because I had been yelled at all afternoon for something that I didn't think was going to be a problem, and did not see why it was a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, the thing that consistently strikes me as you're talking is the extent to which you take responsibility for so much of it, in that it wasn't just that you didn't think it was going to be a problem. You did it with your mom.</p>

<p>[00:18:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who was excited about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was not my idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like you didn't feel comfortable talking about puberty or sex with your dad. Of course you didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who the hell does? It's not your job to feel comfortable about it. It's his job to find some way to talk to you about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or like when you say, you know, "I didn't know about some things to do with personal hygiene or dress until I went to St. Margaret's (sp?)." Well, how the hell could you have? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, it was his job or your mom's to do that. Like it's not because you couldn't find the right book. That's not how it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>[00:19:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or how it's expected to work. I know probably a lot of things work like that for you, but like—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Some of it is not actually intuitive. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Waving my arms] and saying yeah, that's not something people were born knowing about. A parent has to show them or talk to them about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's not your assumption about how things work—-</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- with any of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I don't know—-</p>

<p>[00:20:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there was somewhat more of a quality of feeling like you had to take care of him kind of stuff. Or that you screwed up for not being able to see in advance that you shouldn't have dyed your hair and pissed him off. Like that was poor care of him. Or like, you know, throwing the tampons in the grocery cart and making your dad deal with it. Like "I'm not taking care of you around this one. You're just going to have to suck it up." As though—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's more like I didn't have money and I had to have them. (chuckles) So this is an instance in which I have to make you deal with the fact that I have hit puberty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I had money, I bought tampons myself. I just never had any money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you were 12.</p>

<p>[00:21:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not employed. And right, so I guess—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [The feeling I get though] is like "Okay dad, you're going to have to suck this one up and just deal with it. Like this is one that I can't care for you around and handle on my own."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which didn't mean that I wasn't afraid to do it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I don't—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're much more comfortable, I guess, taking care of yourself and in that way, kind of taking care of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Than [confronting things on your own].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:22:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or [doing everything that you possibly can].</p>

<p>CLIENT: It gave me a real edge in terms of (inaudible at 22:18.0). You know, it was boarding school and it was kind of miraculous actually, in that other people did take care of me in ways that I could not expect at home. And then the ways that, you know, things like I already knew how to do my own laundry. Like I wasn't homesick. I didn't need anything that I wasn't getting. That was really good. Yeah. Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:23:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you probably could've [handled being in] college. It's kind of sad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet, it certainly says something about your independence and how well you managed to do for yourself [and other things].</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. I don't really know—- I don't know what to do with any of that. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:24:46]</p>

<p>You know, I'm angry about things like the dyed hair because that was clearly some bullshit between mom and papa that didn't actually have anything to do with me but that I got in trouble for. (pause) But—- (pause) I don't know. (pause) I just felt really guilty all the time. (pause) I did dye my hair once again, when I was in college. Less of a success than I had hoped. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:25:49]</p>

<p>I'm like, okay, I got that out of my system but I just had to do it. (laughter) (pause) Yeah. (pause) Things got so much better after I went to boarding school, like dramatically better. (pause) I don't know. When I came home, I do not know why, but it was like suddenly my relationship with my dad just completely shifted, such that—- (pause)</p>

<p>[00:26:48]</p>

<p>It was much more like a kid home from college sort of thing where, you know, I just kind of took care of myself and—- (pause) You know, that let me actually get to know my dad for the things that are really loving about him. (pause) I don't know. You know, and I still had a curfew obviously, but that didn't (inaudible at 27:36.4) because I didn't go anywhere. (chuckles) But it was much more—- (pause)</p>

<p>[00:27:53]</p>

<p>It felt like he was trying to run my life less, or trying to interfere in the way—- like I had a way that I did things now. That was like, this is how I take care of myself. You know, and I liked that. (pause) You know, when I was old enough to get a job, I liked that. (pause) </p>

<p>Clothes were such a nightmare. I was just obsessed with the idea that if I could dress the right way, then I would not be so visible or so picked on or so despised.</p>

<p>[00:29:00]</p>

<p>But like I never—- I dressed like 80 percent in hand-me-downs. I didn't have much of an option. Like I would hit growth spurts and it wasn't like—- like we kind of got new clothes at Christmas and when school was starting, and that was kind of it. So if it wasn't those times, then like I was out of luck. (pause) You know, those are the things that kids make fun of each other about. (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:30:22]</p>

<p>I still try to put myself together in the morning, you know. (pause) I want something I feel good about. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [It's good you can take care of yourself]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's kind of, I guess classic, both of us. So for years and years and years—- well, actually still—- my dad would give us clothes at Christmas. So these would be clothes that he had picked out, and they would always be wrong. Like they're either just not quite fitting or just really not the right like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look right.</p>

<p>[00:31:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just didn't look right. And the difference between Amanda and I was that Amanda would always return them and get something else. I could not—- I did not return them. It made him feel bad. But I couldn't wear them either. Or like I would wear them, but you know there was like this halo of shame all day wearing the wrong clothes. So I just stopped. (chuckles) So there you have it. (pause)</p>

<p>[00:32:40]</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know how to not think I should've been able to fix these things. (pause) It's not reasonable. Of course I couldn't fix these things. (pause) But it still feels like I should've. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:33:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think one aspect of it is that by like feeling responsible and like you had to protect and take care of him, you were also trying to protect and take care of yourself because then he wouldn't hurt you. I think that may be one thing that can be difficult about being here is—- (pause) I mean, this came up once a few weeks ago. You probably don't remember. (pause) How you would be like, and maybe this isn't true, but like I'm hurting you or saying hurtful things in pointing out things that hurt.</p>

<p>[00:34:47]</p>

<p>So I think when you struggle in here, one reason that you sort of work hard and work at being sort of a good citizen in therapy, with the hope that I then won't say things that hurt, or you will have noticed them first or somehow been able to protect yourself from that. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's easier to think that I could've done something different than it is to think that bad stuff just happens. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. (pause) Yeah. </p>

<p>[00:35:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then instead of being in a more active role like you like, you're sometimes in a more passive role (inaudible). (pause)</p>

<p>[00:37:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure what the goal here is. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:38:01]</p>

<p>So when I do start to feel like you are saying things that are hurting me, or you are making me think about these things, I mean like it almost never—- I never feel that way for long enough to say it out loud, because immediately in my mind it comes in "No, that's not how it works. That's not what's happening here." And I feel guilty for thinking that. (chuckles) (pause) I don't know where I was going with that. [Maybe I wasn't going anywhere]. (pause) </p>

<p>[00:39:02]</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know why (inaudible) like that. (pause) Yeah. I feel like in the past couple of weeks, I've kind of brought up reasons and you've kind of called bullshit rightly so on most of them. (laughter) You know, in a way it doesn't matter. Like it was what it was. (pause) But—- (pause) </p>

<p>[00:39:58]</p>

<p>But I know he feels badly about it. I'm not sure he knows everything there is to feel badly about. You know, we've talked about it obliquely in the last couple of years. (pause) He kind of said "Yeah, that was bad." I think good things that I have learned from you outweigh the bad.</p>

<p>[00:40:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I think in here and when thinking about him, it does seem like you're working hard to protect yourself [by the truth of what you're saying] but—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in a way, you're trying to find things that you can say that make you feel better about things between you and he, that you also feel like I'm not going to call bullshit on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in that sense, again, sort of "make you feel bad about." </p>

<p>[00:41:49]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it's like two ways of looking for answers. Like, you know, I could say why did this happen, thinking that I'll come up with a reason that's good enough. And I can say why did this happen, knowing that there's no reason that's good. Like there aren't any excuses—- for him, I mean. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it was important to find some answers.</p>

<p>[00:42:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop. </p>

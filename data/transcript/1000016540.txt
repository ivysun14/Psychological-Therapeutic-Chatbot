<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR:  Hi, Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're always beating me. One of these times I'm going to sprint up and beat you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Chuckling). Well, you see I time it all when I hear the door opening. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You've got to give that little, you know, 11247...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I did that before you came. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow. You're no fatter, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I say you're no fatter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no fatter, but fat. How about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I had a really interesting weekend; it was really - it was kind of different, you know. You ever have these like old family albums, all that sort of thing? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Like the old pictures?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's what I... I had a thing, you know. I kind of said when I left for the weekend that I didn't really know if I wanted to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And went away anyhow. And I kind of went with the idea, you know, finding out a little bit about, like, my family background, which I really have never done. It's kind of like if you've been home from your family for a while then you kind of - well, I've been gone, I guess I left around, say, junior year, so it's been, gosh, 12 years, and I'm to a point now where I can kind of look back on things. </p>

<p>But I asked my ma a whole lot of questions about like when she was a little girl and when her mother was a little girl and when - well, that's as far back as I could go because I don't remember back any further. See, there's this thing, this is what I was trying to figure out, like. I never found out about my dad; like I said before, that he was a taboo subject now. 0:02:39.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've never spoken about him at home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Never mentioned him except for once; and that was the time we were drinking and then we got to it. And I asked my ma all sorts of questions about whether they were an emotional kind of family at home and like if she was - like if my grandfather would ever hold her in her (sic) lap and who she'd talk to when something was bothering her and all this sorts of stuff. I think for one evening or it was one afternoon I was talking to her about three, four hours, you know, just kept after her. </p>

<p>And then I got hints and inklings; like, I didn't ask directly. My father came up, but I got hints and inklings along the way. And then on the last morning I was there - I left on a Saturday because I - last morning, I had asked the day before if she had any old albums and stuff, and she kept two albums from the time that she dated my father. And a long time ago I must have glanced through a bit. It was kind of like glancing through something like maybe a Playboy when I was in high school; something I didn't really study. And if I'd see her looking at them, looking through these things, then I would close them, pretend like I was just looking at old pictures.</p>

<p>Then my real curiosity was on my father, and this time, though, I still felt funny, like I almost had to work up to ask her about - let's see what it was - to ask her about if he had any letters; that's what I was after was the letters. 0:04:27.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Letters that he wrote to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or any letter, anything he wrote, anything where his personality would come through. But finally I asked her if she had any and...</p>

<p>(Telephone ringing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Answering call) Hello? Hi. Yeah, but I'm seeing somebody. Yeah. I'll be psychodrama meeting tonight. Yeah, I'll give you a call or something. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I asked her about the letters, and she had saved them all but then she threw them all away except for the last one he wrote so I didn't have really anything there. And it was kind of - when I first asked her about that then she - I said something like, you know, "Never really talked about it." Now I'm really curious about him, and it stuck kind of funny, like, what do I call him? You know, I refer to him obliquely; I don't refer to him like my father. She refers to him as either "your father" or "Johny"; his name is the same as mine. But me, I feel strange when I refer to him, even. </p>

<p>But anyhow, I went through these books. She made one comment, like before I'd been talking, and it just came out kind of - well, it just came out. One comment was that - how did she say it? Oh, I was after the [funny knot] (ph), you know, like whether we were really warm, we were a warm family, or an emotional family or anything like this, that's what I was digging at. And then I said, you know, "Was my father a warm person," and she said, yeah, he was a lot different than she was. And then she said something, you know, that really zonked me, because whether or not she believes it, it must have been her attitude. 0:06:54.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hope it's not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said, one statement, how did she say it? When we were at home it was considered - did she use the word "affectionate"? I think she said, "When we were at home it was considered a sin to show affection, to touch."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now, wait a minute. She's talking about in her home, when she was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, when she was back on the farm. And she says, "When we were at home it was considered a sin." I used the word "affectionate." I says, "Was there much affection," and she says, "Yeah, when she was at home it was considered a sin. Now, I think that - and like touch, hugging, stuff like that, especially like with a guy or something in a sexual sense, and she said when she told that to my father he couldn't understand that. He says he just couldn't understand it. </p>

<p>So one time my father and my mother - I don't know if this was before or after they were married - they were over at my grandmother's house, that would be my mother's mother, and my dad put his arm around my mother and said something silly like, you know, "Look it, you know, I've got my arm around your daughter, you know, something like this. 0:08:32.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, that's really subtle. And my impression of my dad is like he was really a stud. All the pictures are like one of these - oh, for instance, there was a quote, the only thing I could find that he had written. There are only two things I've ever read that he had written. (Inaudible at 0:09:03.6) a little quote from the newspaper; I don't know if it's factual, and he had just - I didn't realize but he had been - I knew he was a boxer, but he was a champion of the division and then he had been in golden gloves competition. And one was from - he lost a quarter finals round in Kansas City. So they have this quote in there... What did he say? Oh, the guy is in the room and he is asking him, you know, "Why did you lose the fight?" And he says, "Well," he says, "I've got such a good record that any time it goes to a decision I naturally lose," you know, some cocky statement like that. </p>

<p>And there's another thing my ma said: That my dad always said that he did not deserve her. So I don't know if maybe it was just he was cocky on the outside and underneath, you know, maybe that's projecting from me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that seems hard to interpret what that means, huh? 0:10:04.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, like all weekend long I was trying to - you know, I was trying to get at things that I haven't ever asked about before. There was another thing... What did she say? It was about sentimentality. Oh yeah. When we were going to my sister's in-laws, that is where we had our Thanksgiving dinner, and apparently last year, when they had the dinner, it would be my sister's father-in-law - his name was Wes - and he's a real warm kind of open, real, you know, kind of sentimental type guy. He's really nice, at least I think he is. And my ma likes him, too, but he opens the - he has a spontaneous prayer for the Thanksgiving dinner, and his daughter and her husband are in the Peace Corps and they're over in Malaysia, someplace in Malaysia, or Indonesia it is.</p>

<p>And last year, apparently, he had a prayer saying, you know, remember them over there, working hard, you know, in a certain new country and all this. And, oh, he mentioned protect me going back to New York and all this kind of - you know, it's kind of sentimental stuff, slushy stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And my ma gets very - she doesn't like this at all and she says, "I hope, you know, he doesn't have some - something slushy like that," you know, sentimental stuff. And it's kind of funny with me too, because like when I've noticed that like when you sing happy birthday to somebody, I'll sing it, but I feel kind of stupid doing it, you know, kind of, oh, I don't know. Or there are other things that I think I pick that up, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This kind of uncomfortableness with, let's say, sentimental or even close sorts of things. 0:12:40.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like a sign that that kind of stuff isn't rational enough; it's too emotional or too childlike, not adult.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it's something like that. It's even feeling embarrassed by that sort of thing, you know, and my ma kind of - well, she put it into words, but I sometimes (inaudible at 0:13:12.3) myself. You know, the thing with it is like - oh, there's one other thing. I asked her specifically - she thought, you know - I didn't tell her I was in therapy, but she kind of - after I'd been drilling her for a couple of hours she started saying stuff like, you know, "Don't you think I did a good job bringing you up or something? Why are you asking me all of these questions," you know. And oh, she says, "Do you think I'm crazy," or something like that. I said, "No, I think you're probably normally neurotic," whatever that means, you know, I says, because there are certain things I've told her, and I tried to explain. I says, "Ma, there are certain times..." You know, like she wanted to be a nurse, even a practical nurse. I said, "Now, I have tried a thousand times to sit down and explain it to you, but you don't hear that, you don't want to hear that, because you're afraid to be a nurse," you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You tried to sit down and tell her what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I tried to tell her like what she could do to become a practical nurse. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, uh-huh, how to go about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. One of the things, she'd have to risk herself in a classroom. And I tried to explain the difference between intelligence, raw intelligence, and the amount of time you spend in the classroom. She thinks that you're intelligent if you go through high school and college, then you're really smart, you know, whereas she's dumb because she only went through 10th grade. I says, you know, "It doesn't necessarily mean that." But she doesn't hear that. And I went through about four things, trying to say...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She doesn't have concrete evidence for herself that she's intelligent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right, right. The way she measures it is that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And no matter how much you try to tell her differently, you can't get through to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well, the reason I cited all these things, I says, "These have been times when I've tried to explain something to you, and I say you're normally neurotic because you cannot know what I am saying, because you don't want to know what I'm saying," and so I don't know. I don't think I left her thinking she was crazy but... </p>

<p>Well, then I cited one other thing, and this she taught me something. There was this time, I think I mentioned it to you, when I was about in 1950 or '51, when I was real small and my cousin was going away to war. And my mother, my mother's boyfriend, the cousin that was going away and I were all in my aunt's living room; everybody else had left the room. And she went after my cousin in a nice sort of way. You know, this is another thing that came over occurred (ph). In a nice sort of way she says, "Well, tomorrow night you'll be on the boat, you'll be going off to war, you know, I went through all that," and just I think the kid was shattered, by the end and crying. And my mother's boyfriend just mentioned a little that she shouldn't have said that. 0:16:25.7 </p>

<p>I perceived it, and I still remember it and I brought this up, and I says, you know, "This is an instance where I don't think you knew what you were doing." And then she said, "Well," she said she didn't think I could remember that, but she says she remembers it vaguely. But then she also said - like my mother isn't sophisticated in hiding anything, right? She said that when my dad was in the second world war and went overseas, her sister, the one that was , her sister continually told her how easy he had it overseas, you know, off fighting the war, just sends his checks home, takes life easy, we back here have got to work. And they really got onto her about that, just all the way home, up until the time he got killed, and she took it that way. And so....</p>

<p>And then another thing came clear: She reacts to that the way I react. She reacted to that by not even letting them know that she'd been hurt and that this was hurting her and that she was angry about it. She just, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hides it inside, same way that you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, hides it inside, right, right, exactly like I do. And like I asked her about that, too, and then we got onto that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean why she does that. 0:18:05.8 </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I said, "Why do you do it that way? Why don't you let people know?" And she gave me this whole bullshit about - which I use - that there is this Bible passage about he being called to fire upon their head by doing kindness. And if your enemy hurts you, what you should do then is, instead of attacking him back angrily, you should be kind to him and that way you can hurt him, too, and I says, "Well, you're doing the same thing, you know."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kill him with kindness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, exactly, and this is what she said, you know, that she would try to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, yeah. I used to always think that way. I think now - this is one of the questions I had, you know, like how does a mature person, or on the way or whatever, like how do you express - I can't believe you don't get angry. If you get angry, what do you do? I mean how do you vent your anger? I'm asking you now, how you do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you're asking because you're not sure how else to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how. I mean I know how I've done it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is to be kind to the other person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all day in the angry part inside of yourself. But I guess what you're saying is that you're being kind to the other person is really - for you, the way you're being hostile to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Well, I told my ma, I says, you know, "What you do with that is you confuse people, because they don't know, number one, you're hurt. They don't know, number two, you're angry."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then when you react in a way that indicates you're kind you really screwed things up because then all the honest emotional responses aren't there and you really - it's fucked up. I guess I didn't say "fucked up." I still don't use that around... 0:20:08.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so what's the answer then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [How would you do know] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I don't trust myself to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you just said that if you don't react in an angry way, that is, if you act in the kind way, that just fucks us up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay, I consider certain people mature people, and when they are angry - I guess when I think of anger I think of kind of almost losing some control, you know, and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do those two go together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because anger kind of takes over and you don't control yourself, at least I guess I don't. I haven't been angry enough to know, and maybe that's why I'm afraid... Like maybe if I'm angry I'm going to - well, number one, physically, I could massacre somebody, I know that for a fact, but I don't think that maybe is what I'm afraid of. You know, you look so childish and silly, I think, when you're angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. It is, like, again, you're being childish by expressing your emotions, by acting them out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and you might regret what you do and you have nothing to make restitution...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Cross talk) happy birthday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you can't show any emotion or else that's going to be childish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you can't control it, especially if it's negative. I don't think I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once you let go, once you become angry, you lose control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but, you know, I'm looking for like a guideline, I guess, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How to hold onto yourself, how to hold the reins in so - what, so you can become angry about not losing control?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean just to express the anger in a mature manner.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, now those are just sounding like words to me, but I can think of getting angry and hurt really bad once, when I got in a fight with a guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And this is way back, too, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was probably the most painful thing that I can remember. Because this kid, we got in a fight down by - it was about when I was in ninth grade - we got in a fight down by the river that ran by our place. And I chased him for about six or seven blocks; he had hit me with a stick. Finally, I caught him and we got into this fight, and he got on top of me and had my arm behind me and just held it way up there, you know, and it hurt like hell, and I started blubbering. And I started with this whole thing on "You haven't been through what I've been through," like I'd really been through something, only I didn't know what the hell I'd been through, like. I don't know what was in me. It was a whole...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so your experience tells you that when you get angry you lose control. You went running after this kid...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I didn't lose control...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...until he got the better of you, and then but you lost control not of your anger, (telephone ringing) the thought that you exposed yourself, exposed your...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that was - I said never again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Answering call) Hello. Ah, yeah. Oh, okay. Let me transfer you to the reception desk. Could you hold on, please? 2360, please.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yup, that time, you know, I was really mad, and then, well, the guy had a hammer lock and I couldn't move. He held me for about a half an hour, and every time I'd move he'd yank that thing up tight. And not only was I physically beaten, but then I went into this whole thing on - all I remember saying is, "You haven't gone through what I've gone through." 0:24:37.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're getting angry and losing control and that really exposed your weaknesses.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that was... I couldn't face that kid for a year. I could never face him again. And then about two years later, he got killed...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like something grating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, really, because really, you know, I felt like just a complete ass. And two years later he got killed on a motorcycle, and I was almost glad he did, because he's the only one that I could remember that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wanted to put the finger on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And since that time I can't remember ever really - no, that's too broad a thing. I must have let it go some time. But very, very seldom have I ever let go. Yeah, there are a couple of times I can recall when I've kind of fallen. Well, just this last week, and this is why I couldn't do it. I knew what was even going on when it was going on, but I got castrated and my balls were cut out and on the floor and I was looking back at them. On Tuesday, I saw you on Tuesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was Wednesday morning. I went, we had a meeting, and there is this girl in my office by the name of Sylvio, Susie Sylvio. And I know a little bit about her. I know she's separated from her husband; he's in a state psychiatric hospital, and I know that she is - she has been seeing a shrink for a couple of years. 0:26:29.8 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And to me she's just - I bug her continually. I don't know why it is, but I will never give a straight line to Sylvio. I once in a while will be nice to her, but I... Because to me there's just - I don't know what it is. I just can't hack her. But I don't do it - you know, emotionally confront her. I'll just say, well, things, or she'll say, well, things, one way or another. But since we've moved to the new office we've been kind of nice to each other, you know, at least civil, civil.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have this concert coming up, the Messiah, and I'm selling tickets for it; it's down in Orchestra Hall. And I went around to some of the people in the office and my friends and asked them if they'd like to buy tickets, and most of them did. And Sylvio said she wanted two tickets; this is two weeks ago. It would have been the Monday before that. Sylvio said, yeah, she'd buy two $4 tickets, and I says, "Fine." I said, "I'll get them" - this is what I said in the two weeks ago - I said, "I'll get them on Monday and I'll bring them on Tuesday." This is the Tuesday of the - [by year] (ph). The time sequence is important. I got in the argument with Sylvio on a Wednesday. The previous Monday was the day that I was going to get the tickets and give them to the people on Tuesday. On Monday, when I came to the - we practice on the [Logish Y] (ph). I came there, and last year they had a policy you pay them and you get the tickets right away, and the lady didn't have enough tickets with her that night. 0:28:02.1 </p>

<p>So I gave her the money, it was 42 bucks, and she said she'd give me the tickets the next Monday so I didn't have them on Tuesday. Sylvio comes up to me on Wednesday, the day after this meeting, and she says, "Alector, where are my tickets?" And I said, "Well, I gave them the money, but the tickets won't be here until next Monday, I'll give them to you on Tuesday then." And she says, "What do you mean you don't have my tickets?" She said, "Alector, you're notorious around here for always being broke," she says, "and I am not going to finance your Thanksgiving vacation." She says, "I'm not going to finance you having a good time on Thanksgiving." In other words, I was taking the money, you know, and I'm going out and I don't know what she thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spending her money. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, that was the big thing. There were all kinds of things I thought; well, it could be one or it could be another. But when I looked at her I think - like I think Sylvio - I know she's always so straight and so controlled and so in charge that I almost thought - you know, she has steel gray eyes, but she said it almost emotionlessness, you know, and she says, "I want my money back." Well, first of all, I think, you know, she is kidding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean what the hell? And then she says, "I want my money back," and I says, "Okay, fine." And I said, "Have you got two ones," and she says, "Yeah." And so I gave her her 10 bucks and she gives me the two ones and I couldn't believe it. But I never... </p>

<p>She made these comments, number one, about that I was always broke. Well, I always pay you back, too, I pay you back right away; secondly, about my having a good time and her financing it. And the implication was that I had just railroaded all these people into paying for their damn tickets and then not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what are you saying? That you should have been angry at her for doing this to you? 0:30:06.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, then, after she walked away, then I sat there for five minutes and I says, "you know, I've really been raped," because she said all this shit and I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you didn't fight back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, I just did what she wanted. I gave her her money back. And then while it was going on I knew that things were irritating me here, but I didn't know what to do, so in effect, she castrates me and gets away scot-free. And I know Sylvio's weak points. I know what I can attack her on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could have gotten back at her is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, but I mean the least I could have...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I should have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, and I didn't. I don't know what I would have done. Number one, she would have made a fool of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? How?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Emotionally, I would have been a fool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would have gotten had, number one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was stuttered or something like that, I wouldn't have made sense, which is part of the thing she always wants to bug me about anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does she know that? You've never gotten angry in front of her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think what she would have wanted to see me do was something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because otherwise, you know, like it was so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you know you would have stuttered if you were angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I would have looked foolish. And there's one thing I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Well, what would all of that mean] (ph)? </p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, to look foolish in Sylvio's eyes, I would imagine. It would have been like being in her power or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In what way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she would have succeeded in getting me angry, for one, which I think she tries to do. Not easy, but I think I'm missing something here. But I'm trying to avoid something, but honest, I don't know what I'm trying to avoid. 0:32:19.0 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what you said was that you were trying to avoid being embarrassed or looking like a fool.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. I'm trying to avoid saying something and I don't know what I'm trying to avoid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I feel like I'm hedging her on. Okay, when I was talking to her, you know, just prior to this, I could not look her in the eye. I would glance to the side like that, and she could look me right in the eye, but I could not face her and allow myself to get a little emotionally pissed at her. I could not look her in the eye and probably still get mad. I think she did, you know. I think on that kind of a confrontation she would have proved stronger than me, and I would never admit that to Sylvio.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I believe it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why? I guess what you're saying is that you're afraid that the incident that happened when you were in ninth grade would have been repeated; that is, that somebody would have gotten the better of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I can beat Sylvio rationally, as long as we're both being cool and as long as, you know - as long as we're just using the room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Cross talk) lose control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, as long as we...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She'll retain control and be rational and reasonable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. What she will do...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:33:54.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: She won't be able - because I don't think she can express her emotions any better than I can, just by watching - by seeing the look in her eyes. But what would have happened, if I would have lost control, I think she would have still been at that same rational level and still - and she would have beat me, and that's kind of been like our game all the time. As long as I'm using the words, or hitting and running around or making little comments, you know, I would never get beat by Sylvio. But if we got in the situation where, I was operating emotionally, like I would have been there, you know. I could feel it just coming, and if we were to bolt to the doors, I would have looked like a complete ass, I'm sure, just a complete ass. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you would have lost control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would have gotten angry, and I think she would have beaten me, which she would have beaten it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, angry means losing control for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And she would have beaten me down, because I know she would have just remained at her own level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because she can get angry without losing control?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's what I was going to say. I was going to say that, for her, you know, like emotionally and rationally might operate on the same level, although I've never seen her emotional. She's sensitive I'm told. Her friend says she's very sensitive, but she certainly covers it well. And I says, "I know she's sensitive," I say, but that's what's crazy, because if you're nice to her, if you're kind to her, it gets to be such a stagnant thing it's unbearable; I can't stand that. And if you're not nice to her at least - it's at least somewhat lifeful (ph). </p>

<p>But yeah, if I would have got mad, you know, she could have said, you know, she did really one-up on me and I don't know if - and I couldn't face it. I could not confront her. I could not directly meet her at the level where I should have met her. I couldn't meet her on an emotional level. 0:36:29.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I'm still trying to figure out what that level is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Let's say she throws an insult in my face, you know, which is, point blank, insult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She didn't throw it in an angry manner, she threw it in a half-smiling kidding tone.</p>

<p>COUNSELER: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's still the same thing. And then she pressed the point. Okay, now I couldn't - I didn't retaliate. I couldn't retaliate. I couldn't really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How could you retaliate? What are the alternatives? The first one and the only one that you think of is to get angry and lose control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but no, okay. I think that because I think that's what I felt like doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt like getting angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I did...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if you get angry you'll lose control. You don't want to lose control.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, what I did, I got defensive, and she says, "Now, where are the tickets?" I explained where the tickets are, and then she starts pumping me, and with each pump I give her explanations, you know, when I should have just said, you know - well, what I felt like saying was - I know how I think I can get to Sylvio and I maybe, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you felt like saying was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, originally I should have just said, "Okay, bitch, here's your money back, you know," or something where I wouldn't have been smiling, where at least she would have got the idea I wasn't completely happy and where I wouldn't have felt like she was calling the shots that... Well, to top it off, I haven't talked to her since, but you know, like I don't want to avoid her now; it's almost that thing. But I know she's going to ask me for those damn tickets. 0:38:37.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: After you've given her the money back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes, yes. I said, "Here's your money back, Sylvio." And I had told her previously that I had paid for the things already, so I don't know if she's been thinking about it at all, but she must think I sold all those tickets. So I told the lady at the window, I said, you know, "I don't want the two fours," and then I got my money back. But you know, it's like I've got a plan now what to say to her. It's like deviously planning what to say to her, because I'm sure she'll ask for the tickets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about telling her the truth, that you told the lady at the window that you didn't want the tickets.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'll say, "Why?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm now telling you the truth, that you felt she was no longer interested in going, because you've given her her money back. Somehow I guess I have the feeling you want to get back at her though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the thing. That would be a mature way of doing it. 0:40:05.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: My way of doing it would be to say something to purposely plan to get mad, you know, plan to call her a couple of names, and there are certain areas that I think anything related to her femininity would get her uptight. I don't know what it would accomplish, because I don't... That sort of answer would be like the answer which would be honest and it would be what I'd want to give, but I wonder... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't really satisfy you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it would, because that's exactly what happened. And it does convey - it almost conveys a sort of reproach, you know, which I feel but I didn't express to her. You know, like afterwards people came up and said, "Did Sylvio really get her money back?" I says, "Yeah," and they were all on my side, of course. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, then you don't have to get back at her, do you? You already have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at her, though, I'm saying, not at her. See, the thing I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to do it personally. You want to do it yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I feel - I know it would be fake if I didn't want to have this all planned out. "Okay, now, Sylvio, I'm really going to get mad at you." See, I don't think you can face Sylvio.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think you can face her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not... I really feel shaky if I know it's heading for a certain level. 0:42:15.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For the level of a confrontation between the two of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. You know, like doing it almost the way that you had mentioned is almost, well... I was going to say it's almost like being nice, but really being something else underneath. I think part of the thing that got me was that my integrity was called into question, too. She said, you know, things like - she made implications about that I borrowed money, as though I never paid the money back, or that I was purposely cheating all these people so that I would have a good time on Thanksgiving, I had no other way to do it. All those kinds of things came into my head. And then the way she said "I'm not going to give you money so you can have a good time on Thanksgiving," which to me meant good time with some chick on Thanskgiving, you know, at my expense. But at the time all I could do was just... 0:44:06.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fade away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, just kind of limp out of there is what I really did and I didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With only one (cross talk).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's almost like when somebody is staring at you and you can't look at them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you look away. And to look at them, you can't do it. The same thing happened to me two nights ago, when I was playing ball, basketball, and that I think was a black/white thing. But it was ridiculous; 29-year-old guys were playing basketball, were playing with - or I guess there were four black guys against four white guys, you know, nice little get-together, and it was over at Settlement House, and Settlement House is more black guys than white guys so it's kind of like their ground. </p>

<p>And it was unbelievable; we were going for a rebound and this friend of mine, who never admits he's wrong, was under, you know, going for the ball. One of the fat guys gave him an elbow; moved him out, you know. We got the rebound anyhow, so one of the other guys got it. But my friend says, you know, [push and fell underneath which called in a foul] (ph). Well, we had the damn ball so it didn't really matter, but the guy that did the pushing, supposedly, got the ball and says, "Our ball," you know. Well, this other guy started an argument, and those guys argued for 20 minutes while the rest of us stood around. And I'm sitting there trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Usually you settle it by shooting a free throw. Neither of those guys would shoot a free throw, one black guy and one white guy.</p>

<p>And then the guy I was guarding was a guy about my age, a black guy. And he says - and I can't understand it. I know what it is. I know how a black athlete will antagonize you; it's a way. I've felt it before and I can't quite explain it, but I could not face that guy. And finally I said to him, I said, "This is a black/white thing." That's the only way I could say it. But it was a way that I knew I was being confronted. 0:46:22.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You, as well as the guy who was fouled.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I didn't even enter into the argument. I figured those guys can blast it off, but the guy that I was talking to, as soon as I said black/white thing, he started laughing like mad, you know, as though I didn't know what I was talking about. </p>

<p>Well, the point is I could go on and on about what I thought was going on, the difference between, let's say, a black athlete and a white athlete. But the point is that I felt like an idiot because I could not face the guy, I could not explain myself, and he was getting me mad. I told him three times, I says, "You're getting me mad, fellow," because he did stuff underneath, you know. And in athletics it's a little different; I'll flip elbows and stuff like that; I don't worry about that. You know, somebody gets rough with me and then I'll retaliate it, but not when it comes...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you can only retaliate physically with another guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even more than that, only on an athletic playing field.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right, yeah. Well, it's just coincidental that all this stuff kind of happened, or maybe it's that I'm more aware of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you couldn't respond to him verbally, just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, he...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Cross talk) Sylvio.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, he beat the hell out of me verbally. I mean I'm sure he was - he was laughing like it's - I can't say it's true across the board. I still haven't figured out if it's just blackness or whiteness or if it's a way of being for a certain person. Like a black athlete, these guys could be relaxed, play the game, you know, make it look like they're not giving a damn at all. We're hustling, we're hustling, screaming out, you know, setting plays up. They're just being cool, you know. And, you know, most of the time we split about even, but when they lose it's like, "Oh, we didn't try anyhow." And if they win, you know, it was no sweat, "You guys were a walkover." 0:48:24.9</p>

<p>You know, it's hard to define that, you know. I don't know my racist things, you know, but that's something I've got to work on, too, because I think I've got them, but it's very hard to define. And that thing, you know, what I can't seem to crack - like I thought, you know, okay, if I go back, go back to my ma, go back to my early upbringing, I can find - and I think I get indications of what might contribute to the thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But still you can't...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't put the pieces together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, and I can't do it with - I still cannot react spontaneous. Right after that I told Wesley is like my confidante there, an older lady - I says, you know, this is what happened, bing bing bing bing, and this is what it should...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you call all women by their last names?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do that a lot. It depends. But Wesley, I always call her Wesley.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sylvio you call Sylvio.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And Sylvio I call Sylvio. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Girl I date I call Susan, but not - I call her Galione. But I've done that before, you know, a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it strikes me that you said before that Sylvio-Susie - the way to get to her was via her femininity, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does it mean to call her Sylvio, like she's another one of the guys? I mean I think that you've gotten to her already. 0:50:10.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: By using that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So her response is, "I'm going to get back at you, boy. I'm going to accuse you of absconding with my money."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always call her Sylvio.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She finally had her chance to get back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I call a lot of girls by their last name. Well, </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's always good to end a session with a bombshell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Sylvio. Yeah, I've done that all along, yeah. In fact, I don't think I've really called her Susie. That's bad news. Now I'm not going to be pissed at her.</p>

<p>COUNSELER: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I won't be pissed at her, but that's what's going to happen. I've just got a feeling, a definite feeling. This is for Thursday, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'll go home and mediate. I'll see you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, bye. 0:51:44.1</p>

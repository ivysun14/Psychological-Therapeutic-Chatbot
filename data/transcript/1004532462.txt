<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: What was this week? So, I talked to my grandmother, my stepmother's stepmother. We were just talking about, you know, how everything has progressed and really how nothing has progressed. She was asking if my feelings had changed at all and I said "no, they haven't." She said "you know, mine haven't either." She was like "I saw personally, with my own eyes, how he acted with you."</p>

<p>[01:13.0]</p>

<p>And it just struck me strange that she said that, and I didn't ask anything. Then she said it again and I was like "what do you mean?" She goes "I don't really know how to tell you this" and I'm like "okay". They live in Texas, so every year my stepmother and my dad and myself and my sister who was just born at this time, but we would all go down. And so I guess the first time that they met me, I — well, this is so disgusting — I was sitting on my dad's lap and I got up and he had a boner. So, I don't remember this at all, so she said that she was sitting across the pool from them, you know, we were on the lounge chairs and they were sitting a few feet away around the table.</p>

<p>[02:16.7]</p>

<p>And she says it struck her very strange, but she didn't — it was only the second time she'd met him and the first time she was meeting me. And then it happened again a few days later, and then a third time — this was all in the same trip. I had been in the pool in the morning and I had gotten out to have lunch, and then I wanted to go back into the pool after lunch but my bathing suit was wet. So, you know, it was hanging in the shower. So I asked my grandmother, who I had only met once at this point, if she would — I was five — if she would help me put on my bathing suit. And she said that my dad heard this from the living room, and the way he got up to insist that he help me put on my bathing suit struck her as also very strange.</p>

<p>[03:07.4]</p>

<p>I remember her saying, you know, joking around, she was like "no, boys change on this side of the house and girls change on this side." And from that day on, I noticed there in the house we had boys' and girls' changing room signs on the door. And she says that was what — I was like "you know, why didn't anyone say anything?" So, I mean, that was very hard to hear. And she spent more time with my dad with my little younger brother and sister than she has with me. And I asked if she had ever noticed anything strange with them. She said that no, he doesn't even show as much interest in them as he does with me. Everyone has always said he has a strange obsession with me.</p>

<p>[04:11.4]</p>

<p>So that was — I don't even want to think about it. I didn't even know I was going to talk about it today because I couldn't even repeat it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't remember feeling — I know you used to talk about feeling awkward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I can remember never wanting to look him in the eye because it made my skin crawl. And I remember when I would stay over there, when I was five or six was when the restricted visitation was lifted, and I would go over there every other weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what led to the restricted visitation?</p>

<p>[05:01.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a few things, but one was that my mom's — well, going through their stuff — she had already filed for divorce. Well, going through their stuff she found these pictures folded up, mixed in with his bills, that were ripped out of parenting magazines. They were pictures of babies in bathtubs and like a baby on a changing table. You can't see anything, but they're getting their diaper changed, and she brought them to court. She was like "I have no proof but this is strange. This is not a normal behavior." And then he accused her of this and that, and she was like "all I can do is tell you of it" and she had pictures and he said that she planted them and she has a sick mind. Clearly —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like history.</p>

<p>[06:01.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that was one thing, and then just being violent. Then he tested positive to a drug test that — did I tell you this, that he ordered a drug test? Well, he accused my mom of using drugs, and she was like "that is absolutely ridiculous, I will take a drug test right now." And so the judge said "okay" and they were both ordered to take a drug test. She tested negative, he tested positive. What an idiot, you know? So that was like the last — because he had been in my presence at the time. They were divorced when I was two, so he didn't have any visitation rights for a year while he was on probation after testing positive for drugs. And then he had, I think, nine months of restricted and then it was lifted. And then he was remarried to my stepmother, and they were expecting a child.</p>

<p>[07:11.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just grossed out, so gross — I don't understand how someone could feel that way, you know, one to their own daughter, two to a child and then one to their own child. And I feel lucky that I have no memory of anything because that would be awful.</p>

<p>[08:02.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what his own ability to [inaudible at 08:12.5] impulses are, but thank goodness your mom protected you as much as she could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And just having this kind of knowledge is pretty traumatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really wish, I could've absolutely gone without that (laughter). I don't even know how — So I got off the phone and I was like, what do I do with this information? (pause) I hope that someone is asking my little brother and sister these questions because I spent a very small amount of time with him unsupervised. You know, whether my stepmother was there when I was young and — but he spent so much more time with them. And they are still so young (pause). I don't know.</p>

<p>[09:15.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has your stepmom's stepmom talked with her about it? Is that information she shared with her? Maybe heard her ask the questions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said, well I asked if she had told my stepmother these things and she said she called her the day before she had talked to me, and she said that — did I tell you that the next year we were there, the next trip we made to Texas, he got really drunk and he said to my grandmother that in college he liked to beat up girls and rape them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>[10:05.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was just like in normal conversation, like it was included in his college-years story. And so she, with this information, she told my grandfather at this time. She tried to talk to my dad about it the next day, before telling my stepmother, and he was "Oh my God, you took that serious? I was totally joking." So she started telling my stepmother that story first and she didn't want to hear about it, so she started to get the story but she said she couldn't even, she wasn't even listening — she couldn't. She got off the phone before.</p>

<p>[10:55.6]</p>

<p>My grandmother was saying — you know, it was 15 or 16 years ago when this happened — I told my aunt, my stepmother's sister, that this had happened and my stepmother's brother, so she's like "I told these people 15 and 16 years ago and everyone brushed it off as if it was not anything to be concerned about, she's overreacting." She said "I felt that way too, that I saw nothing and I was overreacting." But those signs are still on. They have a U-shaped house that folds in the middle, and there's two separate changing areas (pause).</p>

<p>[12:09.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really hard to hear, and it's scary to think about all the potential possibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just glad none of them happened. But then, hearing that and knowing that he was caught in January and it's now April and he probably won't be convicted until June. How do they have these people just roaming free, you know, especially being charged with crimes against children. How do you — and they are facing jail time already. You don't know if people could be in danger. I just don't understand. I respect our judicial system, I just don't understand how you can have someone with this much evidence just be walking around for five or six months.</p>

<p>[13:13.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's an imperfect system when you see it up close like this. It's so personal. As part of the process, do you know if — it seems like it would make sense to me that because it is a crime against children and he has children, that they would be evaluated as part of the court process. I don't know if that's the case and I wonder if that's — finding out about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They were, the two weeks that they were out of school. They have a caseworker who is working, and she came and evaluated both of them. She said she found, besides the initial trauma of all this happening, she found no other reason for concern that he may have been violent towards them.</p>

<p>[14:08.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine that that would be a focus of the evaluation. Whether they would verbally talk and sort of let people know if there were ever incidents or anything is questionable, but a skilled evaluator can usually assess whether it seems like the answers are truthful. It's very likely that kids will protect their parents, but a skilled evaluator should be able to detect whether if that's what they're getting in response or whether they're getting the actual truth.</p>

<p>[14:56.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have yet to be contacted by the police, thank God. So, I told you my mom was, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm so sorry you had to hear that. I'm sorry that was part of your experience, whether you remember it or not. Sorry you had to hear it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely could have gone without that. But, I don't know, not that I can be angry with my grandmother. You know, why wouldn't you call my mom? She said that she knew — she said she had no idea that he had had restricted visitation for so long. And my stepmom says that she had no idea either.</p>

<p>[15:54.9]</p>

<p>But I don't understand how she could not have known because the timeline doesn't match up. She must have known. But I just don't understand how you would want to have a child with someone who has lost custody of their first child, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your mind works to protect you if you want to feel a certain thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So someone like your stepmom, you know, she fell in love with him and you don't want to think those things about someone that you love.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be hard sometimes to sort out what you see and how we filter things we see. And we make interpretations about stuff that we see, things we hear, all the time. And sometimes it happens unconsciously and you don't realize how you might be slanting what you see. That's just what it looks like to you. I have no idea if that's what was happening for her.</p>

<p>[17:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard to have so many good reasons to be so angry at your dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughter). I try not to though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To not like who he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know (pause). I just wish he wasn't sitting there with no consequence. I know we talk about this every time, but it bugs me, it really bugs me.</p>

<p>[17:54.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay. No one is expecting you to talk about it and have it go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly not me. It's big stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wish that all this didn't come out, you know. Not 20 years — or not 15 years, 16 years ago. I wish that for — like, if I had been the adults in this situation, I would've done something different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would —</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what I would have done if everyone — like for my grandmother, everyone was telling her this is not — maybe I would have done nothing. And this is the man that her stepdaughter had just married months before. It's like that show, have you ever seen it, who they actually marry? I was watching it actually this weekend because our families could be on that show (laughter) (pause).</p>

<p>[19:19.8]</p>

<p>I wish that you could like see — he had so many people fooled for so long. Everything, his whole — he used to tell people that he went to NYU. He went to community college for one semester. And, you know, I'm finding all of this out. Later I remember telling my dad's mother "oh yeah, when dad played football for NYU" and she was like "what?" But then she would cover for him and be like "oh yeah."</p>

<p>[20:05.3]</p>

<p>And then I would ask my mom because I found that response to be strange, and she "he never went to NYU". He said he didn't graduate but that he spent three years there, which is all a lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty good con man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he was fired from every single job he's ever held for theft, every single one. And why didn't anyone — how do you just live, you're stealing money, stealing prescription drugs. He has worked in property management, so he was — I just don't understand how he got away with this for so long. I don't know (pause).</p>

<p>[21:13.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so different from how you were raised.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, completely. And I knew a lot of this stuff. It was written in their divorce agreement that I could not know anything about what happened in their divorce until I was 21 when the child support payments stopped. If I was to be informed, then he did not have to pay child support anymore. It's in their divorce agreement. So I would ask questions like any normal child would about their parents' divorce and what happened. You know, as I got older, would ask more informed questions, and my mom was not about to start lying to cover him.</p>

<p>[22:16.1]</p>

<p>So she let me read their divorce agreement when I was probably 15 or 16. And it says right there that I'm not allowed to know any of these things and she said that I have to keep this stuff a secret. So I could never — I never went and talked to him about it. So when I'd ask him why they got divorced —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You knew you were not getting truthful answers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and I had already known. And I remember sitting and listening to him talk about this and I just remember steam coming out of my ears because, you know, "people fall in and out of love, we had a great marriage and your mother just decided she didn't want to be with me anymore and she broke my heart" blah blah blah. So even to this day, he has no idea that I know these things. I don't know, maybe if I were to talk to him about it I'd say, I would just be spilling out all of these things (laughter).</p>

<p>[23:23.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the child support is up. I wonder how that would feel for you and also what it would be like for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think I will ever talk to him again. It's like I feel I'm being like overly-dramatic, you know (laughter). I don't know. Because I'm sure that my little brother and sister will — just because of the front my stepmother is still putting up for him [inaudible at 24:02.1] you know, ten years, five years down the road if they are still having a relationship with him, I will not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you maintained a relationship with your sister and your brother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and my stepmother is already going through the divorce proceedings. How do we do my sister's high school graduation, my wedding, cause I would be happy to never ever see him again. And I just don't want all those things — I know I'm thinking so far ahead (pause). I mean I really won't, I really don't want a relationship with him.</p>

<p>[25:01.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to know what's going to happen when you don't know what will happen in court. If he'll be sentenced, what will he be sentenced with, how that will impact things. I do think it's possible, though that it would be tricky to navigate. But it's possible for you to maintain a relationship with your sister and brother, and for you guys to have very different ways of relating to your dad, whether you completely cut him out and they continue to have some sort of relationship with him. It probably would require a little bit more acknowledgement because right now there's a lot that gets left unsaid. And being able to navigate that and maintain a good relationship with them is probably going to require being able to talk about some of these things that are so hard to talk about. To create clear boundaries and to create clear definitions about separating your relationship to your sister and brother from separating relationships to your dad. They don't have to be contingent upon one another.</p>

<p>[26:17.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tricky relationships require a lot of open communication.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've always had a separation between my mom and my stepfather and that side of my family, and my dad and my stepmother and their whole side of the family. No one ever — like, I almost didn't go to my high school graduation because I didn't want my mom and dad to sit next to each other. The anxiety I felt for months before that event — oh my God, it was awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you worried about with them being in the same space?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Besides like dance recitals when I was little, that was going to be the first time that they'd been together since they had been divorced 16 years before. I had dance recitals and they'd sit on complete opposite ends, and they would never — I would have to run back and forth to say hi to both of them, which was fine. Keep them as far away from each other as possible.</p>

<p>[27:22.6]</p>

<p>And my mom's parents were going to be there. Not that I thought they were going to get into an argument, it was just like — and you know, my mom didn't seem to care and my dad would have preferred her not to be there. I just couldn't. I went and it was fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you certainly didn't get to enjoy your own graduation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could not wait to get out of there (laughter). And then before this all happened, I knew my college graduation was coming up and I had only two seats. So not only were they going to have to sit next to each other, but since I had only two seats, no one else can be there, which was causing the same amount of anxiety. It was even going to be worse because it was just last summer they got into a huge argument because my dad hadn't, of course, over child support, my dad was four months late on child support.</p>

<p>[28:52.7]</p>

<p>And he sent her a letter that he was no longer going to be paying because he felt like he didn't have to because of my stepmother's parents paying for my education. And my stepmother supported him 100 percent. So my mom called my stepmother's parents and read them the letter and they completely disagreed. Why should they pick up his responsibility, this is a gift they have chosen to give, so then it created — and they hadn't spoken since then.</p>

<p>[29:55.6]</p>

<p>And then I go over to my dad's, he'd bring up how much of an idiot my mom was, whatever. But I mean we don't have to worry about that anyway because he won't be going to my college graduation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are you having, your mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think since you only get two tickets, it's going to be my mom's parents who get to sit, and then you get standing room. So my mom, my stepfather and Kyle, and I'm thinking about inviting my stepmother but I don't know if she would even want to go. But I mean I feel like I should invite her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like her to be there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I would, but I don't want there to be a dark cloud, you know. And her being there and my dad not, it would just kind of be like everyone knows there's an elephant in the room. So, I don't know.</p>

<p>[30:57.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And "everyone" being?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me (laughter). You know my little brother and sister, if my stepmother was going to go, but then we don't have seats, they're just going to be standing. So I'll extend the invitation, but I don't want her to feel like she has to go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're not really sure you want her to be there, so the invitation will be extended out of obligation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I wouldn't want her to feel like she's not invited because that means she's — I don't know. Like I feel terrible not wanting her to be there.</p>

<p>[31:49.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If this hadn't come up and things weren't tense with your dad and the allegations weren't there, what would you have wanted? Not what you think you should have, but what would have wanted with regard to your graduation celebration?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That my mom and my stepfather had the two seats and they just stayed home (laughter). But he didn't want me to go to Worcester State because while I was searching for colleges, every one that I said I liked, he would say — another reason why he's just weird — he'd say that they're not an accredited university. How can you be a state school and not be accredited? What? So I would have to call and I'd ask and I'd tell him to call — they're "edu."</p>

<p>[33:03.0]</p>

<p>And no matter — he was just so strange about it. It's always a lot stressful for me to have them completely separate (pause). But I will invite my stepmother because it's the right thing to do. But then I also don't want her to feel strange only being my mom and my stepfather's family. By inviting her, I don't want to feel like she has to go. I don't know. This is going to stress me out for the next month and a half (laughter). I don't know. I don't know. It will work out.</p>

<p>[34:16.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does the ceremony mean to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, again, I wasn't going to go (laughter) because the ceremony, it's more for my mom. You know, the first one to go to college.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a very public acknowledgment of your achievement. Something so special in your family to have someone graduate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so she is so excited about it. The ceremony really is more for her to take pictures and that whole thing, which is fine. I mean it's like five hours long for me to get up for 30 seconds and walk across the stage (laughter). So, I'm excited to have my grandparents there for the whole weekend. We'll go out to dinner.</p>

<p>[35:11.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure they are very proud of you too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I could do without the ceremony. Just send me my diploma (laughter). But I'm sure down the road I'll feel lucky to have the pictures and everything. I just don't want it to be — I want it to be like happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would make it happy for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I'll feel bad if my stepmother isn't there, but then if she is there I'll just be thinking about it the whole time. Is she feeling strange? Are they talking about my dad?</p>

<p>[36:11.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Taking care of other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughter). I don't know, I just have to get it out of my mind and focus on the fact that I'm graduating, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think sometimes people are surprised by how moving the ceremony is for them. So much gets caught up in finishing last papers and the logistics of having people in town. Even without the extra complications that are happening in your family right now, students are often — sometimes there are hotel reservations to make, and there's lots of traffic on graduation time, blah blah blah. And people kind of get to the ceremony and realize that it actually does feel pretty meaningful, and some of the things that people say, and the speeches can resonate. It's not necessarily something you plan for. You feel what you feel in the moment.</p>

<p>[37:16.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then the next week we leave for vacation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you are really looking forward to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm-hmm. I know, I'm so excited.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A well-deserved break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that can sort of be your graduation if the ceremony doesn't meet the expectation of feeling like a celebration of what you have achieved. You can make your own with the less complicated family dynamic of being away with just your mom and your boyfriend and your stepdad. Let that be your time to let it soak in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that will happen because we've planned this trip for over a year. And then while my stepfather was in the hospital, we considered cancelling it because it was sitting on my mom's credit card, all these thousands of dollars, and she was feeling guilty not knowing what his hospital bills were going to be, if he was ever going to be able to go back to work, is he ever going to be able to fly again. So it was almost cancelled, but thank God she decided to wait.</p>

<p>[38:36.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's going to be going with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's totally fine. He scored higher on an IQ test than he had. Last time he took one, I think it was 25 years ago (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's amazing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really good news.</p>

<p>[39:01.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you're supposed to be able to do that, even just with normal aging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know (laughter). He was like, "well, 25 years ago, gosh, who knows what I was doing" (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And no problems with memory?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not at all. His only one strange thing is that he has always been the manly-man, but he got this stuffed puppy dog while he was in the hospital and he — you know, when you have a frontal brain injury they say your inhibitions have flown out the window. So he had this stuffed puppy dog and he kept saying how much he didn't like the dog and how much he wanted the dog out of the room. It would make him angry. But then the next week I would take the dog away, move it to the waiting room, and a few minutes later he would ask for the dog and would want the dog to come back.</p>

<p>[40:06.9]</p>

<p>So this happened for two weeks. It was so strange. So he left the ICU and the only thing he wanted to pack was the dog. He wanted to keep his clothes — he didn't want anything. It was odd, but he wanted the dog. He has no memory of this at all. So we get home and my mom had just packed the stuff up in her bag and she put it on their dresser, and he has this strange connection to the dog. It's odd. He would never have a stuffed animal. I mean, he's 55 years old (laughter) and the dog has to be at the end of the bed. He had to bring the dog downstairs, and the dog sat on a chair (laughter). I was like, should I be concerned about this? (laughter)</p>

<p>[41:01.5]</p>

<p>He says he has it just to mess with my mom cause he knows that it freaks her out that he has a connection to a stuffed animal. But it's so funny. But he had no idea where he got the dog or who gave it to him. It has a "get well soon" ribbon on it. It was cute. He named it Puppy or something like that (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little latent nurturing side coming out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughter). It's just funny (pause). I would never — the time in the ICU was awful. Worst two and a half weeks ever. I'm glad that's over (laughter).</p>

<p>[42:17.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it was really scary to see him going through that, not knowing what was going to happen. Uncertainty is always so hard to deal with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We did have some great laughs though because his personality was still there, but there was no filter, you know (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Looking back —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, oh my God. At the time we weren't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you know, it's really scary because you don't know what it means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he knew. It was just so strange that he read an entire book while he was there in the ICU. At the time he would tell you what the book was about and I have since borrowed the book because I wanted to — but he has no recollection of reading the book. It's like he lost three weeks. But since then he has no issues with memory, so far.</p>

<p>[43:24.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's amazing the brain can recover.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, I know. But he still doesn't understand the severity at all. He thinks we're all being dramatic and making it up (laughter).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He didn't experience what you did. Even if he did have memory of the time, which I think is probably protective that he doesn't, I think it's very different to watch someone you love going through something like that, than to be the person going through it. It's not necessarily any worse or better, but it's a very different experience and you have so many watching someone go through it. You often have so many more what-ifs and imagining various outcomes.</p>

<p>[44:17.6]</p>

<p>Sometimes the person who is actually recovering is so focused on day-to-day recovery that sometimes their mind doesn't go to the same what-ifs and comparisons and things like that that the people watching make. It's just a very different perspective. To feel so helpless also as the person sitting there can add to how difficult it feels.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, my mom was seeing a counselor after it happened because they said that some people suffer with PTSD symptoms after. And so she was seeing a counselor and she said it was helping, but she's fine. It was so strange because he was better and he was doing so well, and she got worse and then she would beat up on herself because he is better, why is she feeling so —</p>

<p>[45:32.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she used up a lot of her reserve being strong when he couldn't. That's pretty common. Partners tend to fall apart at different times. One is strong for the other, and she used up a lot of her reserves and then she needs some help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was an absolute disaster, and she was just like the rock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can only be the rock for so long before you need someone else to do it. And if you're anything like your mom, I'm guessing you probably are, you guys usually take on the role of being the strong one. Sometimes the strong one needs to lean on other people too. Why don't we stop there for today. We're on for next week and we'll make sure you catch the earlier train.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter). All right. Good. I will see you next Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

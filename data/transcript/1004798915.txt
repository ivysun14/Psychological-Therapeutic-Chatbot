<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where'd we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: First of all, are you available on Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I am (pause) at—I could do 11:30 or 1:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll take the 11:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, that's the 21st, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that will be our last appointment. (inaudible at 00:37) (laughter) it's just like (inaudible at 00:42) the balloons, but grip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand. You've been in limbo for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) lately I've been thinking about (pause) just what a (pause)—it feels like what happened in Mexico would do to me. And (pause) it would actually destroy me, it would. And (pause), you know, it doesn't matter if my wife is 3,000 miles away. That's something I can't bear, I just can't and I've demonstrated that. [00:01:49] And (pause) it got me wondering (pause) why I would choose to hurt myself. Never mind my wife, but hurt myself—why would I want to do that? Do I not matter? I mean, don't I deserve to be happy? Don't I deserve to be (pause) not prone to that kind of pain? Happy holidays by the way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I settled on there, you know that, yeah, I do deserve to be happy. I do deserve to (pause) live without the expectation that I will fail or that I will succumb to this destruction. I mean, this was just a couple days ago but (pause)—OK, so there are, like, three parts. That's one. The other one is, you know, wondering what it is that is keeping me here, you know. I don't necessarily think everything has a reason but I've been wonder about why I'm still here.</p>

<p>And (pause) Tuesday night, Wednesday night, there was a day where I was doing a lot of work around this person's house and (pause) ended up working on the basement, working the garage and we hadn't gotten everything done but I said, "You know, I'm kind of tapped out now." It was, like, seven o'clock. And I sat down for a minute. I said, "You know, let's take care of that refrigerator"—it was Tuesday night—"because the garbage goes out tomorrow," and I know there's a lot of stuff in there that you'd want out. And her eyes kind of lit up and, you know, so I helped her clear out most of what was in her refrigerator.</p>

<p>And then I went to my room and she came in and said, "I want to ask you something." And it was, like, already kind of strange. It was kind of (pause) I don't know, I could just sense that it was an odd question, kind of. And she said, "If you weren't married and I weren't married, would we (pause) have a crush on each other?" I thought that was just the strangest question because, I mean, she put me on the spot, you know, and she didn't offer anything up on her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What she was (inaudible at 05:14)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I was like, "I don't know, maybe. Probably, I don't know." And I felt so (pause) uncomfortable. But I didn't tell her that. I think you could probably read in me. And (pause), you know, she said, "Because this is kind of an odd situation, you know, it's awkward, you know." I'm like—I mean, "It's unusual," she says. And then I started to wonder if my being there was suddenly not such a good idea. And her husband was coming in the next day. And, you know, he and I are friends and this is, like, completely above board but I didn't know what was happening. [00:06:22] I didn't really know why she was asking this. So anyway, she did some stuff with the kids and I go in there and I'm, like, thinking, "Dear friend number two, what's going on?" (laughter) "How are you?" you know, and that kind of thing. I was trying to, like, quickly set something else up.</p>

<p>And (pause) later on she was in this other room and I came in and sat down and I said, "You know, I know I've been here for a month and I know you've been very generous with letting me stay here and I (pause)—I just wonder if I should be finding another place (pause) just because I don't want to be the guest who, although they're doing a lot around the house and trying to help out whatever they can is the one who's, like, really oblivious to the fact that it's time for them to go." [00:07:34] And she said, "Is this about what I asked you earlier?" And honestly it wasn't. But I also, I mean, it kind of was thrown in my face, I guess by myself, that this has been a long time and maybe it is time and maybe I'm just oblivious to the this being an unusual situation for her kids, for her husband, who's, you know, miles away, and for her. I don't know.</p>

<p>(pause) And (pause), you know, I said, "I don't know what the right thing to do is, but I (pause) just—I don't know how Karl feels about this—" this is her husband—"and I don't (pause)"—I'm just trying to piece it together here. [00:08:48] "I don't want to wear out my welcome. I mean, I've done things that I can help you." And she said, "You know, this summer—I don't really believe in a higher power, but this summer I asked God for just a little bit of help and I think God sent you, because you've been, whatever, you've been really helpful and you really help me out." And it's like, I don't know how she does it. I just don't know how she maintains this life of (pause) frenetic (ph) daily activities. And anyway, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this is her typical situation, where he's away this much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, he lives in another city and they see each other once a month for a week, something like that. So, she's not a single mom but she...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well she's living the life of one most of the time. [00:09:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly and so (pause) anyway, you know, (pause) earlier in the conversation she asked me if we were not married. I said, "Well, I do think we're similar," and she laughed out loud because she thinks we're nothing alike (ph). And she said to me later then, "You know, when you said you thought we were similar I laughed because I think we're completely different, but I think we are compatible." And to me the only time I use the word compatible is, like, in a romantic or relationship kind of way. And I say, "Well, yeah, it's probably true," and, again, I'm trying to keep it (pause) (inaudible at 10:53).</p>

<p>But then she's like, you know, she started to pry and she's like, you know, "I just want to make sure—it's like, you know, you and I have been going to my dad's and helping him with his thing and, you know, going around town doing all these things as if we've been doing it for years. And you—it's like, you'll be gone in a week or whatever. And what will it be? You know, I just want to know that (pause) you're my friend and I want to know that I'm your friend." And I said, "Oh, absolutely," you know, because I think it is true. We've gotten very close and it's unusual.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not just this (ph) friend. I think that's really what she was—we have our connection here. It doesn't have to be sexual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. (pause) But I still don't know (pause)—I didn't want to delve into it any further as why she asked me that, you know. [00:12:01] Anyway, so, at the same time, I saw it as kind of a test of what I would do. And (pause) on the one hand, I think I passed the test of, you know, do I trust myself to do the right thing. On the other hand, I don't (pause)—I'm not attracted to her. I mean, it's not like with you or (pause)—I'm sorry, if France calls, I have to answer it. (laughter) I'm sure you understand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. You can leave your sound—leave your sound on because if France calls, it's important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, you know, and so, I don't know (pause)—I mean, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a little bit easier because you don't have a crush on her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And (p) so that kind of matches to an extent what I was talking about earlier, as far as it destroying me, if I were to fail, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there's a—it sounds like there's still a wondering in your head, what if you were sexually attracted to her? What if you did have a crush on her? Would you be able to tolerate that and still do the right thing and honor your marriage and honor yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And would it matter to me that I'm friends with her husband, you know. Would it (pause)—I mean, I like to think certain things that I would do, but I just (inaudible at 14:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, but you don't really trust yourself fully that if those two things could coexist, that you could find someone attractive, have the opportunity, and decide not to take it because there are other things that are important to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's [the big] (ph) step.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think that'll well position me for it because this is not what it would do to my relationship or what it would do to my wife or what it would do to me, and that to me is somewhat of a revelation because I don't think I've ever (pause)—I mean, I've reminded myself just how horrible I felt, for a long time, just how (pause) unbearably, just (pause) how tortured I was. [00:15:07] And I still am to some extent, you know, and I think about that and think about what it did to Julie. And it's (pause)—why would I ever want to do that again? Rationally, I don't. Emotionally, normally I don't. When I'm under stress, I do.</p>

<p>The third thing—I've done a lot of thinking since last night. The third thing is that over these past few weeks I've just kind of occupied myself with trying to organize this woman's household, you know, different parts and fix different things and get rid of things and just kind of throw myself at that problem. [00:16:13] And (pause), you know, she didn't ask for any of this and there is a point at which I am exceeding the—what I would consider the necessary, you know, compensation for her letting me stay there. And what I've seen during this time is a similar theme or a similar pattern where I (pause) give all my time to someone else and I don't take the time for me. And, you know, it's like, without even thinking about it, I'll walk into a room and say, "Hmm, well that can be fixed and maybe I could do that," and all these things that aren't asked for but it's like I am so ready to give up my time to other people, to other things, to anything but what I'm really into. [00:17:36] Everyday. And I don't have fun. I mean, that is—[so that's fine] (ph) and I think we talked about this a little bit last week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that it's like the—it's the satisfaction of having a product? Like, the organized basement with the clean furnish (ph), and not the satisfaction of a process. Not putting value on the experience of something that's fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the fleeting thrill that comes with someone who's delighted with what you've done, you know. It is fleeting but somewhat satisfactory—me and you have talked about this. But it's not deeply meaningful to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 18:23) fades away as soon as the sparkle and the (inaudible at 18:26) gone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And she puts the mustard in the wrong place. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wrong, it is wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not in Bryce's place. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has, like, 20 mustards and it's like, my god woman, you've got—anyway. So, you know, and I started—the other night I wrote about this. Or actually I was mowing the lawn and I was, you know, thinking about this really deeply. And I thought to myself—because earlier in the day I had actually had some free time and what did I choose to fill it with? I don't remember but it wasn't for me, because I thought about stuff that I would choose to fill that time with, but nothing seemed (pause), I don't know, appealing. And so, I was mowing the lawn and I said, you know, if you had free time, if you had time for yourself, truly, there was nothing, you know, someone needed you to do or something that you saw needed to be fixed, what would you do with that time? What would you do? [00:19:37]</p>

<p>And so, I wrote down—when I finished mowing the lawn, I wrote down (pause) the things that I normally choose to do, the things that are fun, and what the difference there is. And the things that I would normally choose to do are things that produce something. Things that are fun, they can produce something but they aren't necessarily designed to do that, you know, fishing, playing guitar, crossword puzzle, you know, stuff like that. I can't remember all of it. And the things that I choose to do that are frustrating are the things like recording or songwriting or Hebrew. It's like (pause) it gets to a point—and I can't remember what I wrote but (pause) it gets to a point when (coughing) (pause) those things don't deliver and I get discouraged. [00:21:03]</p>

<p>And so, (pause) I'm trying to make sure that I actually set out to have fun. The night I went to (inaudible at 21:28) by myself and ate a restaurant and watched the new Batman—not so new Batman movie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The latest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The latest one, yes. Got halfway through and realized that I hadn't seen the previous one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 21:44) go together. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nah, you were busy getting a degree.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I know. (laughter) I was sure I'd seen it, but I have to go see that one and then this one again, so, you know. But anyway, so there is some satisfaction (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was the food? Do you remember what it tasted like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was rushed because (pause) it took a lot longer than I thought it would and so I ate some of it, put it in a to-go thing and then it's sitting in the fridge. But no, yeah, it was rushed so I didn't really get the sense to be in the moment, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you were in the clock, thinking about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The other thing is though, I've noticed—what was I watching? I was watching (inaudible at 22:38) So there are a number of movies that my wife just didn't want to see in the past year or two. And so I got a bunch of them...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now's your chance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was watching Super 8. I didn't realize it was a, like, it was so much about kids and—have you seen the movie?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I haven't. [I guess] (ph) most couples have the same dynamic. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure and there's probably good reason. But (pause) I was checking my e-mail every ten minutes or so and I was like, "You know what, I'm just not into this movie. It's just not engaging." And I've noticed other things that I'm doing where I'm not checking my e-mail and it can be like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See that's great feedback to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really is because (inaudible at 23:31)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also, just the awareness that you have that you're noticing your e-mail. I think that's probably new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is too. And just to know that—I mean, I think I've noticed myself checking my e-mail before but I haven't noticed when I wasn't checking my e-mail. So things like crossword puzzles and, you know, absorb me for a good hour and a half—didn't check it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That ups (ph) the value of it. If you notice, "Hey, like, I'm engaged enough in this process that I don't care if I miss an e-mail." That, you know, obviously goes in that column of you're actually really enjoying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, that matters (inaudible at 24:12).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's a good way for me to judge whether or not I'm enjoying something because sometimes I was like, "Well, maybe the movie will get better," and still checks (ph) my e-mail. I was like, well at what point do you just cut the cord?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well then, I think that's another piece, is giving yourself permission. If you're doing something that's supposed to be fun, that you had the intent of enjoying and you're not enjoying it, it's OK to cut out. You don't have to finish the book or you don't—it's OK to turn off the movie. It's OK to walk out of the theater. That if it's something you're supposed to be doing for fun and it's not, then you don't do it. And that's not quitting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not as though when you get done with it you feel kind of half-fulfilled because you finished it but it (ph) didn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it wasn't serving the purpose that it was meant to serve for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you've charged yourself with the task that you're doing because you want to do that task, you know, studying Hebrew might not always be fun, then there's some value in sticking to it just because. [00:25:15] But, yeah. A movie that's supposed to be an enjoyment movie that's not enjoyable...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a part of my fun time. I need to kind of recoup that and cut my losses where I can. And so, those three pretty significant things happened in the past week. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, so it's hard to be in this limbo, but it's providing you with (ph) so much time to think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And to think not in circles. I think one of the differences is that, you know, it's not like you're a stranger to thinking. That's, you know, one of your strengths. But when you feel really—when you're thinking and you're really busy, you often tend to think in circles because you don't have time really to complete the process to watch where the thoughts are going. And I think that's one of the differences with this sort of extended time that you've had. You're able to really follow the thought process where it's going and you're making these connections that you hadn't put together before. [00:26:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the one hand I'm thinking, OK do I need more structure? On the other hand, like, I'm enjoying not having a busy schedule so I can actually, you know, think about these things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (inaudible at 26:41) and that doesn't mean you have to live this way forever. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But with the benefit of this time, it certainly would be informative. (pause) Yeah so, (pause) I still think I'm following the thoughts about don't I deserve to happy. And trying to keep those thoughts alive and know that I'm still going to have crushes, I'm still going to be attractive to (pause) people that are not my wife, and that can be OK. (pause) But it doesn't have to mean that I am untrustworthy and that when push comes to shove, I will not act on that. [00:27:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And letting there be separation between what you notice—and an attraction is noticing someone—what you feel or fantasize about and what you do. Separating those things and allowing yourself to believe that you can separate them and will continue to separate them in the way that you have most of the time. I mean, most of the time you've separated what an attraction might be from what you acted on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the other thing I'm noticing here and there is just (pause) the success I've seen when I do trust my instincts, when I do trust myself. [00:28:56] And (pause) I think that's partly informed by my starting to accept myself as a normal human being who's experienced thinking emotions do have (pause), do have sway over my—I mean, as I should, over my decision-making.</p>

<p>But still, the challenge is still there for me to not (pause) consider myself a creep if I feel certain things and that my feeling something or noticing someone doesn't mean that I am doomed to—that my destiny is that that's going to be downfall. [00:30:55] That my acting on that, my (pause)—the expectation that I will have done that is going to be my destiny and that I don't have to be unhappy just because I feel certain ways or think certain things. Again, like you said, the acting on versus the thinking, there is a separation and I can be a happy person. I mean, I deserve to be happy. I can be that way (coughing) and feel certain things and not feel guilty about it. So, I don't know. That really sums it up, but (pause) that's where I am today. [00:31:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hearing you say, "I deserve to be happy," because you asked yourself that question many times—I've heard you say, you know, "Don't I?" But hearing how you actually answer it and affirming to yourself that you do deserve to be happy, to make decisions that will make you feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's kind of new. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a really important shift for, I think, what your baseline could be. Just sort of at baseline thinking, "I deserve to be happy," is such a difference from questioning whether or not you're a creep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sure is, it sure is. (pause) Yeah, and (pause) along with that flows a lot of other things, like (pause) I have earned this fellowship, you know. These things that are often discounted as being, you know, whatever. At the same time, I don't think to myself yet—but I don't know if it's imminent. I don't think (pause) I am really an important person because of these things or my identify is wrapped up in these things that I've earned. [00:33:59] I'm OK with that. You know, we've (ph) talked about that and it's something that I'm still wary of, but I think at the very least I can feel as though I did something to make those happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not to chance that there is—you have some direction and responsibility...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Influence, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...influence is a good word, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't need to feel like I'm just in constant (inaudible at 34:36) over, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your own life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah and I just have started to accept the idea that I'm still learning. I haven't figured everything out (pause) and most people haven't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, we never will have everything figured out. And you don't need to have everything all figured out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and the way I do something, there is no wrong way to do it. How I came up with this fictitious (pause) role model of impossible construction is not accurate and it's not fitting me and it's not helping me. And so I might feel somewhat self-conscious about telling people what my project is over in Paris. [00:35:44] But (pause) I don't need to. I don't need to have to figure it out. I don't even need to have it figured out when (ph) I'm there, because if I think about it realistically, it's something that I'm there to learn. I'm not there as an expert reinforcing the knowledge that I have—that's not the point. The expertise I do bring is in radio and that is the final output, but what I gather and what I educate on are the things that's the point. (pause) As soon as I ever get over there. It will happen. I deserve to be happy. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow you'll make it happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. [00:36:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've showed that you have a dotted (ph) persistent in figuring out how to make it happen thus far.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes. God, I almost had to make a long drive on Saturday, because I thought I needed those bank statements. And I said, "You know what, screw it. I'm not going to go," but then I realized yesterday I didn't really need those bank statements. I'm like, trust your instincts, you know. So, anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Save yourself really hours of a really boring drive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wish we had been taping when we started, because the sound of the things that you've just said, you know, the belief in yourself, belief in your ability to be happy, your OKness (ph) with being able to take credit is such a difference from the language that you used when you started in here. And just to hear that difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just to hear it without really, really long pauses in between, because, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It feels much more natural. [00:37:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels natural and I think also, I don't want to give it, you know, all the credit to the medication, but (pause) I couldn't get my point across and (pause) I didn't have confidence in the point I was trying to make. And I'm still kind of monitoring myself, you know, trying to make sure, OK, am I lingering too long here? Am I pushing through? Or am I getting hung up in the hiccup? That still happens sometimes, but I can swallow it and keep going.</p>

<p>So, yeah. No, I think you're right. I think it is significant change and (pause), you know, the other piece I think is still the letter to my dad, which I was—I think I've got time to do it before I leave, before Friday and before the last session. So... [00:38:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If not, your relationship with your dad, your relationship with the letter will go on beyond our sessions. So if it's something that you finish for Friday, OK. If not, then you'll [refund it] (ph) after Friday. You'll send it or share it when it's ready.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it OK if I still send it to you? OK. Great, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're welcome. (pause) Since Friday might be our last session, do you want to think a little bit about therapy in France? I know it was sort of (inaudible at 39:42). And if you do pursue it, what might you be looking for at that point? And thinking about what worked and our therapy work, what might be useful to have be different? [00:39:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I'd like to continue with reinforcing the idea that I deserve to be happy and the I am worth, I have worth, and just those messages and skills that I can use to continue to build that. And so to me, it seems like a DBT kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean, a lot of this certainly—I know you did the DBT group and we use a lot of the same types of skills in here to reinforce that. I mean, DBT is everywhere. I don't know the strength of its popularity (inaudible at 40:51) there's a huge DBT community in the area. I don't know if you'll find that where you are, I mean, it has to be a DBT practicing therapist over there.</p>

<p>But if you can't find that, somebody that does a lot of cognitive work or cognitive behavior is usually (inaudible at 41:07) themselves. You'll find a lot of overlap. I mean, my background with a lot of this goes in reinforcing (inaudible at 41:15) comes from the CBT—that's short or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—comes from that. The DBT skills use a lot of the same types of things. I mean, paying attention to the thought, noticing your thought, not necessarily following, you know, sometimes choosing the opposite action based on what you're thinking types of things. So you might find that both, you know, if you can't find it in some of the labels themselves, a DBT therapist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's going to be some (pause)—or I might could talk someone into starting one. (laughter) But yeah, I mean, right now the insurance question is still floating out there and as I look at my three month supply of—my dwindling three month supply of medication that I was able to get to the end of July, yeah, the question needs addressing sooner than later. So, part of that is, you know, again, at least continuing psychiatric, you know, care. But, I mean, just for the medication but I know GPs can also do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, especially if you have, you know, what you're on, you know, it's not the route I would recommend, but you have a cocktail that's working, so having a GP just to prescribe the same things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're saying have a GP do it as opposed to a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, I think in worse scenario I would do a GP, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In reality, primary care physicians prescribe most psychotropic meds, way more than psychiatrists prescribe. They can totally do it. But the follow-up is usually not the same, you know, just based on how their schedules run.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just experience with what works and what to do next, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 43:28) in thinking about how it impacts behavior.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think we can (inaudible at 43:44) say that Friday will be our last appointment and (pause) it's nice to have some warning (ph) for myself (inaudible at 43:55)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I appreciate it as well. New changes, just your thoughts going into it...</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to drive after this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So when you fill out an application for a Visa, you have to have a biometrics appointment, which normally is in this area, but they didn't have any appointments open Thursday, so the other location is available. They had one slot at one o'clock. And so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll make it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure I will, it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) But you're nervous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes and no. I don't know. My whole day is kind of nervous, just because I'm trying to get this allocation (ph) off today because they don't do work on Wednesdays, and so if they get it tomorrow maybe they can turn it around and send it back to me. Otherwise, if I get it on Friday or Monday (inaudible at 45:25). Well, I'm tired of talking about this. (laughter) I'm sure you're tired of hearing about it, but anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well let me stop and we'll get you onto the interstate. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some street. OK, thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very welcome. I will see you on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good luck.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you didn't have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I did.  In January I definitely did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Trying to think when I saw you the last time.  When did I see you last?  January.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	January, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So about the time I made the decision to do Weight Watchers was around that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] wedding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I'll cry.  I can't wait.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How exciting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, it is exciting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where's it going to be?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know exactly.  Yeah.  [NAME OTHER] likes to go up to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I love it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A few years ago one of the drug companies took all of our secretaries up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was a while ago, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, yeah, that's what my whole life has been for the last, since I seen you last.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Getting ready.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm a little bit like out there.  I've been very like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a good thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, how many weddings do you plan like this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This'll be it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, 1 daughter.  Right?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I know.  This is the wedding.  Yeah, I know, but it is very a lot of pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You and George Bush.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, yeah, but if I had all his money.  He don't have any pressure, what are you kidding me?  Lays back and tells people what to do.  You know, I wish I could do that.  Write a check, write a check, you know.  We can't do that.  But yeah it is, it's an awful lot of pressure.  It's getting to my daughter and it's getting to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About 200.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my gosh, okay, great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's going to be a nice big wedding.  A couple of weeks ago we had the shower.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we did all that.  But it is, it's just a lot of pressure.  One minute I'm up and the next minute I'm freaking out and getting all wired and all crazy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But getting things done?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like when you get crazy it's not like dysfunctionally crazy, it's just crazy and you do what you need to do to get whatever your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do what I have to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  Some people can get crazy or anxious or overwhelmed and then spin their wheels and not get things done versus getting stressed and then accomplishing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] get it done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, if you're worried about something and it's getting you stressed out, you take care of it and get it over with, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  No, I have to get it done.  We have to get it done with her, I have to get it done for her.  It's bad enough she's going off the wall once in a while.  I don't want her to see me, so I'm always more or less trying to hide what I feel.  To tell you the truth if I get a little bit like, you know, not feeling too good or getting a little bit overwhelmed like you say, I do that on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, that sounds like a pattern.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've always been that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I always do that.  I don't let people see anything.  You know, I sit in my room or I go to sleep or I close my eyes and take a little catnap for a couple of minutes or whatever, that's the way I've always been.  So that's what I do now too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, not sharing those feelings with her, which is really okay, you know, she's stressing out on her own.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's stressing out a lot.  I don't know.  Did I ever ask you, is it possible that she will feel some of the things that I felt?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean have depression?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, there can be genetic components to depression.  You know, there's a possibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, will she ever have like the panic attacks and stuff that I did?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's not that well known.  You know, the genetics per se.  She may not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just curious because sometimes I do see her get a little, she cries at the drop of a dime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she gets very angry 1 minute and then she like, I don't know, it's just, and I always, it's always in my head, I always remember what I, like for a long time I went through a lot of that without anything, without anybody's help or telling anybody for years and years and years because nobody knew.  I just thought something was not right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean?  So I remember when I was her age or even younger than her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But her relationship with you is pretty open.  I mean, she—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I've told her—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That if she ever has like, you know, whatever kind of feelings or she wants to tell me about it, but I still think she's the type that wouldn't tell me.  She's, once in a while she said things like I don't want to take pills.  Like she acts like I'm a pill freak or something.  The thing I take you don't even know I would take it.  Like nobody knows unless I tell.  I said, "It's not like I'm, you know, taking whatever, valium or being stupid kind of pills or whatever."  I said, "It's not that."  First thing out of her mouth is, "How you taking pills, mom?"  And I'm like, [NAME OTHER], it's nothing like that.  It's just like if you do ever feel like anxious or overwhelmed.  Like I said when I was her age or younger for years I got feelings like that.  But I didn't know what it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think she would probably be more likely to share it with you than your experience with your mother.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, that would be, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, so I mean I guess kids tend to, I mean, if you think of depression as being learned and not genetic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, you know, she may be modeling after you versus reacting against your style in a sense.  So, you know, she may be more likely to say something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think depression is learned.  I think there's more of a biological component, that people can be predisposed.  Whether she actually experiences depressive symptoms is hard to predict.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because sometimes she's very, she gets like me too in a way when she gets like very, not angry, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hyper.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like, oh my god, and it scares me.  Like I'll look at her and I'll think, my god, she's just like me.  And then just like I said, I always remember the times where I sat in the corner in my bedroom when I was her age, of course I didn't have anybody to talk to, didn't tell people how I felt, and the panic attacks coming daily.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The other thing is that those panic attacks limited you for so long when they weren't treated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, because I never knew what they were.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not driving like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, never.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it limited your life, you know, quite a bit.  But [NAME OTHER] drives right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] drives but she's very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She has a license?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But and last time, I'll tell you truth, when I'm driving with her, I'm scared because she'll, she start, if something's not right or we get lost—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She gets very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only if you get lost.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lost and if she's just got a lot on her mind or something like she'll constantly say, "I don't know why I'm driving.  I shouldn't be driving.  I shouldn't be driving.  I don't like to drive."  Or she'll just get—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I guess, I mean, you don't like to drive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I won't drive because I'm afraid to drive because of the way I feel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think, you know, her experience is that that level of anxiety, the intensity of anxiety is not there because she's driving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She got the license.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, yeah, that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so, if she's, and you had these symptoms for so long that it really did shape a lot of, you know, your decisions when you were younger.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She hasn't had it in that same intensity or else her life would be much more limited.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.  Yeah, I do think [INAUDIBLE] she went out and got her license and all that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was thrilled to death like inside of me saying, "Oh my god, then she won't be like me."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She isn't.  Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's definitely not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's going to drive and that's what I always wanted to do but I never did it, but she's going to do it, so that means she's better than me.  That's what I would think in my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Better or different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you do tend to put things better.  You know, better or worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and there's a lot of differences, like—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always still say better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But when you see her having a reaction like you, your first response is you're afraid that she'd be like you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want her to feel like I feel, like I felt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  To be like you though may not be the worst thing in the world.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you know what I'm saying, because you have a lot of positive qualities.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are not one that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's like me in them too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, as long as you see the good things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I do, but it's when I see them little spurts coming out of her sometimes I think of me, and I think, "Oh my god, I wonder if she's going to feel like feel or is she going to get sick like me," because I always feel like I was sick [INAUDIBLE] panic attacks.  They were the worst things I ever had.  And I always get so nervous about them.  And then I always think is she going to have 1of them maybe when she's driving 1 night or is she going to have 1 of them when, you know, whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what?  If she does, she'll probably know what it is and she'll have you there to be able to say this is what you do about it.  So if she does, half the battle is done because when you had them you couldn't share and your mom didn't really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing, I'd just sit in the bedroom until they passed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Walk up and down the bed, no, nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She wasn't really into that with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, hum—um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's been attuned to it but she's in her own world in Florida, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you know, it's, it's a different kind of a relationship you have with your daughter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In many respects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm hoping that, like I used to try to tell, and then plus too I always think she has [NAME OTHER], and believe it or not them 2 have a kind of a relationship where they really do more or less I think tell each other everything.  Like he knows so much about her.  But I still don't think he would quite understand it if she had to say something because every once in a while now he'll kid around because she's been, she's very stressed out with her job and everything too, and like he'll turn around to me and he'll say, "Why don't you take her with you, wherever you go," because he thinks, I don't know what he thinks, when I come here to you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I guess he thinks, you know what I'm saying?  Maybe she needs to talk to somebody, and I'm like, "Well, maybe she can come to me, or maybe she can come with me one day if she wants to."  You know, if she wants to, but the way he says it sometimes, I don't know if he's trying to be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like he's just frustrated and not know what to say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he doesn't know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He can't change it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I've been through either.  He doesn't know certain things.  And he thinks I think just because I'm at [DEIDENTIFIED], [PATIENT NAME] comes up to [DEIDENTIFIED], oh why don't you take [NAME OTHER] with you because she's losing her mind or something like that.  That's what he talks like, joke around say something like that.  And I'll say, "It's not that simple."  I said, "I don't know what you think I do when I go up there, but I just sit and I talk."  "Well, maybe she could go with you."  "Maybe she can someday."  I said, "That's up to [NAME OTHER].  If [NAME OTHER] wants to ask me to do that for her someday, I'll take her with me."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I'm hoping if she would come to me first before him because he's just a guy and guys are [INAUDIBLE].  You know what I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But you know what I mean, but he's just a guy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would just push it under the rug and go, "Oh, come on, take a nap or something."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think the difference is, is that you've experienced the panic and your daughter knows that.  He hasn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you would have a degree of understanding from your own personal experience.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And I just don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Plus you're her mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just don't think guys, they think they if you're taking a pill every day or you're coming up to see that there's something, "Oh, god, she must be something crazy or something."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would just say it's not a guy thing per se.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's individuals that haven't been exposed to it or experienced it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Man or woman, whatever.  The other thing is he might feel frustrated he doesn't know what to do to change it for her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of course he does because he sees her getting upset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so he can't make her feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Other than just listen or understand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And that's, you know, of course, like I said, and everybody says around the time of your wedding it is the most stressful thing and she's going through a very stressful time with work.  And then having this on top of it, and then you've got worry with the money, where the money's going, blah, blah, blah.  And it is, it's like bam, I just got laid off.  When I was up here the last time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, because he just got laid off 2 weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think you told me that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he's not gotten a job yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's still—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My daughter, I can see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is he like on severance?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he's got a severance and he's got unemployment, but those will only last I think until September.  And he has been to like 1 or 2 interviews and he's going to go take the Philadelphia police test.  And, uh, which my daughter was very unhappy about, but I think the fact too that he's just been sitting around, you know what I mean, you know how it gets to, and I think it's just eating at her too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she's holding everything in because she's afraid if she explodes them 2 will fight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, sounds like the wedding needs to happen first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I would just say see how things are [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, that's what I keep saying.  I keep saying after the wedding things will get back to normal.  After the wedding things will get back to normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he may end up [INAUDIBLE] doing the same thing, like it may be tough to like apply for a job and then go on a honeymoon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but most of the times, he's been to a couple and he's told them, that's the first thing he tells them before he goes I do have to go, I'm getting married and I do got, you know, and they all have agreed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They all have said no problem, people get married, people do this stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, accepting.  So now, like right now we're waiting on another 1 now probably within a week and see if he gets it, then he's taking a test next week for that other.  You know, but I think, I just worry about her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE] I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, I think you're going to worry about anything.  You know, I think you worry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?  No, not me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it makes sense that you'd be worried about her.  But, you know, I guess, and that's what I was telling you about, you have to kind of, when you worry about something about her being like you, you have to remember that being like you is not a horrible thing.  If she has symptoms she has you there.  And that she has good qualities too that are a part of you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's bright.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, a lot brighter than I ever was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, but she's in tune to those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm hoping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's got a lot of things on her side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean?  A lot of stuff [INAUDIBLE] and hopefully that reassures you so you don't like go down your pathway of thinking all the worst things, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Imagining the worst.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't imagine the worst but I still, it's just something that always goes through my head, every time I see her in a bad mood or every time I see her cry.  That's the first thing that comes into my mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But crying doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't cry now if I wanted to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a natural feeling, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I used to cry at everything.  I can't, I don't cry at nothing, I can't cry at nothing anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wait until the wedding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm saying.  Everybody says that, but really I don't, I don't know, I just, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about the other end of your life, has [NAME OTHER] contacted you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I think everything's fine.  I don't know where he's at, when he's coming home.  I don't know if he's dead or alive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely none, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's the way I want it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I still do this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every time I hear somebody in my work or something go, "[PATIENT NAME], somebody's here to see you," or something, I just die.  I just die.  My hands get like this.  I get all, but so far, so good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's a big part of everything that's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and I've just been working every day and just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still the [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That's what I do.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just not, I'm just not interested, you know, like my daughter wants me to, you know, get interested in maybe some guy or whatever.  Truthfully, deep down in my heart I just don't want that right now.  I don't want, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], new guy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he just killed it for me right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm afraid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I am.  I'm literally afraid.  Anybody ever talks to me, everybody, any guy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You've told me about some of the people that would come into the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wasn't there—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had 1 a couple week, there was 1—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wasn't there a police officer that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was a police officer I still see.  I talk to him.  And there's this other guy that once in a while he asks if he can drive me home, and I said yeah because he lived right around the corner so I said yeah.  We were friends.  And then he started getting a little bit, I could see that he wanted, and 1 day he like 2 nights in a row he was outside of work taking me.  And the last time, well, just about a couple weeks ago, I went up to him and I said, "Please, you know, I will take the bus home."  I said, "I don't go for this, I don't want this.  I don't want no ride.  I don't need people taking me home.  I don't need you doing this now."  I don't want it right now in my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Okay.  How'd he react?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, he was nice about it.  He said, "No, no, you know, I can still take you home," and I said no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was going there specifically to take you home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  And then once he took me home 1 time and then he'd be out there a couple days later and he'd be out there more.  And, no, I don't like that.  I feel like, no, I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wasn't like he was asking you out on a date, it was just he would be outside—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, he asked me and I told him no.  I told him about my daughter's wedding and I used that as an excuse I didn't want to get involved, blah, blah, blah, and all this shit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you like him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Well, I mean, as a friend.  But see, that's all I seen him as.  He just sort of, I didn't like it.  So I was like no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But was it no because he was just a guy or was it no because he was whoever he was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I think it was no because he was a guy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I keep thinking I don't want that in my life right now.  I don't want to be answered to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's your choice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And it's like eww.  I just don't want to be bothered with it.  I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, you know, again, it's 1 thing to say you don't want to be bothered, it's another thing to be afraid of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I have, I honestly have to say couple times when he took me home like he took me home if his car went a little bit too fast I was shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was like this isn't normal.  I shouldn't be like this.  And then I was, I was scared.  I was like looking at him thinking I don't know this guy really.  And for all I know he could be whatever.  And I'm in the car.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could be a prisoner.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, I think when you're coming out of a relationship like you had it was so difficult, you know, to end.  No wonder you'd be questioning your choice, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like looking more closely at whatever choices you might make, you know.  I think that's natural.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and not wanting to fall in that same pattern.  But, you know, again I guess it's, a part of it is just being able to have those experiences to know who you can trust and who you can't.  And right now it sounds like any guy, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.  It's like I said, when I was going home, like the first couple times or something in the car I'm thinking this isn't normal because every time the car went a little bit too fast, I was thinking where's he going?  Why is he going fast?  Or if it didn't look like he was going straight to my house, like he went a different way than I know which way to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you were also being very sensitive to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I would get very—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He was going too fast in the relationship too in a sense.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I was getting like where's he going, why's he going this way, why didn't he turn that way?  Like stupid stuff in my head.  And I'm thinking [INAUDIBLE].  Years ago I would have never, I would have thought who cares.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were extra sensitive to what he was doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And everything he did, it was just, it was unbelievable.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you'll know when it's the right time.  And I think the thing you have to kind of keep in mind is when it is the right time that you have to kind of recognize that whoever you're going to be getting to know, 1, you have to get to know them, you have to get time to get to know them, and invariably he's going to be different than the last.  Nobody's going to be exactly like him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I know.  I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean?  So you have to kind of, whoever you end up meeting, give yourself the time to get to know them to give them the credit that they're going to be different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In all likelihood they'd be better, there's the potential they could be worse.  [INAUDIBLE].  There's always that potential.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But the probability is that they'll probably have a lot better qualities in some respects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The fact that you'll be more sensitive to getting to know them, you'll know faster.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll know.  Hopefully.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, instead of falling into, you know, a pattern and then having to regret it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, you know, your being more scrutinous of the relationship will help.  But right now it sounds like it's just, it's pushing people away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just don't want, no, I just, I just, I'm alone a lot and that's the way I like it right now.  I don't know if that will ever change, but that's the way I prefer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's the way it is right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I go to work and I do what I have to do at work and I see the girls and [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Blah, blah, blah, and do all that.  But now I don't need to go out and I don't have to do all this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not unhappy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I am.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I think that's normal.  Sometimes I'm even regretting the house thing.  Maybe I shouldn't have done it, maybe I should have bought my own house, maybe I should have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you've mean living with them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Not that they're bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you have your own space there, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I know, but it's still not mine.  It's not mine.  It's not mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like I can go out and buy the paint and paint the living room the color I want to or hang curtains the way I want to hang them.  It's not like I can do that because it's not my house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're living there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's your home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's still not my home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't feel like that.  My daughter says it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But sometimes I even feel like they don't make it, make me feel like it's my home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have your own room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have my own room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you can do anything in there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anything in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I have my own little TV and, you know, my little dog and, you know, whatever.  And but sometimes I feel really left out and I feel like why did I do this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I shouldn't feel that way.  I mean, come on.  She's got a husband.  A husband's going to be coming, that's the way it's supposed to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, I think part of you is feeling happy being by yourself in a sense, part of you is not, is feeling distance too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At some point I think you'll make some choices and decisions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think the way you were talking about it before is that, you know, it will be, the family will change, I mean, once she has her first child.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then the dynamics will change.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You'll be there to help out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you'll have the opportunity to be there.  You know what I mean?  Which has its good, its pluses and minuses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just that's the way it is, and it'll be different when that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It ain't bad if you sat sown with your daughter and you really wanted a certain kind of curtains in the living room.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, most of the time like she will ask me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like for my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can't imagine she wouldn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she'll say, "Mom, what do you think," or something like that.  And I'll say, and it usually ends up whatever I say ends up going, most of the time, but she always, [NAME OTHER] has to come in and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, right.  You know, but sometimes it just makes it, I don't know, I just sit and I think I don't know what I did.  Maybe I shouldn't have done this.  Maybe I should have done it.  Maybe I should have went on my own and stayed by myself and did, you know, this way I'd have my own, my own to look after.  My own home or my own whatever.  I still don't feel like even when I walk in there at nighttime it's not mine.  It's my room.  But it's not my home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you were the 1 that helped support so they could buy it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean, it was your [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was my suggestion.  It's what I wanted to do at the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But like you said, maybe things will change, like it has been very, the last, this wedding planning and getting money and stuff like that has been very hard.  Maybe after the wedding, I even say to myself, "You know, hopefully we'll, things have to go back to normal."  Which they're not normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twenty years from now, who knows, 10 years out, they might want, and you might want to decide to make things different then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's just the way that it is now, and I don't think you made a wrong decision, you know, to be with them, you know, and to help them out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but how come sometimes I always get to feeling, you always get the feeling that you're not wanted?  And I don't, I think that's, it's me though, it's not my daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think it's the way I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's exactly what I was saying about how you look at things as better and not better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And I always feel like I'm in the way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I shouldn't do that.  I know I shouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the way, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why am I here—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a constant with me.  It's a constant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  It's how you look at your self esteem, that everything has to be a negative.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, but it never gets any better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's why I'm pointing out to you that, you know, I think you made a reasonable decision to be where you are.  I mean, you're in a neighborhood that's different than the neighborhoods you've been in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's close by work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did that for her.  I wanted her to have a nice fresh start.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that doesn't mean it was good for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know what I'm saying?  It was good for her but maybe it wasn't good, the right decision for me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you can't change that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't, I can't change nothing now.  It's all done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But things can change in the future.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like I keep saying, maybe after the wedding and everything goes back to normal, like we're not counting every penny, we're not worrying about who's this and who's that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We're not worrying about [NAME OTHER] going to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But then, yeah, the next thing after that will be, you know, what it'll be like when—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Baby comes or something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, shush.  I'm trying not to go that far.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when you think about it you've got to think about the positive excitement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  I never think about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  Get through the wedding first.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't get this, all my life it's, and again I don't know, sometimes it gets worse instead of better.  That's all I do.  And then sometimes I think I spend too much time alone because I've got too much time to think.  And so when you're alone you think a bit, and I think of this and I think of that, and I think of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when you're alone and you think, you think about all the negatives.  You don't think about the positives.  That's the problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	True.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't balance out the negatives with positives or vice versa.  You know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's part of the problem when you're alone is your mind just goes all the negative pathways as opposed to, you know, where things really are.  You know, you think about the worst parts of yourself as opposed to the positive things, the good things.  Right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hardest thing for you to get is a compliment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can handle the criticisms but you can't handle a compliment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Am I right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm right, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's horrible.  I don't understand where that came from.  I don't understand.  And then sometimes I think as I get older it gets worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep the Zoloft the same.  Okay.  Want to set up another visit?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Three months?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's going to be like July or August, August I guess.  It's like around [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where are they going for their honeymoon?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mexico.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ten days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ten glorious days.  I can't wait for her because I know she needs it so bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you'll have 10 days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'll have 10 days, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In your own home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, I know, I know.  I thought of that too.  But I really want her to go and, like I keep telling her, "[NAME OTHER], when you get there, please just rest."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And while they're away you'll be able to do the same?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Recover from the wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Same time, 3:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We were scheduled for 4:00.  We were scheduled for 4:00 today though but we'll put 3:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Put 3:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So 3:30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If anything changes, I'll let you know.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'll call you when I get there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like a plan.  Okay.  Very good.  I'll turn this off.  Thank you for this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.</p>

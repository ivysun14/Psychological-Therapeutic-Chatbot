<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I guess what I was thinking about last night was I don't know if there's a relationship — I've been having these weird dreams. I had one last night actually too, where I was being tested for drugs or something and tested positive for TCH. But I was at home and the papers, I had to hide them, because my mom and my dad, who were both at home — which is weird — was going to see them or something. So I tried flushing them down the toilet. It was just this very weird thing of having to hide something. I think I just realized I've had these kinds of dreams for a very long time.</p>

<p>[00:58.4]</p>

<p>I remember this one dream I had. I was like 10. This was when we still lived in Mexico, and I had bars on the windows to keep people from coming in, not to keep me from going out. And I had a dream that someone removed one of the bars and snuck in. Then my mom came to check on me before I went to sleep, and so I was hiding this person under the blankets.</p>

<p>There's always some element of hiding stuff. I know that I tend to hide stuff, but it seems it's so extreme. Like I still remember that dream from more than 15 years ago, you know what I mean? So I relive the feeling of like, it was almost like guilt, lasting for like weeks over having had this dream. Last night's was similar, obviously not that extreme, but it was similar in that I felt much more guilty than I should have. Like, okay, paperwork. They're not going to pat me down, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[02:10.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would their reaction be to finding out that you tested positive?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be very very negative. I mean, for my parents I think it's like a cultural thing. Whereas whenever my mom sees people on TV — because she watches a lot of TV, so she watches the Dr. Phil show or whatever — whenever she sees recovering alcoholics or drug addicts or whatever, she's like "Why are they clapping for them? They were drug addicts." I'm like "Well, they're recovering. They're not doing it anymore." She's like "I don't understand. Why would you clap for someone who does it?" So it's very negative. I mean, I did use to smoke weed a while ago. I don't know, like in college and a few months ago a couple of times, but not like every day and I haven't done it recently. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[03:02.9]</p>

<p>So I don't really — I don't know. It's almost — I don't know. It's very very guilty, though. I remember I used to have these all the time, and I still kind of do sometimes. And I think maybe the reason I had it is because I've been thinking about how I don't really put myself out there in terms of flirting or anything like that. And so I was like "Okay, I'm going to try to flirt. It doesn't mean anything has to come from it, but I should know how. (chuckles)</p>

<p>I just had this guilty feeling, almost like the same pit of my stomach sort of, like I'm doing something wrong. Almost as if — I don't know. I see Julia and she has a really great relationship and I'm like "That would be cool." And it doesn't seem wrong, but it feels wrong. I mean, I don't think it's wrong obviously. But it feels wrong. Does that make any sense?</p>

<p>[04:07.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The relationship piece or the flirting piece?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of it. I just feel like it's something I would have to hide or something. Like I know my feelings and what I'm thinking about it are two very different things. It's like I feel like it's wrong, and I have this viscerally negative reaction to being in a relationship or thinking about being in a relationship or something. Or feeling like I have to hide it or something like that. But I know that's not —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, that's interesting because I think last time you brought up your ideas about what would happen in a relationship, like might you live with someone before you got married? Might you have sex with someone before you got married? Your ideas about what would happen in a relationship are very different than what your parents would consider acceptable. You know, you've expressed the idea that your parents would be happy for you to be married and have children. But the idea of how to get to that place is a very different idea.</p>

<p>[05:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that's part of what makes it feel so wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. But I have a lot of other things that I disagree with them about that I don't feel guilty about. Like college or whatever. I don't have an ounce of guilt for that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder what the conflict is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think this one dream about hiding this boy under my blankets when I was younger I think was related, because at the time I had this crush on this kid. I was going to school in Mexico and was in fourth grade or something. This is so stupid to be talking about something a long time ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the feelings though are the same. I think it's not really the content that's important. What makes it not stupid is that you're carrying around the same feelings.</p>

<p>[05:55.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I think I may have told you about this. In the fourth grade I had a crush on this guy, this little boy, and he was really cute or whatever and I wrote him a letter saying "Oh, I like you. Will you be my boyfriend?" or something like that. Something I would never do now. (chuckles) And my dad found it apparently and gave it to my mom. My mom, I remember very clearly, she hit me a couple of times but I remember this one very clearly because she slapped me in the face. She never hit me in the face before. I think this was the only time. I mean, she slapped me a couple of times but not really. And I remember her ring hit me and everything. I was very — I remember and I still feel like "Oh my God, that was bad, that was bad."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The writing to the boy was bad or the being hit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's why — no, no, no, the being hit was bad. Like it made me feel really bad. Usually I got spanked, or I got the belt or something on my bottom where it wouldn't really hurt. It would just be more like the feeling of "Oh my God, my mom hit me."</p>

<p>[07:06.7]</p>

<p>But this one actually hurt, and I was hurt by it almost. And I remember after that I didn't like this boy anymore. I was like "I'm done. I can't do anything to do with" — I think that sort of stayed with me through junior high and high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what was it that you were being punished for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For writing the letter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but what was bad about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. I wasn't supposed to do that, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because. That was a stupid answer. (chuckles) I think it was like too forward or something, and that's not what proper girls do. Almost like proto-slutty or something, I guess. So my mom was furious. Like she was very angry, and I think my dad was too. I don't know. He never really corrected me ever.</p>

<p>[08:14.1]</p>

<p>So I think it was "This is not what proper girls do" or something. Like you have to be — it was about being proper or like "This isn't how you go about things."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would have been the okay way to let that boy know you liked him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, you don't. You wait for him to let you know, I think. I mean, that's the way — I'm assuming, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think — this is really enlightening, because you knew that you were supposed to feel badly. You were shamed by your mom's reaction, by being hit, but you weren't sure really. Even today, you're still guessing what was it actually that was so bad. You got the idea that you were bad. I wonder if that's part of what you're carrying around, because there wasn't a clear message about what behavior was it that was so horrible. Okay, so you weren't supposed to write letters to boys, but I think you got the message that you were bad.</p>

<p>[09:11.8]</p>

<p>It wasn't so much just the writing the letter, but there's this sort of ambiguous shame that was induced by their reaction that you're still carrying around. Because it wasn't really specific, because no one said "This is who it's okay to like" or "This is how you let someone know you like them" or "This is how you act when it's time to date." Because you didn't really get any clear messages about that. It seems like it has just sort of morphed into anything having to do with relationships, and you've been carrying it for a really long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe part of that is that I don't quite remember exactly what she was yelling at me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you remember being yelled at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's what came through, that she was really ashamed of you and you felt that too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I mean, even when my mom is visiting here, she sort of has this — she was sort of like "Don't neglect other parts of your life." (chuckles)</p>

<p>[10:16.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is kind of a mixed message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know if I ever did have a relationship or something, I have no idea how to think about telling her. That sort of communication to me is like the tundra, like I don't want to go there. Or, I don't know. It's just unpaved territory, like I haven't been there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any idea of what she would consider to be appropriate for you now? I mean, she's kind of giving you permission, this other part of your life, this probably romantic life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. No, she was very explicit about it. (chuckles) Yeah, I think now that I'm grown —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a difference between fourth grade and graduating from grad school.</p>

<p>[11:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I think she's more open to it, especially because you know how I told you I was sort of treading the water or whatever, like "Oh, so-and-so is sleeping over at her boyfriend's house." Sort of dropping those things in. I think she realizes that things are different. I mean, she might not agree with them, but I don't think she would hate me for it or something. She would probably let me know that she wouldn't do it that way. But, yeah, I don't know that she would have as severe a reaction. Like if this were at home, I don't think that — I think it would be very different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things are different here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. I mean, she understands that things are different culturally and stuff. I think at a certain point, she must realize on some level that I'm sort of split between the two.</p>

<p>[12:09.3]</p>

<p>But she definitely sometimes makes absolute claims where "This is your culture, and you're not allowed to be in another culture" sort of thing. Or "This is how you were raised." But anyway, I think she might understand, but I think she would have a rough time with it if — I don't know. It's like very stressful for me to think about. This is where the splitting is helpful. (laughter) It's all so secretive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and it sounds like carrying this secret doesn't feel that good. This idea that you have to hide things, whether that comes out in a dream in hiding papers or a dream in hiding a person or a dream in hiding something else. This theme that it doesn't feel that good to have to hide stuff.</p>

<p>[13:01.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even just yesterday, I talked to her for like two hours. I was in a car accident last weekend or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was fine. But it was complicated and ambiguous because it happened at a traffic circle, and of course the ridiculous driving laws. (laughter) And so I hadn't told her. I did call my brother for some advice for dealing with insurance companies and whatever. I called my mom, and she was talking about my little brother driving and how he almost — because he's just learning to drive. He's getting his license in February or something. No, he has his license. Oh my God, he has his license.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [I guess February was rough].</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) And so she's letting him drive sometimes, and they almost got into an accident. My mom was like hysterical. She is the worst person to try to teach anyone to drive, of all time. But she knows it, so it's okay. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[13:59.2]</p>

<p>So she was telling me about this almost-accident and I was like "Well, you know" — I wasn't going to tell her, but then I was like "Well, I got in a car accident a few weeks ago." (chuckles) And she goes "AHHHHHH", like is frustrated. But even just telling her that — like, I wasn't going to tell her that just because — I don't know. Is that weird to keep (inaudible at 14:22.2)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why did you feel like you wanted to hide it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I guess because I feel like she would disapprove or think that I'm a bad driver, but it wasn't my fault. So I was like, maybe if I just let her know that it wasn't my fault, she'll be okay with it. I don't know. Maybe I'm still having issues sharing stuff with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you didn't want to be judged.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you were afraid that she would judge you either as a bad driver or irresponsible. And it's interesting the reaction you got was one of frustration. Clearly she knew you were okay. You were talking to her. But it wasn't one of concern at first. I mean, maybe that came later, I don't know.</p>

<p>[15:07.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean she asked me where I was hit or if it was really bad or whatever. I explained I was in a traffic circle, so we were going 20 or 30 miles an hour, so it wasn't on the highway or anything. But I sort of expected to feel some sort of relief, because I had been sort of thinking about this over and over, like "I really should tell my mom. I really should tell my mom." (chuckles) But I guess I — I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you had this one sense that there was an obligation — you know, I heard the "should" — that this was something that you were supposed to tell her, and yet you really didn't want to. I mean, that's exactly how you get guilt-induced because you felt these two competing things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So maybe in terms of — I don't know. I mean, do you think all this is related? Because it feels like it is to me, but I'm not quite —</p>

<p>[16:07.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think that it's all related because it's the things that are in conflict for you. It's the idea of the messages you get about what people are expecting of you. You know, whether that be your mom expecting a certain thing in relationships, or sort of a societal idea that there are certain types of information that you share with your parents. Your own sense of you want your mom to think of you in a certain way. You want to be really close, and there are certain things that are going to get in the way of that, either because she approves or disapproves or because it's going to create some conflict. So I think it all goes back to figuring out what makes sense for you, and allowing what you want to guide some of these decisions, rather than kind of a general message of what society kind of expects is appropriate or what they want.</p>

<p>[17:06.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's interesting because I never feel like I'm not doing what I want, do you know what I mean? Like I'm so far away, of course I can do what I want, but insofar as "Oh, I went out of town by myself yesterday for fun."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But the what you want in terms of what you share, so it's maybe a less obvious doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. But maybe that's what I was —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you tell your mom that you went out of town by yourself? What would she think about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did. She of course disapproved. She was like "I can't believe you're going alone." (chuckles) I was like "It's a 2 hour drive." Because before it really was about very obvious things, like where to go, what to do. So maybe that's changing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But now she's got less oversight on that stuff, but you still carry around with you, even as you're doing that, you're aware "My mom wouldn't like this decision."</p>

<p>[18:09.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But is there a way to be okay with that? Because I wouldn't change some of the things that I know she wouldn't be okay with. Like I don't regret smoking weed a couple of times a few months ago or in college. I just don't think there's anything wrong with it. But I know she wouldn't. Of course I'm not going to share that with her. But that still makes me feel guilty which is why I stopped, because I'm just not going to be guilty all of the time. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The big question is how do you let go of the guilt when your decisions conflict with what she would want you to decide?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I don't know. I just don't want to have these dreams anymore. (chuckles) It's really stressful. Yeah, that makes sense. Especially because I've always, maybe before or like in college, I've always been like — maybe because my energy has been focused on sort of doing what I want that I haven't really had a chance to deal with the results.</p>

<p>[19:18.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You've had to work so hard to do what you want, because there's so much to fight against, that it sounds like the next piece of being okay with doing what you want hasn't really settled in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. How does that happen? (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, how much do you believe that it is okay to do what you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, certain things I don't. Like smoking weed for example. Okay, it's illegal so okay, I can deal with not doing that because I don't really care that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're okay with giving it up, but that's not that big of a concession to you to do what she would want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Because I'm not that invested.</p>

<p>[20:09.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But the idea — maybe you're not that invested, but maybe you'd like to do that recreationally once in a while and not feel guilty about it. So how do you get okay with doing something that she would disapprove of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) I really don't know. Maybe I can't. Maybe I can. Because then that sort of translates to ["I can go flirt."]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So for some things, it's almost more important. Like do you really need to feel that okay about smoking weed? It sounds like it's not that important to you, so maybe not. Do you need to feel okay about being able to start a relationship with someone? That's probably going to be important at some point, you know? Maybe it's not that important right now, because I don't know if there's somebody in particular you'd like to be with. But when there is, which most likely at some point there's going to be, it's going to be really important.</p>

<p>[21:04.7]</p>

<p>So you're kind of figuring out and it's just this idea of letting go. What would it feel like to let go of your desire to please her over pleasing yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think I sort of know a little bit maybe what that would feel like, just because I have been so invested in my relationship with my dad before. I told you about that one conversation I had with her where I was like "I'm not going to spend all this energy talking about what he's thinking or trying to decipher what sort of language he's trying to speak to me." And I meant it. I just wasn't invested in it. I actually feel more, I don't know, a little bit freer. Like I can really sort of section this portion of my life out and sort of put it away until further notice without it eating at me or something, you know?</p>

<p>[22:07.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So do you know what it was that sort of tipped that over for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Maybe like telling them that I didn't — at least letting it be known that I didn't want him here. So that they almost know the status of where I am with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were able to be really honest with them about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then that conversation I had with my mom was very helpful too, because I was finally able to tell her, and she wasn't like crying over me not having a relationship with my dad like she had with hers. And so maybe something like that, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So with regard to a relationship, what would you need to be honest with your mom about, do you think? What would sort of be the equivalent?</p>

<p>[23:05.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my God, I don't know. (chuckles) She probably doesn't even remember that this happened so long ago. And she has almost very closed-minded opinions about dating, just because she never told me this until a year or two ago, and she hasn't told anybody else in the family. She actually got pregnant before they were married, and so they got married because she was pregnant.</p>

<p>I think the way that manifests is that she doesn't want that to happen to me. And so I think that's why there were always these restrictions on dating, and I guess it makes sense. But I feel like you just can't restrict someone from doing that all of the time. (chuckles)</p>

<p>[24:00.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to be allowed to date at some point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But I also don't know any different. So maybe, I mean, I don't know. I don't know. That will be a hard conversation to have either way. (chuckles) Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your hopes about dating? What do you envision for yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope to date eventually. (laughter) I don't know. I want to date people, like date various people or whatever, but have that be separate from a relationship. Like obviously not (inaudible at 24:41.6). (chuckles) Just because, I don't know, I feel like I had that one bad relationship in college, but I'm really inexperienced in terms of dating, and I want to sort of be better. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, get a little practice.</p>

<p>[25:02.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I also, I don't know. Like I'm starting to think long-term and I feel so old. Like I'm thinking "Oh my God, I want to have a family eventually." I mean, I can't believe I'm thinking about this. I'm 24, and I can't believe I'm 24. So yeah, I don't know. It feels like time is important to me now, especially since I'm going to be in school forever.</p>

<p>Because usually I was just like "I'll date after I graduate. I'll date after I finish my master's. I don't have time to date." I really didn't have time to date. (chuckles) It's always been later, and I'm going to be in school until I'm 42. I mean, like almost literally. (chuckles) So I have to sort of find a way to integrate it if it's important to me. So yeah, I don't know. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>[26:01.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does, except my math is telling me that med school is taking you 18 years.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) No, no. I mean, it's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I know there's some pre-med stuff to do first.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seven years for like training, but then there's like a very long residency, depending on what you want to do. I did the math and I was like, if I wanted to do a Ph.D. or something at some point, I would be like —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your [merits] are adding on, M.D., Ph.D.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know, maybe. (laughter) I can't really let go of the Ph.D. So I'm still trying to figure stuff out, but like potentially I'm going to be in school for a very long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever the years are, long enough that you can't put off dating necessarily until you're totally done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is this imaginary timeline you have in your head for, you said family and —</p>

<p>[26:54.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I don't want to be in my late 30s and have children, just because I like that my mom was younger, and she was able to do stuff with me like go to the beach. I don't know. I mean, I would rather be a younger parent than an older parent, but at the same time, I don't know. As long as they're healthy, I don't care.</p>

<p>So, yeah, maybe it doesn't help that — this isn't natural for me to think about these things, but Julia always talks about wanting kids and what we're going to name them. (chuckles) It started out as kind of a joke, but it's almost not. It's funny how things start out as a joke, and then they're not. Like even just thinking about med school, I was like "Ha ha, wouldn't it be funny if I were a doctor?" Maybe it's a way of trying on stuff for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of a non-threatening — you don't have to commit to it yet.</p>

<p>[27:51.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. But yeah, I don't know. (pause) I guess I don't want to — like I went out to a bar recently for a game or whatever, and there was this boy there and I wanted to flirt with him. I tried and then I just couldn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does that mean, that you tried to flirt and couldn't? If I were a fly on the wall, what would I have seen that night?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I was like being nice to him or whatever, but then making eye contact at a certain point became difficult, which is problematic. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What made it difficult?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I felt embarrassed. I don't know. Is that normal?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Well then maybe I should just try harder?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what's the difference between flirting and being friendly?</p>

<p>[28:56.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being really friendly. (laughter) [In a degree].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What if you didn't call it flirting in your head? I'm wondering if part of labeling it as flirting is what makes you uncomfortable. Because the whole point of dating and getting someone's attention and giving them signals that you're interested, that's all you're trying to do. Getting to know somebody and if you feel attracted to them, to let them know that you're interested, which isn't so different than being friendly. You are a friendly person and that feels much more comfortable for you, rather than this pressure of flirting and dating. It almost puts too much pressure on what could be a little bit easier interaction for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually. Yeah, there is this horror of like — (chuckles). I mean, now that I haven't done it in such a long time — it's almost like, I used to be a really good debater in high school and I competed and stuff. Now the thought of it horrifies me.</p>

<p>[30:04.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think we can make it really complicated, and there's a gazillion books and a gazillion advice columns about flirting, and there's all these rules about how long you should make eye contact and is there a specific way you should flip your hair and blah blah blah. For me, I think that if you're thinking about those kinds of things, even if you just have this idea that you're supposed to be doing something specific, it puts a very unnatural spin on it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no, and that's not where I'm coming from. I was just trying to hold a conversation and I was so embarrassed I couldn't even —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you embarrassed about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I just felt like — I don't know. I was thinking about it, like there's nothing wrong with flirting but I was just feeling almost guilty. I don't know. So, again, it was this weird —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you feeling guilty about?</p>

<p>[31:00.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. Being attracted to this person?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, so not necessarily about what you were doing but about what you were feeling. You felt guilty about feeling attracted to this guy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That particular guy or would it have been any guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just guys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what's wrong with being attracted to a guy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing wrong with being attracted to (chuckles) — it's hard for me to decipher, especially when there's such a big difference between what I think and what I feel. It's hard for me to understand, and it makes me very frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what was the talk in your head when you realized you started to feel badly about being attracted to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like "Why am I feeling badly? There's nothing wrong with this." So I started getting frustrated with myself and it turned into "I'm going to go to the bathroom and (inaudible at 31:47.5). (laughter) So, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so what would Julia have said to you, if she were talking in your head and you started feeling badly about being attracted to this guy and talking to him? What would she have said?</p>

<p>[32:06.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I mean, I've definitely told her about these kinds of things before. She probably would've said something like "Wait. What? No." (chuckles) Or like "No, no, no, there's nothing wrong with it. I have a boyfriend. People have boyfriends. It's okay."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if — you know, part of it is going to be sitting with that feeling and working through it, letting yourself get to the other side of it, to help yourself with that. Because it feels so unnatural and so uncomfortable for you when you start to notice you feel attracted to somebody, say to yourself "It's perfectly normal for me to feel this way. I am an adult woman, and it is perfectly normal for me to feel this way."</p>

<p>[33:04.1]</p>

<p>Let yourself kind of hear that, not question and judge yourself for what you are feeling, but reminding yourself that these are normal feelings, these are normal behaviors, and it's okay. Let yourself sort of sit with the permission to experience that, and even the permission to experience feeling uncomfortable flirting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or talking about flirting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or talking about it, which might be good practice, kind of sitting with that. Because it sounds like one of the things that happens is that you notice you feel a different way than you think you want to feel, and then you get angry with yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which probably doesn't help. But if you can practice being comforting and encouraging to yourself, it will help you kind of sit through that feeling, and then it's kind of like exposure therapy, right? You get used to having that feeling, being exposed to that feeling, and it becomes a little bit less problematic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>[34:03.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just like if you were scared of — it's kind of like a phobia. Like if you were scared of heights, making yourself go up a little bit higher and heading out a little bit higher every time, you get more used to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that how other people get over fears? (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's one way. Exposure is definitely one way of getting over your fears. It's confronting it and hanging out and realizing that actually a lot of what you're worrying is going to happen at that time, doesn't actually happen. Or if it does happen, then it doesn't actually kill you. Your mom might be upset if you make a decision that she's unhappy with. Sometimes you find out that she's actually less upset than you thought she was going to be, and sometimes you're going to find that she's upset, but she doesn't stop loving you. We know you're not actually going to die from the upset-ness, but she doesn't stop loving you.</p>

<p>[34:56.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's really what's at stake, in terms of pleasing my mom. Okay, that's helpful. That's helpful in a lot of ways, actually. I have this terror of bridges. I'm very scared of them. (laughter) But — okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's work on one thing at a time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the romantic stuff might actually affect you more than (inaudible at 35:23.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter). Yes, yes, especially here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hopefully you can just stay with — yes. It's a little harder down south or anywhere where it's hotter. You should be okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, I guess I was sort of hard on myself before. It's just so unnatural to be nice to myself. I guess I need to work on that. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So are you likely to ever run into this guy again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's my close friend, actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. So you have opportunities to practice that.</p>

<p>[36:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) To try and be less awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To practice talking, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the reason I've distinguished flirting from being friendly is because most of my friends are actually guys. I'm really good at making friends with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's just sort of my default relationship. Like my best friend from college is Leonard. It's more of a sibling relationship than anything romantic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it become that? Was there ever a point in time in which you were attracted to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought he was an attractive person. I mean, he's good-looking and he's funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But did you ever want him, or were you ever ambiguous about whether he would be a friend or a potential partner?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe at the beginning, I don't quite remember. But I can definitely see —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of going back a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I can definitely see thinking about it, at least in terms of our first couple of interactions. I mean, yeah, I still think he's attractive, but I couldn't — like it's very —</p>

<p>[37:07.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you put them in the friend category, or do they put you in the friend category?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, but statistically speaking, it must be me. (laughter) Especially because I would say 80 to 85 percent of my friends are dudes. So, I don't know. Maybe, yeah. But I think that's why I was trying to distinguish — and people have told me that I (inaudible at 37:40.9) pretty well. (chuckles) So maybe that's why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you ever asked anybody "What does that mean?" I mean, I know we can look at the outcome and see that you have a lot of male friends and sort of determine it backwards. But it would be interesting to figure out how does it become that? How do you channel it in that direction, because that's really sort of what we want to look at.</p>

<p>[38:04.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could ask Leonard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be comfortable for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's a really good buddy. He's always the one that wants to talk and I'm like "Alright, I've talked enough. I don't want to talk anymore." So yeah, I'll ask him. That's actually really interesting because I never really thought of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At some point you send off this signal that you're just one of the guys to somehow get them to turn off the idea that you're not a potential mate, and that you turn that idea off too. My guess is that part of this makes you — if you can do that, it takes the pressure off. Then you don't have to worry about whether you flirt with this person or not. You sort of remove the question and then you become comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's also where — I was thinking about where the distinction is between being flirty and being friendly. And I think that's why I have this separate category of flirting because it's abnormal for me or something.</p>

<p>[39:04.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I do think there's a difference because there's some signal that you send when you're — like in a lot of ways, the behaviors are the same. When you're friendly, you talk to someone and you ask questions about what they're interested in. You pay attention to them. These are all friendly things.</p>

<p>But there's some signal there that if you're interested in somebody in a romantic or sexual way that you somehow let them know that. And those things can be really subtle. If you're a social psychologist and you're witnessing behavior — I mean, this is where all those books come from, right? Like how many times do you touch somebody and how long is — these are all things that if you're looking at an interaction, you can see.</p>

<p>And if you were watching your friends, you would probably be able to know that "Oh, she's flirting with him. She likes him." without necessarily knowing why you are thinking that, but you can tell the difference. You're thinking about it and it feels really awkward. But if you're sort of allowing yourself to just do what feels natural, then it removes the awkwardness for you.</p>

<p>[40:07.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, okay, I see. Maybe putting them back together would be good. (chuckles) Okay, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It would be interesting to hear, because you have someone you feel comfortable asking, what was it that he remembers back when you became friends, that made you friends rather than dating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and he was definitely single at the time, so it wasn't like I'm — okay, well I can definitely do that. That's interesting. I guess there's just a lot to think about. This has sort of been coming — I mean, now that I have all the time in the world, oh my God. (laughter) My roommates are definitely getting sick of me because I'm like "Do you want to go out?" on Monday. On Tuesday, "Do you want to go out?" (laughter) On Wednesday —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then you'll have all these opportunities.</p>

<p>[41:04.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But also a lot of opportunities to think about — to over-think. (pause) Do you think that guilt about back then will sort of go away? Like the dream that I had 15 years ago. Sort of that interaction I had with my mom. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, short answer, yes. Yes, it will go away. Will it go away just because of the passage of time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's been enough time, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it was going to go away just because of time, then it would have gone away. And sometimes things do go away just with time. But it has stuck around for like 15 years now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a pretty long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, my guess is there is something there that's not resolved. So we actually have to have you confront or finish whatever it is that's unresolved about that feeling.</p>

<p>[42:07.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can do that on my own, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to talk to mom. No, I think a lot of this is what are you holding onto internally, and what can you choose to let go of. Remember the punishment of having them find out about that fourth grade incident and that dream that happened later. You're holding onto the message that was sent. [It's not done holding onto it for you].</p>

<p>[He] may or may not feel the same way, but that's not what's holding you back. What's holding you back is what you've internalized from those experiences. So your job is to figure out how to let go of it because it's no longer appropriate. Maybe it was appropriate in fourth grade in your culture and in your family, but it's certainly not appropriate anymore as an adult.</p>

<p>[42:58.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just strange to me that that's the one thing that I've been told I can't do and did anyway, but still feel guilty about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's interesting because there's some part of the message that you believe. My guess is that there's some part of that message you got that day that you believed. Whereas with the school thing —</p>

<p>CLIENT: That day?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The day you were punished about the fourth grade boy. I think something struck a chord there. Whereas your dad telling you it's not alright to go off to school or college, this particular degree not being important, things like that, you never believed it. It never resonated at all with you, the message that you were getting about those things. Leaving home — you were quite sure that it made total sense to you that leaving home was the right thing to do. My guess is that you feel somewhat conflicted about relationships, about behavior in relationships and what's an appropriate norm for you in a relationship.</p>

<p>[43:58.8]</p>

<p>There's some conflict there, so some of the messages you got about what's right and what feels shameful, what's acceptable, what's proper behavior, you're not as clear on it for yourself. And so hearing a message from them, you have something really to stick to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (pause) Maybe I've been something like — because maybe in fourth grade, I would be like "Okay, well, I'm kind of young to date." So maybe that sort of concession could have stuck. Do you think — I mean, I know this isn't like for sure, but do you think it necessarily has to do with now, that I somehow think that dating is wrong or something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's less about what you were thinking and more about what you were feeling. I think that you felt really shamed in that encounter, and so what I'm thinking is that shame got attached to the idea of dating.</p>

<p>[45:03.0]</p>

<p>Not so much in a logical way to do with age or any particular behavior like writing the note. It was not even about writing the note. But you felt shame for liking this boy and expressing it. And that's the same thing you feel uncomfortable with now. You felt attracted to this guy in the bar and you were trying to express it in how you were talking to him, and you felt shame. I think the feeling got attached to the idea in a very loose way, not about one particular thing. So that's what allows it to carry over into another phase of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it doesn't have to make sense, like logically?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Emotions often don't make sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think it does. If it all did make sense, it would be easier to explain away to yourself, and you can't really explain it away to yourself because it got attached and it doesn't really make sense.</p>

<p>[46:00.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That makes sense. (laughter) Yeah, because I think it would be really frustrating for me to feel like there's something I believe is wrong about dating, and I don't know that I do. But having the feeling attached to it, it's almost like it's secretly there waiting to occur. That makes sense to me. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's where I said if you can find a voice to talk to yourself and help you sit with these feelings until they're worked through, we can start to attach a different feeling to the same scenario and replace it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is like on vacation, yeah. I see what you're doing. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Same thing, different —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Application, yeah. So it's like feeling really bad about telling other people about how I feel, until there's enough positive results from it, sort of thing?</p>

<p>[47:09.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So imagine next time you see this guy, you're able to talk to him. You start to feel kind of awkward, you start to feel ashamed. And you sort of talk to yourself nicely about how it's normal to feel that way, and some of that shame starts to dissipate while you're talking to him.</p>

<p>Then you've started to feel something different in that same scenario, and eventually you can start to attach that feeling, that it feels nice to have someone's attention. It's good to get to know somebody. It feels good to have someone return the flirtation. If you can start to feel that in those experiences, then it replaces some of that shame. Just like with communication, it's not necessarily going away in one successful encounter. Every encounter doesn't have to be successful. But you give yourself the opportunity to maybe feel something different.</p>

<p>[48:06.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so attach the new feeling sort of thing. Okay, that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop there for today. I don't think we had scheduled for another time, so if we can try that.</p>

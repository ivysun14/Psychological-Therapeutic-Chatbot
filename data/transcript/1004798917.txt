<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm going to be at the airport at 3:40 today. My visa arrived today and I'm kind of in a whirlwind right now. I wasn't expecting to leave today. I was actually expecting to leave tomorrow but last night around 10:00 I said well maybe I could leave tomorrow. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you are. Well congratulations on getting your visa. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Thank you. I'm kind of stunned that it's actually here, but I'm finally accepting the fact it's nice to have in hand. And I don't know actually where to start. This is our last appointment and (pause) I don't know how these usually go. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well there's nothing magic about it. Like I think we've been doing a process of sort of getting ready for the last session when you know exactly when it's going to be. But this is really a time to... Your life doesn't need to get wrapped up today because it's our last session. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it is often a nice time to reflect on where were you when you came in and where are you now; not that this is an ending point. It's an ending point for us but it's certainly not an ending point for you. But it's a time to sort of take stock of what's changed for you. What do you want to take with you from what you've processed, from what you've learned, from what you've done. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's funny because when I came in here it seems like a lifetime ago. I was in a completely different place and (pause) even then I didn't really realize that I was needing help. I mean I think I knew or it was pointed out to me and (pause) I knew I had... Well I think... When I have come in for help in the past with other people—more like started to get help—it's been a process of realizing that what is normal for me isn't normal. It's not something I have to endure. [00:02:44]</p>

<p>So my inability to concentrate, to remain focused, to concentrate, all those things were really quite paralyzing time and (pause)... So I mean there's an immediate benefit of addressing that and also, of course, getting a medication change and things like that. But from a more (pause) I guess cognitive therapy I think (pause) there are a lot of things that we dealt with and one of them was, I think, (pause)—I don't know—deeply necessarily was the issue I have with attraction to women. And I had never had a female therapist for this amount of time. It had been a few weeks if that. [00:04:03]</p>

<p>And so I think that's clearly something that... I was obviously shocked by how the intimacy of this kind of relationship can happen first of all and then secondly be a useful tool to address that and pick at it, and see where (pause) again what the circumstances are, what the pressures are, why the need for fantasy and escape and that kind of thing. So it's been a useful tool for me to just kind of measure where I am throughout the day with other people. I'm certainly not (pause)—not that it's even expected, but I'm certainly not immune to that (pause) of course to you and to others. (Pause) I think there's a lot in conjunction with the DBT award as well that has been helpful. And even lately I think some of the revelations or discoveries about (pause) my worth, and my right to be happy, and (pause) just what is necessary to keep me healthy, and what things tend to me threatening to that. So I don't know... [00:06:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I mean I see a lot that's changed and part of it you've captured and just kind of been thinking about how you assess how you're doing. I think when you first started a lot of how you assessed how you were doing was symptom based and that echoed in what our sessions were like. And I don't think we were taping back then but we were recording because we lost tapes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:06:45). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter) You know I think a lot of our time in the beginning was spent looking at how did you sleep, what was your anxiety level like throughout the day, and then using those kinds of measures to kind of assess how you were doing. And once in a while I check in with those things now, but much more often the way you describe how you're doing in terms of how you're thinking or how you're feeling emotionally rather than using those other indicators to kind of gauge it for you. And I think that's a shift in also noticing the control you have over it rather than being random. What your anxiety level is like, or whether or not you were able to sleep that night, or how you were concentrating. You've got a lot more awareness of how you can control those things. [00:07:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think you're definitely right. I mean I'd forgotten that when I came in sleeping was an issue. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a big issue. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it really was. And even having a basic understanding of that (pause) of what I can do, like you said, to control those things, and control the anxiety, and manage it. (Pause) I guess I think the other important piece is the allowance for thoughts to come and go without labeling them good or bad; specifically bad. I'm still working on that I think. I think. [00:08:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay. You will be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure a lot of people are (pause) but I think—at least I know the value in allowing thoughts to come and go without judgment. I think it's something that I'm just going to be working on for a while I'm sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a practice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not something that you're ever done doing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So yeah, that's an important part. I think I'm still... I think that the issues of my day I think are still something that (pause) although I brought them up in here, I think a lot of the work is my thinking about it and processing it. [00:09:40]</p>

<p>I'm just kind of working on that. I don't know. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you? [00:10:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still looking at your upper chest. You look very beautiful today. (Pause) So I'm still not immune to those things. And I suspect I won't be perhaps ever but again... [00:11:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder what you can make of the fact that you have had a relationship like this. So, like you said, it was the first time that you've been in a longer term therapy with woman. So to be able to open up, to have an intimate therapy relationship, to have those feelings of attraction and you didn't act on them. You stayed in the long term relationship without making it sexual. And I wonder how you can make use of the fact that you know that you can do that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that's even something that we talked about last week with the one I'm staying with and (pause)... I think for a lot of people the assumption is that the natural course of events is for something like that to turn sexual. I think that's maybe what she was thinking that (pause) this person is doing so much for me. The next step is some sort of physical contact or something. And, again, the main difference being I'm not attracted to her. [00:12:35]</p>

<p>(Pause) So yeah I think that's going to be something that I'm going to have to be at least wary of in that (pause) how I handle a relationship in which there's not a professional boundary that (pause) I need to be at least—I don't want to say I need to be—I am comfortable with it... I'm comfortable with it not being brought to a different level but also (pause) can communicate that as well. And I don't know that I'm as good at communicating that, my preference for that, as I could be. [00:13:57 ]</p>

<p>You know it was always a thrill. We had someone who's attractive, and you enjoy being around the them, and the intimacy is perhaps what's missing somewhere else. You have that charge I get and (pause) I think under certain circumstances that could be dangerous for me. (Pause) And although I've had this recent not test but an experience (pause) I guess the circumstances that my wife is so far away and that happened is significant to me. [00:15:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well to me it seems as though I... Long periods of time without her where I might feel the need for some sort of intimacy that's not available to me and... So how when I arrive tomorrow morning how I (pause) just evaluate and try to put in place a certain (pause) opportunity for intimacy that perhaps these five weeks have allowed me to realize the importance of and what approach I might take that's different than the past. [00:16:55]</p>

<p>(Pause) Because I think in the past stress and anxiety have (pause) kind of worked against feeling any (inaudible at 00:17:32). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about reestablishing connection and maybe also being aware and noticing where maybe you didn't have; where you didn't have connection with her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: In what way?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In being able to put that in place. I remember once making a comment about date night that you guys had to watch a show or something like that together that you both liked, and in your head you were sort of evaluating whether you wanted to spend the 45 minutes watching with her or whether it would be better spent reading, or writing a paper, or getting some work done. And the missed opportunities for connection and really that wasn't the way you were going to connect with her at that point and kind of figuring out well what do you do instead then. How do you make use of the time that you have to make the connections that you need with one another? [00:18:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and make a point of it, I guess, and be deliberate about it. Just the fact that you guys are both home at 5:00 p.m., for example, and are in front of each other doesn't necessarily entail and intimate connection or opportunity. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Intentionality is really important. The same that having an intention to go to the gym.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Even just setting out to enjoy the weekend you can't decide necessarily all the time on Friday what you're going to do Friday night without some planning which often makes that more successful. And also within that leave the door open to spontaneity and what that might look like, or feel like, or (pause) be disguised as. [00:19:43]</p>

<p>(Pause) So (pause) I guess I'm looking at this (pause) reconnection, this whatever you call it, rendezvous as being a (pause) kind of interesting experience and just to see where we are. Do we pick up where we left off? You know it's been five weeks which is an eternity but it's still longer than we've ever been apart. [00:21:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My challenge to you is not to evaluate it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But to notice it. Notice what you feel. When you're together experience whatever it is and not to evaluate or judge what you're feeling, what you're thinking. Five weeks is a long time to be apart and people in relationships respond differently to that. But just to be wherever you are, and to figure that out together, and not to go into your own head, and think about it too much. [00:22:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think you're right. I think that could be dangerous and if something isn't like it used to be is that bad or you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You can notice those thoughts and questions and then choose to let them go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is what it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I also see it as kind of an opportunity for a fresh beginning. Things might not be the way they used to. We're in a different country. We're in a different...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You in a very different place now than you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not going back to exactly what you were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Even I know it's like a constant frenzy for a few weeks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And I think another opportunity is going to be able to (pause) observe how much (pause) of my—how much anxiety I'm experiencing over those changes in where we are. Whatever those things are that make one anxious when they're in a new place and trying to not view those—not react with anxiety but rather excitement or something else. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>(Pause) I think I've in the past had a tendency to (pause) establish that this is what needs to happen as fast as possible and such and so forth and not just let things happen in a normal course of events. And I think that kind of self applied pressure is something that... And we talked a little bit about this last week, or two weeks ago, that there isn't one right way to do something. And things that I invent in my head aren't necessarily the best way to approach it and especially if they just resulted in providing pressure, and put a clamp on intimacy, and connection which I think in the past they have. So in a state of like (pause) rush, rush, rush to do all these things that seem after the fact pretty arbitrary. [00:25:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But in the midst of it, it feels pretty necessary or important. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just want to be wary of putting undo importance on things that (pause) would otherwise hurt other opportunities.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need a reminder to check in with yourself every now and then; notice what you're feeling. If you notice that you're feeling anxious, or rushed, or hurried that's your signal to yourself to say hey is this really necessary. Is this as important as I'm telling myself it is? And just give yourself a moment to pose that question. I think asking yourself questions has been a really useful strategy in figuring out whether or not you're making those kinds of assumptions and setting those kinds of expectations on yourself. Because that's sometimes your clue to yourself that you have this maybe unstated expectation. [00:26:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That knowing that, as you said, it's unstated but knowing that myself even knows about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) As far as a therapist overseas goes I'm not sure yet. I don't think it's a matter of if but just when. But even then I'm not sure what part of this seems especially (pause) in need of more work. I think you've given me (inaudible at 00:27:38) approaches to take that can lead to questions but not necessarily verdicts or sentences. [00:27:52]</p>

<p>I think it's... I think in the past I've led to those things that have seemed a final judgment or summary judgment whereas observing and asking questions that don't feel like they're coming from an already determined perspective or opinion leads to more questions and not to anxiety necessarily or to a battle with myself. And so that's, I guess... I think there's going to be a point at which yes it's clear to me that I'm not feeling normal for whatever reason and we'll say okay it's time to do this. So yeah (pause) I think having those—being in the practice of asking those questions, and self checking, and that kind of thing is going to be important if only to realize that... [00:29:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think that might help you realize when.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when it's time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When it's time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah (pause) that's where I am I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know that we talked about some of sort of the buzz words of things to look for when you do look for a therapist and I know that you (inaudible at 00:29:53) and that's something you can continue. And another thing I sometimes ask people to think about is just in being an educated consumer for yourself thinking about this therapy round what was useful, what was not useful, what was missing, things like that, that might help in determining a fit with the next therapist. [00:30:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure I know what was not useful (pause) nor what was missing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah sometimes those are hard things to notice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or even (pause) you can't miss what you haven't had. Oh there is one thing I do want to ask you about. There was one point when, and I don't remember what it was called, but all I remember is when you said something about when you drop your right hand and there was some sort of exercise there that we were going to do but we... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we never got around to it. [00:31:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was missing; the follow through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yes. That's the one thing. But what was that called?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a type of progressive muscle relaxation. And PMR is an abbreviation you might recognize. So one type of... It's a relaxation exercise and people do it in different ways. And progressive muscle relaxation is a systematic way of going through your body usually tensing and then relaxing so that you can feel the difference. So that would be a really useful thing. I don't know how I dropped the ball on that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I forgot about it sense but I was like I don't remember what it was called. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: The last sessions are always great for bringing that up. [00:32:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's actually something... So in the interim between now and finding a new therapist that's something you can actually—there are books. There are probably apps that you can download that will take you through that. So that's something that you can kind of pick up on your own. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right let me just (inaudible at 00:32:23) so I can actually remember the name. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's progressive muscle relaxation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thanks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you go on Amazon you'll find that there are things you can order. I'm sure you can probably get—you'll find it. It'll take you through it. It's just like listening to a guided meditation type thing. [00:33:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Great. Great. Yeah I think (pause) that will be useful, like you said, in the interim. (Pause) Sorry I seem kind of spacey. I'm kind of like tired but anxious at the same time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well that's understandable. You're moving to a new country today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't even realize it. It was like on a Tuesday they were saying well I hope to get the certificate to you by the end of the week. And only then can I actually submit the application for the visa. And Tuesday at noon, 9:00 their time, it came through, and so I was able to send of the application Tuesday thinking I might get it Friday, I might get it Monday, and I'll probably leave Sunday or Monday. Anyway so everything's just incredibly sped up. [00:34:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a big day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. It is. And I'm just thinking about all the things I haven't finished that just have to be... (Pause) I don't know. (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I know that you'll do well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. I appreciate your help. I do. (inaudible at 00:35:05) patients. (Pause) And I appreciate you taking me on in the first place. [00:35:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm happy I worked with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your honesty, and your courage in facing not only what has happened in your past but also what's happening here for you. I appreciate how hard it is sometimes to talk about those things. And the fact that you were willing to take those risks I feel honored to have been able to work with you through that. And I'm real glad that you were able to do it because I think that it's going to continue to make a big difference for you. To work through that stuff in here to the degree that you did impacts what happens out there. [00:36:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's why I keep saying you're do well because if you apply the same kind of honesty with yourself that you have done in here that's going to help you get through whatever it is that you face in work, in life, and relationships. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Pause) And I'm still frightened by facing things like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay to be frightened. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I think the challenge for me is just to figure out what things I divulge to my wife in honesty and what things I don't. And I don't... I know longer believe that everything needs to be shared. [00:37:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the same time (pause) sometimes it's necessary in order for them to understand what you're going through. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah. So figuring out that balance of what you share, why you share, what's to be lost or gained. Those are tricky lines to figure out, and I don't think there is one right answer to any of the questions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And the fact that I struggle with (pause) an attraction with you, for example, I don't think that's going to necessarily help anything and it's going to actually make her more (pause) insecure and fearful of my going to a therapist. And so yeah... I just... Then I think there's the more immediate updates on I'm anxious, and I'm fearful, and I'm whatever that I don't always—I don't know—pass along. I think that's perhaps more unhealthy because she doesn't know where I'm coming from. She doesn't know what's on my mind. She might think it's something completely different. [00:39:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are blocks to really having intimacy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Pause) But I guess that's part of also the judging is—not judging but having information come in and me not determining well if you're going to have a completely honest relationship you need to tell her about that when that's not necessarily true. And any self described high ideals that I might feel I have to hold myself to aren't necessarily true, or not appropriate, or right. [00:40:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That question that sometimes we use for ourselves what's useful it's adaptive. Does thinking this help me in any way? It might be right but completely not useful in that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Damaging. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And so therefore why do that to yourself. And that can sometimes be used too in sharing a piece of information. How is that going to be helpful in getting the intimacy, the closeness, the trust that you want in your relationship? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sharing your emotions is usually useful. Sharing a fantasy that floats across your head sometimes not. [00:41:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially if you don't know what its meaning is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If it meant something important to the relationship, then maybe it's something that needs to be brought up. But a lot of times it's not about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it could be interpreted as my saying we're heading for splitsville. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Which isn't at all what it means for you really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So without any context to myself it's going to have zero context and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a lot of fear for her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of fear and a lot of (pause) guesses at context. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should probably end. [00:42:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Is it okay if I send you a check?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can absolutely send me a check. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I've ever written a check.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you certainly can. Do you have my address or do you want a card? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think a card. (Pause) Great. And it's just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can send it to my name. You don't need the suite number included. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And just write it out to your name not like a business?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, no just my name. Add either (inaudible at 00:42:42) or doctor at the beginning. It's fine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All the best to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very welcome. [00:42:51]</p>

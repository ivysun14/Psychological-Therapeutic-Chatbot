<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So how have you been?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good and bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, let's cover the bad first then we'll do the good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Problems with [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to go back to the trip and I think you'll understand from there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At the dinner table there was four couples.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which I enjoyed having extra people there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh .</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> These people are not poor, net worth, middle 7's to middle 8's for net worth, annual income 100,000 plus, comfortable people.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> As we're talking at the common and they come around to [NAME OTHER], well, you know, tell us about yourself.  Well, I've been a housewife all my life.  Not really true but it takes on the conversation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, as the dinner table is going around, now you've got to remember we're having dinner with these people once a day at least for seventeen days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, the conversation vary immensely, backgrounds of the people, all right, you know [NAME OTHER] and I.  One man is an investor, his wife is an investor, that's what they do for a living.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They invest in stocks and bonds and manage their own money.  One woman there, about our age, the CEO of her own company that she started, for twenty five years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sold it to a german company, sold it in the middle 8's, not poor.  Her husband, he divorced his wife and married her within the last five to six years.  He was a turnaround specialist, in his own right, at 5 million net worth, was making as a consultant and running a farm, a corporate farm in [DEIDENTIFIED] that he owned.  Again, third person, never did quite figure out, I know he was in industry, he was a physicist mathematician, his wife had her master's degree and worked in in vitro fertilization specialist.  Okay, that gives you an idea of the table.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the course of things, [NAME OTHER] is telling me, hurry up and eat, hurry up and eat and I'm ignoring it.  First of all, this is a table I don't have to control.  I can sit there and listen.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I am not talking a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that was her criticism the last trip.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That was the last trip, so this time I said I don't care if we sit there 10 minutes and nobody says anything, I'm not going to, I'm not going to take control of the table.  Well as it turned out, I didn't have to.  The guy who was a turnaround specialist, his wife could do that quite nicely and I didn't have to fool with it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the course of things, people are telling my wife, you know, you have an awfully nice husband.  This was said at least by one of the couples for seventeen straight days to her at every meal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because they pick up on, she's telling me to shut up and eat.  This goes on for seventeen days.  She doesn't even realize what she's doing.  I did raise a little objection one night and she says well they're not going to leave the table until you finish your dessert, so I told you to finish your dessert, shut up, finish your dessert and let's go.  That's basically what she said which is very rude, not really to me but to them and I know everybody wants to go to the show but when they're talking to you, I can get up and leave anytime, I don't have to finish the dessert.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And as soon as everybody is done talking, I can put my spoon to the side and get up and leave.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I had done it earlier at different times.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, this is, comments are being made to her that, you know, your husband is very very bright and he really has a lot to contribute to the conversation.  Well people are telling her this because, only because she's telling me I monopolize conversations and so forth, which I wasn't.  I don't know what her hang up is, I don't.  We get home and going along the way, there's pictures you cannot do justice to taking them without professional equipment that I would want, so I'm looking for those postcards because those are professionally done pictures and I'm picking up these postcards and I'm saying, these are pictures I would like to be able to take, my camera won't let me do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I can feed them into the computer to tell, for the story lines.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she gets all bent out of shape about, you're getting an awful lot of postcards and I sent postcards, I don't know if you got one or not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I sent a lot, a fair amount of postcards.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I know that, well the last day of the cruise, they come around the night before and they take kind of a picture of the tables.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Everybody at the table and I always like to buy that picture because that's a remembrance of everybody that was there and then I write a little note and put down who all was there and so forth.  And so I bought the pictures and I came back to the room and I said I picked up the picture and I bought something else and she just came unglued, just totally yelling at me about my pictures.  I didn't like any of those pictures, I told you not to buy any pictures and I told her, I said look, I can edit you out of the damn picture but I wanted the picture.  If you don't want to be in it, that's fine, I know how to edit you out, I will edit you out.  She is still totally peeved by the pictures, so I threw them and left.  She was still upset about it.  I said, I hope she [INAUDIBLE] pictures.  We got home, I can't find them, they're not in my suitcase.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Why didn't she want you to get the picture, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She doesn't like the way she looks in them.  She looks old, looks like a bulldog, she doesn't like the scar on her face.  I'm sorry and I talked to a surgeon and he said because of the radiation, there's probably not very many plastic surgeons that would even look at it because radiated tissue does not heal well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I mean if they'd have fixed it at the time it happened, you know, it kind of looks like she has a cleft lip on the one side.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't bother me but it bothers her immensely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I said well, you know, I'm sure you can find a specialist that will try to fix it but I said it's going to be a risk.  No, I'm not going to do it.  Okay, if you're not going to do it then learn how to accept yourself as you are because it's a problem.  All right, we get home and I'm looking for my postcards and she just totally explodes at me that she didn't want those put in the computer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The postcards?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The postcards.  They're not, you didn't take those pictures, they're not your work and I don't want them in the computer.  It was her computer and my computer, well it's not her computer anymore than it is my computer, it's the computer.  I can't find the pictures, I can't find the postcards and I don't understand.  That's not fair, I'm sorry it's just not fair and I know life isn't fair but I don't know how to deal with her and she finally did something, I came in and I was going to do something and I mean I've been laying stone, we went and got some stone from the quarry so I could finish up the stuff and so since we got home, it's been a little cool but I did get a little stone laid and I came in to do something and she just, she started yelling at me and I exploded.  I said look, if you want a Goddamn divorce because you think you'll be happier by yourself, then file for the Goddamn thing and leave me alone and I mean I really lost my temper and I mean I was not nice and then she's crying for 4 hours.  I let her cry, I didn't do anything and then she's telling me, well the other thing was that on the ship she kept telling everybody I owed her an apology if I can provide the picture, at the next dinner and I thought that was rather gauche of her to be honest and I didn't understand it.  I mean we had a great time, I mean the time, it still was a great time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was just this, what I call, picking</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Picking, picking, picking and that's what, actually what she said I don't even remember but it was like a trigger, it was Goddamn it, I've put up with all this now enough is enough, leave me -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought I had, all right, I blew up and she said well, whatever she said, she said [INAUDIBLE].  It's awful not to remember but that's how minor it was and she didn't understand and I said [NAME OTHER], what you said was not what the problem was, I said that was a trigger.  You triggered me and I said I'm sorry I exploded, I shouldn't have, I should have been able to control myself better but I said I couldn't, I said what happened, happened.  Then she wanted me to explain all of what upset me, that she triggered, well I can't explain it to her because if she couldn't understand it for the people telling you every evening and my saying, you know, as casually as possible, I mean it's okay [NAME OTHER], you know, you don't have to worry about it, these people are controlling the table, I'm not worried about it and, you know, people would come and talk to me on the side, particularly the guy who was the investor, he and his wife, and she didn't seem to understand that I wasn't monopolizing them, they came to talk to me and they could end the conversation anytime they wanted and go away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I just, I don't know how to deal with this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know what she's afraid of.  Another thing she started doing on this trip that I'd never seen before is what she said was not actually accurate.  If we spent $10, it was $20.  If we did something, it was slightly more then, if you will.  Now I always had a habit of exaggeration, so I understand where it's at but I didn't, I didn't understand why she suddenly felt this need to do this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean she was as well educated as anybody at that table.  If she wanted to, she could have said I was a manager, area manager from [DEIDENTIFIED] for twenty five years and I handled multimillion dollar budgets, which she handled at least million dollar budgets and plus for three different stores.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Each one of them which have budgets that reach like multimillion and yet she told them that she was a housewife and she really wasn't interested in, and I don't understand.  And then when she did say something, it was demeaning to herself.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That she was insignificant or not important, etc., and she'd say it about herself and they'd just sort of look at her. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think she's depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I thought she was depressed but it doesn't seem to be constant.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like you would say depression, if it is, it's very short term and maybe 2 or 3 hours at a shot even and then boom boom.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Type of thing.  I mean she was upset when she had her pocket picked but we were in [DEIDENTIFIED] but dammit, it was her own fault, I told her and told her and I told her not, she can, they got 40 euros, no big deal but I told her not to carry the credit cards there, carry them close to her body.  She just slipped them in her purse.  She bought a couple of postcards in [DEIDENTIFIED] and she, instead of putting it in and zipping the pocket closed and hooking the flap down, she left the magnetic flap hold it.  He just slipped his hand in there and took the coin purse but there were two credit cards, two debit cards and a credit card which meant I had to cancel credit cards and so forth but no big deal, I had my cell phone in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I already made sure so it worked in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I just called them and told them and they said it was blocked so there's no charges.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If they do, we're certainly not liable but I mean we had a great time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My pictures are, oh, I took fairly decent.  She says they're very artistic.  I don't think they're that artistic.  If I want to take a picture, to me it's [INAUDIBLE] artistic work.  I've people look at a couple of my pictures and said they're as good as any postcard they'd ever seen, so I know they're not terrible pictures but if she's in a picture, even slightly in a picture, she's very upset.  You know, you kind of take a picture of somebody in an area as a reminder, oh yeah, I remember being there, that's what pictures are for.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I also need it for memory because I have, they come up on my screen saver and it's an open file so they all come up.  So I look at it and I say oh that's [DEIDENTIFIED], that's [DEIDENTIFIED], that's [DEIDENTIFIED] and I can look at the pictures and they tell me where we were at a certain time, a certain place and I can remember it that way.  Well, exercise your memory looking at a picture and say well that was five years ago at, it's good to keep the memory working, as well as an exercise because I do find that there's things that I have to really say, oh, now what was this or that and I don't like that feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But so that's what I've been doing.  I've read a couple of good books while I was on the trip, while I had time, which were excellent books.  One is about being, I can't remember the title now.  Anyhow, it's basically, oh, why I hate republicans was one of the books I read and it was really more geared to why I hate [NAME OTHER] but it was generically done and the other one was very interesting, it took American history from the founding and what the symbols, why they were used, how they were used, why [NAME OTHER] used the language he used, what he was trying to convey with that language and how it was supported in his writings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm up through I think [NAME OTHER] now.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And how uncle [NAME OTHER] comes about in being.  I knew how it happened but there were a lot of other things that went into it.  The flag, can you document, did [NAME OTHER] really do the flag.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well come to find out, she knew [NAME OTHER].  She had, she made his continental flag and she made suggestions towards what the actual flag, now whether she actually sewed it or not, she may have, she may not have.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But she certainly had input into it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> From the documentation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Her daughter said that she made up a [INAUDIBLE] at one time and had written about it but so they're not really quite sure about that but she may have and it may have been someone else that actually, she snipped it all out and somebody else actually sewed it together. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like an interesting book.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's extremely, it goes into political cartoons, how the french influence shows up in the Americans during the revolution and how it is interpreted.  Certain battles, why they were won and lost and what the surrounding writings and political cartoons, how it contributed to the win or loss.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How political cartoons affected attitudes, I mean it was a tremendous book.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So there were a lot of good things about the trip it sounds like, good books, good pictures, good times.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, we had, I can't even begin, we went to [DEIDENTIFIED], I mean we had trials and tribulations, we got to [DEIDENTIFIED] and found out that [DEIDENTIFIED] that had booked our airlines, had booked it but didn't pay for it so they canceled our trip to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Well, I had a receipt that said I had, from my credit company.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That I had paid for it.  Well, they called, [DEIDENTIFIED] was very very nice.  They spoke pretty good English in [DEIDENTIFIED] even though they were Italians from [DEIDENTIFIED] but they're skills were very good and they wound up putting us just behind business class and a seat between us, so then after the plane was gone, so nobody came and sat between us, then they came and popped the arms up and said relax.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we had tremendous leg room.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So the flight into [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, it was like being in first class seats.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The seats were a little stiff but it wasn't bad.  You didn't get the armchair affect of a first class or business class seat but room wise, which is far more important to me for my legs.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Was excellent.  The food was so, so.  Now once we got to [DEIDENTIFIED] there wasn't a bad meal for thirty days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it is so different.  One of the things I didn't realize is [DEIDENTIFIED] geographically is the size of [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] area wise.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If you put, that's the size of [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it has 45 million people living in that area.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So their farmland is very precious to them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can imagine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They feed 45 million people off of their land.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so when you go to a restaurant, the soup is pre made and [INAUDIBLE] but the salad they make up fresh.  The pasta they make fresh normally.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just a matter of [INAUDIBLE] cut it and cook it.  Everything is just, so yeah it takes 2-2 2/2 hours. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But that's because they're cooking everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Tons of fish.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I ate fish for thirty straight days.  We went into [DEIDENTIFIED] which is the port for [DEIDENTIFIED] and we didn't go into [DEIDENTIFIED], we went into [DEIDENTIFIED] and then we went into the [DEIDENTIFIED] country and went into, I loved to go into the farmer's market and so we went the farmer's market and the fish market.  They had more fish in a town that had 50,000 then we have in the state of [DEIDENTIFIED] and they sell that much a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a little tiny red fish that were like this, up to the big eels.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  You don't hear that much, at least from here, I didn't hear that much about fish or seafood in [DEIDENTIIFED], think more about the pasta.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Every meal you get seafood.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I ate sole and sea bass and I'm not talking about filets, they roast the whole sole and bring it to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And get the bones out, you have the whole, both sides of the fish sitting there for you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they serve them with black pepper and lemon.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, as soon as the sea bass are [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They roast the whole damn sea bass and bring it to you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it's, it takes forever to eat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] and I, we learned, we'd only buy one entr退e but it was kind of funny in [DEIDENTIFIED].  You didn't want to go in and just order a pizza, they got very insulted.  They expect when you come into their restaurant that you understand that you're there to eat and so they expect you to order the soup, a salad, and a pizza, no problem, soup, salad, entr退e, went in and ordered a pizza because one of the people on the cruise told us, they told them to leave.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They said we'll you're a pizzeria, we want pizza and they said 45 minutes and they guy kind of looked at her and he said what did you want, they said just a pizza, one pizza, no, no, no, you can leave, we don't make a pizza for nobody.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The guy was, of course, this guy being American, he was insulted.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He didn't understand huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and I said well didn't they tell you that before when you went into [DEIDENTIFIED] that you just insulted the guy.  He said how did I insult him, I was spending my money there.  He says, no, no, no, you have to buy, to establish, and it's kind of like when we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] the very first time, we went into the french district and they handed me an American menu.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When it was a french restaurant and he gave me a menu and it was a terrible menu.  This is a nice little french restaurant.  The guy came back and I said do you have a wine list?  He said it's on the bottom.  I said no, no, no, I said you don't have any chateau [INAUDIBLE] and the guys eyes light up, grabs up the menu and he's gone, he comes back and hands me a menu, it's all written in french of course.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's a beautiful french menu and suddenly, oh this guy understands food enough and wine that he's going to buy something here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we had a beautiful meal but I mean that's the same thing there.  They had, in some restaurants we went to, they had an American menu for the Americans.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then they had the Italian menus and sometimes, with me I never had a problem, they took one look at me and handed an Italian menu.  Some of the people got their American menu and they'd say to the next table, they'd say you got a different menu than we do and I'd say yeah, you want to look at the menu, here, [INAUDIBLE] this type of thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because they just figured Americans, all they want is a hamburger and a salad or something and it's like I learned that calamari is delicious, I'll never be able to eat calamari in this country.  You know how it's kind of chewy?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED] it's not, you could cut it with a fork.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> First of all, they don't cut it into rings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They take the whole calamari, they cut it lengthwise, it's all cleaned and everything, then I think they poach them so that they're part cooked, then they run then and flour them, they run a skewer through them and so they're, you know, they're a triangular thing and they put three of them on a skewer and dip it into the oil just enough to brown the flour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then they take it, they put it on your plate, you get three of them, so you're eating nine squid with a bed of lettuce and tomato and cucumber, green pepper, red pepper, you know, all there and wine, oh my God, they don't, they export their bad wine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Keep the good stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, the guy said, we don't export this stuff.  We had wine with every meal, two bottles a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which is not a little bit of wine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It costs about $5 to $6 for wine a day, or no, per meal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, for a bottle, $5 or $6?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In a restaurant?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In a restaurant.  What you do is, I leaned to order the wine in Italian.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Vino blanco and or [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they would, you just ask for the house wine and he'd pull the cork out of the bottle, put it in a carafe and bring it to you, set it on the table.  Refreshing, number one.  No dry taste left in your mouth.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Number two and never even a hint of any side effect.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And yeah it was just automatic, the guy, you'd tell him and if you'd order one, he'd kind of look at you and you'd say do you have something better and he'd say oh yeah and he'd bring something better, you know, a different wine.  If you ordered one and he didn't think it was the right one, he'd say I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you were open to whatever he thought was best; he'd bring it to you.  It was so so delicious.  Aced grape juice, that's how they tasted like.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean you could taste all of the flavors of like fresh pressed grapes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, wow.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If it had citrus, you could taste citrus, you could taste, it's just amazing the difference.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And what amazed us is we were eleven days, we drank wine at least twice a day for eleven straight days, you want to know something that was phenomenal?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My blood sugars leveled.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I ran 93 to 97 blood sugars.  I never spiked.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Part of it, I think, had to do with the fact that I was eating so much fish.  I think it had to do with the fact that I was eating all these fresh vegetables.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You go into the markets, it was like being in [DEIDENTIFIED], you could smell the potato juice, smell all the fruits, they had odor to them.  You walk in our stores, you don't smell anything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You just smelled all these, you get all these nice aromas in your nose.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And but we ate all this fish, not very much veal, not very much lamb, it's there but I think I had veal maybe twice.  I think I had lamb once, you could cut it with a fork, it was just magnificent.  [NAME OTHER] made a point of not eating in the tourist district, we would walk into the neighborhoods and find a restaurant.  I wasn't afraid to be there, I thought I could understand enough Italian that I could get by and we walked into places where they didn't speak any English at all so we still managed to order and eat and to thank them and they kind of looked at us funny like why are you over here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like gee we don't see many people from the tourist group, they'd look at you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But other than that, [DEIDENTIFIED] is amazing.  Have you been to [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh gosh, [DEIDENTIFIED] is a magnificent city, a lot is interesting.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], I worked for a man from the time I was about 12 years old to at least 16, his name was [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] wanted me to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] with him because he always said that he was a master whatever, big restaurants and hotels in [DEIDENTIFIED] and that he wanted me to go and learn how to do that in [DEIDENTIFIED].  My mother wouldn't let me, my father said that was a great idea.  I thought it was a good idea too but my mother, she just couldn't understand it and I guess I can understand it too now but we're going to [DEIDENTIFIED] and they say see that little town right over there, that's a part of [DEIDENTIFIED].  Now we're all in [DEIDENTIFIED], about 5 or 6 miles into [DEIDENTIFIED] but that's an Italian town over there.  The bottom of the mountain belongs to [DEIDENTIFIED], the top of the mountain belongs to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And this little town is completely surrounded by swiss, it's just across the lake and they say, yeah, that's [DEIDENTIFIED] and the guy says that [DEIDENTIFIED].  Yeah, the tour guide was a neat lady.  She says tell us about [DEIDENTIFIED], well that's where [NAME OTHER] lived and worked.  His family were the restaurant and hotel people on the other side of [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED], now that I knew but I didn't realize they owned a town and the hotel there is a 5 star hotel and casino and has been, it rivals [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I could have been trained there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I wanted, we had time but I didn't have time to go around the lake and I would have love to gone and talked to him and said hey, where's [NAME OTHER] and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, everything.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because he's, I did find out that was probably, when he came to [DEIDENTIFIED] and worked for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And ran the [DEIDENTIFIED], that's what his title was.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> General manager, that was his vacation time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> From the hotel in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I found out a little bit about my probable, my grandmother.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Her name was [NAME OTHER] and from the island of [DEIDENTIFIED], could have very definitely been Jewish.  They, in the 1850's when my grandmother's parents left [DEIDENTIFIED], the Jews were being persecuted in [DEIDENTIFIED] and they'd rather than have their land confiscated, they probably sold it and my grandmother always said she was from [DEIDENTIFIED], her family.  Well, they probably weren't from [DEIDENTIFIED], they were probably from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But they sold their land, converted the cash, went to [DEIDENTIFIED], the reason they went to [DEIDENTIFIED] was because if they were going to be arrested or anything, they could jump into [DEIDENTIFIED] because it's only about 10 miles into [DEIDENTIFIED] from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They could go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and be left alone and they could take their money with them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And because they weren't wealthy people in this country but they were certainly what we would call at the time affluent, they were land owners and so forth in this country and in the 1868, 1870 to be a land owner in [DEIDENTIFIED] and running truck farms at that early state when trucks weren't around, yeah they were doing pushcarts and wagons.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Basically what we call truck garden today and the Jewish people still run a lot, make a lot of truck gardens in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the reason I found all this out is our guide was a Jewish lady.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She was an Italian Jew.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so she was very interested in trying to help me figure out how this went together.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was kind of interesting that way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like you learned a lot, experienced a lot.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I learned so much about history and it's just, I never would like to live outside the [DEIDENTIFIED], I call the [DEIDENTIFIED] home.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I could go back and pick up where we left off, there is so many little places that are so interesting.  [DEIDENTIFIED] will never be united though.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, it's too diverse?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, their mentality is city state.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now they may say we're part of the [DEIDENTIFIED] union and all this but when they start talking to you, they say oh well, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED] was it's own city state and we had our own, you go to [DEIDENTIFIED], oh well, [DEIDENTIFIED] was an empire of it's own and we have, they don't think in terms of large regional blocks of things.  They think in terms of, oh yeah, we're here and this is what we are.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And this is who we are.  We're different from the Italians 10 miles away.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because our lineage is this, their lineage is something else.  Oh and you go to [DEIDENTIFIED], the first thing they'll tell you at any of these places they take you is ruins from [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We were part of the Roman Empire.  We were actually Italian until 1705.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We were part of the Italian nation, the roman nation.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Even though the empire fell in 1000 or something, they were still considering themselves part of the Roman Empire in 1705.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You can go to [DEIDENTIFIED], it's the same thing, [DEIDENTIFIED], they point out the Moorish influence of 800 years of the moors being there and then of course you see a lot of Moorish architecture.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And in [DEIDENTIFIED] they don't paint their houses and the reason they don't paint them is they tile the outside with ceramic tiles.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it cools to wash them off, it's so humid and everything the paint would just, so they learned to tile the outside of their houses.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they use these ceramic floors, the 3 inch tiles, the tiny tiles, and they just tile the outside of the house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's magnificent to see.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I'll bet.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Colorful, you know, and we went into some of the [DEIDENTIFIED] ghettos.  I got some pictures from that.  One of the things about [DEIDENTIFIED] is [INAUDIBLE].  Some places, restaurants, the only thing they had was a kitchen, all their seating area was the sidewalk outside.  They'd just take the tables every day and they'd spread them out on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And that was their restaurant and the adobe part is just the kitchen where they cooked.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which was, you know, can you imagine that in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, they don't worry about flies or insects, hell you live with those creatures, critters.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's just amazing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know you've got somebody waiting.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you know, we didn't get a chance to really come to any conclusions, especially about [NAME OTHER].  What I would say is it sounds like there's something that's upsetting, bothering her, even though it's not clear what it is because she was, like you said, kind of picking at you.  I don't know if she's depressed, she's angry about something else, or she was just scared, you know, if some old buttons are getting pushed for her, she's getting triggered.  I don't know but maybe when she's feeling better, maybe she'll talk to you about it and you can get some more information about her about why she was so upset about these things on the cruise, do you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think she even realizes she did it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's my concern.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that I don't think she even realizes or understands what she was doing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because twice on cruises now she's been upset with you about things that seem -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very minor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and I'm thinking is it the setting of being on a cruise that she's uncomfortable with, I don't know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she tells me she loves them, loves going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she doesn't understand, she says you're ready to go again already and I said yeah, I saw one for a hundred and seven days and she says well I couldn't be gone that long from the puppies.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I said well I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED] for forty five days.  She's looking at me like are you insane.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well if you enjoy it, there's no better time to go than the present.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well yeah, we're not young kids.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so let's keep talking.  Oh, we need to set another appointment too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you want to check back in</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They moved my surgery for my throat to the [DATE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Of November?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> November.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So we might want to talk in November again say before that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Before the [DATE] which is a Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Before you give me [INAUDIBLE], if you do I'll put it on here, I got a check for you in my van.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's not a problem.  Do you want to meet that week before the [DATE] which is the week of Thanksgiving, I'll be here Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, otherwise, the [DATE] is a Tuesday and I don't have anything that Monday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm getting surgery on Tuesday so let's go -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The week before that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The week before that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I've got times either like on [DATE] at 3 o'clock is an option.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right, let's try that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to talk also about how do I avoid the trigger points.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because they don't help any.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For her or me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But you know, you're reading your sugars three or four times a day and you suddenly don't have any spikes in it or anything.  Now [NAME OTHER], I can't, that's another thing that drives me crazy, drives me bats, is everything that happens to her, she says it's the medication.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the middle of the damn cruise, she didn't tell me she stopped taking her Synthroid.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's risky.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well there's something going on with her that's -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I understand she's had some bad episodes with medication.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't know what to do about it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And let me go get that check, I'll just put it on the table.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine, okay, that's fine.  All right, take care.</p>

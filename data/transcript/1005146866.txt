<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a challenge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Wow. Yesterday I was having a very good day and I sure let Jeremy know it. I mean I went to dance and I was surprised because not only are the classes smaller and I sort of know who to predict - like, who's the best but who's - now it's like five people that know the teacher. This time the teacher was, she's the owner of the studio and her own girls, teenage dancing girls, are there and I was a little bit overwhelmed because I didn't know. And you know, their being young, they're a little bit more - I mean they're just really - and there is a lot of really good girls, like they all have their own like - one's very flexible, one's a greater turner, and they're - not to the point that they're like professionals and you know, I found myself just like - I mean and even like when I went to dance on Thursday, like every week there seems to be a new set of advanced girls in the intermediate class. I actually got in the advanced level and so now I'm an (unclear). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I'm actually one of those advanced girls in the intermediate class. In the same sense they always feel like, it's like I'm trying hard but there's always going to be someone better or someone like - and it always seems like maybe you're not getting better, maybe - (cell phone ring tone) - I mean it's really hard to tell - I'm sorry, I'm waiting a call back from my doctor. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just sort of like - I mean I guess when I was living - you know I was in high school, maybe going to community college and even up to undergrad I try hard, I succeed and I was the best. And now it's like - and so there was dance and then when I came home after dance it was around lunchtime and Jeremy said he was going to make these wrapped fresh rolls and collard greens and something about like he makes jokes about, 'oh it's the headiest lunch, it's something so healthy that you can't believe it,' so for some reason I just didn't - I was thinking about picking up [Furio] (ph) after dance because I love - that's my after-dance treat sometimes, like it's too cold - it's snowing, I have to walk a mile. So I mean I was kind of on the fence about like - no, I should just go home, should I get coffee, no, just go home, and then yeah, when he's like 'oh, we're going to have this.' And I was like, 'oh, oh, okay.' Then he was like, 'is that okay?' And I was like, 'yeah.' And she's like, 'oh, it's smoked salmon.' And I know smoked salmon is a delicacy around here but I just don't like smoked salmon. (Laughs). I don't like it - I mean I like it in select circumstances and so he's like I can put chicken, and I was like, 'oh, that's fine, yeah, maybe that, yeah.' And he's like, 'oh, I can make you something else.' And I was like, 'nah, nah, nah, hah, don't go to the trouble, it's fine.'</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you feeling? [00:03:48] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just feeling like well, it was disappointment and just sort of like, yeah, it was more like disappointment because like the night, like the few days before we were talking about going to his friend's sandwich shop Sunday where they serve fried chicken sandwiches and we eventually agreed like, no, no, let's not do that but then after dancing I was starving and I had worked my butt off and I also had heard that when he was making a lighter lunch because of the Purim celebration was like an hour earlier, I was like there's so many change of like my ideal thing, like everything was sort of changing. My ballet class was different. In Pier 1 this lady kind of almost tricked me into getting a credit card there and she got mad when I realized it was a credit card. That's not supposed to happen. Lunch was not supposed to happen. It wasn't supposed to be something challenging. And then Purim got changed and then [Ozzie] (ph) and Christina just recently moved into a new apartment and my mom said it was gorgeous and so I was going to have to see Ozzie and Christina and sort of deal with that. And I was just like - [00:05:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nothing was going the way you wanted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean I'm happy for them that they have a nice apartment. But there's something - because I guess my mom tends to like spark sort of controversy and drama by saying, 'oh, I think Ozzie's been jealous of your apartment and so he really tried to one up you with this apartment.' And like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes it feel competitive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and his brother is very competitive and Jeremy - and so then after, later I mean, I apologized about the lunch because it was actually tasty. I wound up also getting depressed about Hamantashen cookies I made that after trying this new way of folding - you're supposed to fold them into a triangle, but because I didn't do something right with this new method, they opened up like half of the - I mean no one's got to see those in the end but I was just like over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hamantashen are very hard to make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (Laughs) Most of them came out, but I was just (sigh) nothing. The cherry on the top was when the soap in the shower hit me in the eye.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ohh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fell down from above. And I just, I found myself getting so anxious and worked up and especially when like, because Jeremy was telling me about Ozzie about how Ozzie always tries to compete with him like with food, with apartments and now Christina is exercising three days a week and like - over! Over. Why can't - I mean I should be happy but - you know, if anyone of my friends was exercising three days a week I'd be happy for them. And you know just like in dance when people - I mean for some reason like I'm a competitive person in nature, and I try and like forget about what like keeps that in balance trying to keep this constant voice, like it doesn't matter, life's not a competition, but the moment people start openly competing that's when all bets are off and I have just been feeling just sort of like falling short in every category and even research, like my advisor promised me, or didn't promise, but was like, 'oh, I have this paper that has to be turned in by the end of February and it's for a magazine and can you work on this project?' </p>

<p>And I kind of gave up my sort of thing about doing the PhD. I mean maybe I just chose this project to sort of like extend my PhD. Maybe there were - there probably were other reasons but those were the - but then my advisor is like now he doesn't have time and I'm just like, there's no paper, I still don't have my splits. I still have so much work to do in dance and I mean I should exercise more and just research and giving my proposal and my teaching the course of the future that was not - I mean I didn't spend that much - I mean I spent a lot of time thinking about it, I just didn't understand the assignment. People - I filled out a worksheet rather than using the worksheet to guide a rationale. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:09:17 - 00:09:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just been having a hard time sort of like - it's sort of like when you try hard and not fail, but you don't really succeed. I mean maybe it's just because when I'm comparing sort of what success is, I mean - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be success?</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:09:46 - 00:09:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be recog-? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well - success is, I guess there are many aspects.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you're failing in every category, so I'm curious as what success is in each of your categories. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess with my research it would be getting a paper. That would be a success. For dance that would be someone recognizing that 'oh, you're doing so, you've done much better or you're improving.' </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you made "advanced" this year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that not a sign of recognition of improving from last year's place?</p>

<p>(Cell phone ring tone)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. And I guess I didn't recognize like yeah, I guess I want things so fast and some things just in life are little successes but they build up on each other. And I guess what would be successful other things like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else did you feel like you failed at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Having an apartment that didn't have stainless steel appliances and having an apartment that wasn't as cool looking as someone else's.</p>

<p>(Cell phone ring tone)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or as Ozzie and Christina's. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you like your apartment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I like it quite a bit. It's very cozy. There's things, you know, that we'd do a little bit differently if I had my own design. You know, when you own an apartment you sort of take - but you know, in terms of decorating and you know, with the money that we had, which was quite a lot for decorating - like $4,000 is a lot to furnish an apartment. Yeah, I really like it and it really feels like home. [00:12:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course, (unclear) things important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think, I mean of course there are things like I would do differently than Jeremy, and Jeremy would do differently than me, but we sort of made many - a couple of compromises but we - both of us really like it and I guess, yeah, I mean as a whole I really like it. (Cell phone ring tone) It's big, it's spacious, it's really cozy and has everything we need. And yeah, I mean, so I guess that's a success and we're happy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I you can define success in something other than comparison to somebody else, if you can make an objective criteria in dance rather than it being the best one on the room, have it be something that doesn't - that is really just a measure of you. You know it sounded like you have specific goals of having all your splits. That's something that doesn't change when there's somebody else in the room and you can measure your own progress. And I have actually noticed a little bit, like you know inch-wise progress where there is somebody else in the room and you can measure your own progress. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have actually noticed a little bit like inch-wise progress and that actually does make me happy like, 'oh, I'm only four inches off the floor in my kneel split or five and a half, I think. But - yeah, I think that's actually - and I think that where it gets me is when I see like a 12-year old in class when she's just going back and forth and we all three split and I'm like oh, I'm so far behind, but - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll see where she is when she's at (unclear). [00:14:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think that's a different - there can be another girl in the room one day to the next day to the next day and you don't have any control over those other girls. Who comes in and who comes out, who's naturally really flexible, you know, or not. You only have control over yourself. You have control over what your apartment looks like, to a degree. But you don't have control over what somebody else buys, or rents. If you can keep your definitions based on the things that are more in your control rather than success being based on who gets to the finish line first type of thing - it's going to feel a lot more steady and consistent. Because those other things are always changing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's actually a good way of thinking about it. </p>

<p>(Pause): [00:14:58 - 00:15:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think to some degree that's what I had when I was an undergrad, like I was so in my own world that you know, what was - and I really didn't have a clue what everyone else was doing and so I just sort of had my own sort of goals and expectations and I guess maybe I'd just been a little bit more less into my own world and in one sense maybe that was good - but in another sense with a competitive like - you know, yeah, I think I do need to yeah, just think about what my goals are for myself, not - and then I guess I'll be less sensitive to the changes going - </p>

<p>Because yeah, it can really affect my day and my dance class and I remember like sometimes like I just sort of, you know, when someone is new into the class, I sort of think like, 'what's she doing here? Oh, she's good,' or, 'she's better than me. Yes, she is. How much better? Oh, I don't know.' And all of that goes through my head like during l'etendu or combination and then I'm like lose track of what I'm doing because I'm thinking and it's crazy how scatter-brained I can get versus like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you were focused on what you were doing and how well you did the combination. I mean, I think that competition can be how well you're doing the combination this week as compared to last week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you can measure your own performance rather than who's doing the combination best in the room and those things are always changing - the people who are in the room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true and maybe someone has a bad day and maybe someone else has a sore ankle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:17:09 - 00:17:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And another thing that was going on is lots of organization. It actually feels nice like because Jeremy and I recently we went to Ikea and like to just like at the six-month mark of living somewhere you sort of have an idea like where the clutter is piling up and it was actually nice. Like I sort of feel like - and I can see why people do like spring cleaning or like there's all these Pottery Barn ads of "organize your life" and it's like, yes, I'm feeling the need for that. Especially now that I'm getting more involved in like going to dance and like, you sort of like need systems and it's nice to sort of at least try and set that up and I'm trying, I'm working on - I recently identified - because Jeremy and I kind of had a - I don't know what the problem was, but I know that there was a problem. I think I was feeling like - oh, it started on I forget what it was, what exactly started it - I mean I guess I'd been sort of feeling like bad because I stay in my pajamas like when I'm working at home and yeah, dumpy clothes and you know, but when I'm at home I'm still working.</p>

<p>I'm not being domestic and I know that Jeremy gets a little bit like frustrated, like when I'm at home and when I don't really do anything besides get dishes dirty and of course I'm doing my work but, you know you think that if you save the trouble of having to commute, get dressed, do all those things, and like you know, nothing is done around the house either - like no cooking, and so like I started to realize that, 'okay, maybe I just need to go every morning, at least I feel like home is home - something to relax, something where it's okay to wear PJs and you know there's sort of a dress for success sort of thing. Like you're out the door in normal clothes, you're going to think not like you're on vacation. But then I realized that I was afraid of leaving home. Like I had a hard time like getting, leaving the house. I don't know why. I guess I'm getting better at leaving the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the fear?</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:19:51 - 00:20:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well. That's a good question.</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:20:05 - 00:20:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In one sense it's like I'm away from my comfort zone, like I've been working at home for so long and been a student for so long, like you know there's not a fridge in my - I mean there's a fridge downstairs, but you know our - I make tea, my favorite food, my favorite nibbles, where it's just sort of my office with some snack food and some coffee or tea that I can try and brew, but I'm not very good. I don't know, and the fact that I'm going to be around people and like I'll have to feel a little bit self conscious and use a public restroom and I've actually gotten much better at using public restrooms. That doesn't seem to be my fear these days. Because now I'm in so many public places, like in terms of dance studios and it's gotten a lot better because I just sort of - </p>

<p>(Cell phone ring tone). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I have to check this. I'm going to step out for a minute. I'm really sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Cell phone)</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:21:29 - 00:22:11] </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was quick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't even have time to look at my - (both laugh). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm very, sort of flexible with these things. But - what was I going to say? Oh, yeah. And the fact that maybe I might need something like, I don't know, I guess I'm sort of - I'm not a packrat and when I normally go on trips I don't pack that much stuff, unreasonable and not like a three bags for a three day trip. Or being comfy or being productive and, you know, not having - in case I get very sleepy something, you know, I'll just sleep on my office floor if I'm that sleepy. But I guess, yeah, I mean the workplace is a lot different from home and it's funny, I used to teach dance twice a week. When I was in college I'd teach dance two to three times a week and I would at least drive an hour and a half to get to dance and I would teach there for a couple of hours and then I'd come back and you know, it just seemed part of the routine, like oh you need to go to dance, and now it's sort of like I don't know - I haven't really understood why I have such a hard time leaving home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you having a hard time leaving home on workdays? Or are you having a hard time leaving home like today or when you took dance on the weekend? Is it where you're going or is it the leaving?</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:24:01 - 00:24:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I have a hard time leaving for - like I'm always just sort of like, yeah I have a hard time leaving for dance. Like some days I go very slow and like, oh I don't want to go. I love home so much I don't want - yeah, and eventually I'm out the door because I realize I have to but then I'm five minutes late to dance class because I was like, 'what did I spend that time doing?' I was like, it's so hard and I don't know if it's just kind of like the fear of leaving the solitude and comfy-ness of home or actually have to do something and engage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like maybe part of it is the anxiety of facing something that's less certain, you've not much control - I mean some of the things that you were mentioning like the elements you have control over, like what's in the fridge and what snacks are available and control over how and when, you know, what you brew, versus there's a lot less certainty about those things either in your office or who knows what you are going to encounter on your way to some place? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and what's going to be in dance class? How it's going to go. The weather - is it going to be cold? And like, you know, it's just sort of like - yeah, there's a lot of unknowns and yeah. I must say, my home really is that good if I want to stay home, but then I sort of look back and I sort of see that when I was in my old apartments I just stayed home all the time like my going out nights was when I got dressed and went to Walgreen's and that's the joke my friend makes all the time. Because I get dressed up very nice just to go to Walgreen's and go back home and get in my pajamas and yeah, I guess there's sort of like I guess, there's - I have a hard time when - I didn't think about that, but yeah. I don't - like there's so many - I have a lot of anxiety about not being able to control circumstances and you know, having a possible day like I did yesterday where everything just seemed to be like not going my way -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What you were expecting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it makes me angry. (Chuckle) Like you know, like why? Why is - but I sort of see that you know any job that I'm going to have besides maybe being a housewife, even housewives have to leave the house - but I'm going to have to leave the house and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel like it's getting harder?</p>

<p>(Pause): [00:27:18 - 00:27:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe compare it to before you moved in together, leaving your old place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: On Porter Square, I mean I realized I had to leave, but it was really frustrating because I sort of chalked it up to like a lot of it was like - turned into like - at least I had (unclear) about leaving. I had this rage, this embitterment like - oh, I'm not - I'm leaving and I have to go all this way to get to Jeremy's and he never comes over here and like, oh, I just want to be home. So I didn't think of it like - it just sort of was like, I'm always in transport. I'm going to be so excited to be home. I'm finally am home. But I sort of realized like, it's not that - actually it's not that it's gotten harder since my sort of getting anxiety like I don't want to be around germs, but I think now that I'm doing stuff I'm forced to think about it. I get (unclear) dance at 10:30 in the morning. I'm forced to think about it as opposed to just not going in and just staying home all day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many days of the week do you leave the apartment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's see. Monday. So the past two Mondays. I guess, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - but Thursday doesn't have to be until night because I have dance late at night and then Friday usually not, but I guess there's four possible days during the weekdays that I have to leave, but it's - except for Monday and Wednesday, I guess Tuesday - Thursday and Friday are more like when it's my (unclear) to leave. But - and I guess on the weekends because Jeremy never wants to stay in the house, so I guess it's Sunday, too, I have to leave. But I get to come back really sooner so I guess that's some concession, like, oh, you know. So I'm going to have my dance stuff and I'll be fine going to dance. But it's just like really, I mean even - I sort of saw myself last night when I had only an hour to take a shower, put on makeup, do my hair and I thought I could get ready really, really fast - and I was surprised. I was like normally, like, I take forever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're regretting leaving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the getting ready that takes a long time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ohh. I'm Eeyore - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, your delaying leaving because it feels anxiety provoking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But I found that practice makes proficient. So by practicing more like - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think you're exactly right because I think there's a difference between wanting to be home and feeling afraid to leave, or feeling afraid to be out. It sounds like you're afraid to be out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And facing that, confronting that fear over and over and over again and proving to yourself that you're okay even when things don't go necessarily how you predict or how you want. It might be uncomfortable but it's not unbearable. You're okay. You're not really happy but that's actually all right. You don't need to be perfectly happy all the time. So I think that pushing yourself to confront this fear in the same way that you confronted your fear about using public restrooms or confronting your fear about touching your makeup bag and things like that. It's pushing yourself to do the things that you are afraid of so that your fear isn't limiting you.</p>

<p>You know I'm glad that you like to be home. Your home should be a comfortable, cozy place where you feel at peace. That's great that you've created a space that feels that way and I want you to be able to hang onto that but also not feel like you can't be other places. So I think, like you're doing, pushing yourself to go to the office some days and pushing yourself to go out and take your dance class, go out and run and errand so that it doesn't feel like - so that your fear doesn't lead you to avoid those things and get bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because when you avoid them and don't do them it's almost like you're proving to yourself you can't do it. And you can do it. And the more you do it the more comfortable it will get again. I think it's maybe gotten a little less comfortable because now you have a space where you can work from home. So there are days when you don't go out and you didn't do that so much in your old apartment. [00:33:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I remember when I was going to community college, I had to drive an hour there every day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you just did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And yeah, and you know, I did it over and I made jokes about my car being like messy, but it felt kind of like home. It was kind of like a new home, like - and I sort of got used to it and sometimes (unclear) bad, sometimes - but I didn't really care because the focus was more on school and my grades and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, not all those things like the outfit, the hair - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Food.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't all have to be perfect in order for you to be able to go out and do your thing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting how, yeah, I guess I'd gotten so used to - I mean being in a situation where I could obsess - at home where I obsess about my plants because they're there and - but it seems very weird, like I left my plants at home and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Unclear). [00:34:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Yeah. That's true and I'll probably be more surprised about their growth and development than if I'd watched them every hour and wondering why they're not blooming that hour. Yeah, I - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you haven't mentioned the anxiety before and I'm wondering if it has something to do with the pattern of being late here, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that's actually - it's, I mean definitely I have a hard time - it's definitely not personal. Because I really do enjoy therapy. It's just a hard time getting here - like just getting here - like leaving home and that's really like, you know, it really is hard. And I think it sounds silly, but and I actually had this problem like getting to my classes, getting to my meeting with my advisor. I always push it. You know like I'll start getting ready like say if I have an appointment, and I have to leave at like 1:30 and I'd be like, 'okay, well you know, it's 1 o'clock. Okay, I should start getting ready to go. No, no. I just want to finish this - I just want to finish this.' It'll be like 1:50 and I'm like, 'oh, shoot,' I'm going to be 15 minutes late, I've got to go, I'll get ready real quick and then there's a rough patch of skin, I have to get that off.' And then I'll be like not just 15 minutes late, I'll be like 25 minutes late and then I'm rushing to get to the T and like running and like I mean, it's just - and you know, when I'm running I'm late and I think, 'how come I didn't think about this earlier?' And arrgh, hard. </p>

<p>Yeah, and I used to get to community college like early - like on the early side. Definitely not late. Never - I mean I was late to my own oral exam. Everyone else was late to, though. I actually was like two minutes late. Yeah, I mean that's the biggest joke in my group is that I'm late and that I'll be late to my own funeral. [00:37:17]</p>

<p>But yeah, and I think I just need to maybe set timers, to just tell myself like, 'time to go.' Like just get used to - I guess like when people are addicted to something they need to just tell themselves, "no." And I need to tell myself, "no, you need to go."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well how can you make yourself more comfortable about being out? Because it sounds like it's the anxiety that's making you not want to take that next step of not getting ready or not start the process of not getting ready. So if there were a way to lower the anxiety about going out, maybe you wouldn't delay it as much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think you know, probably having my lunch packed the night before - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So then you can know what's going to be to eat. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And like planning the night before what I'm going to wear. What - I mean I used to do that in college and I guess - I mean I was - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And there were things that worked back then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, laying out what I'm going to wear. I did pack up my dance stuff the night before and I was so happy that I didn't have to think about it. I took the coolest bag with me and I guess maybe that's the thing is like instead of thinking, 'oh, no - what do I want to wear? Is this the weather?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you check the weather the night before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and sort of prepared myself for like, instead of like waking up and being surprised, I mean the weather - it can be unpredictable but as long as I carry an umbrella, I'll be fine in Boston. Yeah, I think that's, yeah - and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So fewer choice points. [00:39:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I think I do have a hard time making decisions, too. And I think often I get anxious about making - I get - all the time, I get anxious about making decisions because there's always like (unclear) that it's the wrong decision. But yeah, and - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that takes a longer time. If you're doing that the night before it takes a longer time - it doesn't make you late. The consequence is you're going to go to bed later. Hopefully, you'll learn to limit how long you give yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I just - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Make your decisions so that you don't eat into your sleeping time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that might make - decrease some of the anxiety of the process of getting ready before you go out. Because I wonder if the anxiety about making the decisions and the anxiety about being out are combining to be overwhelming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To reduce the anxiety about the decisions, then you're only left with the anxiety about going out which might still be uncomfortable but won't be as intense. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean yeah, it's crazy. I didn't realize this but right before I leave - and that's another thing - like I'll double check stoves, I'll double check curling irons. Yeah, even if I don't use the stove - I'll double-check it. I've gotten a little bit better with that because I'm with Jeremy. But I think it's anything to delay it and I mean sometimes I'll kick the door because I'm mad I have to leave. I mean, not very hard - just sort of like, it's kind of like fun in a way, but really is a sort of passive-aggressive statement that I don't want to leave. [00:41:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like an honest expression of what you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (Chuckles).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling mad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (Chuckles). I mean it's so silly, but I mean I just, yeah, I mean I'm glad I'm coming forward with this before I actually have to be doing this every morning, not only that as a teacher, it's going to be early in the morning. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your time to confront it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to judge it. It's not silly. It is what it is. These are some of the anxieties that have come up for you and we're going to find a way to confront them and minimize them, but you don't have to judge yourself for having them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we stop there for today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And we're on for two weeks? Same time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But not next - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not next Monday.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: What should we do? Is there anything that you want to know or do you suppose that we just go on and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just go on. Well I thought one of the things that would be of interest to you would be the general idea of my background. Maybe I (inaudible at 0:00:43.4) or you don't think you need to know anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That means I've got to talk about something real. That's a big help. Well I didn't really get (inaudible at 0:01:02.3) to discuss except I think that one of things that troubles me about my personality generally is that it's been said by others and it's conceivable that I do have because it's true a rather passive personality type. [0:01:36.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it is yeah. It troubles me. I'd like to know which came first. You know the chicken or the egg.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will it help?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will it help to know which came first?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so because I can sort of feel and attach words to them. (inaudible at 0:01:55.7) But until I know where they sprang from, I don't think I really am getting anywhere in talking, or with myself, or thinking about it. It becomes morbid finally unless we're going to make any progress. [0:02:12.4].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It becomes morbid if you don't make progress, but I'm not sure exactly where you are understanding the why of making progress.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They why's? I don't follow you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think that you've made any progress just trying to understand why you are the way you are now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh really? I just assumed that was one of the things. Why don't you think that would be the case?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because a lot of people understand where and why their problems came from but they're not able to do anything about them to change them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I know where they are. I don't know why they are, and I can't do anything to change them. [0:03:01.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What particular area has changed then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Let's do that by all means. But anyway let me go into it for a moment whether it's right or wrong and maybe it'll explain it. The reason why I say that is the personality orientation I am is because I have noticed myself in situations where I let other people sort of run the show. I notice half the time in conversation I'm much more at ease when I can bring other people to speak to me rather than me speaking to them. I just noticed that a lot of my contemporaries find the opposite is true. Most of them prefer to talk about themselves rather than listen to somebody else talk about themselves. I don't ever do that. I don't have any talent for it especially when I'm with a close friend. [0:04:08.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have a talent for doing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: For talking about myself in that way the way others do and putting yourself on certain emotional stances. When I talk to other people, here's why I don't like to do it, I do tend to get a little bit over intense because (inaudible at 0:04:27.2) and it causes me to think about things probably in a different way than they do because they're feeling more ordinary or something. I don't know. But I get over intense and rather embarrassed talking about my part and the other person's part. So that may be one of the reasons why I do that. I did that a lot when I was younger when I was like 21 or 22 I'd really (inaudible at 0:04:52.8). I was very serious and I couldn't follow a conversation along without turning it back into something that was kind of serious. So I don't remember what I did when I was 21 or 22 in terms of other people talking to me, but I know I do it now. That bothers me. It doesn't seem that I should do that. I always do it. It's just an automatic reflex. [0:05:24.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't talk to them. I get them to talk to me. But I automatically ask them well what did you do, and then they go merrily on. Of course, I feel a little bit of just dislike for that, but I automatically cause them to do that. That's part of the whole structure that I was talking about in the beginning is screwed up. And for example, the only one that ever put it to me in those terms was the sister I had who mentioned it in a very (inaudible at 0:06:11.2) what if...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:13.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, what if I said that someone was and she was referring to me. Of course, she is anything but herself. She's a very affronting person and can do it beautifully vocally. She can listen to other people talk, and that's the only reason why I like her, because I can't talk with her. Again, it's all very serious and appropriate because we're brothers and sisters and we can talk about old scars that I couldn't with someone not in the family. But she can also talk about herself and about other people she knows with a very, very good solid and entertaining in a way and entertaining being the lesser of the two. But anyway that's one of the things that I am concerned about and wondered why. I told you quickly just to say this because of the insecurity I have with everyone in the world by virtue of my feelings about myself. But that doesn't go anywhere. That's a circular kind of thing. And I'd like to try and find some way to get a grip on that and break that circle so that I arrive at something stronger. On the one hand the easiest way and the most sure way to say it is well what you do is you simply do it and you don't really talk about it. But I can't do that. I'm the kind of person apparently that's got to have a theoretical framework as to how they relate to other people. [0:08:24.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well if you're looking for a complete theoretical framework, you've come to the wrong place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm saying I'm that kind of person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's part of what's happened in relationships with other people too because you want to have laid out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't like the ambiguity of certain situations (inaudible at 0:08:47.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me a little bit more about what happens? What I would like to see, and you opt out if you want, say that I'm a person that came in and I sit and I say tell me about yourself. [0:09:10.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: If someone did just out of the blue, I suppose I'd tell you similar to what I'm telling now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one does that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would you tell me? Just look at me and say (inaudible at 0:09:38.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wouldn't know what to say. I really wouldn't if you put it on the table.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try saying that. Try saying that. I don't know what to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to say. I'm many things. I'm the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how did you feel about saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How did I feel about saying that? I thought it was a clever mocking response. Really probably the goal that you wanted to (inaudible at 0:10:11.4). That might be what I did. [0:10:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be your goal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That might be my goal if someone did that, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Suppose the family asks about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, except on my terms. And when I finally felt that the stars were in the proper configuration I would've done...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:37.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd turn the record player up four degrees to really get it all there. That's simple shyness too. I guess the main thing is I really don't know because of the fact that I have opted out of so many relationships in general. I know, for example, that one of the causes of the difficulty is simple unadulterated fear, not a deep seated fear, but a sort of fastidious in some way although I'm really not very fastidious. In some ways I am emotionally sort of fastidious. In terms of not wanting to get involved in what might become an embarrassing scene and I think that... [0:11:47.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And being fastidious is a good way to (inaudible at 0:11:50.6) that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what's a great contrast is my friend Foley. One of the patterns of my friendships with people is very often they're unlike me in really strong ways. My friend Fitzy is entirely unlike that. I've never seen anybody so emotionally naked in the world. The guy only talks. He gets so involved with people that he flushes bright red, and he looks at people, and he's just open, and it's incredible. His ears are red and everything. It's not that he's saying anything embarrassing it's just that he's putting himself out so much. I, myself, could never ever in the world do that. I'd much prefer a light mocking response I made previously when I called it that. He might be more inclined to say something really revealing. It's one of the reasons why I like him and one of the reasons why he's such an unstable person. He takes it so far he's an unstable person. [0:12:44.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's good to a degree.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And even my brother is like that. He's willing to let his vulnerability appear at times, and you can see it in his eyes although he likes to be very practiced my older brother. (inaudible at 0:13:05.3). But at the same time he has a certain amount of vulnerability that he's not afraid to express at times either. I can see it. And that's the thing. To point out that that's the thing I respond to most strongly is that I mean my heart just goes out to him when it happens. [0:13:31.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When he's vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's really breaks me up to see him because I've got a little bit of a hero worship thing...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long have you been thinking about this stuff that you feel about right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I am. I think I recognize that I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. And as I say when I talk to people, I sort of rear back from it. I think that really in some respects I'm a very cold dispassionate person. I mean emotionally. I take a little bit of pride in being able to stand back. For example, and one of the things is, and this might be mistaken on my part, but one of the things is that there's in some people an attitude that our team is right. And this is a very strongly emotional gut reaction that they have. But I never had that point of view really. At least I attempt not to. It's just a little bit of a vanity thing in sort of a way. I kind of conceive of myself at times as being a cool dispassionate observer and watching and recognizing in some respects our team is not right. Perhaps our team is entirely wrong and realizing that to myself and entrusting that in various ways causes me maybe to seem a little negative at times. Anyway my brother George, or my friend Fitzy, if I was involved in some scrape or something, or somebody they know, even down to an ethnic thing, the other guy's absolutely wrong or absolutely right. And I don't do that emotionally much less intellectually. I don't even feel the emotion of it. I don't feel that connected to the thing. [0:15:41.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel very disconnected.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel apart from people, and I'm proud of it in some ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was going to say that's what you're here for. I mean that's probably the reason why you're here is because you don't like to be so apart from people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I guess I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And yet at the same time I feel that you have engineered this therapy to go in such a way that you won't get any closer to people. You know that you have engineered what goes on in here because you say what you want to say. [0:16:23.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I probably (inaudible at 0:16:24.6). I agree with you. I agree with you. It's very possible that I would try and do that and maybe try and make myself appear to myself and to you a certain way that isn't necessarily exactly accurate. But at the same time, I think you've got to recognize that I just can't just march in and all the sudden disobey the kind of rules that I've been living by for so long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:50.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I do try and engineer that... It seems that way. It might in fact be so. I really can't say honestly definitely. If that's the case, it shouldn't call on a person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what led you to believe that I'm going to engineer it? What did I say that specifically caused you to think that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the previous things and you said, "Shouldn't we talk about why I'm this way? And I said, "No, I don't think so." And well regardless of that we talked about that. And you didn't talk about your friends or your brother, we're talking about you. [0:17:35.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I was comparing myself. I was just trying to set up, I guess, in your mind what my picture of myself is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could I ask you once again what exactly do you think you'd like to get out of this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think I would like to get a better understanding of... I think what I'd like to do is break that circle that I was speaking of before. Try and really see a real reason, if there is a reason... [0:18:21.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now you're saying the same thing. One is I want to understand myself better and two is I think I want to change. I think I want to break that cycle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not exactly sure what it is I'm seeking to break except.... I'm not asking when I come in here to transform my personality. I'm seeking to get a better understanding of why it is that I am this way. In some ways I'm trying to get an understanding of what it is because as I mentioned the other day, there was a very sexual ambiguity to what it is exactly wrong. [0:19:13.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so I hear two goals. The first and primary one is to understand yourself; become more familiar with yourself. You want to know the ins and outs of how you work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the second is possibly break that cycle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that one will lead to the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can...</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I can recognize mechanisms in myself that are self defeating to the kind of person that I really want to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think that we need to figure out what kind of person you want to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What kind of person do I want to be? I don't know exactly. I mean I can't formulate that precisely. Do you want me to try and answer that question?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know what level exactly to respond to it, but I'll respond to it as a first approximation in a way. As I mentioned before I am concerned that I am involved on an impending change of events that are going to cripple my (inaudible at 0:20:39.0) in the seeing the world. So I want to understand what it is and why it is that those things are happening. It could be simple childish textual topography to behave the way I do in some instances. It could be something a lot stronger. And the reason why I wanted to do that is because I have a vision of myself acting effectively in the world dealing with people. [0:21:07.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'd like to hear what your vision of being effective in the world is for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: An outstanding vision of it would be being in politics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you're telling me what you would do and how would you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How would I behave in politics?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of a person would you be? How would you go about accomplishing that? What would you be like? What would the personality structure be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think the personality structure would be... I don't know. I can only explain it in the negative. It would different than I am now. It would be a stronger, warmer, more forceful person obviously. I think that politicians very often give off a certain magic that people sense about them. Good politicians do. It might be artifice. I don't know. But there is. There's a chemical action in a good politician. I met George (inaudible at 0:22:10.2). He's probably one of the most inept politicians (inaudible at 0:22:14.0). He's got a very strong.... You feel that the guy could really do something. That he's a real person. Paul Timan (sp?) is that way. And I like that idea. I like that idea of dealing with important issues that concern everyone and speaking for what you believe to be the correct way the proper principles. [0:22:52.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your ideal personality includes such things as dealing with important issues and saying what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Dealing with important issues in a way that I think they should be dealt with and I'm going to sway the populace to deal with them in that way. That's another gratifying aspect, for example, being a politician persuasion. It's definitely in anything. I'm not confining it exclusively to politics. But anybody that becomes a leader of anything has a certain morale of force to them. And they become a leader in their bloody trade association. They speak to the things that concern everyone in the organization. That's something I think I could do. If I were out of this... [0:23:42.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you desperately...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I think I could do if I were out of this mess. And it seems to me to be evidentially worthwhile gratifying to the ego and the invisible hand of Adam Smith striking an analogy and it's gratifying to you and conceivably you're doing something good too. Obviously I'm not picturing myself as (inaudible at 0:24:16.1). I envision myself as doing something that I believe in educating people with talking between people. One of the things that really most strongly moves me, the reason why I find it so emotional about the thing is I'm really gripped by the utter pathos, and the horror, and drama of an Eros struggle. I really am. It's really enormously moving and tremendously distorting thing and a human thing. (inaudible at 0:25:01.6). Those things is appealing and honestly to be at Martin Luther King's side in some effective way. [0:25:24.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the kind of thing you like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I really do. But it's very difficult. (inaudible at 0:25:34.8) You've got to be pretty strong. You've got to have a certainty about yourself. Certainty proceeds from some kind of chemistry that goes on in you. I mean men can be absolutely certain and project great certainty about themselves and be ridiculously wrong, but they are effective because they have that chemical thing going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd rather have that effect you than what you have now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think what I've got now is fairly (inaudible at 0:26:14.3) approach and so that would be very gratifying. I think it would be worth something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now I feel like I know a little bit more about what you're in here for. (inaudible at 0:26:47.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well as I say I don't mean to sound exclusive in terms of politics although that is the strongest (inaudible at 0:27:01.6). So that's part of it. You know what strikes me as so pathetic about that though is that given someone that isn't practical, if someone with my particular disability would entertain such a notion. It's such at odds with what I really am. The absolute symbiote of sexuality and training himself to be a great political leader is pathetic; disgustingly cheap kind of sanity. [0:27:34.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you disgusted with yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am at this moment for being so ordinary that it has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What has nothing to it; you're dreams, or what you are now, or what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dream. It proceeds so easily and perfectly from what I am now young blood flexing him muscle, and he's real power. He's going to be Paul Bunion. I mean if you want to see somebody that's vulnerable, there's somebody that vulnerable is entertaining those kinds of notions about yourself. [0:28:12.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I thought that's kind of what you're doing. Oh, my God (inaudible at 0:28:17.1).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not why I said that. I objectively believe that. I mean it is. Maybe I'm too critical but if you take a quick remove, and you're not really concerned with the person at issue, that would be an immensely power kind of thing. So imagine what a writer with a malicious intent would make out of such a person. And what's awful about it is it really does motivate me. That dream does motivate me. In a way I think it motivates... I mean for being here so I can be myself... [0:29:10.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what's awful about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it's so common. I wish I had a more maybe mature grasp of my potentiality in what I am and arrive at some commonly stated fairly well reasoned stable conception of my ability. The thing that I'm talking about there is (inaudible at 0:29:34.8). But those are the things that really do move me. Because when I hear Martin Luther King speeches in Washington's speeches I think those are the greatest emotional things ever. It does motivate me. And what I'm saying is I think it's cheap. I don't like it in others, and I don't like to think of myself as having a lot of the cheap spun cotton candy, and oysters, and stuff myself. It's disgusting to me when I see that in others and I'm pretty critical (inaudible at 0:30:23.8) indulging herself frequently in childish things of that nature. But it is something that motivates me. If you take that away, I'd give myself a break. But I give my brother... Because the negative extremes that motivate him move me very strongly probably because I (inaudible at 0:30:48.8). On the other hand I think they're intellectual unrespectable and unemotionally unrespectable in certain circumstances. But when I see him engage and try to act out those fears, I'm really moved by it. I recognize his need for it and it is childish but sometimes I'm critical of him. But when I see that, the raw me, I never feel critical. I just feel uncomfortable rather than (inaudible at 0:31:21.3). And when I think of myself in that way, I think of myself as being stronger than he is. I do sometimes think I'm stronger than he is. [0:31:35.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think (inaudible at 0:31:35.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't think that I have the deep need I guess that he does. I'm not trying to be...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To fulfill those goals.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think I have the need for all the things that he does. He has a desperate need for your approval. I recognize there's a great irony in my saying that. But anyway he has a great need for the approval of others (inaudible at 0:32:00.1). I recognize he has that and I have felt myself that I don't really need all that. He I am a nervous wreck. He seems to be one more strongly than I do that acted that way. But people who reject me I would retire to myself, but he wouldn't. He'd figure out a new way to get back in there and get and be accepted by them. He became very adapt at all the maneuvers that go on. [0:32:39.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of you admires him for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the technique and his guts for another. And partly I think that I have thought that (inaudible at 0:33:05.3). Maybe I shouldn't feel sorry for him at all because he's the one that got the guts, and I'm the one that doesn't. I'm the one to be pitied rather than him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There is conjecture in that. How do you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: How do I feel about it? I don't know. I could say what I think about it, but I don't know how I really feel about it. [0:33:39.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:33:42.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think in some ways he is more to be because I think he really does need that more than I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's factions from those things that he's talking about that really aren't that strong. I don't know. We're talking on two levels you see because I'm relating to my brother in some respects to a very superficial social of viewing people. And on the other hand there's a certain need, a real need for the approval of people, and being with them, and being in them, and among them. [0:34:33.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we don't know exactly what we're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm talking about it on two levels. I think that he really does need that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he doesn't do that stuff with people though?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:34:48.8) for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I envy him and there's things I feel sorry for him because I think in some ways he's going to fail at it. I don't find me wishing that upon him. I don't think I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I hear, I hear John the vulnerable talking right now in terms of boy you wish you could do that but thinking you might get hurt that you're also being vulnerable of getting caught saying, "Hey look, I want this." [0:35:19.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's a very strong thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:24.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. I have a very strong feeling about never wanting to appear to want something too much and just maintaining my cool about it; never appearing to strive too hard. That's death because you might fail.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what was the other side of the coin?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what was the other side of the coin?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The other side of the coin is if you strive hard enough you might not get it, you might win after all. [0:36:04.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're caught in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that (inaudible at 0:36:09.7)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It smells of a chicken coup. It's totally new.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see that that's not right and that's probably the only reason why I'm going forward with you this whole apathy thing. (inaudible at 0:36:35.4). It's so obvious but it is totally limiting on my part because I just can't bring myself to (inaudible at 0:36:47.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't say what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't let others know because then they'll (inaudible at 0:37:01.2) and so they really won't. [0:37:02.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you expecting that double line here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've been reflecting similar example a few moments ago where you said, "I would like to be in politics." "I would like to be a respected political leader." But that brings it closer and afraid that to even express around here but that is your duty if that's what you want.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it is but the thing that's disgusting about it is that it comes from and flows out of such dreck you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it does. It flows from a closed in frightened little person who no longer needs (inaudible at 0:37:49.4) as long as I don't do it of course. If I do this would be a challenge wouldn't it? It would be kind of marvelous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on right now? [0:38:05.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm thinking that that's probably right. I hadn't thought of it exactly in those terms but it would be marvelous if I did it. I had to take a jump from (inaudible at 0:38:22.6) where I could accept it if I did it, it would be good. But anyway my point and my emotional reaction to it is that the reason I feel that way about it that I think they're so common and ordinary by mere virtue in fact that I would entertain such a na�ve notion about what I could be. But that of itself proves that I'm really not a person of dimension because a person of dimension... This is probably a very elaborate explanation but a person of the dimension required wouldn't think any terms. They wouldn't go on one hand they're contesting themselves as totally ineffectual and then on the other hand those conception totally amicable. And they would have a certain more slowly, or supplements about, a way of proceeding. (inaudible at 0:39:30.6). I'm defining myself really when I'm engaging in that kind of thinking. Maybe I'm just defining myself. They're saying that people are because they're not needy; therefore, I'm not accepting can I be in the world. [0:39:52.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:39:57.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Differentiated from what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More differentiated than the respected political leader.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean what kind of creed?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of creed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What specific kind of things would I do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Or what specific kinds and ways would you want to be a leader?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well without talking about what kind of issues or anything I think the way that I'd like to do it to be an orator and I would like to be able to move people the way Martin Luther King moved people because I think that he was marvelous. [0:40:50.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:53.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that would be really enormously gratifying. And actually I think I would put it great us. I couldn't to bad use in any moral sense. I couldn't be irresponsible political demigod being the kind of person that I am and the kind of things that I've gone through. If I ever were to become good at it, I couldn't turn aside all the anguish and mental conversion I've gone through I don't think unless... I just couldn't I don't think. [0:41:29.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You trust to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would trust myself to speak to the best emotions in people because I do want to speak to that. I want it very badly, but I'm frustrated all the time because of my ability, as I say, to really communicate very well with people. So this has been kept back in me. I can't do it in simple ways that some people can do things by looking at each other, or things going on, I just don't have that. I'm too excited. So this causes again this whole fantasy proceeds from the frustration I have being unable to talk to myself. If I found a girl that I could marry tomorrow, and have children, and could love, and could do a decent job, that kind of sanity would take away. I may be gratified by the communication I had with her and (inaudible at 0:42:20.3). But these things that's where ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's where you are right now. [0:42:24.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's where I am right now. And if I didn't in my life took a different kink and I were to get involved with something that's what I would do. (inaudible at 0:42:37.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I certainly don't have anything. I agree with you that your goals may change tomorrow, but I think that you have a great view of now of what those goals are, and being able to admit that you have them, and admit those steps you're taking to reach them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing about those goals I think is that those are just, as I say; I don't know that they're really goals as such. What I'm really seeking is the gratification that comes from doing those kinds of things. And I suppose that if I just had a moment at all to see that kind of gratification from another vehicle, I wouldn't be nearly as motivated to allow myself to talk to people. [0:43:22.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of sounds like you're defining your goals more specifically in terms of what the gratifications are. They're everywhere for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Communications is the one. You always feel like you're moving someone, you're influencing them that they respond to you, that you're important to them. Even the power of it; that's one of the good things that I might be interested in. It isn't having power over them, it's really making them responsive and that would be a gratification in itself. [0:44:12.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I try an experiment with you? Say I walk in and I want (inaudible at 0:44:21.4). Gee that's a really nice tie you've got. (inaudible at 0:44:41.9) What does that do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well any event that I ever encountered personally like that I think that they're a goldmine for me to work with. [0:45:06.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would that easy...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Someone that would be so shattered by my just sitting there...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm saying pretend that you were me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I see. I thought you were....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And pretend I'm you and I'm trying to impress you with by what I say. I want to get close enough yet I'm scared that they're going to rebuff me so I say, "Gee I really like that tie." And then the fear clicks in and I say, "Oh, but I don't have any." Okay, what I'm saying is that's what I see you doing. It's funny but it's obviously very human the way that were saying you've got things you want to accomplish but being very afraid, being vulnerable about getting a response at the time. [0:46:11.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see that perfectly. I probably would make people react in a negative way. I just really ask for it I suppose. You know complimenting someone, for example, in some way and then behaving yourself in a compliment for a certain compliment. And that's true. I think it's an acceptable occurrence. And that just comes from a negative feeling that I have about myself I think. I mean those things they don't make logical sense, but those are things that really motivate me at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel that you aren't an adequate compliment giver.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel that I don't deserve to have anyone respond to me when I do the kinds of things that people assume. Whether I deserve or don't is really level, they will not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They won't? [0:47:23.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No they will not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sure of that? (inaudible at 0:47:30.5) they just don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, they will not. Because I know I do that. I hate to say it but that's possibly something that I do and it proceeds from there to (inaudible at 0:47:40.9) something I frequently do find when talking to someone that we have more negative things in common. That's the nature of people. And if you involved yourself in hypocrisy then (inaudible at 0:47:59.8). As I say, the problem, and I can understand it because it's partly physical what the problem is in this case, what my main problem is that how do I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really do feel that way about myself really strongly and that's difficult. I could take remedial action in terms of somewhat maybe delayed (inaudible at 0:48:41.0) getting stronger control of myself better. I don't have control of myself and watch what I say and control myself if possible. [0:48:58.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you done?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm not. I thought that I could but the obvious conclusion is that it wouldn't incidentally really going to work. I've got to try to rise it to merely some stronger orientation of myself so that I wouldn't have to apologize for having the dream about myself. [0:49:32.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think both of us manage our goals that we're going to set. I hope we will be able in terms of accepting ourselves more and more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See the thing is the moment you said that accepting myself more and more, I could feel the hair on the back of my neck go up because there's something about that that really does rub me the wrong way as it were. [0:50:14.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that again comes down to the thing I have... And let me just express it and not make any judgment on whether it's normal. It's that I think that if I work to accept myself the way I am (inaudible at 0:50:43.5)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you were able to accept yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If I were able to do that I think a certain way that's self imposing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is that self imposing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that sounds peculiar but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it sound peculiar to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, you're question you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it sound peculiar to call that self indulgent? Does that sound peculiar to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds odd. I recognize it being... I think what I'm responding to is maybe your reaction, maybe to my own reaction, I don't know what, but it's a paradox to me. I recognize on the one hand it's very stupid, and foolish, and negative to say accepting yourself is self indulgent. That doesn't make any real sense. But on the other hand, maybe you shouldn't accept yourself. Maybe there's certain aspects about yourself that are contemptible, and I don't want to accept those parts of myself. And I hope I'm not being too easy with this. Maybe it's an old Catholic concept of punishing yourself for certain aspects of your personality. I almost prefer the self flagellation or whatever, to finding yourself liberated and free. [0:52:16.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean the only point... What I really.... I can't (inaudible at 0:52:22.4) it very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I hear you. I hear you. I hear you right on. I mean there's no problem in understanding what you're saying because it's a very, very frequent thing that I do that I think almost everybody does. And I think that that's probably the biggest cause of your ulcer. And if you're going get Catholic about I could quote the phrase that Jesus Christ saying love others as yourself. Now the presupposition that's there is to love yourself. And it's mighty hard to love other people if you don't love yourself and that means accepting yourself. Accept yourself as forgiven or what ever you want to do but accept it, and start off from there, and go on from there because otherwise, it's like sweeping yourself under the rug, and you can't even get up the rug wall (inaudible at 0:53:26.7) is no good. It's like... [0:53:34.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can get it and I can recognize that. What I'm really describing... I shouldn't have brought theology into this because it intellectualizes it. It's strictly emotional.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's a very real emotional reaction that you're faking what's going on with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, probably the strongest sort of reaction. I remember telling Crocker one time something about this and I really was surprised at my intensity when I spoke to him strongest thing I felt (inaudible at 0:54:13.9). I was really surprised when I walked out the intensity of my emotion when I was telling him about what a rotten guy and how appropriate I thought it was that had gone in there. That wasn't cheap. I wasn't saying poor, poor me, I'm really a rat. And see aren't I really kind of good because I think I'm a rat. That was really, I think a legitimate... [0:54:37.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's how you felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A legitimate impression of how I felt about it. So I guess that's kind of a venal reaction too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I don't how we're (inaudible at 0:54:57.0) but I'd like to say something in words that I hope you know I'm pro-normal. Most people are not normal even by the time you're done with this. And that is I really believe that the only way you can improve yourself is by accepting yourself the way you are to start out with and saying hey it's going to be okay. You're okay the way you are. I like you. And then I think you're going to find things are going to be easier to change and make better. [0:55:29.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really simple minded about (inaudible at 0:55:35.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I know. I know people think that and I thought that too and I know that there have been times what my reaction is, but I am so irritated with my personality, the way I would respond. And I just get so exacerbated and it's just like throwing knives at myself which gives me less energy, less ability to change, less motivation, less everything. And if I say okay I see that thing happening right now or closing up on me, I'm barely there, I say, oh, it's happening again. Oh, okay, that's the way it is. Fine. Glad to see you back. You're proud of me and just accept that, it's going to be easier to do something about it. At least that's one truth about myself, and I find that truth a lot. It's not client. When you accept yourself, rather than admitting that you never want things to change, but I think it's a very good indicator that change is coming. [0:56:53.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:57:02.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:57:04.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sounds so cad. I feel like I read that before. I feel like I read my own case history before in so many Sunday supplements in mind kind of things and I wonder if we should avoid this one. And I know what we're really talking about now... I'm guilt ridden because, I don't know, I'm really confused about it. That's what I think. I really don't know how I should react to it. [0:57:47.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well do you have five minutes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I (inaudible at 0:57:58.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well one of the ways that I explain my coming here to myself was to say that I naturally know... I don't know. I didn't mean to say that. I thought to myself well this is business that I'm going through may be all bullshit. After all to be honest to (inaudible at 0:58:42.1). And often times I think that some of the things that they did let themselves get away with some of it guided by those conventions of their terms. It's probably really sounds of pretentious and rude in the way I say it. I guess it is. But that's the way I explain it because I really can't. I'm trying. To be honest I have a strong mental reservation that this... I'm not entirely very acceptable of... [0:59:27.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so I'm cheating on you a little bit. I recognize that probably it is a crucial thing. I don't want to, but I just don't... I mean it isn't so bad though because you shouldn't expect someone to come in absolutely free and sold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're right. I don't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't mean to say that I'm going to be sold. I'm going to be selling myself, and if I start to make connections that I wouldn't otherwise make, then I know I'm sold. The only thing about it is that this sounds so easy, and I guess I'm really stressing what I said before and responding to it. I'm just really stressing. [1:00:08.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not so easy. I'd like to believe it, and I want to believe, but it just sounds so easy, and I've heard it so many times before (inaudible at 1:00:16.9) and everywhere...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you already try it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No I haven't tried it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Can you remember that; that you haven't tried it? I have a constant experiment for you and that is sometime this week when you're aware of that happening, (inaudible at 1:00:38.6) and say that's all right, I'm doing better. That's all right. Try it and see what happens. And I don't mean like a hawk but just remember. Just try and keep in mind what I asked you to do. I'm not trying to play (inaudible at 1:01:06.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I know. I know that that's a bad choice of words. I'm probably a little bit surprised that I'm so damned backwards in some ways. You know surprised at myself. I should just be able to accept what you're saying, but I did want to express that to you because I didn't have to, and I could've held that back, and we could've been a gaining a little bit and that wouldn't have been so good either. [1:01:35.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm glad you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As I say, its just one of those things that's the most reaction (inaudible at 1:01:42.1) go away instantly. So you're probably going to become, as we continue, very tedious for you to see me goes through this kind of reaction when I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not really tedious because I'm very interested in people. And I'm interested in the way people work and I see this. Even in listening to you tonight, I understand myself better why I play that same game, and I do do it. I can sit here and tell you about it. And I have popped through some areas but I haven't managed to do that in all areas. Part of it is accepting very humanness. How we each fall into that shell. [1:02:39.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't want you to get the idea that I think you're stupid because you're not stupid. Like I say, I do it, I know, everyone I know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It offends my vanity both that I'm doing it if I am...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, could you accept your vanity for a moment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah I guess I could. I do anyway. I don't know why that causes to me laugh so much, but I get the biggest cherry out of this. I really do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [1:03:35.1]</p>

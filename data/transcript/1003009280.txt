<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were talking about they were closing down dealerships, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, my wife got very upset -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> With the [INAUDIBLE] and we uh, we've had a short term separation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, then when she found out I got a good team working for me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I forgot to shut that off, I'm sorry.  That's not good for your recording.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No that's okay, just shows what happens.  Nice rhythm to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you, I'll shut it off and I also have last couple of weeks I've been living alone which is, you know, not really good for me.  I'm not good at living alone -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, then we found out my attorney found this guys who's like really tight with the lady from the IRS, like, they're like, uh, I don't know the relationship but it looks like it's going to turn out where the IRS is going to give me one year, even though I have the penalties and interest.  Which is a lot of money and not ask for any payments because they understand automotive is in the same position I'm in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And give me a chance and give automotive a chance to get back together again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I can build the business back up again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, this guy that's working with her also cut uh, uh, cutting uh, I'm sorry this guys working with the state.  Also cut a phenomenal deal with my personal and corporate tax that I owed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's like really dropped way down and uh, that made my wife a lot happier.  She was really, I shouldn't be talking to this recorder but she was scared she was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Going to lose her house -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, they were going to take her jewelry and clothes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And everything else, that, that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like Bernie Maydoff of something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bernie Maydoff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, where, yeah, exactly and you know, it's like this, you know, you're a minnow in the pond now.  They're going after people who have bank accounts in Switzerland -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or they want they're Social Security Numbers and everything -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> "Right, right."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they're going to work with you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, we just got this news the other day so um, uh, we had to wait to go to, that we're leaving for and I wasn't supposed to go but now I can go and that made me feel really, really good; because I haven't slept a lot but, well and uh, uh, even with the uh, Lexapro I've been depressed because, you know, my grandmother used to say, "Only a stone should be alone."  You know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Only stones should be alone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I can't, yeah, I can't walk into a restaurant and eat a meal by myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh, really.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even though you, you know, I'm an extravert kind of guy -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm probably really not, but um, things seem to be shifting back -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> To a position that makes me very hopeful and happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how's the mood doing now?  I mean you, you were depressed, you had lost your um, father and stuff.  Now you've got the uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still have dreams about him at night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Married now, um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, you know, it took me years to, as you know, uh, he died when we finally became friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, uh, there's times I still grieve the loss -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The house is up for sale.  I don't go there with my brother and sister to remove things.  I said, "Take whatever you want."  I, I just don't, I can't deal with it.  Um, so there's times I get very, very sad and then there's times I'm okay.  But I don't get those, well, you, but I know what bipolar is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're either like superman or you're, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You're, you're like a dog -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I, I never get the highs -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I'm either okay or I'll get lonely and depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Does that make sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Makes sense to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And um, uh, I've actually this is, lately I've been really working, really, really hard which makes me feel good about myself -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to do things that make me feel good about myself and actually maybe this little separation was good; because it get's me going, I don't have a codependent person -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Allowing me to, you know, like get lazy or feel sorry for myself or whatever -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you've got to be more self sufficient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.  Which I'm not used to doing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something like that, um-hum.  Yep there's something good about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I mean, don't get me, don't get me wrong, I mean, you know, when you're sleeping alone at night in a hotel room -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not a lot of fun but I think things are going to get back together pretty quick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well [NAME OTHER] at the wedding will be in the same, in the same bed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's a recorder on so I'm not going to make certain jokes but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I appreciate you're humor, uh, [LAUGHING], that's all right, um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I'm going to try all the persuasion I can.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right so what's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've had my ups and downs, I mean I'll be honest with you, um, um, there was a TV, well when they closed down these Chrysler stores yesterday -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Alaska's, it's been around forever, I don't know them -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum are they closing them down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're down and uh, they built a little Bohemian Museum -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They were supporting this town and I, and this older guy, who had to be in his 70s, he was the originator and he has [INAUDIBLE] around since 1920.  He was wiping tears from his eyes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I started crying.  I felt really bad for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you know when they do all those things.  It's an end of an era, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, things are changing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And GM dealerships too are getting shut down.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's about 2600 or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well people were saying, you know, why are they getting closed down, you know.  Why them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I know why but we have to go back to the 60s and I don't know, if you want your recording to go that long, but I know why -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, the benefits are giving the people uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I know they're talking, I mean, they, they have to deal with all this stuff -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They put too many stores, they had too many stores to begin with and the benefits that were given to retirees -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then in the 60s the guys were, you know, we didn't have the Japanese coming in to our market.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So they got real smart and goofy, they were leaving wrenches and door panels and figure, you know, nobody can touch us we're GM -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then you know, the Japanese came in and said, you know, Ford used to have the mentality I could drive 100,000 miles on an oil change.  Well Honda came in and say every 3000 miles you get an oil change, in other words, we, how do I say it politely, GM shot themselves in the foot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let's put it that way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now I got this guy Obama, I don't want to get political that's not what I'm here for -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think he's going to turn this country socialist.  I'm really worried about that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He is a wonderful speaker, he's better then Clinton -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And Clinton was good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I, I, I think he's, he's going to try to make this a socialist country.  I mean, you know, the way he's talking with, you know, one thing about Bush that, you know, they, they give Bush no credit for nothing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But you know what, since 9/11 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we haven't had any attacks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly and now he wants to, you know, let all, let all these horrible people back out.  Where are we going to put them, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, they're, they're, yeah I know.  There are some thoughts that the 9/11 thing was a giant conspiracy that, planned in advance designed to have the government take control of certain things and start a war that was, uh, give endowment essentially to certain contractors and keep them in business Hal Burden perhaps being one of them or something like that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And so what, what they're saying -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, like the Kennedy's con, conspiracy?  I'm sorry go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, what they're saying is, is that a lot of um, the Obama's and the Bush's they're all good buddies and friends and stuff like that and a lot of these people, that people locked up they're all from Saudi Arabia or what, any how they're saying that they thought it may have been a preordained thing or this is what's going to happen and you know, they're saying the government knew it was going to happen but they let it happen.  It goes back to sort of theory of Pearl Harbor, that FDR was warned -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They broke the code.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, that these people are coming and they said, "Well you know what, let them come, that'll get us in to World War II, in time to save England and a time to deal with the Japs and, you know, do all that stuff."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's only one thing I see that comes out of war -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So they pull all the aircraft carriers out; because they said that we need those, but battleships screw them.  So they left the battleships behind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Double carriers.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing I see about war -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And most people had died, in my opinion, through religious wars -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is the fact that um, in countries -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It decreases population growth which they can't have, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's one of those natural checks on population is war and famine, pestilence, you know, I mean very natural checks on population growth -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Throughout time.  Typically when you grow to a certain boundary where your lands can no longer support your people you look to expand.  Hey, look over there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well because the little idiot in North Korea -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, you know, they let him shot off his ballistic missile, you know, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, God we're on recorder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The guys in the porno, the guys in to in, you know, in to uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure he's been [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And this guys a nut case, I mean, I never would have, I mean, personally I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Would have shot that missile down and said, "You fire that missile we're going to flatten your whole country."  You know, you want give up all your people and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, in some ways North Korea maybe doing it for blackmail saying, "We'll shoot up the missiles so now you give us a few billion dollars and we won't shoot up anymore missiles."  It's like saying, "Okay we can do it, what are you going to pay us so we don't do it again?"</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's like pay us so we don't blow up Japan.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Our country is broke -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean if everybody called in our Americas right now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We'd have to go to war and kill them all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We can't pay it off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Go bankrupt, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We would be, we would be, we're in major, major, major, we're printing money that doesn't exist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that's my, my, I'm giving you my opinion.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well you think there might be inflation someday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Someday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well that's what they're kind of hoping to get reinflation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Social Security is going to go away sooner than they say -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well they're going to have socialization how are they going to get rid of Social Security.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, I don't know it's uh, these are very, very, very in my opinion, uh, not scary but very um, I can't finger on the times.  You know, I, I don't know, I mean this Obama guy, I'm not knocking him, but he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know his wife was in college she wrote a paper on separatism.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Separatism.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Separatism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Separatism from what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Race.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, like segregation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, sir, you know and, you know, Obama you know, he even resented about this thing about uh, Guantanamo.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, you let these terrorist out, I mean, these are known people who want to kill us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think it's just going to move them to Wyoming.  That's the plan I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not to let them go just to move them around.  They're going to close Guantanamo but you know, some people who are judged harmless, quote unquote will go back home and other people they will move them to Wyoming or whatever.  Ah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whatever, I mean, I can't run this country.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so how is your medicine.  Let's go over, what are you taking now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, uh, I'm taking the Ambien and by the way that really help me.  Remember you gave me the one and half at night -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That helped me get more sleep.  Especially now with what's going on so, so I think you gave me 45 of Ambien last month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm taking the um, you gave me a choice, you put on the prescription -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of the uh, the Vicodin because that 10/660 they're having a hard time manufacturing it or getting it so whatever they have in stock either 750 or the 10/60 -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You allowed me to have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One just had more Tylenol in it.  Um, I'm taking the Valium uh, 4 times a day 5 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I've got some Lexapro left but you can uh, give me some Lexapro -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, you're taking, so can they find the 10/660s?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I, they never know.  You know, Walgreens has this $4.00 prescription deal or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So the, you go there and all the sudden you give them the prescription and he gives you uh, six tablets and then the problems is then they try to fax you and then I get refused.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's sounds like I'm asking you for more than I'm supposed to have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right are you taking Lyrica anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no I stopped Lyrica a long time ago -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're still on Lexapro just are you taking 20 or 10?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I would like 10, 20 is I don't know, I think it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right.  So, Ambien, Valium, um, the Vicodin -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which you're taking for your pain for your back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How would you say that's doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm, I'm, I even take Advil too, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would say I'm probably about an eight; because two of the discs are pressing on my uh, what do they call it, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> On your nerves there back there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah it's the uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It hurts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll tell you in a second, not the spinal cord it's pressing on something which is causing the pain -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I've got six of them, that's the problem.  Two in the neck -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two across the upper chest and two in the lower back and now I'm on a soft mattress in a motel and make me [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to put a pillow underneath me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I've got [INAUDIBLE] one side.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But um, hopefully getting back with my wife makes me happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean if you'd seen me a couple of days ago I wouldn't have been a happy camper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got you, so you understand the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the medication.  Treatment plan to your satisfaction, you're okay with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean the risks, benefits?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, do you understand the medication, how it works and the risks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it can't kill me though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, anything's possible.  I don't think -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pardon me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Anything is possible, I don't think it's likely -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think it's going to be killing you.  Take too much of it and it can so don't, don't take -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no well I can't because, just take it the way I'm supposed to and I'll be okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, even my wife can tell she'd been calling me, things are getting, are getting better between us -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I knew this was probably going to happen when she found out the amount, the amount I owed.  Once she found out what they're doing for me -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She had happier, she was afraid of losing, you know, being thrown out on the street and that's what got me thrown out on the street [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, all right well sir, I think we're all set.  Let me turn this off, I want to see you back in a month.</p>

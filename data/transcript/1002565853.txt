<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Give this to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You going away this summer or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll be away for a week in July.  First vacation since January.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to Florida in July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In July?  My god.  Wow, why for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a conference down there I have to go to at the beginning of the week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And yourself, you getting away this summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm going June 7th to, uh, Outer Banks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's like next week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And I haven't realized it's next week.  I'm not ready.  I haven't even thought about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you've been to Hilton Head.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've been to Hilton Head but I've never been, they went to the Outer Banks a couple years ago and they really liked it, so they're going back again.  And I didn't go before, I didn't go with them and I'm going this time.  See what happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is another tennis?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [NAME OTHER] and her husband will be there which is going to be, we're not talking right, well, we're, she's doing my money.  I gave her, she asked me if I wanted her to do my, see, when I retired I got a lump sum that, I got $7,000 for, um vacation money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Vacation money.  But I was that much in debt and plus that much in debt, so she asked me if I wanted her to do her money out of the blue one day while we're sitting for breakfast.  And since I can't say no to her for anything, I made the mistake of saying yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she's doing my, she's taking care only that portion of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of the $7,000.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the $7,000.  So so far we've, uh, she just, uh, I don't know, she just doesn't, um, she got [NAME OTHER] to talk me into doing the front window, uh, the basement windows, you know, I needed a new basement window but I needed a front door more than I needed the window.  But he don't know how to do doors, you know, and how to do the windows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] is her husband?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Husband.  Yeah, she's got, you know, they're pretty much back together [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, they're pretty much, you know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he did the window but not the front door?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, he did the door, I mean, he did the window because that's what he can do.  And he did, and he did, but he did some things, uh, that were not cool.  I mean, I didn't say nothing to her, I let it go.  Like he charged me extra for things that I told him not to do.  He charged me more money.  I told him not to move things and he moved it anyway.  You know, he put, in order to do the job the way he wanted to do he had to put all new pipes in.  Well, originally he didn't tell me he had to do that.  He had to just simply put one plate in but what he did was when he put the new cabinet in, which was 19 inch which was what I wanted, he wanted to put a 24 inch in but in order to do what he wanted to do he moved my cabinet over more, which in a way it's good, I'm not complaining about that part of it, I'm complaining about the fact that he—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Charged you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did it without my permission.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And charged you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And charged me.  And then he did the window and instead of putting one piece in, he built the window off of two separate pieces and a block in the middle, which are fine, it looks okay, but he could have done it with, so what I think he, what happened was he had these blocks and he wanted to use them, so he did all the work and built it up and charged me a lot of money for the cement it took to build it up.  You know, and then he did a little bit of cement work on my patio and left the one piece undone, like on the step how the step goes like this, well the top, he cemented from here to here and a left a big gaping kind of like hole that was already there, it was there, but he didn't cement it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, he cemented everything else but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One of the biggest things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the most obvious was above the steps, you see.  You know, so he did a little kind of like nasty type thing that I would, and she brought him, she didn't directly bring him to my attention.  She would, she said, "Well," she said, "you're getting the front payments, uh, done in a year, right?"  And that would include that piece.  And I said, "Yeah."  My neighbor next door, the new neighbor wants to get that done in a year.  He already asked me.  Told me we were going to get it paved.  So, um, so that, she wanted, I guess she wanted to see if I would say something but I just, I usual, I let it go.  And then he hacked the wood downstairs.  There's a piece of wood that he hacked down.  Well, he did the exact same hacking as [NAME OTHER] did on the front door that he said was such a horrible job.  He did the exact same thing.  He hacked this one piece instead of smoothing it out and leave it, he could have smoothed it when he cut the, if he had of cut it he could have smoothed it, but he hacked it exactly like [NAME OTHER] had the basement door, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So now it's matching.  Matching [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, if I took pictures of both of them and compare them they're, uh, they're similar, they're very similar.  You know, but so he did nasty things.  And, you know, the funny part about [NAME OTHER] is I always defended him when [NAME OTHER] would tell me to lie to him about where we were going and he asked me I would tell him the truth.  If he asked me whose party was taking place at his house, I would tell him.  I never ever talked down about him or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, I didn't.  So he's, I don't know what he's trying to do or what he's trying to prove or whatever.  I don't know.  I don't think she has any feelings for me at all other than she has the desire to, um, uh, maybe fix what she did wrong before when she did my money, because she was cruel and mean and she's trying not to be cruel and mean but she's getting there.  But I'm aggravating her so she feels justified now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To be cruel and mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, she feels, because she's been real nice up to, she hasn't screamed or yelled, now she's starting to scream and yell so I guess she must be getting close to her goal of whatever she's wanting to accomplish because she accomplished what she wanted to do.  [NAME OTHER] got $1,175 of my money by doing the work.  Of course I benefitted by it, you know, [INAUDIBLE], even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted, I wanted a door.  I told her I wanted a door.  Well, [NAME OTHER] can do the window and, yeah, I told someone else they could do that window, [NAME OTHER] and she didn't want that to happen, so she talked me into doing it.  And of course I don't know why I can't say no to her, I have no clue.  I just can't say no to her.  I don't know what it is.  It's like she's my mother and I can't say no to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You still needed to get the door done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I still needed to get the door done.  And I still need three windows.  And I, the window in the basement could have waited.  It could have been the last thing I needed done.  And then he went to fix the toilet and I, down in the basement and I did say no to him.  I said that is the least, least on my list of priorities.  But he's a plumber, so that's what he wanted to do.  So I told him no.  And then she says to me, "I'm not going, you know, you complained about this, that, and the other."  I did do a little complaining.  And, um, she said, "I'm not going to have [NAME OTHER] do anything anymore.  I saved you a lot of money."  You know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera  And so, uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if she's ever been a friend or a foe.  I really don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds like she's a part of your life and connected and not leaving it and, you know, you go through ups and downs like many friendships do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Many downs.  More downs than up.  So I'm [INAUDIBLE] this vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, you're going on vacation together again.  How many years is this in a row now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know.  I haven't been going with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Didn't you go to Hilton Head last year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm not going this year either.  They go in October.  I have no desire to go.  I don't feel like going 12 hours to play tennis for a week when I can stay home and play and save me a lot, and then the money.  They're going to, uh, Lake Tahoe in the winter, I may go there, but I love Tahoe and those in spring.  I mean, I lived there.  I lived in Sacramento.  So I don't know if I really want to go in the winter.  They ski so, but I might, I don't know.  Let's see how money is.  You know, I'm not real, I'm not abundantly wealthy at the moment because my pension's a little shorter than I thought it was going to be, even though I got that money, that big lump sum, that I can't touch that.  I can't, I'm about to touch $2,000 because my car broke, but I can't, I got $3,000 more than I expected to get so I want to stay within the realm of $3,000, you know, and not touch what I thought I was going to have so that it grows.  You know, I cannot touch that money because it's the only thing I got, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a nest egg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's it.  You know, um, I wouldn't have had that if I didn't get in that draw program.  If I had retired the normal way I would have had a better pension, but I wouldn't have that money.  You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're still doing some work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I work at [DEIDENTIFIED] which is why I'm sick.  Kids keep making me sick.  Yeah, I keep getting sick.  This is the second time.  But, um, in fact, last night I said to my doctor why don't you just write me another prescription because I'm going to get sick again because these kids are always runny noses, so he did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He gave me a refill or Z—Pakk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Z—Pakk.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which really helped me the last time, so, um, and, um, and [INAUDIBLE].  No, but I have very ambivalent feelings about [DEIDENTIFIED].  I haven't like dug into it like I did my city job.  I just don't know if I'm going to be there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that kind of similar in a way to the city job, I mean, has it, I mean, in terms of public service?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but it's not the same.  It's more direct service.  It's not the same at all.  I did a lot of paperwork and didn't have, I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was more office job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	These kids are with me.  They're not, I'm like a babysitter in the room with them.  You know, and though they want me to do more social work stuff and not pay me.  They want me to do assessments.  They want me to talk to the moms and, you know, be involved with the moms, [INAUDIBLE] children and seeing where the children are at different stages in the development, you know, and pay me $12 an hour.  You know, so I just haven't said, okay this is what I want.  You know, it's like I don't know.  In the meantime I keep getting sick.  And I mean some days I really love it.  I love the kids.  I like the kids all right.  I really, I like them.  And I feel bad for them because their parents are, I don't like the moms and they know it because I've practically said I do not like you, I love your kids.  So that's a problem.  Now I have to somehow re—fix that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I need them in order to do my job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I have to really, I don't know how to fix them, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Keep your anger a little bit more under the surface.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have to really change that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so that's something I have to work on.  And I'm not very subtle.  I'm not subtle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that could be okay if there's certain things that need to be addressed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, the other day I was afraid to say anything to them, so I haven't said anything.  The other day one of them, and I didn't say a word, and I could kick myself around this room, one of the little boys came to his mom, he had to go to the bathroom, he said, "Mom, mom, I've got to go to the bathroom."  She started screaming at him that he was a freak.  Started screaming and yelling at him that he was a freak.  Okay, freak, you freak, you know, and he's young.  And she's yelling and screaming at him in the cafeteria, you know.  And I just was really upset with her.  So the other day when one of the fathers hit their kid across the face I said, "You know, [INAUDIBLE] find another way."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what'd he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Yeah, don't make a big thing out of it.  You know, you know, these kids, they have to be, that's what's wrong with these kids."  The kid was what, three years old, four years old, you know.  Uh, they talk to their kids like they're 20.  They expect a three year old and a four year old to act like a 24 year old.  You know?  And it's incredible.  And you do, some of them you do have to remember that they're only two.  I have one he's huge, he's real, real huge and he's two, and yet he's so so big.  He's big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Well, it sounds like you have a connection to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As you're describing it it sounds like it, and I just saw you smiling about it and as you were describing the kid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, some of them are, some of the kids, some of those kids, the older ones have the biggest problems because they're [INAUDIBLE] responsible and they're the angriest out of all of them.  They're either the youngest is the angriest or the oldest is the angriest.  You know, there's like, and there's one little tiny one, only yay high, she cries all the time.  She cries at the drop of a hat.  And she is so precious and so tiny and so cute, but she cries all the time.  She chronically, chronically crying.  And, but they all have, uh, they can be bad.  Oh my god, they're so bad.  They're really, really bad sometimes.  They're mean.  They're mean to each other, you know, even within their families they're mean, they're really mean.  The young one, the one sister will whack the other one across the face with a pillow every day just up and hold her.  Matter of fact, I told her she was mean and I didn't mean to say she was mean, I should have said, you know, psychologically speaking your behavior was mean, you know, but I said you are mean.  Then I felt horrible on the way home.  I said, "Oh man, I shouldn't have done that."  I should have just said your behavior was mean.  But actually she was mean.  You know, but, uh, so yeah, I do like the kids.  I just keep fighting the social, the part that they want me to do, the assessments and stuff like that.  I'm fighting that.  I can't fight it much longer because they're going to fire me if I don't start doing what they want me to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's doing them now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nobody.  I'm sure the case managers are because each child is assigned a case manager, but my [INAUDIBLE] coordinator, what it is it's a room that's dedicated just to the children and it's a playroom.  And the moms are supposed to come in with the children and, um, what do you call it, interact with the children in a positive manner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In other words, play with them or teach them or do something positive with them instead of screaming, yelling, and battering them.  So, uh, when they come in they don't play with them.  They sit there, two come in at the same time, they sit and talk to each other and just let the kids play.  They do not interact with their children.  Uh, like some read.  They seem to like reading to their kids.  They seem to like doing that.  But a kid's attention span after a certain time is gone.  These kids have no, I have one that's a year old, he's like a bull.  He can wreck that room in 30 seconds.  And he's like a bull in a china shop.  He goes from, he doesn't have a focus on one toy and play with it.  He goes from this to that to, by the time, in four minutes he can have like seven things on the floor already.  As time goes on the whole room looks like a tornado hit it.  He just, he doesn't have a, she said she was going to have to him tested, but, uh, he just, and he wants, because he doesn't know how to do it himself, he wants what everybody else has.  If he sees one child, you know, uh, play with something, he goes and takes that toy to play with.  You know, so, um, but, uh, [INAUDIBLE] that's interesting.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's full time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's only part time.  That's another thing.  She wants me to do all this in a, I don't even have a desk.  I don't have a desk, I don't have a computer, so what I've been doing is doing things at home and I don't want to do that either because I'm not getting paid for that either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's like I think [NAME OTHER] I got the job somehow through [NAME OTHER].  I don't even know how I got this job except through my other job.  I know that they had it earmarked for me for some reason.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know how it came about and why it came about, but, um, I think [NAME OTHER] told her that I'll work hours and hours for nothing which I did when I was at [DEIDENTIFIED], but I don't want to do it now, I'm retired, sort of.  Yeah, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it does provide some extra income too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I have to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Instead of [INAUDIBLE], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm going to try to get into the Environmental Protection Agency too.  They hire seniors for, uh, and I'm going to be a senior, so they hire seniors in a program, you know, for secretarial jobs and stuff like that.  So I'm going to go down and apply to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, how's your moods doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My moods have been, uh, my moods have been, uh, well lately they've been very tearful.  Not tearful, just I've been more emotional lately like I cried at [NAME OTHER] office last Tuesday and I shouldn't have done that.  I said I know I'm not supposed to be crying at work, she said, and she filled up as we were talking about the kids and how the moms [INAUDIBLE] the kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you were talking about something that you feel a passion for then.  And it was something that this person you were talking with shared as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's my boss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I don't know if, it doesn't sound like that was inappropriate at the moment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but I shouldn't have cried at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But your boss did too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she did fill up, she didn't cry but she like really filled up.  And her eyes were all watery and she said, I know, she said it's very hard sometimes to watch them.  And it is, it's very hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe that sensitivity is why they had the job earmarked for you.  You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe they knew that about you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had them all, they were coming through looking at the moms.  The moms every once in a while say, "She is good with the kids."  They say that every once in a blue moon.  They'll say, "Well, she is good with the kids."  And the one, the boy, the two year old, um, I said I'm going to have to take him to therapy because he's obsessed.  He was obsessed with me for a while, now he's a little better because I've been telling [INAUDIBLE] now.  But he was, he was like every time he saw me he would cry because he wanted to be with me.  But it wasn't really me.  So then I said to her, I said it's not me, it's he wants to be in the bright space to play and I represent the bright spaces.  It's not me.  So but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, how are you doing with the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it could be better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you taking it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, not exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I just, I started taking it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought maybe it would, you know, I didn't know if I was going in depressed or, you know, work was bothering me, is there a bathroom on this floor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could I use it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know where it is?  It's, you go out towards the lobby and right up at the double doors and then immediately to your left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll be right back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't go as far as the waiting room but walk to the doorway to the waiting room and then look to your left.  You found it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, when nature calls you want to answer that call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For sure, I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't want to let it keep ringing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, you might want to tell them, that one toilet it's not flushing very well.  It's not going down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I'll tell [NAME OTHER] to give maintenance a call.  Yeah, those bathrooms don't get a lot of service.  There's also restrooms when you're on the other side of the waiting room like towards our office, there's two individual ones on either side like to the right and to the left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Because I went all the way down, I had to go earlier when I was here and I went downstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The first floor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they're on either side of the waiting room, like one towards the top of the steps there and the other right over here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I went downstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I wrote your prescription out in the meantime, but I was asking you about how often you've been taking it and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Doc, let me do it this way.  I will promise you for the next, give me time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I would like to see you again in two months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Until I see you next time in July.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right, I will take it every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Even on vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I'll take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean, I guess we'll only really ever know, it's not the best medication just to start up if you're feeling that your moods are going up and down or you're feeling emotional or you're feeling depressed.  You know, it's a better medication just to take as a mood stabilizer all along because then it helps prevent those periods where you go up and down.  You know, so you don't have to get to that point of saying, "Oh, I'm feeling up and down and need to take my medication now."  You know, if you take it regularly like a vitamin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I seem to be except I get, I'm getting [INAUDIBLE] when something's missing I'm always chronically thinking that someone stole it.  That's like a [INAUDIBLE] and [NAME OTHER] was always asking me if I was happy when I came to my job, when I came to my, what do you call it, supervision meeting.  She kept asking me if I was happy, finally I said, "Well, why do you keep asking me if you're happy, if I'm happy, you know, don't I seem to be happy?"  She said, "Now you're being paranoid."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that sounds like a, you know, kind of a comment about an interaction or whatever, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I guess, you know, the paranoia that worries me in the past had been, you know, just about [NAME OTHER] and about friendships and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Job evaluations.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what [NAME OTHER] problem is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It doesn't seem like you're as paranoid as you have been before.  It seems like that's okay.  That's actually improved since you retired it seems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think that, um, uh, I think, uh, I don't know what [NAME OTHER] problem is.  I mean, I know she has major issues with me, but, uh, she doesn't want to, oh, the other day she said to me, she was saying that, "You don't know how to talk to me about anything about money."  I said, "Excuse me, for the last nine years of our lives together, that's all you've talked to me about."  And then whenever I try to talk about anything else she screams, everything's bullshit.  Everything, and I even said to [NAME OTHER], I mentioned it to [NAME OTHER], she goes, "Isn't that what she talks to you about?"  And I said, yes.  So I don't know what her problem is.  I can talk to anybody else, and she can talk to anybody else.  We just can't talk to one another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how many people are going on the vacation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ten, thank god.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you've got a little dilution there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And they're going, for the most part, I think most of them will go to the pool.  I want to go to the beach.  We're not that far from the beach.  I like the beach, you know.  I've got to do something to my arms and everybody looks at my arms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	About what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they're hairy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Well, that you can take care of.  Just make sure you get a little color before you go down and be careful in the sun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've got to get some stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, other than that then, while you were in the restroom I wrote up your prescription and I wrote up the next appointment, [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is a Wednesday also.  And so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Same time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Two months, same time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so I'll see you then.  You all have a good vacation.  And take the medication every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll try to maintain my promises, I promise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, very good.</p>

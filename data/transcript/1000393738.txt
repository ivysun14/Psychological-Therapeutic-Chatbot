<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) I don't know how to start because I suppose in a way I usually like to know what I want to start saying and I don't know today.  When I came in I was thinking again something that had occurred to me earlier, when I thought of coming here that yesterday I had feeling at the end of something that I would pick up again today.  And I think if I really tried I could remember pretty well what I said yesterday, but I would have to try.  I mean I don't just suddenly think of what I was saying yesterday.  Certainly not at the end where I had this feeling of something to be continued.</p>

<p>And I was thinking of last night that first when I got home (clears throat) I thought I'd feel differently toward MSCZ when he did.  And then he called to say he couldn't come home until late.  And I think it just made me feel very angry.  And he called right after I'd gone to bed, and so I didn't want to answer the phone, although I really wasn't asleep.  And he let it ring so long, finally I answered and it—, and I was just very nasty.  And then finally when he did come home I think I felt guilty I'd been that way, so I wasn't nasty anymore.  But this sort of—, I kept changing.  In a way, I didn't know how I felt.</p>

<p>And then I was just thinking of something that has also been on my mind today.  And I don't know exactly why, because again it's sort of a feeling, and I don't know whether it's connected.  But the book I'm reading has sort of reached the climax, and it involves a woman who's lied to a man that she's—, she lies maybe unconsciously but still to attract him to her.  And eventually he—, I don't think you can call it seduces her because she wanted it, but in any case they have intercourse and he realizes then that she lied and, and, I don't know, he's going through all sorts of questions about himself.  And I don't understand, because the author doesn't go into detail on the woman, and he handles it quite subtlely, and I don't think I understand what he thinks lies behind the motivations for the woman. And, I don't know, I keep thinking about it.  I don't know whether I'm thinking about it because of just the book in itself, but somehow the mood I get from it seems related to how I was feeling last night, or—.  Or there's just something about the fact that it's clear what this man's feelings are, but he lives in the Victorian time and he can't necessarily, if he's going to maintain Victorian standards and morals and everything, ethics, act by how he feels. And I think part of this feeling I have is thinking, "But he knows how he feels and he should act by it and not torment himself," or—.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe it's just something about the fact that I'm feeling, I think I feel more empathy with the man, because of his state of not knowing exactly how he feels and not knowing what to do about it.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because when I think of that it, I just feel as if, and last night's no exception that I've been, in the last few days, aware of feelings that I just haven't understood.  It's almost as if it's a relief to think about this man and this book that's all unreal, in a way.  I mean I can keep thinking it's only fiction.  And then I don't think about myself if I think about him and their situation.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  I was thinking about school and, uhm. At first I was just thinking about, I don't know, silly things like how the clock in different rooms is different.  And people are so time minded that you have to kind of count on one clock being 3 minutes ahead of another, because if you're 3 minutes late since your clock is different, you'd be held responsible.  And then I realized that (exhales), or at least I thought, that again school was easier to think about.  And I was feeling sort of the way I felt yesterday.  Finding it hard to, I don't know, get involved in anything that meant anything to me.  And, and then it occurred to me what I had been saying yesterday about not wanting to accept.  Well, I was thinking of what you had said.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you said more than your not wanting to accept what I said.  You said I can't make you accept it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: As though I'm trying to.  And as though were struggling on this.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And it's funny, too, because when I think about having left here feeling better, I think it was, not that I was accepting anything, but just I had been honest about this feeling of fighting you made me feel better.  But then today I'd forgotten it.  And forgotten that I'd said it or been honest about it or— (clears throat).  (pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about this feeling of being in a struggle with you, and that's part of this feeling I've had, I think, lately toward MSCZ.  And it made me wonder if, if it's just something that's part of my reaction to men or if it's just general or what.  Because in a way I have this feeling toward women, too.  Maybe it's from s_, a different reason but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't quite understand it except it's (clears throat), it seems something to do with having this idea of people having power over me and not wanting them, too.  (silence)</p>

<p>That made me think of just (exhales) well knowing some of the things my parents did with me, but also just imagining their reaction the more I didn't want them to have power over me, or the more I was obstinate or perverse.  I mean people always use those words, too, but—.  Anyway that they'd want to have, that would make them feel, in order to discipline me, they had to get power over me first and sort of show me, teach me, and—.  So that that struggle just would never end.  And then I thought of my attitude toward the boys, and how sometimes it's been exactly that way in reverse.  It's almost once I know I have power, and that anything I say they'll be obedient immediately, then I don't care.  But there are sometimes I think that as soon as I question whether they would be obedient immediately, then it becomes necessary to get absolute power over them.  And I was just thinking about how obviously a child who cared would immediately react negatively to that, and I was thinking of some individuals.  But I think it's also I d_, I think I did it differently, but the feeling I have—.  (silence)</p>

<p>I don't know, when I g_, again when I think about my parents and how I've been just like them, I was thinking that in a way I was right to feel the way I did about their wanting power over me.  Because maybe I could have gotten a feeling about myself in another way, but I did take their need to have power in that way a th—, as a threat to me because they were saying really, and I, as I feel I do when I'm this way with the boys, that I'm more important than you.  And almost as if, by letting them have that power, I became, not only less important, but that I lost something.  I became a little smaller somehow each time, and—.  And then I was just thinking that now I react this way, I would imagine a lot of times when it's not happening.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or anyway, just being an adult the whole situation is so different now.  And no—, it seems I apply the same reactions that I used when I was little.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know why I'm thinking about this, but I started thinking about something that's been going on all year, but it happened again today.  And I spoke to the children about it, that I've had a lot of swearing in my room.  And I think it comes partly because there are a lot of boys who have older brothers.  And anyway, just this whole thing of power that I was talking about, I have a class full of children I think don't want adults to have power over them and so maybe in a way this is one way they're resisting mine.  Because they—, I don't think they know what the words mean always, but they use it is knowing that it's not a proper word to be using.  And then I was just thinking that today, one boy was saying, "Shut-up" a lot.  And I suppose it's because of the way I was brought up, but I d_, I never liked hearing it.  But really it's, I don't know what's so bad about.  And especially if a boy is made angry and that's expressing his anger, he could say be quiet in an equally nasty way if wanted it.  And I don't know, I think I've got this thing where everybody's got to be polite, using polite words and hiding all these feelings.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, like right now I notice you don't say what these words were.  Except perhaps the most innocuous.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  Maybe I did consciously leave them out.  I'm not sure.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I think I'm (deep breath) I don't know, it's in a way I take what you said just to point out that, for whatever reason I had, I didn't say them.  But in another way I take it as almost you want me to tell you, that this is part of what I'm saying.  And so it's almost as if now I have to decide am I going to be obedient and tell you or not obedient and not tell you.  And the feeling I have when it's on that basis, if I feel it doesn't add anything more to what I was saying I don't want to tell you.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: That's your very polite way to say, "Shut-up."  (pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But the feeling I have is that, in a way I don't want you to, because then I won't have the opportunity to say it.  And that m_—, reminds me of another day, when I was talking about feeling that I was fighting you and i_, I d_, I don't know if I was feeling that way then but it seems that I was.  I want to fight, and if you didn't say anything, then I couldn't say "Shut-up" to you.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it just makes me think, too, of how I used to be when I was little that I'd constantly do things that I knew my parents—, because I knew how they'd react would tell me "no" or tell me to do something else or—, in any case, exert this power that I was resisting.  And I wanted them to just so I could resist it.  (pause)</p>

<p>And then that makes—, I don't know exactly the connection, but I think next of what I was saying, I think yesterday, about being nasty and seeing how far I could push MSCZ.  And then you commented that—, well you applied it you.  Now I can't remember what words you used.  (pause)</p>

<p>But I think I do feel I was thinking about, if by being angry I am pushing you, see if you'll reject me I suppose, is what I'm pushing you to.  And I think I feel sometimes—, I mean sometimes other things are harder to say, but I think I feel underneath it, if you can accept me when I'm angry at you that's more than if you accept me for things I sometimes say, about other feelings or other thoughts.  But the other thing, the other main thing that I suppose I'm afraid you're going to reject me on, and it's not a case of pushing you to it, I'm just afraid that it will happen.  When I talk about it—, is what I recall feeling when I was talking about sexual feelings toward you or feeling close toward you and things like.  (pause)</p>

<p>It almost seems that I assume or, or I don't know, don't even want to risk the chance that you would probably reject me for sexual feelings.  So the next best thing is to show anger, and if you don't reject me for that, then at least I have some security.  (pause)</p>

<p>An— and it brings my father to mind again, and it makes me feel sort of funny I was reacting this way.  Because I think I was with him, partly because I know he wasn't rejecting me for me, for any feelings toward him, of wanting to be close to him.  He just couldn't respond that way, but he did reject me anyway.  I knew he would.  And so I'd get angry and see that he wouldn't reject me.  But in a way he w_, had already done that.  And it was just he couldn't—, if he were going to the image of being a good father—, couldn't throw me out of the house.  But I don't know, I kept taking some, some pleasure or something, I don't know exactly what I saw in it.  Constantly having proof that he was stuck with me, that he had to keep me around, however much he might not like being near me.  (pause)</p>

<p> And I think that's how I've felt, when I've been nasty to MSCZ.  (pause)</p>

<p>But it doesn't make sense to me that I'd be that way with him.  Except that I'm just acting by habit.  (pause)</p>

<p>But then the feeling I had right this minute is if I were home right this minute I would still be nasty to MSCZ, despite everything I've been saying.  And so it makes me wonder if there's something else, that it's not just habit, but there's something that. I don't know, triggers this kind of reaction, or this feeling.  And I think of what you pointed out I think yesterday of—, that last week I had been feeling close to you and then I got this way this week.  And I might start reacting this was because I was afraid except you didn't reject me.  And, I don't know, maybe  I was feeling I didn't know really whether you had.  I d_, I don't know your thoughts so—.  But I suppose I could see it, though on the other hand, I made overtures in telling you how I was feeling and you never told me in return.  (pause)</p>

<p>And that just brings to my mind the thought that I can't recall too much about my father's reaction, but there was a period when I know, I suppose I could term it making overtures to him in that I would—, when he'd come home that would be times when I'd feel really glad to see him.  There's be times when I would go to the station and—.  I think the feeling I had, at least the way I see it now, is that he was pleased to see me, because it gratified him that a child of his was acting this way.  It fulfilled his whole image of the family, and that there was no feeling toward me personally. And so I didn't get the response that I wanted.  I wasn't totally rejected but, I mean there just wasn't much of anything in reply, and— (sniff).  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't remember immediately then getting angry, but I thinking about it I'm, I know my next feeling would be to feel angry.  (pause)</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm saying, "Well, I don't care."  And I'll show him I can be on my own, too, not just I don't care.  Or not it's so much I'll be on my own, it's that I'll show him I don't need him.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking back to that (deep breath) feeling about the book and (exhales) somehow it had something to do with feelings I have anyway.  And this time I was thinking about the fact that, as I'm reading and as I see this man in the book become, I don't know, more indecisive and endangering what he really wants by being indecisive and all.  I know because I read the review of the book that he does lose this woman, after he in a way makes up his mind that he wants her, and wants to give up, well he's engaged so he has to break the engagement, and it really involves giving up all the ideas that he was brought up with, and how to live and what's right and all.  (pause)</p>

<p>And that just makes me think of pushing MSCZ or pushing you and the fact that I keep thinking, "Well, I haven't lost you," but yet in way I guess, well just like that dream, too, I think I will.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>The next thing that happens is I think something, and it's one of those things I think, uh, I'm not going to say, because, I don't know, it just seems sort of silly, and then I start thinking, "Well, I did think it so I should say it."  Yet maybe, what—, I mean I can see it's part of this am I going to be fighting you and not say it or say it.  And I don't right now want to face that.  I don't want to say either way, and so then I start thinking well maybe it's relevant, and I just don't know why or how. (pause)</p>

<p>Except it's something I've been, a kind of thing I've been doing a lot.  Because I was—, when I was talking about the book and the feeling I have, too, of losing you or MSCZ, I felt something that I interpreted as feeling very hungry, almost feeling that sometimes I get of feeling nauseous because I feel so hungry.  And then it occurred to me that I haven't eaten a lot today, but I certainly haven't eaten less than, I mean I haven't eaten so little I should be feeling terribly hungry.  And so the thought that comes to my mind, whenever I start feeling anything different from the way I think is normal, is maybe when you're pregnant you feel this way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, (clears throat) our time's up.</p>

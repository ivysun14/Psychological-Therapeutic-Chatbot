<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session two, session two, November 10, Richard counselor. Session two, November 10, Richard counselor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi. Where shall I begin?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean it's really your hour. And it's, maybe I should have said this to you the first time. But they were as good as I wanted on the first time. Really I guess it's best to talk about the things that really seem most relevant to you to talk about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just, I guess that's where we begin.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. I had a, after I left you the other night, I had an interesting, well I had a thought about something that I had said and you had refocused on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was kinda interesting. You know it was the idea that kinda the theme running through, when you said that you know that I felt cheated. And that's where you know I think the general tone of hostility really arose from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was thinking about the fact on the way home. And I discussed it with my wife about the fact that maybe I really, you know one of the things I indicated on my first group eval, the projectives that were being given before the counseling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt that I was too critical of my wife. Especially, you know people close to you your very critical of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think pretty if almost extremely critical of my wife. And of course I don't always verbalize it but then it comes out emotionally.0:02:03.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I started thinking perhaps this feeling cheated which I kinda think more than anything relates to my relationship with my mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I kinda take it out on my wife. I started thinking about that but you know I had kind of an unrealistic, unconscious expectation that my wife would meet these needs that hadn't' been met in childhood. And that when she didn't I started to... (overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Is it kinda like the thing like did we not only accumulate these ideals but in a sense I guess it had to do with being critical, accumulated some kinds of resentments from those ideals and that's how they really come out. In this criticality you taking it out, your taking your unhappiness and dissatisfaction out (inaudible at 0:03:06).1 by being critical, being bitchy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It comes somehow from a, just an inner feeling of, being cheated just kinda sums it up but it's like what being cheated feels like I guess. It's you're just not getting what you should get, what you deserve. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or what I want. And that may be a separate third thing. I also was thinking during the course of the week about some of the things we had talked about. And I thought about it and as things happened during the week, just anything, you know, I think that you know we were talking a great deal about feelings. And I remember once you had kinda summarized that it sounds like you're kinda devoid of feeling. That things that happen to you are kinda empty in a sense. 0:04:12.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had agreed at the moment. But I realized during the week as things happened to me that I was far less..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Less devoiding. 0:04:23.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, less devoid of feeling than that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All feeling. I mean you know there are [all mix of feeling are present] (ph) maybe some more than others but you know at the same time I was more conscious of my feelings during the week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And as things occurred you know I thought, gee you're feeling happy or you're feeling sad or mad or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. When so your kinda say you, that was kinda an oversimplification in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no. At the moment I guess you know I was feeling that way. I guess me being here..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were feeling (inaudible at 0:04:59.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I, the only feeling that really pervaded me at the moment was anger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it kinda moved out even the feeling that I could have other feelings, or do have other feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's like all that was in you was that anger. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've been waiting to talk about it for a long time. (chuckles) I was going to get my hour's worth. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know I thought I was conscious of it during the week and thought well that it was kind of a false picture for me to paint as a generality, although at that time I was feeling like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess, I guess, one thing maybe I guess that's probably still true as a generality from what you were saying is like. I'm not sure if it's because we were waiting to talk about it but, the overriding feeling in your life is kinda one of resentment and anger. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think it might be. And I was never really aware of it really until I took Projectives. 0:06:05.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I could see the themes running through there as I wrote. You know like I am or when I was taking, using sort and I could see the theme there. And it surprised me because I had never really thought of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It somehow seemed to ring true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, it did. It really did. And like I say, it was surprising to me. I think I kinda you know, compartmentalized different segments of my life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really didn't see the relationships as clearly as when I sat down and did that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah I'm kinda getting the feeling like ok, you're saying you saw it clearly. But how did you feel after seeing it clearly? Because it almost sounds like are you compartmentalizing another compartment?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah, I see what you mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I guess what I'm asking is like what did that really mean to you. You must have had some kind of reaction to it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I was surprised. I really was. That, you know I was surprised that I was feeling that angry. And yet at the same time I accepted that because I, well it's hard for me to explain why I accepted. I guess because I was ready to accept that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember once I took a MMPI and after I took it the psychologist gave me an interpretation and he said you're a very dependent person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said I'm not. You know and I denied it. And gave him reasons why I felt I wasn't dependent. Well, when I look back on it now, yeah, he was right. I was a dependent person. But I couldn't accept that. So when I saw this I felt surprised. Because I didn't feel that I was..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That way. 0:08:03.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Feeling that hostility or something. But at the same time the hostility had, we'll say within the last four or five months, had really become a major feeling in my life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: A dominant kind of feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I guess I was a little shocked to see that. But you know I can't say like I felt bad or anything else. It just..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I kinda sensed like when I asked that all that kinda happened to you is, all that you could kinda see was that you had initial surprise to it. And then I kinda had this feeling you were kinda saying, "But I don't know anything more about it." But then what? It's just surprise. But I mean is there any more meaning in that for you, other than just that surprise. I'm probably not being clear on that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't understand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have the feeling, like I asked you how you felt when you realized that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said shocked but then, ok I see it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So where are you now besides seeing it? Is that all feeling as you are with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've thought about it a great deal, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And continue to think about it. And I would imagine some of that you know, that I talked about some of that last week. About why I was feeling angry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. As I kinda remember the feeling of anger I had the, you know kinda the picture I was you know it's kinda like after sitting, you talked about a week ago. But like as I remember it the feeling that comes to my mind is just a feeling of anger. A really resentment over like lost opportunities and just unrealized parts of yourself that somehow that cut off. I mean that was especially poignant to you when you talked about the girl and you know.0:10:10.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I mean, what are you smiling for? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you used the word poignant and I'm not sure what you meant by that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess what I was kinda asking, when I said poignant it felt poignant to me. That that experience. I kinda got the realness of that experience when you talked about that incident. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like how much you really did feel that you've missed out on things and had the resentment.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess I was kinda asking maybe that's what you want to talk some more about. But I don't know if that's where you really, and again I say it's your hour. But I don't, you know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm tired of it being my hour. It's been my hour for about ten years and you know, I know what I've done with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know, I told you that my main thing has been intellectualizing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I got into that I would imagine when I was in high school and I started trying to make a conscious attempt to understand why I did certain specific things, or felt specific things in a given moment. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'd just go out and take long walks and think a great deal about it. And you know, it became my way of dealing with things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here you are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know because it's kinda, it was effective to a point and I no longer feel it's serving the purpose I want it to serve. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It served some purposes. Now I'd like to undo some of that. So what I mean by that, you know to bring it to here, is that maybe it would be better for you to help me focus on things that you think are important. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I, I mean it's kinda the belief around people in [this place] (ph) that we don't know what's important. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:12:01.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We do think the type of things important. And that's basically how you feel about something rather than what you think about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I guess like what I'd kinda like you to talk about if you could I mean if it's this, is to talk about what your feelings really are in those kinds of situations like about this. Let's try to talk more about those of resentment and how do you feel when that happens? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Ok where do you want, which feelings do you want me to talk about? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anywhere. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uhh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just let me say one more thing while we're on it. Because I sense that you have, I'm sure you know that there are many different schools of therapy. Maybe I should say a word about that. The school practiced here, I mean in this whole center, is kind of a school that's not geared to insight into understanding. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or in a sense geared to directiveness. I mean you must, might know something about Jung [ph] therapy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's pretty much the prevailing theme of the practice is done here. I don't know if that means anything to you. But I mean functionally what it means is I don't want to tell you what to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll try to focus you in on what the experience is and what you're talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Ok the only reason I'm hesitating now is I suppose I'm questioning where I should focus. For myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 0:14:02.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: The two people I refer to primarily are my wife and my mother. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I would, you know as I told you I have a lot of feelings or thoughts, both that you know a lot of times I'm transferring my feelings for my mother and our relationship to my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know. Maybe it would be best to talk about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kinda looking to me, is that ok?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah I suppose, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean because I sense that like the last couple of weeks you've been feeling just kinda unsure about where to go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kinda like you have all these things out there and you have insights about them and it's like, I get a picture of it's like that it's static that way or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well see I guess I am, you know I doubt where to go because I worked so much of this through in my mind so damn many times that, you know then it just kinda led me nowhere. A blind alley, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I guess what you're saying, "Well I don't want to go over what I've worked out in my mind."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. I think in some ways I'd like to because so much of it I've forgotten. Because I've been doing it for so long now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't know where to do. I'm, shit. See I can't get away from this. I just kinda ask myself are you, you know I feel like maybe I don't know where to go because maybe I feel like I blasted my wife last week and I feel guilty about that. You know and that...0:16:22.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you want to talk about that. I mean just...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean to see what kinda sounds that that's still present in you right now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Perhaps. And maybe that's why I kinda prefaced tonight by saying well, I have other feelings besides anger. You know, because maybe I do feel guilty about that. I think it kinda, a couple of times this week I thought about it. You know that gee it sounds like I don't get any satisfaction from my marriage or from my wife as a person. Which is untrue. And I don't know. I just, maybe that's why I don't know right now where I want to go with it. Perhaps that's..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Here's what I'm getting a picture of as you're talking. I'm getting a picture of you're rather confused. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Basically that how you feel about your life, your wife and your relationship and what you do and don't get out. You kinda had weigh that all. That's what I think..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kinda what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had to weigh all those things. Where you are in respect to how you feel is generally about your wife because it's like you feel angry but yet you get things and what does that all mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I meant about confusion. 0:18:01.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something you said there is very true. But the anger I feel. I feel anger over the fact that I even feel or have a need to weigh it. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In other words I live a relationship. I live it. And yet I feel a need to weigh it in my mind. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Rather than just accept whatever it is I'm feeling. And whether I, you know if I feel good and often I feel good, then why in the hell do I have to ask myself if I feel good?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. In other words..</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I find myself doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It's kinda like you really wish somehow you could just..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Accept it. Just accept what it is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel whatever feeling it is. Whether it's good or bad rather than putting it into a bigger framework and having to analyze it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Accept the feeling. And always making a comparison see? And at this point since I've only had this marriage, I can't compare it to another marriage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I often find myself making a comparison against, you know we'll say, a fantasized marriage. If I had married that girl, what would it be like now? Would I be happy or unhappy? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it kinda sounds like that you really, you get angry at yourself or upset with yourself about just the very fact that you don't find yourself living in whatever moment you're in, in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's kinda like you're spending your life evaluating your life rather than living your life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really. Right. When we first got married, I found myself really thinking about a girl I had gone with about three years before my and I got married. And I used to think about her often. I used to escape into that fantasy. In a way it was a kind of a mourning. I was really kind of mourning her. Because when we broke up she just shit on me and married some guy right after that. And it was something I really, really didn't work out. 0:20:11.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something you really felt very hurt about, it sounds like. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Extremely, yeah. And occasionally now I think about it. But not in the almost compulsive way I did at one time. And now when I think about it it's because something happens to connect it. Something happens to associate it. But I think I really kind of have a tendency rather than to accept the feelings I was having at a given time, I would say well are these good feelings or could I have better ones? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it's kinda like you couldn't just have it but you were always putting it on a scale of some kind. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. And I think maybe that gets, maybe that boils down to whether I trust my feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See because I don't think I really do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You somehow like, you do this to kinda make you feel secure that you can trust or relate. It's not even trust them. But this is something else and I can trust this operation. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I can trust the weighing and the value of the operation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More than I can the feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Than just being where I am.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember hearing you say that but I just, wherever I am you know. I guess maybe it has something about that patterned feelings or as opposed to analyzing things. You know I can't just be just myself if where I really am and feel that and that's what I feel and that's what my experience is. I'm always putting it into some kind of framework or scale or whatever. 0:22:08.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and I'll, I don't want to say always, but like if it's a really, if it's an emotional experience between myself and my wife or maybe myself and another person, that's generally the kind of thing I'll evaluate. If for example I see something pretty, I don't question it. I just feel it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If something good happens to me outside of that context, I more or less just accept it. I don't evaluate it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But is it like in the context of people? I mean is that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, primarily, you know. Well, an intimate relationship with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's, I think that's what I evaluate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And if something, I mentioned that too when I talked about what I want to get out of therapy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's something that I've been very dissatisfied with. Because I feel I put up a lot of barriers between myself and people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Can you, I mean I don't have a sense for what that is. I mean..</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean what the barriers would be?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I mean what you, exactly what you're talking about. I'm getting the feeling that you're seeing yourself that there's a problem that like I know with people what I'm doing is I'm evaluating my experience with them and just not trusting my feelings with them or their feelings for me. That may be in there too. I don't know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I get a sense there's some kind of values there that maybe you want to talk more about all that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I get a vague sense but it's kinda abstract, you know? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, I think that for example I'm very guarded with people. You know really. 0:24:06.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kinda just, well it's hard for me to explain. Well ok. We'll say reserved. I hold back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. I think. I can only explain this as a kind of a thought because I don't have the feeling for it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But like between people, feelings constantly pass, ok?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And we can sense those feelings. And the feelings are often much more reliable than what is said and so if you're really tuned into your feelings, you can feel a lot of things about a person that you'll never hear and ..(overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...say themselves in other words. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But you feel them. Ok now if you trust your feelings I think that, and if your feelings aren't really distorted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you let yourself feel them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I think that you have something between you and other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't feel this interchange of feelings. I feel little going out and little coming back to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kinda sense what you're saying. It's kinda like you know from somewhere or somehow, that's probably not important, that there can be a real kind of communication between people that has to do with sensing in yourself the feelings that they're giving you and giving out the feelings that you feel inside.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I sense you're saying is that in intimate relationships with people, like you don't get either of those. Like you don't have, you're in a different dimension of interacting or something. But it's one that's devoid of these real kinds of basic feelings. 0:26:10.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That's it. So well ok. That upsets me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I had a feeling when I said that it kinda, you stopped there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I didn't know where to go. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I was just trying to focus it more so hopefully you could go on with it more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean. Do you see what I'm saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I just, I had a very bad feeling after I said that. Now that you've summed that up and it's something else. But I felt that you know, that's probably not the (inaudible at 0:26:49.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When you said, "I had a very bad feeling." I wondered if you were feeling, "Ok now that I've said that is he just going to tuck that away and think about it later on?" And maybe that's what I was..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah that's, that's what I, I had this feeling that that's, you know in that moment, I just felt like I was getting, you were getting in somewhere and I was getting a sense of it. And I responded that way. And I have the feeling what you did was that it was almost like it was in a compartment just then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I'm saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know what you mean, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I had the feeling that you were doing that very thing, in a sense. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you had been talking about before. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. It bothers me because I feel that I'm missing. I know I am. But I also feel it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: For example I married, and my wife and I have talked about that, about this. We feel, both of us, that we're extremely compatible roommates. And that's the word I used in the past. We really compliment each other in terms of lifestyle and likes and dislikes. 0:28:07.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, accommodating one another. But I often feel that that's it. We're just kinda being roommates. And maybe she ought to just start paying half the rent and you know. And we both ought to go somewhere else for emotional...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the sense like, yes. I get the sense that you, it's functional but it's not, it's very..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not satisfying or fulfilling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not the very thing we're talking about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't have this very meaningful kind of emotional interchange. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just not there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think maybe I feel it too, that perhaps one reason that's true is because my wife is a great deal like I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think that's what attracted me to her. Maybe that's why we got married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's why I have constantly continued to weigh things. Because relationships that I had with girls before I married my wife, were I think more emotionally involved. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They were more intense. And I think that when I dated these girls and let's say began to love them, then I gave a lot of myself over to them emotionally. And I felt that my relationship to them was uncomfortably dependent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I perhaps after the time that this girl that I mentioned earlier that I fantasized a great deal about and thought about, that was probably the most intense emotional relationship I ever had. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel like I gave over a lot of myself to her which she rejected. You know, and like didn't maintain. 0:30:12.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Was that the kind of thing like, I kinda sense that it's like "You know I had that at one point. I was really open and I let myself have emotions with someone. I let them flow to someone and I really got kicked in the face here." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And so I turn around and I analyze it and I say well, I can't blame her, you know. It worked out best. And the way I really worked the whole damn thing out. The way I really resolved it was that I came to the conclusion that it was kind of an excessively dependent neurotic relationship that never would have lasted because I never, she never could have met my needs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I never could have met a lot of her needs. And so I feel like I justified. Later on when my wife and I decided to get married, or maybe I should say when I finally decided we'd get married, I justified that by saying well, it's a healthier relationship. It's not full of this dependency that I felt. And it's one that can sustain itself because we're both, it's a more mature kind of thing. It's more reality based. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess, I mean I kinda sense that you feel better about like your marriage because you didn't feel this neurotic dependency thing but I also sense from what you've been saying is that there is something very different about it than with this girl and that is this kind of emotional being able to have those feelings inside yourself and sense them between you and have them between you. It just isn't there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kinda, it's like devoid in something that maybe love is all about. 0:32:03.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It is. And you know so I guess that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how do you feel about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when you said that you know, it's devoid of what love is all about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So your angry or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No I felt really sad. I started to think about something that, I don't even remember for sure when it occurred but it, it was we'll say within the last four or five months, and I was sitting up one night. My wife was already in bed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was watching television and I was drinking. And I started thinking about another girl that I had dated. The girl I dated right before I met my wife. And I imagine had I not met my wife this girl and I might have gotten married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we had been in the Red Cross and in training together. And then she went to Bulgaria and I came home. And then I married my wife about 18 months after that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I hadn't seen this girl at the time that I decided well, you know, I'd get married to my wife. And I started thinking about her one night and you know, and feeling the fact that she and I had an emotional relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wasn't a, you know, an intellectual relationship. It was emotional. And I felt very sad and I just sat there and cried. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kinda like sensing what I've lost and what I miss. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it's not only that. It's like what I'm going to miss. Because it would be different if, well you know I feel like I've got a long life ahead of me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:34:06.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if it's going to be sterile, emotionally sterile, then I don't want that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I kinda really sense kind of probably the poignancy of that thing about that was, I don't know if it was very clear for you, is that you know it's kinda like saying to yourself, "You know God damn it. That felt like a really meaningful type of thing to have with someone."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the idea of it never being and going through life, just going through life without that is very saddening. I don't know I guess you'd cry for kinda seeing that that was something you really miss and might never have and were missing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. 0:34:52.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that crying was in part crying of loneliness too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know it's really funny. I, and my wife is this way too. My wife never cries about anything. Except when she watches movies. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I rarely cry about anything. Although I would imagine I'm even more likely to cry about something than my wife. But I'll often find myself watching a two minute segment at the end of a movie or some kind of moving thing. Like a happy ending or a happy moment in a movie and I'll sit there and cry because it's a, it's like a release for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know. It's, I don't feel, it's not like I you know, when I say my life or what goes on in it is often devoid of emotion, it hasn't, my whole life hasn't been devoid of emotion. And I would imagine the way I got to where I am now, right at this point might be, a real outgrowth of this thing like with this one girl and you know I got crapped on. And I think I was afraid to really let my feelings go that much after that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. 0:36:44.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I traded feelings, the hurt feelings you know, for security. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For situational function comfort. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I wouldn't get cut off again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Because I imagine it's kinda like when you really put yourself out on the table it's like with this girl, it's like you put your guts out on the table in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your insides, like the things that were really most you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you got stepped on. And it's kinda like you can decide, make a decision somewhere that that's a very risky way to live. "I don't want to have to go through that kind of pain again."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See and even at this point I don't know if I'd be willing to again or not. And I say that because I've thought about "Well, I could get a divorce." And then I think, "Well shit. You really don't know what you want. And you might end up being unhappier so why risk it?" Which is the same thing that took when I decided to get married...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There it is again. 0:38:03.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I decided to get married it was a feeling. A feeling that I said, "Get married." It was really a feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I evaluated it for four or five God damn months. (chuckles) And one day the feeling moved me again. And that time I said, "Just accept it and do it. The feeling is there." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really do it. And I was sober and everything you know? But as soon as that was over. Like my wife got on a plane and came back here. And that night I felt great. Oh, wonderful. But the next day I started evaluating it again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't know. I would imagine at this point I feel that anything, even the pain of real emotional discomfort would be better than just sterile things or just or anger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kinda yeah, I kinda yeah but I'm not, like you said about something you imagine I kinda sense from what you're saying that you're not sure about that either. Because like what you're saying is like, "What do I have now? It seems, it feels sterile. When I feel something that's often anger. And it's situational comforts. But it's not emotional, real basic emotions underneath it." You go back and forth. And I guess what is not, because I guess what you're saying is maybe somehow after this experience with the girl, it's like you decided not to live that way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess what you're saying is without how would I be happier? And I don't think you have, you know the answer to that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess all you do know is that it's pretty empty and sterile or just filled with anger way, situationally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, during my first year of graduate school, I had an affair with another girl. And it lasted about half the year I guess, about six or seven months. And when it ended, the girl thought she was pregnant for a while. Well she was pregnant and she miscarried. And she thought at least that it was my baby. I'm not, I don't know, she's sure that it was. But the point is that I said, "Well if you're pregnant, I'll get a divorce." But I didn't want to marry the girl. And I didn't say I would. 0:40:43.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This was after you were married. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, but I didn't feel I could go on living with my wife knowing that I got this girl pregnant and she would have no way of living, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess maybe that was the very, very first time that, you know like my relationship with my wife was really jeopardized and I was really sick. Really upset about it. And it was all feeling. It wasn't something I could analyze away or something. I was really scared. And I felt..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Scared that you would lose that relationship? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Lose my wife. I felt, I don't know I just, I felt like helpless for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And angry at this girl. And angry at myself and really sad at the idea that I might lose my wife and our relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I kinda sense what the importance of that is, is that it's kinda like you're in a bind in a way. Because like the relationship you feel like is so because it doesn't have these real emotional things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.0:42:08.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If it's not meaningful that way, forget it. It's hard for you to really, it makes you sad to think about giving it up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: The one time it was jeopardized, yeah. I mean you know when I was really faced with the possibility of giving it up. A couple of times before my wife and I both decided to come in, we had arguments over things that, well we had arguments over things that had happened. But arguments that you know when we were faced with either splitting up or really working out the problem in some way. And I felt, I felt really threatened then. You know at the loss of the relationship. I really got very anxious about it and I guess like when I thought, the time that I thought I was really going to have to leave my wife, I really felt that something was being taken out of me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, something very important. And something more than I realized was in me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it kinda sounds like underneath somewhere there that there's something, you're not exactly sure what it is. But somehow you do want to be with your wife. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think, I think so. I'm feeling right now the very kind of conflict, you know when you're saying what do you feel, you seem to feel? I'm sure and just now when you said, "You seem to want to be with your wife." And I said, "I think so."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's [I contemplate] (ph) Because after you said it I was thinking, "Well, I want to be with her if." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I heard a very hesitant yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And you know I started thinking, "I want to be with her if she does this, if she does that. If she makes certain modifications." You know, not me. She. And part of those things go back to kinda like my critical feelings. 0:45:01.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then others, about which I'm really kinda ambivalent are the fact that I question, I really seriously question whether I as a person who am basically happy with myself as a person and with my lifestyle, my goals and I wonder if I should demand of myself that I make big changes in my, say my idealized lifestyle and my goals for another person. Or if I should just find another person. And maybe.. 0:46:25.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like should I compromise myself that much? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and maybe when I said it I guess the word loyalty popped into my head. I guess the feeling that I'm married and after I got married I realized that my wife couldn't be the kind of person I idealized or wanted and thought she had the potential to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I imagine I kinda wrestle with the question, well should you give her an A for effort and stick with her or should you just say well we didn't make it. You go find a guy that will lead you kind of life and I'll go find somebody that will lead my kind of life. If I figure out what my kind of life is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was what, I don't know..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure. I'm really not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. What you said, you married your wife for her potential or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, like what do you want from, what would you like, what would you like the relationship to be like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'd like my wife to a lot freer, emotionally freer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. Ok the changes I want to make in myself, you know I'm assuming because I want to, you know I want to be freer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Yes. Uh huh. So I guess what your saying that part of it is that you want this more type of emotional relationship. The kind of relationship that lovers are. 0:48:04.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry say that again. The last part. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying what you do want in a relationship is you want a relationship of the kind of which what lovers supposedly are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, what no. What love is supposedly like, what I know love can be like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's even better. I mean you know, I mean so far you know it can be..</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know yeah. I know what I can feel. I know what I felt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know what you don't feel, what's missing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. And that's why I feel an absence, a lag. You know it's like, and this is maybe a small thing. I used to write like a bitch. I'd write poems like mad. And when I dated a girl, I was constantly writing poems. I've never written a single poem to my wife. Ever. I wrote, I gave her a couple of poems, but I wrote them for other girls, not for my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kinda sounds like..</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I just can't feel it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I really sense here, what you're saying is that, "I once had a real kinda emotional vitality."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "A real kinda emotional vitality that I expressed to people, that I gave emotions to people."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was like, I have the sense that that was like what meaning life was about for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was life when living really, like when you had those you felt like you were living. When you were writing those poems. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh well, when I was feeling those feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes that's what I mean. Your poems were just an expression for those feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where is this, like you're kinda saying to yourself, "This thing that was so meaningful to me, where is it? It just ain't there."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I kinda sense that is what you want in a relationship. 0:50:02.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Yeah I do. And I think the only reason I don't have it now, well when I say that, I guess the reason I don't have it with my wife and why I married my wife as opposed to another kind of person, would be because I was afraid of my feelings. You know I was afraid of getting hurt again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess that's it. Afraid of getting hurt again. Afraid of trusting somebody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you want, yeah, I kinda sense you wanted something safe and secure but not something where you'd be very vulnerable. Very vulnerable to being hurt. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kinda sounds like you really are very much afraid of that. Like you know what that's like too. Just like you know what that meaningful, having that emotional vitality, you also know what it's like to have your emotions stepped on and cut off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just kinda, it kinda hit me that, you remember last week that I was talking about the fact that this girl, my brother's girlfriend and kinda the emotional need I don't, you know I got torn up by meeting this girl and the feelings that it provoked in me. Just this one person. And I think that I felt that way because she seemed so emotionally free. And it kinda freed my emotions for a moment. You know what I mean? 0:52:21.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It's kinda like her being you know to have her emotions it's like it could kinda get past whatever those barriers are..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well it's kinda like she holds out the promise of helping me feel my emotions again. Of a person with whom I could feel emotions. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kinda you could I guess what was powerful an experience probably was like you could sense the possibility that you could do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and that's why it was really so threatening to me. Because it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ironically I haven't called my brother since that day. I haven't called him on the phone. And usually I talk to him every couple of days. And that's been two weeks now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think its, you know this thing with the girl is really, well it's really meaningful to me because lately I've had a tendency to think back about just what it was like to be, well let's say 15 or 16 and in love with other girls. And just think about the feeling itself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And how good it felt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kinda like you think back on it and you can sense the possibility that you kinda almost something of that warmth aliveness filters into the recollection of it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you [get to grow up again] (ph) in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's really funny now that I think about it. When I started thinking about those feelings then I kinda dampened them by saying, "Well, nothing could come of them because you were life 15 and you had to do all these things. And it just never would have worked out. "And it's just kinda my way of resolving that feeling and saying, "Well forget it." 0:54:18.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really kinda sense that. What you're saying is that, "I sit here at times and I remember things and I really kinda get the sense of longing for that."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "And kind of a real sense of kinda remembering some things past kinda lost things that were really meaningful. A type of way of living that was meaningful." But what you're saying is that, "I don't even let myself feel those feelings because I say they won't get me anywhere."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah and right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You shut them off in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And right now I think I'm shutting them off because not on, you know in times past I shut them off because I was afraid of getting hurt again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in part that's true now. But I'm also at this point I think I'm afraid of acting on them. Well maybe I'm afraid of acting on them because I'm afraid I'm going to be hurt again by acting wrongly on them. Which is how I got into this whole damn mess to begin with, you know. That seems weird. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. The kinda sense like, "I have them and I can sense them at times but I'm really afraid to let myself totally get into them for fear of what might happen."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "What they really might mean to me too. Mean to me in terms of having and in terms of what would then happen to my wife if I really have these feelings of longness and wanting those kinds of relationships." 0:56:03.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think, well I feel too, that if I were to really act on my feelings, see and this isn't. Well, ok. I'll just tell you. If I were to really act on my feelings, I would probably divorce my wife. Maybe get married again but maybe not. But then if I didn't get married again, I feel that I would just kind of, and I don't know how to explain it. Just have a lot of very short term intense affairs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I feel like I could at least on a short term basis, intently love a lot of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And sometimes, you know it's like I'll be somewhere and I'll see a girl. And I'll think, based on just what I see and what I project into her, and I think, "God, I could really have a beautiful relationship with that person." Or I think about that with people I know well enough to, you know have less of a fantasized idea and more of a realistic idea. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And of course that kind of thing is threatening to me as a married man. But I would imagine that's probably what I would do. If I really let my feelings go and acted on them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's not necessarily good or bad. Except I feel it's bad for me because, you know I keep saying to myself, "Well there's got to be a point where I'm going to get hurt again. Whether hurting is, I'm going to love somebody and want to get married to them, you know." 0:58:07.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then get myself in the same God damn bind I'm in now. Or whether I'm going to end up one day 50 years old and very lonely and unhappy and never knowing the security and the kind of experience you have when you have a family and you have children.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well so that's it. You know I feel those kind of things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was very complicated because there are a lot of things that I pass off as together or not. One thing is, I guess what struck me about that whole thing you were just saying was that how many things there are really that you want. And somehow they're different things. And you haven't been able to get them all in one place. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like the idea of a home and a family, security, all that kind of thing, that's one thing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's one thing. That's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then there's also just an intense emotional feeling too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which a relationship is very meaningful emotionally. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is another thing. It's like you can't see those two together in your family now. I mean, either you or your wife. And it's hard for you somehow to see yourself as having those things united in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think, just now when I kinda flashed back on it while you were talking. I think that perhaps I'm talking about or just talked about two different, completely different ways of life which obviously conflict with one another. And I imagine that if in my marriage I have the really intent kind of emotional relationship that I'm looking for, then probably I wouldn't desire the other relationships. And I say that based on past experience with myself. 1:00:18.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You've had that kind of relationship..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I wanted it to last so I had the desire to want..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like the most, you can't get enough of it in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So perhaps I keep thinking about how good it would be to have all these short term relationships and maybe I think about that only because I don't have a really satisfying relationship now. </p>

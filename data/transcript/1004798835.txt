<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I saw you on Monday I said I was going to try not to talk to Franklin and see him this week. I went home and I had a conversation with my friend, Jennifer, the friend who has gone through this similar thing but to a more extreme extent with the physical cheating and all this stuff. I was talking a lot about how I was trying not to talk him. He's making me feel guilty. She's like, "What has he done in terms of what your terms were for making this work?" and I'm like, "Honestly, nothing that I've seen." She was like, "Maybe you need to tell him then that you're just literally not going to talk to him, not respond to him, until he shows you that he's done some of this stuff." I was like, "Oh, ehhh," and she was like, "I know, it's hard and it's scary because what if he's like, 'Nah, nevermind," or whatever. She's like, "But, honestly, you need to take care of yourself and you're way too concerned about how he's feeling and all this stuff," similar to what we were talking about. [00:01:02 So then I went to dinner with some girlfriends, which was really nice, and then I went home. I called him for some reason. I had had some wine and I called him for whatever reason. I don't know; just to be nice because I felt bad for him. He was kind of like . . . I don't remember exactly the conversation, but I got into talking about how I hadn't really seen him do these things that he said he was going to do and this whole therapy thing means a lot to me because I really want to talk about issues that I can't talk to him about that haven't worked for us and whatever. He kind of started making me feel guilty like it's only been this amount of time, even though last week it's already been a month and you're still thinking about this, so that when it's him it's "only" been a month and "I've been doing so much and I've been trying so hard and I'm thinking about so many things. It's so hard to find a therapist and I don't have time. I can only call during my lunch break or after work hours and they're closed after work hours. I've been moving and I've been doing all of this stuff." [00:02:00] I'm like, "Yeah, I know. I've been there the whole time with you doing it also." I was like, "I really don't think it's a lot to expect. These were my terms." I don't remember then. He was just kind of getting on me trying to bully me down from my soapbox, basically, and at one point said, "How about this, Trina. I'm not going to talk to you for a while. I'm not going to answer your calls or your texts. I just can't do this." I was like, "Excuse me?" And I do remember saying this. I was like, "How about this. I'm not going to talk to you for a while. I'm not going to answer your calls or your texts. I'm not the one that messed up in this situation. You are." He was like, "Well, fine. So what did you drink with your friends at dinner?" I was like, "No. I haven't." Of course, I had, but I wasn't about to tell him about it. He was like, "Well, fine then, and hopefully the next time that I talk to you I can have some of these things done that you want me to have done." I was like, "Yeah. Me, too. Yeah, I know." (sniggers) [00:03:08] So then Tuesday night I went with my friend, Jillian, to her son's football practice and just sat in the bleachers and chatted with her and that was good. Then I don't think I texted him at all. Maybe I texted him goodnight. I literally am addicted, like can't not do it, feel like I don't know what's driving me, right? Then the next day I had open house, my big annual opening event, big reception with music and catering and the whole thing, so I was very busy the whole day. I was leaving for the night and had a text from him. Meanwhile, I'm struggling, suffering like, "I miss him. I feel bad." I have a text from him saying, "Are you home? Wait, nevermind," and then whatever. I called him and was like, "What did you need?" He had wanted to pick up the phone case that came in the mail for him which I had left on the front porch in the flowerpot. He got that. And drop off the keys that the cat sitter had used over the weekend that she gave to him because she's on his crew, his dance crew. [00:04:09] So he dropped off the keys. I guess he brought them upstairs and put them inside. I texted him and he was like, "How was open house?" and I didn't talk to him for very long; then I texted him in the morning. I sent him a picture of the cats. I don't know. They were being cute and they're still his cats, too. So I sent him a picture of the cats and I was like, "The cats are having a good day." Whatever. I probably should have not done that. And also a lot of what my friend Jennifer was like, "You're kind of rewarding him when he hasn't done anything. You're rewarding him by letting him see you, letting him talk to you, letting him have you there in his life; and he hasn't really done anything to show you that he deserves that." I was doing that again. But, anyway, last night I had class and I went home. I was feeling really sad and I was talking to my mom on the phone. I was just feeling really sad. I missed him and I just wished stuff hadn't gotten all messed up and was feeling sad that he also, even though I said I wouldn't respond to him, he's now texting me like, "Hey, I did this today," or "Hey, hope you're well. Have a good day," like, "You're the one that should be pursuing me, so I was feeling bad about that. Then all night I was dreaming about—there was a scenario and it was Franklin and there was another girl there and my friends were there telling me to stop talking to him. I don't remember what the circumstance was, but it was not pleasant and it was just more of the same frustrations. Like, "Why are you talking to that girl?" I don't know. I woke up feeling less bad than I was last night and more irritated and confident in my resolve that this is not working right now. I opened his Facebook to see a post that said, "Ugh." Something like, "Note to self. Reminder to self. Don't celebrate reaching a goal with booze on a Thursday night when you know you have work early in the morning." And here's what made me mad, not only because he's sitting around boozing celebrating some reaching a goal. [00:06:05] I promise you reaching that goal, whatever he's talking about, was some move that he probably got in break-dancing. Okay, everybody has their right to their own little celebrations of whatever, but it frustrated me because I made this big point and I want him to be working on all of this stuff and he's there boozing and celebrating, doing something with dance. He's not telling me—instead of a text coming like, "Hey, by the way, I found my therapist," or whatever. It made me feel like I didn't need to be talking to him right now if this is how he's going to treat it. He's clearly like this is not on the forefront in terms of how to fix things with me. Like what the fuck? Now I don't even feel bad at all and I'm glad to not be talking to him because it would just be frustrating and I don't know what's going to happen and when I'm going to talk to him next right now. . It made me feel like I didn't need to be talking to him right now if this is how he's going to treat it. He's clearly like this is not on the forefront in terms of how to fix things with me. Like what the fuck? Now I don't even feel bad at all and I'm glad to not be talking to him because it would just be frustrating and I don't know what's going to happen and when I'm going to talk to him next right now. [00:06:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And when was this incident that you're talking about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That he put the posting? This morning. I didn't talk to him last night. Last night I had been feeling so sad—poor Franklin—and I didn't talk to him at all yesterday, night or during the day or today at all, and I'm not planning to. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound like you're trying to convince me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And myself. (pause) I've been trying to . . . There have been so many instances of . . . I've been dealing for so long with him convincing me that my feelings aren't exactly what they are or that I'm looking at things differently than anybody else would and having different reactions than anybody else would; and, therefore, I'm more dramatic and over the top. I'm kind of having a hard time getting out of that, but I feel justified, like I'm not making a bigger deal out of stuff. [00:08:09] Even the posting, Franklin, you shouldn't be doing that on Facebook. You're not even sending me text messages saying this, that and the other. You're not saving the money that you need to pay the $800 to get back into school because of the class you failed. Instead you're spending $300 on a Playstation and booze or whatever else you're doing. What are you doing? It upsets me and it hurts my feelings, but I think it makes me more angry than anything because here I've put all this emotion and effort and he's talking about how sad he is and how he comes home and cries and I'm his best friend and he lost his best friend and blah, blah, blah. Okay, so where's the effort of the stuff that even if you don't really want to do it, you know that it's important to me in our relationship and you want to be in a relationship so badly with me—so why aren't you doing these things? [00:09:03] It's like I don't understand. And it's like what am I making an effort for then at all? "It's so hard to find a therapist. It's so hard to call the Health Insurance and ask them to send me a list of people that are in my network. It's so hard." I don't think that's hard. (pause) I think I was expecting him to step up to the plate, but it just doesn't seem like he's doing that right now. It's making me not really care—not making me not care, but . . . (sighs) [00:10:02] It's also making me feel like, God, if I'm not there pushing him along he's just going to do whatever; and I don't want to have somebody like that for the rest of my life as my partner. I want you doing stuff that's self-motivated. I don't know. And also I've said, "Here I am. I've started classes. I have all this schoolwork. I'm making plans with friends and reaching out to friends. I'm helping friends and doing this. I'm working. I did this big event. I'm doing all this shit and he's boozing because he got some move in his club probably." I can almost promise you—I've known him long enough and I know him well enough to know that "reaching a goal" wasn't getting back into school. Like, "I'm sure that wasn't the goal you're talking about. Was it getting a certain amount of light from your fucking stupid page with your fucking photography?" Shit. I was feeling pretty proud of myself when I was at home and I was like, "God, I planned that whole, damn event, I got an "A" in my course over the summer, I'm already doing well in this class and enjoying it and my professor likes me and I'm posting on the discussion boards and I'm planning all of this stuff and I'm dealing with all of this stuff. And then he's like so 'I can't do anything because I moved and I work nine to five at a helpdesk,'" not planning anything, just taking tickets and not logistically planning anything at work or in my life or taking classes or going to therapy. (pause) [00:11:57] I also feel like we're in a game of who's going to call who first? It obviously should be him, if anybody is going to call anybody. He should even be calling me, texting me, and I shouldn't be responding. That should be happening right now in my mind. Like, "You should be telling me what you've been doing and showing me that you've been making an effort." (pause) (sighs) [00:12:57] [It's usually him not really knowing what to feel or think about this I think.] (inaudible at 00:13:02) (pause) There I am, sitting at home, worried, thinking, "Is he sad? What's he doing? Is he [ ]?" (inaudible at 00:13:26) and he's at a club boozing and dancing with his friends. And I'm sitting home thinking that because this is what he told me, that he comes home and cries. Going back thinking, again, it's very characteristic of how it's been, this whole situation and our whole relationship. I'm just trying to get by. Day to day just trying to deal. [00:13:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you're feeling pretty frustrated and helpless in that, on the one hand, you really can't get through to him. On the other hand, you can't really walk away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That was one of the things I was talking about with Jennifer. She was like, "I know that you're not ready to walk away from this relationship yet. I know that. You're not, but you do need to do something drastic to kind of shake this up and make it clear that this is serious." She advised me to do that, but to not make the mistake that she made which was take him back three times, thinking that she could do something differently even if he wasn't changing too much. "That's one thing I'll tell you—maybe try this and see what happens and it's scary. You don't have to walk away yet, but don't give him a bunch of chances. Don't let him come to you in two weeks and say, 'I've done all this and I think I'm better,' and take him back; and then stuff falls into the same patterns." [00:15:05] Then I brought up how maybe I am making it too serious. He didn't physically cheat as far as I know. She was like, "Trina, it doesn't matter. He was talking in a way for an extended period of time to a woman that made you feel uncomfortable and that was inappropriate. Maybe he wasn't feeling emotionally attached to her, but he was still emotionally cheating on you even if he wasn't physically cheating on you. He was talking to another woman. Don't make it less than it is because he tries to." Like, "I didn't cheat on you. What are you talking about—emotional cheating?" That's what he would say to me. I was like, "It is, Franklin." (pause) Yeah, it is hopeless, but to the same extent I feel like that situation—I do feel a little helpless because there's nothing I've been able to say or do that is going to make him act differently. [00:16:17] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you also—I know we talked about this a while ago—there is this thing where you sort of think about things from other peoples' points of view instead of your own, whether they're his point of view—where, when you're talking to him and he dominates or takes over what you're thinking, or when you think about how sad he that is and call him up. Or when you think about what Jennifer said you should do or what my view is about being in denial about all of this. It seems to me that you (pause) really do lose ahold of where you are coming from. [00:17:43] I have a feeling that you sort of feel like you know you should come in here and say, "I really wanted to be in touch with him every day this week." And there's some way that you get affirmed with what other people say you should do and trying to convince me of things about what's going on, which also seems like you working very hard to manage something, but I'm not sure what exactly. [00:18:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do have a hard time 100 percent looking at things or at a situation from my own point of view. I do tend to look at it from other peoples' ways of thinking about it or something and what they say. Maybe that's because . . . I don't know. My point of view is kind of "You're an asshole and I love you, but I will never marry you." That's kind of maybe why I'm looking at other peoples' because even the ones that are saying, "You should leave him," at least I can be okay with them saying that because it's like, "Well, yeah, but you obviously know that I have to make that decision for myself." So it's okay for them to say that; but then for me, honestly, I am at the point where this is a total wash. There's nothing here to work with anymore. It's really painful. I love him and I miss him and I did want to talk to him every night this week and maybe see him, too. But it's really stressful and I don't want to give myself an ulcer. [00:20:39] He's not giving me anything to work with, so the way that I look at it is that if you're not giving me anything to work with, then I've literally given you all that I have in this relationship and even in this breakup or separation. And I don't feel that reciprocated and if I continue to not feel that reciprocated, that's it. I can't do anything anymore. I think that's a hard decision to be moving towards, I guess, for me. I guess I was feeling more emotional about it during the week and then I'm thinking about the fact that he hasn't been texting me or making an effort to tell me things that he's been doing. Then this whole thing this morning with his stupid Facebook post about being hung over like, "What am I stressing over saving right now? You don't really seem like you're stressing over saving anything." [00:21:58] Whatever. He may be having more of the thoughts he's having, but he's not showing me anything. He's not coming through on these things that I said were important and that would allow us to think about still having a future. I think I was hoping for more, expecting more out of him. He's disappointed me so far so, yeah, I don't know what to say. (pause) If he does send me a message like, "I'm in therapy. I hope you're well," how do I react to that? I don't know. [00:23:03] I'm really not expecting a message like that to come through [ ]. (inaudible at 00:23:06) Maybe he'll surprise me. Jennifer is like, "I promise. He'll come crawling back. Jerry still calls me all the time begging to see me." I'm like, "Okay, but after how long?" This whole situation is not what I wanted. (sniggers) I don't think anybody would want it, but I never wanted to deal with the situation of somebody having to crawl back to me. (pause) I guess I just don't really know how I feel about him overall or how to react. [00:24:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:14) </p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of not knowing how to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Period.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I guess the idea of being single and not having to worry about stuff. I have to say I've been enjoying being able to go to bed whenever I want without somebody being like, "You're going to bed so early?" or having the TV on and turning the lights off when I want. In the mornings just being able to do my thing, whether I'm running late or not, and not have somebody kind of like, "What are you doing? Why are you doing that?" [00:25:10] I'm doing that quite a bit. Also being able to go and do whatever I want, like after work just on the fly going to the football game with Jillian and not having to explain to anybody or change any plans with anybody or anything. The idea of that more long-term comes to mind, but then the idea of missing him and missing out on birthdays and holidays together, hanging out with him and stuff. I'm almost getting used to it right now, I think. But then you know when I said that's just not me—hanging out. How many times have I been so irritated with him dominating conversations with his ridiculous theories on things? How irritated that would make me and dealing with drinking too much and, "Let's get wine." "No, no. I don't wine." "Ohhh." He makes me feel like I'm a party pooper. Going to things that he wants to go to that I might not feel as comfortable at and feeling guilty if I don't go and him making me feel like I'm a party pooper if I don't go. That's stuff that I really hate about being with him. So when I look at that stuff, it's like, "Maybe I can find somebody that stuff isn't like that and someone that does look better on paper, too." Stuff like that. Thinking about options in that regard (sighs) (pause) [00:27:13] I do have some struggles but . . . I'm going out tonight and tomorrow night with some girlfriends, two different groups of girls, and going to places where we want to dress nice and there are drinks and people and music. It's really nice and not be worried about somebody asking what time I'm going to be home and feeling pressure or guilt like, "I'm just going to stay in then," because he did that a lot and I would feel guilty about going out with my friends and I really don't think, I should. I'm still young. I should be able to go out until three if I want. He does, too, but he always makes me feel like, "When are you coming home?" If I would come home drunk he'd be annoyed. [00:28:11] I don't want to deal with that and I'm happy to not have to this weekend. It's like the first weekend I don't have to ever deal with that. If I want to stay over at my friend's, it's fine. The money thing, too. I'm still catching up a little bit with my finances and I don't have a ton of extra money right now, but just not having to worry about somebody else's finances, just worry about my own. Go out for a $50 dinner at with my friends and have two bottles of wine with them and not have it affect "our" budget. Next time around—if there's a next time around with somebody—I'm definitely not moving in with them until I'm almost engaged to them. Even then, I'm not sharing my finances with anybody until I get married. Lesson learned in both of those situations. [00:29:12] It's too much, too fast, and yeah, that won't happen again. In the meantime, it's nice to have my own finances back and not have groceries at the house if I don't want to have groceries at the house and get take-out every night this week if I want which I haven't, but I could. Although I got two parking tickets yesterday and that was frustrating. There is a parking ticket for Franklin and then I got two other parking tickets. I'm literally paying the city's street-cleaning bill this month or something. Obviously not. I got two parking tickets yesterday and that was frustrating, but I have to brush it off. It was a stupid mistake on my part the first time. I forgot to bump the meter. The second time I misread the sign, so it was three after six instead of after eight. That was dumb. But, ehh, it's my problem. (chuckles) That's great. It's my problem; it's not somebody else getting tickets. [00:30:31] I don't even think he has any idea of how to manage finances on his own. Clearly, not if he's [ ] spending all this money. He even has his credit card bill linked to my bank account because it was our bank account. It's a Capital One with a $300 limit on it, and so he has $300 and I promise you it's still sitting on there. I promise you he hasn't paid it yet. I took my account off of there immediately. Am I wrong, though? I don't know. Again, I think I was feeling sad about it all week and then this morning I woke up after having those dreams that made me annoyed and seeing his annoying not-progressive post, now I don't feel sad as much as just, "Fuck it. Let me just fucking wait and see if he fucking calls me or something. I can't be bothered right now." Yeah, I'm sure that it's . . . See, here I go. I was literally about to say, "Yeah, I'm sure that is going to make him feel sad." [00:31:30] Okay, I'm sure it will. It makes me feel sad, but why do I even need to worry about that or think about that or say that? It's my problem. I really can't walk away from that inclination. Maybe in time I will, but right now I really am trying to work hard at not having my mind wrapped around how he might feel about this or what he might think about me not talking to him. I need to worry about myself. I been doing all of this stuff for everybody—for work, for him, for the house, for all of this stuff. What have I done for me? I am doing more. Obviously I'm going out with my friends as I mentioned and I think it's especially important right now to keep busy. I'm finding that at home it's a little more difficult. [00:32:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe I will have to move at some point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a lot that reminds you of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We moved in there together and had almost our entire relationship in that apartment, so I'll see. I like my apartment, I really do. But sometimes when I'm home I'm just thinking about it, just sitting around. I will have to figure out if I continue to feel this bad then, yeah, maybe I should think about finding a new place on my own and starting fresh on my own at some point. I'm not quite ready for that, but it would be good. We'll see if we end. I'm sure I'll want to text him, but I'm just going to try to stay busy and if I feel like calling or texting him, maybe just calling or texting a friend instead. I'll be interested to see if he texts me at all this weekend or tries to call me. I'll try not to pick up the call or respond to the text message, but I am curious to see if he will reach out. Even if he does, though, it's not going to be saying something, I'm sure, that can convince me that he's working on stuff. Maybe it will be nice, but . . . [00:34:09] I guess it's kind of like lesson learned. Earlier this week when I was texting him and calling him it was me, not him. I was like, "Wait a second. I'm the one not talking to him. Stick with it." (sighs) I guess it's just a difficult period that I'm trying to manage the best I can, and I've been doing pretty good. I do think I'm doing pretty well. I'm just staying distracted. I just want to kind of get a better handle on my reactions to things and how I'm feeling with things, and not rely so much on thinking what other people's opinions or people's thoughts about it—more relying on my own feelings and instincts, I think, is important, too. (pause) [00:35:20] Do you have any opinions? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, not really. It seems to me you're sounding a little more in touch with how you feel. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely more so than last week or earlier this week, I think. (pause) I guess I'm seeing things a little bit more for how they are. I see by you, that I'm not talking to you and you're not doing anything, that I see how that's helping me. There will be digging out of that sense of denial that I have about how things are and how they could be and how they were and how they might be and seeing it for how it is and dealing with that, as opposed to looking at how it was in the past or how it could be in the future. [00:36:32] That was a big problem I was having, so I feel that's a good thing. I'm just finding that distractions are very key for me right now and I think that's in with the whole taking care of myself area.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things like seeing your friends.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Staying out and doing stuff that I've wanted to do but maybe have been hesitant to follow up on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which it doesn't sound like those things are purely distractions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're just things that I would be doing in a normal life; but it's acting as a distraction because it's not stuff that I've been doing as frequently before when I was with Franklin, as I am now. I'll go out every night of the week if I want to or need to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm saying they're a distraction as well, in that if you're out with your friends you're not thinking about it in the same way or you're not as tempted to get in touch with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. So that's helpful as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is tough in the apartment without him there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and with the cats and stuff. My roommate is nice and we've had a couple of conversations and she seems cool, although she asked me if I could unplug my air freshener because she has allergies to strong fragrances. Ugh. I did it. It's fine. I was like, "My house doesn't smell with it." (laughs) It's one of those things, you know. But, yeah, it is difficult so I'm going to have to think about that as an option. If I want to move, I can. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:27) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's helpful to have the support of my friends and be able to come here and talk about things. People don't understand. They think therapy is like this big "thing," when really it can just be as simple as helpful to just talk to a third party. People think it's this big "I don't want to be in therapy," more like gut serious. (sighs) It should be a fine weekend and I have plenty to do at work and schoolwork next week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What other thoughts are in your head?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In terms of things to do? [00:39:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In terms of whatever happens to pop into your head at the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Honestly, I was thinking about maybe buying a new pair of shoes to wear out this weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) What did you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Some new high heels, maybe. I haven't really worn high heels in a while. I thought it might be nice. I'm getting my hair cut next week, which is always nice. I'm looking forward to that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it feels random, but it always happens that the stuff that seems random is so closely connected—not always, but oftentimes. It's like you're kind of thinking of being out there single again and, I would imagine, thinking about how you look in a different way than you might when you're with somebody. So there are things to do with interacting between you and Franklin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, thinking about choosing an outfit based on how I want to look and how I want to feel, as opposed to how he might want me to look or might like me to look or how I might look with him—out of place with people that he knows. It's a really different way of thinking about it and it's more fun. I'm like, "I can just buy something." [00:41:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the differences? Would you wear different styles than you would tend to wear out with him or is that . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Yeah, maybe, because I was always very conscious of how I would look around the people that he hangs out with and maybe try to dress a little bit more in that style. Also, he would like me to wear some things that I really didn't like on myself, but I would do it because he liked it. Yeah, I think I will be a little bit more—I don't know. Maybe a little bit more older. Like maybe buying a whole new outfit to go out one night just because I want to because I want to look cute and not it being, "Why are you buying a whole outfit? You've got lots of clothes" Maybe wearing lower-cut shirts. (chuckles) I don't know. Spending more time on my hair and makeup, being more conscious of my accessories, being more conscious of being out with my single girlfriends and maybe wanting to look cuter so we're the "cute" group of girls. A lot. I am. It does have a lot to do with it, thinking about being out there again. I'm looking forward to it for this weekend, at least. I have nice plans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll stop for now. </p>

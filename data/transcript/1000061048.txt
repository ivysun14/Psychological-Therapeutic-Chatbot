<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 0222-115. Interview number 19. Client 0222-115, Interview number 19.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's going to many a false start on these tapes where all they're going to hear is me panting for a couple of minutes. The trip to Boise was a successful disaster. I got all my business done. As far as what happened with Jes and I, I'd rather not gone. It's a, turned into just the epitome of all the hassles we're having with absolutely no room for correction. </p>

<p>We had agreed to set aside one day to just sit around and rap for a while. And having no place to go, we had intended to just go out to the woods. It's about four miles out in the country. I figured on just walking out there and spending the day at the woods and having a picnic or something.</p>

<p>So of course it rained that day. And we ended up spending the day over at Carmen's again which was nowhere because we ended up with quite a crowd around and she played the guitar while I sat around and read and watched TV with Carmen's little brothers. So it was nowhere. It was just a loss. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was Saturday. Sunday I, or Saturday night I was just pretty well convinced I'd get up and go to the airport and forget it. But I got and decided that wasn't too good an idea. I called up Jes and we got to talk for about 40 minutes before I had to leave. And it was 40 minutes of what it would have taken four hours to get anything done. And it just.. 0:02:24.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. And you were still having to do it not face to face. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I don't think it will get done not face to face. We didn't get it done. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you saying? Things are still?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh they're more fouled up than ever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the, whatever hassles we had were just compounded by the latest experience of absolute frustration. Both of us going different directions and not understanding each other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that what that was on whatever day it was that you watched TV and she played the guitar like a, like a..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it was just an absolute..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Misunderstanding. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was almost a hostility of just I didn't want to be around her while she was sitting there rapping and playing guitar with Carmen because it was not that I didn't want to be with her, it's just that I didn't want to be with her when that's all there is to do and it..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew that isn't all there was to do. We, we, there were other things to do but there was no way of getting together on it. And it just, it was so fucking frustrating I didn't even want to be there. So, it's fucked. I don't know what the hell is going on now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what, what you're saying makes me think like it's almost as if there had still been those 900 miles between you. The way it worked out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's, it was like not so much the 900 between us it's between what I had intended for all of that to be, you know the.. Like I was with Jes but it didn't mean a thing because it was absolutely not what I wanted to do. 0:04:12.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>So you're feeling what? Oh the hell with it? I'm disgusted. What's your main feeling for it? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know. I feel like just feeling bad about that. I've done it too damn long. I'm considering dating. I mean, I'm really. I'm tired of being a chaste little mother up here and I'm horny as hell. I've been around here for a year and a half. And I'm just getting tired of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That and Jes' as much as made it clear that sex would be the last thing she's concerned with. She just doesn't even want to bother with it. And that struck me as..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean between you and her..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or she doesn't care if you do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, between she and I. And I can understand that she's had a lot of problems, but I didn't like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must have hurt. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Quite truthfully it did. But screw it. I don't know. I'm getting tired of waiting and evidently she and I, you know as one, are never going to get our shit together at this rate. So I figure I may as well just do something that at least try and keep me from running around in circles. 0:06:07.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that hold out any, I'm not sure how to put this. Does that hold out any sense of relief or positive expectation? That you might date or you might have a sexual relationship with somebody here. Or is it more like, "Oh, that's a fucking mess. I'm just going to.."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I've never dated much. I've, I've probably only dated about a dozen girls. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But normally I was only going with one girl. And I've never really dated around at all. So it's like I figure I've go nowhere to go but up. And if I should go out and fall on my face in the process of trying to date around and establish relationships that way, it isn't going to hurt me much. I wouldn't fell much loss about it all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Yeah, I guess what I was asking was do you see it, do you feel in any way kinda positive about that prospect?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either dating around or finding somebody. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Nuh huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just as a why go why not? Or I'm damned if I'm going to sit around like this anymore? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the closest. I'm just sick of evidently we, for the 40 minutes that we did get to talk all it did for me was bring it out very clearly that we look from entirely different directions on an awful lot of things. And it's going to, it will really take an awful lot to get an understanding on them. But..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:08:12.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: There' s just not that kind of time available and she doesn't seem to be willing to put forth much effort to a lot of it. I don't, I may be blind to my own faults in that, that I'm blind to them if that's the case. I can't imagine anything else I should have done or could have done. I've tried to get it together. I'm sure she has too but it just hasn't worked. So there's, there's no word or mention or even expectation of she and I breaking up. I just, I'm not going to put all my cookies in one basket any more though. By that I don't mean necessarily that I'm going to go out and date other girls. I mean I'm just not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to make that relationship my reason for everything that I'm up to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's bummed me out too many times.</p>

<p>The deposition came off fairly well. And I'm real happy with the attorney I've got. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And especially after I found out from my dad, he had been talking to him. And he was the insurance attorney at my other trial. Or one of two. That I was a little peeved off that he didn't say something because although I was ignorant and it took me until the middle of the, or the first of the trial, when it was kinda pretrial when it was too late to do much about it to understand that my attorney was an ass.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed that he at least didn't say something. But that could just be professional discreteness. But he was telling my father that there was a chance the thing could be settled out of court and with my permission he'd like to just deny them the chance to settle it. It's my choice whether I can let the insurance company. 0:10:14.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He says there's real good odds if we can get it into court that we can cut them off without a dime. And he was telling this to my father. And he said the reason is because he knew that it fucked me up pretty bad at the court and he thought it would do me a lot of good. And get my revenge one way or another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's strange. It's the only time I'll ever admit to myself that I really do want some kind of revenge. But I usually have a feeling that that's just one of the most wasted energies there is. That and jealousy really turn my stomach. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah but there's some sense in which like this is so, well wait a minute. Let me back off. I was going to comment like that it sounds really nice to me to have somebody thinking about you as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's what I said. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not just what..</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's been so long since I felt like somebody was really gave a shit what I felt like in this situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was really nice to know somebody had considered it. Revenge. Maybe it's not so much revenge as I feel like it's my place to administer a little justice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was going to say. It's not like you're taking something away from them that they have or wish them harm. In a way the whole thing is a God damn sham and you just don't want it to go through or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd hate to see it carry any further even if it's just my principles that are dented. It's, it's that much and that's what hurts most to me anyway. I couldn't care less whether the insurance company loses money. I mean my insurance rates will go up anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? Which ones? Personal ones you mean? </p>

<p>PATIENT: My car insurance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'll be lucky to get car insurance after this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, of course. 0:11:55.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: God I'm tired. I don't know why I'm so tired. I couldn't get a check cashed when I got to Boise so I had two meals during the three and a half days that I was there. 0:12:18.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just starving to death most of the time. And I didn't get much sleep until the last night. I got pretty good sleep then. </p>

<p>I was watching TV the other night for the first time in, wasn't the other night, the other day. It was while I was in Boise. First time in a long time. I just hate TV. Even when something I might like is on I won't watch it because I hate TV. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was watching some really corny little show. And it amazed me how sensitive I was to it. Like this really hokey little simple, it was almost a kid's show I guess. It just almost had me moved to tears when the symbolic matchstick girl falls in the river and drowns and all this crap. (chuckles) Really amazed me that having not been around that kind of thing for so long has left me so uncallused (ph) to it. 0:14:07.7 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. At being moved by something almost maudlin. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was really ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh at myself at the very same time. And yet I really did feel that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I know. Have you heard about this program that's like Sesame Street it's called Mr. Roger's neighborhood? No it's not like Sesame Street but it is a show for kids and there's this really nice man on it. I watched it one day and the guy nearly had me balling. Because he was such a gentle man and he was talking to you know his audience in this very gentle way and it made me think of being a little kid and being a slightly shy person. You know I just, I don't know why I'm balling over this kids show. I mean crying at this kid's show. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's funny. But well maybe I was missing something. I was looking at it in kinda a humorous way. Are you saying there was something about what happened to that girl that really did...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know whether it was even a little girl. I hardly remember the show. I was just saying that because I've heard, it's that kind of a you know just very corny situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And no, there was nothing really about..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing significant. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Just a page that happened to come clear when I happened to turn it over. </p>

<p>Well my paychecks are gone before I even get them now. But at least I know it is paying off debts. I'm hacking away a little bit. I found out that there's a things I've got to send off. Oh! I knew I was supposed to write a letter today and I couldn't remember what. So I wrote a letter. Now I remember what it was. I have to write a, an account of expenses and send it to my attorney. And he says he can probably get a good percentage of it out of the insurance company.0:16:05.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Which will help. I don't know whether to try and screw them or not. Because the only expense I had the whole time I was there was my plane ticket. I stayed with some friends and didn't eat. It wasn't' a very expensive trip at all.</p>

<p>I got my one y straightened out. I got my birth certificate back from the enlistment board. And they remembered me strangely enough. They didn't recognize me but they remembered me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's one y? I forget. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's temporary deferment either for medical or. Mine's for probation right now. And I even made arrangements so that I don't have to reestablish my medical deferment on my shoulder until next October I guess it is. So I can stretch out the one ways, one y's as far as I can. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah so it sounds like some kinds of details, like sort of concrete out there, external details just got settled and worked out pretty well on that trip. But none of the inside ones did or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. The business end of it was a complete success. The personal end of it was actually disaster. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that the whole thing left some kind of impression on Jes. Especially that, what little bit of a talk we did have. But somehow or another I can't even get excited over finding out what it was.0:17:57.0</p>

<p>I finally found out from Anne, Stevie's mother, what it was that or part of what it was that Stevie had found out that he'd refused to tell me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strangely enough Stevie is one of the very, very few people that Jes' parents don't seem to object to. Which is also very strange because he has middle of the back length hair. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he's very strikingly strange dude. He's like six seven or something like that. And it seems that her parents have gone to both the school and the police and told them that Stevie deals dope. Which is strange. Steve is one of the biggest users I've ever known. Or was. He isn't any more. But he, he's never dealt dope. And I can't understand why. There are other people that I know they know from my letters do deal dope. And yet they don't seem to have done much about that. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why should they have it in for him? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. And yet why is it they are still considering him as cool? I have a feeling that they're not only very harsh and unfair people but they're also pretty deceitful. I don't doubt in the least and I'm quite well convinced that when they took me in under the wing and allowed me back into civil life in the family their last summer, it was to the effect that they knew sooner or later they'd probably be able to break it up. Which is, they finally got their chance last fall. And I have a very fearful suspicion that that may be what they're doing with Stevie. 0:20:00.23</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it kinda makes you realize how wary you have to be with people like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it's like I'd never be able to trust them. And I feel a little vulnerable because I love to trust people. I feel that way at work too. People out there are very much that way. You just, you cannot be on their good side no matter what kind of friend you consider them. The people that seem to be in the positions above me are all well known for many years of backstabbing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they'll just rip you apart any chance they get. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like there's no way to feel secure. I know that my hair and the way I dress doesn't go over with some of them. Some of them strangely enough seem to like it. We get along real well. But those people above me again aren't among those. And I've decided lately that I, the only way to cut my hair is to either cut it quite short so that it doesn't curl or to grow it long so that it will curl and go ahead and do it's thing without flipping out and flying out in every different direction. And I don't want short hair so I'm going to go ahead and grow it long. And I just, I just wonder how long I will be able to get away with it before one of them starts putting crap on me.</p>

<p>I know there are freaks working and since it's civil service and since I'm also sponsored in a political way I don't think they'd go so far as to try and fire me. They'd just give me an awful hard time. They may even go so far as transfer me. Which I wouldn't mind. Like if I ended up in a yard up north like Tye was in I just wouldn't cry at all. Not over that. 0:22:38.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's your sponsor? Is it someone well known? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I doubt it. I doubt you know him. It's a guy that lives here in Central Park by the name of Dave. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But someone well enough entrenched so that they can't do away with you (ph). </p>

<p>PATIENT: He's one of the most political potent people in the city right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm .</p>

<p>PATIENT: He'll be running for Committeeman next elections. And although he's not known because of public office, he hasn't held one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He's been working in one department and then moving into another. And he's built up a huge patronage following so that he has a hell of a big army behind him. So although he hasn't got a name yet, he's got quite a bit of power. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>Yeah there's like there's a whole, like things in an organization like that or even where it's just a couple of people like Jes' parents involved it's like, it's like leading two lives. There's some surface niceness camaraderie. You can drink, go out and drink beer at lunch with them and talk about this and that and yet there's a whole like underground world that you have to, it's very subtle but you have to always be on the lookout for what somebody else does. 0:24:35.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's taxing. As well as being you know in some instances when you look at it, sort of sad that kind of backbiting. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. And taxing. I've, I've described it to myself as very tiring to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like having to play a game is bad enough. But having to play two of them is, it's reasonless and quite a bore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess also you were saying or I was gathering from what you were saying, it goes against your grain. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Very much. Like I'm sure if I were willing to kiss ass and play their game I could be better at it than most of them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't find very many of them smart. And it's just that I, I'm willing to take whatever detriment it puts on my ledger to go ahead and do it my way instead of playing their game. I just, I'm not willing to. Those people that seem to have, those people that kinda put it as a mark for me that I'm willing to wear a hat like that and take the ribbing from some guys and still get along with them ok are the ones that seem to be more or less, if they're not my friends they're the people that I seem to feel would be my friends. They, they recognize that I'm not doing it because I'm crazy so much as that I'm willing to do it and I willing, I want to and that I'm willing to put up with what I have to go through to do it. That isn't what I wanted to say though. (chuckles) 0:26:23.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were saying something like they sense, or there's a bunch of people that you're not close to them but at least there would be the most possibility of knowing them a little better and they sense that you're not willing to just go along and that..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now there's the kind of people that think I'm a hippie freak idiot doped up kid that wears hats like that and old coats like this and boots like this just because I'm that kind of a kid and that's our uniform.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's others that know damn good and well, or seem to give the impression to me, that they know damn good and well I could wear short hair and regular clothes and they'd never know the difference anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that I'm doing this because I'm willing to and I want to. And they seem to understand, or they seem to empathize with the kind of position I'm in. </p>

<p>There's one interesting thing that happened while I was in Boise that kinda gave me a hard.. Each time that I go back, Carmen has a brother that's a year older than her named James. And an extremely likable guy but about four years ago according to what Carmen said, he just started spending more and more time by himself. 0:28:30.6</p>

<p>When he was quite young, the only thing I can figure is that when he was quite young he had a pot of boiling water fall on his arm. And he's had skin graphs across just a little ways below the elbow to midway to the shoulder. And it's still scared fairly badly. It doesn't seem to bother him any more but it did at one time. And he just started spending less and less time with people. Until now he just, he doesn't talk to anyone openly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's very friendly to be around but you just never feel like you really know him. And, except for maybe Carmen. He doesn't like to be around people. He'd rather spend his time by himself. Does everything by himself. He's a doper. He'll drop acid and just go out and just drive around by himself. Go to a show. Doesn't date. And I, it really upsets me. Like I feel like I'm sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong but I can't help but feel that he really doesn't dig it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's just learned to put it up as a very good defense and he's learned to accept it that way. And he and I had an awful good time while we were there one evening. I don't remember what it was. It was Friday night I guess. Any rate, we took Jes home and he and I just went out and played around for about four hours that night. 0:30:07.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How it's something sad about someone who doesn't choose his own solitude or at least doesn't choose it in a positive way but just kinda retreats into it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like he chooses it. There are plenty of people that enjoy his company but I can't help but feel that whether he is willing to admit it or whether he's even convinced himself that it's because he likes it that way I can't help but feel it really isn't that way. It's still a defense from the shyness he used to have about his arm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because he had told Carmen also at one time that it seemed the only way he met people or people met him was when somebody mentioned his arm and he had to go through the whole long tale of how it happened and that's how they got to know each other. </p>

<p>I know mostly the frustration of that weekend just left me so worn out. I just, I wanted to scream every three minutes. I just wanted to, I went out looking for a dude that I knew many years ago that has damn near put me in jail a couple of times. Put a friend of mine in the hospital. He caused a motorcycle accident through his drunkenness that, with one motorcycle that I was on the back of he rammed another bike that Josh was driving.</p>

<p>And cut Josh's foot so badly that the doctor said it had cut the sheath around the tendon but didn't quite cut the, he said another sixty-fourth inch and Josh would have been a club foot for the rest of his life. Well he almost is now. He's got a scar that's always painful. He can't dance. He can't run very much. He used to be quite athletic. He loved to play basketball. He can't do that anymore either. His foot's just fucked. 0:32:17.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then perjured himself in court so that Josh didn't even get hospital bills out of it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then stole Josh's bike. Took off for, I don't know, South Carolina with it. It was never seen again. I found out he was in town and I was just so frustrated. I couldn't think of any better way to vent it. I went out looking for him one night. Figured on beating him to death. But luckily that didn't pan out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the feeling of being trapped in some situation that you couldn't do anything the whole time? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were saying about wanting to scream every two minutes or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was like I couldn't just leave Boise without being a bastard. I had to stay there and at least put up the front of being with Jes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I had, it had already struck me as being so useless.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it was empty or..</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was more frustrating than being up here wishing I was there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you have to, why did you feel you had to do that for?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I had left it would have been basis for misunderstanding of why we were having problems. If I had left it would have been my fault. Everything that, the hassles whether they were caused by my leaving or not. </p>

<p>Damn. It's getting long enough where I'm biting it off now. 0:34:10.5</p>

<p>Something else came to mind while I was there that I haven't really given much thought to yet. I was waiting to see if there are any further developments before I form any opinion on it. But judging from the reactions that she had, I have a feeling that Jes is in kinda a never say die position about our relationship. Which surprised me. Because I've always made it clear to her that if I ever felt that it was better that way, whether I still liked her or anything else, I would just break up the relationship. And I don't really know where that's going to end. But I have no doubt it would distort whatever might happen in an intense situation. 0:39:27.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't catch that last part. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it will probably take a little explaining. But it's kinda a thing like..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I understand what you said about what you'd do. What I didn't get is it would probably distort and make tense, or it would probably distort a tense situation. That was the part I didn't get. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it's kinda a thing of mine that you can't, you can't need or want something, you can't need something and love it too. You could if there were no problems. The two would be the same then. But if there should ever be a problem, then your want would be of a different, it would lead you to different actions and reactions than love would.</p>

<p>So that if Jes is in a position where she needs the relationship for security or whatever, why then she wouldn't be able to break it up whether it would be better that way or not. She wouldn't even, probably wouldn't even recognize that it would be better that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well it sounds like surprised you or..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It didn't fit with how you'd been thinking about it. 0:41:00.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although I'd never, never found in her any blatant putting forth of the idea like I have that as much as I like it I'd rather just end it now than see it go bad two years from now. That's what I've been saying for a long time. Although she'd never said anything like that, I'd always just kinda taken for granted. Because we'd talked of that type of thing before that she felt at least similar.</p>

<p>And I, like I said I don't know for sure it's just that I have a suspicion that that's probably the way it sits now. Which left me in a bad position also because in maybe the 40 minutes of talk that we had she would make references of how this has to be done or this has to happen or something like that which I couldn't argue with except that that would have to happen for the relationship to go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kept, I kept having the urge to say if we were still together. And I never did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's making a strong assumption that you're treating as a contingency or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you felt what you had to allow for that in your conversation or? I'm not sure what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I almost felt like I was coddling her perception of things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know whether I should be so brutal and forward as to just say that that's only if we're still together and because that would leave her possibly with the idea that I wanted to break up. And I didn't want to do that either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. Ok but you're saying, "Ok, I let her retain that assumption and," I guess you're not sure what that means.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well wait and make sure that's it first and then maybe if I knew a little bit more of just how she feels that way and why and something like that, then I could decide what to do about it. Right now it's just a confusing little, little question mark sitting back there that I'm, I can't even see clearly yet. No, no I'm in a in a strange way where I've, like I've been through a bag like this before with Kelly. And I just feel tired. I don't want to have to go through a struggle of ending a relationship in a long drawn out painful process.0:43:30.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it kinda the fact of something that's been very important coming to an end or is the situation itself similar in some way? </p>

<p>PATIENT: The situation isn't similar in the least.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Isn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. When Kelly left me it was well, it had, there had been a year's worth of very bad trouble between us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, and it was simply she walking away and not seeing me again. Or pretty much that way. But this is, it's the only similarity is that if this should come to an end it could be a very drawn out and time consuming and wasteful affair. Both of time and emotion and of feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm super surprised that Kelly and I are still friends. I don't think we would have been if, if I hadn't both had been going, well with any girl but with Jes as it turned out when she came back and asked me for help when she was pregnant. And that's probably the only thing that reestablished any kind of friendship between us all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok but I guess, ok then what you're saying is in that you know surely in itself that's sufficient to make you feel strongly for something very searing and exhausting about that process of something coming to an end. 0:45:02.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I had a nervous collapse when Kelly broke up with me. I was just crazy for weeks on end. I don't remember day or night. I'd just sit. And I'd wake up and I'd wake up and realize I was awake and I was going to have face another day and I'd start screaming and crying. And my roommate would come in and throw three tranquilizers down me and some mornings I'd cry and puke them back up. And he'd have to, and I'd get scared because I knew that it would even be 35 minutes before the tranquilizers would take effect. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was that way for weeks on end. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just completely fucked up. And I don't want to, I don't expect anything like that again. Not because the relationship doesn't mean that much to me but I know more about myself now and I don't feel so afraid to be on my own.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not afraid to just turn away and go off by myself. I've been virtually doing that for a long time now and I've done it literally a couple of times. So it's just that not only do I, that could happen to Jes if she feels the way that like I mentioned a minute ago the way that she might. I'm sure that's, that's why it happened to me. The relationship was all I had and when it ended why then I just didn't have any reason for being around. I'd never considered just living for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah so you're afraid like the thing for Jes would be if the relationship broke up her whole foundation go in some way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though she acts sometimes like that isn't at all the way she feels. Or she seems to act like that. 0:46:44.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, Jes and I were in very similar states when we met. I had just gotten over the breaking up with Kelly. And I was just on a very even keel just drifting and being happy doing it. Because it was so much better than I had been. I was meeting people. I was in a new type of environment. I had just quote unquote turned freak. But at any rate I was, I was having a good time. And wasn't really interested in dating. I wasn't even interested in women at the time.0:47:23.3</p>

<p> Jes had gone with a guy for the summer and the fall before. We met in January of 70. And he had never given a damn for her. I know him vaguely and he's a very screwed up dude. Really a wreck. And I don't know how she got tangled up with him but he kept telling her to go away. And then he'd call her up and ask her for a date. Then he'd tell her he didn't want to see her again. Then he'd call her up. And she was supposedly nuts about him the whole time.</p>

<p>So he finally took her to bed and got her pregnant. And she was a virgin. So luckily she had a miscarriage a couple of months later. And she was in just kinda the same situation, just finally getting her shit back together. Just being happy to be alive and unburdened for a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know. She, I don't, that's one reason why I'd always taken for granted that she felt the same as I did. That if the thing is going to end, there's no use dragging it out for two years on futile efforts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's, it's, that's why it surprises me also that it might not be that way with her. I hate, I feel almost guilty talking like that because I don't mean to give the impression that I intend for it to end or that's what I'm looking forward to. I'm considering that. I always have. 0:49:05.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm considering it more as a possibility now than I have before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's still not where my efforts are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah I hear that. And it's a very, well it's a very, it's not only complicating to have her thinking on a different wavelength you think. Or feeling on a different wavelength. But it's really very sobering too. Because you want, these things hurt in her heart anyhow but you wouldn't want to like wreak damage on her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's, it's like the problem itself is a hell of a responsibility to try and figure out but this way I'm also responsible for her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, not that I'm not anyway. But in that way I am and it's, and it's, like I could, I'd never do to somebody what Kelly did to me. Never. No matter what event. It, I'm lucky to have come out of it. I know people that haven't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They're just, they're just fucked. They never trust their emotions again. </p>

<p>Wow. That's been a fast hour. 0:50:54.3</p>

<p>I don't know about time so much. But what is happening seems to be very critical at this stage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is happening between you two. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know what will happen but I mean, whatever happens to put a balance one way or another on our relationship seems to be a very critical point. And yet I really don't, I feel like I could wait two months and go back and it wouldn't make any difference as if I waited three weeks and went back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like time isn't critical. It's what happens that is. And yet although it isn't critical, time is also to be wasted. Especially to me. I don't know what to do with the whole situation. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess that's the main thing that I'm hearing is that right now, "I don't know what the hell to do." Particularly with this other, with this sort of new dimension that's added. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to make it worse, like you know it's a critical period but you're not quite sure how to move it one way or the other or which way you want it to move or..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I just don't know enough about it yet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I understood a little, if I had been able to have the four or eight or how many hours it takes to talk to Jes, I'm sure I'd probably have a good understanding of what I wanted to do. But all that that day amounted to was a greater tension between us. And the 40 minute talk the next day just threw in a whole bunch of question marks that we hadn't considered before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So and to the effect it was a, it was a negative factor in the whole situation. I don't feel bad for the question marks being thrown in. They're a hassle but they're there whether I would have known it or not, so I just as well at least have some inkling of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it does make it just that much more confusing now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not ..0:53:49.5</p>

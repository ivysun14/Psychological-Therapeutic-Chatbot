<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. You may speak (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. There's been a lot, I guess, or not really—I don't know. So we had a house meeting last night. I think it went very well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think it went very well? Is that what you said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I think everyone else think it went well, yeah. That's what I said, sorry. But I don't know, I just, like, I've been so unhappy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What went unwell for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, like, don't want to live there anymore. Like, I don't know. Even just from when it was—like, Julia called the house meeting. And I was like, oh my god, here we go again. And so even just from, like, that it was called, I was like, oh my god, I'm so annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they called for specific reasons, you don't have, like, a sort of standing house meeting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So whatever someone feels that they need to happen, we call them and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you sort of anticipate that somebody's upset with something when they get called.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And the reason that it was called was because there was this whole landlord situation. [00:01:00] Like, she had sent us a bunch of e-mails—like, she basically just figured out that someone moved out, like, five months ago, so she wants us to do something about, like, security deposit. Anyway, she keeps contacting me, right. So I sent her an e-mail and I copied everyone in. So like, "Hey, we should meet about this." Oh, so it was three things. It was the security deposit, the backyard is, like, overgrown, which is true. But it's like a jungle, like, it's really hard. And she said that there was a cat smell or cat pee smell in the basement or something. She wasn't there—it was her husband.</p>

<p>And so I kind of sent her, like, an aggressive e-mail back, being, like, look, we don't let the cats in the basement. If it's a smell in the basement, it's probably the cat carrier, which is in the basement. I know it smells like cat pee. But we can take it out and clean it, like, that's not a big deal. And then, about the security deposit, I was just like—I don't remember exactly what I said. It was about I'll do this or something, like, sort of, you know, not very nicely. And then, what was the third? Oh, the yard. I said that we were waiting until it would get colder, which is true. Like, we'd actually talked about waiting until it got colder so things die and that way we can just pluck them out and it'll be easier.</p>

<p>And so, I think people thought that it was kind of an aggressive e-mail, which is true, but then they sort of (inaudible at 02:25) meeting. So, like, from the beginning I was like, all right, people are going to be mad at me for sending this e-mail, even though it wasn't terrible—it was just, like, firm, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come you are the identified person that the landlord is going through?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I've lived there the longest. At the meeting, the one good thing that came from the meeting was I'm no longer being that person, thank God. Because I really dislike dealing with them, like, I think it's really annoying that she just figured out that someone moved out five months. And she doesn't, like, understand things. (inaudible at 02:58) she said the cat smell, I was like, OK, the carrier. But we don't let the cats down there so it's OK and we'll clean it, whatever. She was like, "OK then, just remove the litter." And I was like, what are you talking about? Like, little things like that happen all the time and it makes it really difficult to communicate with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is with the landlord or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I get frustrated really easily, because I don't like dealing with that kind of stuff anyway. It's the same at work. Like, I don't like sending weekly reports and, like, monthly reports and quarterly reports. I'm like, OK, can't you just put together the weekly reports or, like, read the monthly reports or, you know? Like, little things like that I'm not good at and they, like, frustrate me. [00:03:38]</p>

<p>But anyway, at the end of meeting, Julia was like, for the ninth time, bought up, like, the cat situation. And it's true that I haven't been as good about it as I could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the cat situation other than the urine smell down in the basement that's (inaudible at 03:52)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The litter box, sometimes, since they have two, they, like, use them separately. And I clean the one upstairs and Charlene cleans the one downstairs. I leave it for, like, a while because I work overnight sometimes, and so, like, I'll walk in and, like, my first priority is not the litter box. And so I know that I could be better about the litter box.</p>

<p>But this has been, like, an ongoing situation with Julia for, like, months and, like, I don't know—it's, like, it makes me really angry at her because there's already, like, all this tension and then right after the Sergio thing, right after we talked about how I was kind of upset that she decided to move out so abruptly. Like, literally six hours later, she talked to me about that cat. I almost had a heart attack, right.</p>

<p>And so she saved it till the end of the meeting and I was having one of those moments where I was, like, exploding in my head and, like, I was trying really hard to hold myself back from, like, telling her what I was really thinking, you know. And I don't even know, like, I know this is really immature and it's actually really embarrassing to say out loud, but, like, the more that she tells me to do it, the less I want to do it, you know what I mean? And, like, it's not that I'm, like, actively avoiding doing it, it's that I'm angrier and angrier as I do it, you know what I mean? [00:05:02]</p>

<p>And it's kind of like when I was growing up. Like, anytime my dad would say, like, you know, "Don't eat that," I'd be like, "OK, let me have that." Or, you know, what I mean? It's kind of like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel like she's stepping into this sort of authority role. And you haven't asked for her to be the authority and so you don't want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know exactly what it is because that seems like a legitimate thing to bring up for the house, like, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I was going to ask. Is this about the cat litter or is this about something else and is it coming out—you know, are you both acting out on the cat litter box?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think she's, like, legitimately frustrated. I think she's being honest. And she, like, sent me an e-mail after the meeting because she could tell I was furious. And she was like, "Hey, like, I don't want this to -" What did she say? It was something like, "This doesn't reflect on you as a person. I know you're busy." Some, like, nice e-mail trying to put—she's like, "But I tried to talk to you about it, like, a million different ways. Tell me if there's any way that I could talk to you about it. That would be more constructive." And even that was just like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she's trying. I mean, it sounds like (inaudible at 06:08)—you guys do have a friendship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. But, like, at that point, I was just too angry to really, you know—I don't know. I think it's just the talking. I don't talk that much. Like, I don't want to talk about every single detail of my life or—it's not even about that. I don't even know. I'm very confused. (laughter) I don't know. And the last time we had, like, an e-mail fight or whatever, she was like—because I told her, I was like, OK. So I was asking for advice on a situation at work and I sent it to, like, three people. I forwarded an e-mail to, like, three people. And Leonard responded—one of them was Leonard.</p>

<p>Leonard responded in this, like, very sort of, "Oh my god, step one. Like, this is a leadership conference." And I'm like, this is not real advice. This is, like, yeah. He was like, "Sit down with your supervisor so that you can establish more effective means of communication that are beneficial to -" I was like, this is not real advice. Like, this is—I don't know what it is. (laughter) It's Leonard. [00:07:12]</p>

<p>So I sort of texted Julia and was like, "Oh my god, I'm so frustrated with Leonard. Like, he could just say, 'Hey, like, I don't know what to do.'" (laughter) I don't know. And then, like, five minutes later, Julia replied and, like, 18 times quoted how much she agreed with Leonard and, like, Leonard Leonard Leonard Leonard Leonard. And I was like, oh my god, this is even more frustrating, because I was actually frustrated about Leonard's response and I told her that.</p>

<p>And so then I responded to her e-mail and I said, "Hey, like, not a big deal, but, you know, trying to be more, like, open and honest, like, I kind of felt like you were siding with Leonard despite knowing that it had actually offended me. And, like, I just—you know, we cannot do that." (laughter) It was, like, a nice e-mail and I took care, because I wasn't actually angry. I was just like, well, maybe she just doesn't know. And it was, like, nicely worded and everything. And I used I statements. (laughter)</p>

<p>And she replied, like, "I can't believe that, like, this is what you're going to treat your so-called, like, best friends. I'm not going to put up with this. And, like, we've had so much drama and I'm not going to listen to this anymore. Let's just, like, get over it." [00:08:23] And it was, like, this really angry e-mail. And I was like, OK, well, the one time I try to actually tell you how I'm feeling when I'm not super angry, like, this is what happens, so, like, what am I supposed to do, you know? I don't know. So now—and I know this is a lot like story time. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's OK, I'm listening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even recently, she was like, "Oh, I wish we didn't have the second cat," despite the fact that she was, like, really the one that started to get me excited about getting a second cat, you know. And like, so we wanted to get one together....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they house cats or are they, like, your cat—how are the cats allocated? (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Julia's cat is the older cat. She's Charlene cat. And then Bailey (sp?) cat is my cat. But initially, we'd actually talked about getting a cat together. And I was like, "Well, you know, I don't know how that'll work exactly, like, financially and, you know, once we move out wise. But that sounds fine". And so initially, like, we were supposed to get this cat together, you know. And so now that she's like, "Of course I would prefer not to live with the cat. Like, she's so gross." Just because she didn't like—I guess she didn't end up liking her. That made me so angry. I was like, are you seriously complaining to me about the second cat that you wanted to get? You know what I Mean? I don't know. [00:09:41]</p>

<p>And not that it—I love her, like, the cat, you know. She's my cat. (laughter) But, you know, it was just very frustrating. So, like, I feel like all of this is together and now I can't—I don't know. I'm just really frustrated with her because I feel like everything is about her and, like, keeping her happy. And I don't—that doesn't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would make you happy? What was would make you happy in the relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, I wish she would chill out. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Chill out about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About everything. Like, everything seems to bother her. It's not just the cat. It's, like, all kinds of other things too. Like, (pause) I can't even think of examples right now. Like, I'm walking on eggshells around her, is how I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this different than usual? Has this been something that's—when (inaudible at 10:41) this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean, I think before, like, when she moved in for the first, like, year, I didn't really notice it. I didn't really care, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Were you friends before she moved in or did you become friends?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were, like, friends as in, like, "Hey, I know you. You're in a bunch of my classes." Like, not, like, really, really close friends, but we were good friends. Honestly, I think it's been since she broke up with Sergio. Maybe it's just because she's around more often or, like, she has more time to, like, spend at the house or whatever. I don't know. So maybe that's (pause) since when. But I remember Phil said one time, like, "Oh my god, she's needs, like—everything's about her and she needs everything done for her." And I was like, "What? Like, that's not true. I haven't really picked up on that." And he's like, "Oh my god, it's so true." And then I started paying attention and it was true, like, really true. So I don't know if he, like, primed me for it or something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, (inaudible at 11:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're noticing it in ways that you hadn't before, whether it's there more or you're just noticing it more now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that was, like, months ago, but yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things are [beginning to trigger] (ph) that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I don't know. It's been, like, really complicated trying to (pause) negotiate that. I don't really quite know what to do. Like, I don't want to have a talk again then, like, I feel like that would just be prolonging everything and (pause) it would be more drama and I just—why can't we just chill and be friends?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is the last time you did something fun together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were supposed to go up North this weekend, but I worked. (pause) I don't know. A while, probably a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you enjoyed one another? I know it sounds very coupley (ph) but, like, friends actually get to enjoy each other too. (laughter) And it sounds like lately (ph) you've had a lot of tension in the house, a lot of sort of these intense discussions about how you're relating to one another and I'm wondering if you're doing things that friends do at all. [00:12:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like right now you're being roommates but you're not being friends. But, you know, you've talked about Julia in the past and she's a friend, not just a housemate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. Maybe that would be helpful. I thought of, like—maybe it's, like, my extremes thing again. Like, I either just need to move out and, like, never see anyone again or try to spend some more time with her and maybe be friends again. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I think trying to find an alternative to the extremes is the goal in the long run, right? Developing more of a repertoire of how to respond to things. I mean, it seems like there's a lot of—I think you used the word resentment, building. And we have to separate what's going on for the relationship and what is the content and stuff that's being sort of discussed through and filtered through. So, I mean, stuff like the cat or the e-mail exchanges—that's just what's happening in the moment and you guys are channeling your feelings through that. I mean, I can't speak for her, obviously, but just getting a sense of what you're talking about. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>So I wonder if, you know, if there's a way to kind of cap some of the tension on this stuff. It might be trying to come up with some solutions for the more concrete stuff. Like, figuring out some sort of compromise on the cat, so that doesn't have to be an issue and that can be put to the side and you can focus on what you want to salvage about the relationship. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's definitely what it feels like is, like, salvaging at this point. (laughter) OK. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's doable for you, like, with the cat stuff? I know you said, you know, the more she asks the less you want to do it, just because that kind of wanting to buck the authority piece comes in. So if you set aside what she's asking you to do, what do you see as reasonable for managing the care of what goes along with having a cat?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what you mean specifically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like she's upset about the litter box?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the litter box. So for me, like, I think since there's two litter boxes, two to three times a week is sufficient. Of course, like, if they, like, I don't know, eat a plant and they're pooping everywhere, like, that's different. And she wants that every other day. And, like, to me, that's totally unnecessary, unless it smells or something. Like, it's a point about (inaudible at 15:32).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 15:32), right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. So I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she wants it done almost twice as much as you do. You're saying two to three days is fine, she's saying every other day. So that's asking a lot more of you than what you would do on your own, if you were living by yourself. Is she willing to do any of that? I mean, I know it's not technically her cat, but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think she's offered before, but I never really took her seriously, just because it's always been, like, this angry thing. And so she's kind of offered and I'm like, well, that's just rude to offer. I don't know, it's been...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it be like to take her up on that offer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, I feel like it would be—this is so—I feel like a 12 year old, like, really immature, but it feels like giving in or something. and I know that that's not, you know, an adult thing to say. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're allowed to not be an adult all the time (inaudible at 16:28). I'd rather have you be honest. That's your gut response, is it feels like giving in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe if I just talked to her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you want to prove the point that every two to three days is enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Well, yeah, I guess. (laughter) I guess it is very confrontational. I mean, I haven't actually told her that I think, like, two to three days is enough. I mean, she's just always been like, yeah, every other day. And then, I'm so angry at the point that I feel like if I say anything...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's not listening to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, even just, like—it's almost like there's, like, so much anger and pressure that I feel like if I try to say anything, like, it'll all just come out—you know what I mean? So maybe I should try and tell her that I don't think it should be done every other day. Because I mean, really, it's not that big of a difference, every two to three days or every two days or—I don't know. But I guess maybe subjectively—maybe, like, we could try it out and then if she still thinks it's dirty then she could let me know or something, I don't know. [00:17:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often are you cleaning it now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, Charlene and I kind of alternate. So sometimes I'll do the downstairs one, sometimes he'll do the upstairs one. So it's kind of random. It's just really, like, whenever we think it's dirty kind of thing? But we could be better about it, so it's definitely true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if that's partly fueling some of the randomness. So even if—it might end up that it gets done with the same frequency, but if she knows what to expect, I wonder if that would feel different for her. And it wouldn't change that much for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. That might be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like coming up with something that's concrete to allow—because the anger on both ends is probably fueled by (pause) not really knowing what the solution is and it becomes a bigger thing. And I wonder if there's a way to make it more concrete that you both can rely upon on either side. You don't need to be angry at her and she won't need to be as angry at you. And then you can figure out what's really going on. [00:18:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Yeah, I think I can try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be nice about not being friends with her anymore if you let go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, that's the thing. Like, right now it's such a draining relationship for me that I (pause)—I don't know. (laughter) I'm sure that that's not true, but that's how I feel right now. (laughter) I don't know. We, like, secretly stalk each other. I think I told you about this. Like, we have this, like, really creepy iPhone app (laughter) on both of our phones that's the Find Your Friends or whatever, right, and it, like, literally GPSs where they are for you. And so we, like, creepily stalk each other all the time. Like, "What are you doing at, you know, 'so-and-so' Street?" (laughter) And so, like, those kinds of things I think are funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's kind of funny, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And kind of creepy, but mostly funny. (laughter) [00:19:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, [if you know] (ph) you're stalking each other, maybe it decreases the creepiness of it. And that you certainly don't wish each other harm until, I don't know, maybe recently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Well, I mean, I think the reason it's funny and not creepy is because I would tell her anyway, you know. There's nothing I really wouldn't tell her? Maybe that's something I would miss is someone (inaudible at 20:07).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, having someone there you can be like that with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I was thinking about it and I was like if I, you know, if I really sort of stopped being friends with Julia, I really wouldn't have a lot of friends. I don't really have a lot of friends that are, like, long term. Like, she has all these friends from, like, high school and elementary school and, like, all these people that she knows and goes to weddings for and stuff. And, like, I don't have people like that. (laughter) I have two friends from high school and, you know, a handful, like, maybe, from college. And then, like, two or three from school. So, like, it's—you know what I mean. I really wouldn't have a lot of—I notice that I don't have a lot of continuity in my friendships, which is, I don't know, strange.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a pattern to how they've ended?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much like this. (laughter) I mean, yeah. Like this or like the explosive anger thing, like what almost happened last night thing. So I don't know. [00:21:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So even if it's not about this particular relationship, this is kind of good practice to figuring out how do you deal with a conflict and not have to lose a relationship over it. It's a really good opportunity to work through a conflict and not have it be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I was thinking about that. And I was like, well, you know, if I actually ever get into a relationship or something, like, I can't just be like, "Well, you made me angry. Goodbye." (laughter) You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not all of them are worth—and sometimes it's not, you know, worth ending a relationship, that you need to have practice at figuring out how do you be mad about something (inaudible at 22:00) legitimately angry. And then find a way to work through that way and let the anger go so that the good stuff, the reason you want to have an app to stalk your friend. You know, there's probably a reason you guys wanted that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I think the only problem is that once it gets to, like—I feel like, well you're telling me to do this, then I'm going to do this other thing. Like, that's really hard for me. Just because that's—I'm not like that very often here. I'm like that a lot at home (inaudible at 22:35) weird. But I feel like once that's bought out, it's, like, hard to put it back away. You know what I mean? I don't know. Maybe it just that when I get close to people I become a control freak, I don't know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you think she's telling you what to do? What do you imagine is going on on her end that's causing her to take this role of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: What, about the cat litter or in general? (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or is there other stuff she's telling you what to do? I mean, is there additional things in addition to the cat litter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean, I think a lot of our conflicts have been fueled by, like, different expectations and communication. Like, she wants to talk about everything at all times and, like, to me, that's really stressful. And, like, I don't—it's not that I don't want to talk about anything ever, it's just that I feel like if I'm going to put in the energy to talk about something, it has to be something that's important and, like—you know what I mean? And so if someone comes at me in that sort of, like, "Let's talk about something," to me, this is like, all right. (inaudible at 23:33) running.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 23:33) talk about things, like, are they things about your relationship or is it other stuff that she wants to—when you say everything, I guess that's what I'm—what does that mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything, when did I say that (inaudible at 23:45)? (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She wants to talk about everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know, even just, like, little things. Like, (pause) see the thing is that we e-mail so much because we don't really see each other a lot and so that's kind of problematic too. But (pause) what did she talk about recently? I can't even think of any specifics, oh my gosh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have your phone, with the e-mails on it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do. Let me see if—(pause) that's terrible, right, that we e-mail so much?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like a very judgmental word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Well, but it would probably be easier to not—(pause) I mean, I've tried to move away from it. Like, I know I shouldn't e-mail as much, but then Julia likes to too so then it's really hard with—we both prefer to do (inaudible at 24:36). (laughter) (pause) Well, I can read you the e-mail from last night. Oh my god, it's really long. Well, not really.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm really sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable by mentioning the litter. I debated whether to bring it up and I probably should have done it in private, but I think it's something that I should be able to bring up with you without getting a negative response." I think that that phrasing really gets me because she uses it a lot. "I think that this is something that I should be able to talk about with you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the "shoulds" bother you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just because she said that, like, I'm not going to talk with you about certain things or, like, I shouldn't have to deal with this. Like, that kind of closes the door for me, I guess? But anyway. [00:25:36] "I know I'm not perfect and I have been terrible about chores. I freely admit that I totally understand that it's hard to keep up with things when working full-time. I'm not sure of the best way to discuss this/bring it up with you. I've tried private convo via e-mail and then a group meeting, so def tell me if there's a better way to communicate about it in a way that would be productive. I'm not trying to be rude or make you feel bad. I'm really sorry if that was the result. Honestly, from my perspective, I'd just really appreciate it if both you and Charlene kept up with the litter. it's not a personal judgment against you at all. It has nothing to do with you as a person or our friendship. Let me know of any time you want to talk."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you read that and what's your gut response?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, at the time I was really angry. But this whole, you know, "I should be able to talk to you about things without getting a negative response," like, that's what I feel and I don't think that that's an expectation that she's honored, you know what I mean? (pause) And then also the thing at the end. I mean, that's really the big thing and that went—I just, like, I cringe when I hear her say that. Like, it really pisses me off. Like, it really pisses me off. [00:26:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what about it triggers that anger for you? What are you responding to in that phrasing that gets you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. It feels like she's just in control and I'm not. That's what it really feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you really don't like being out of control.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what it is, it's like she's setting the ground rules and, like, well, do I have a say in that? (laughter) That's kind of what it feels like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I also hear in that is that you feel like you're being told that your response is inappropriate. There's something wrong with how you're responding to this. You're out of control and it's not OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and when we talked about her moving out, that was, like, her biggest thing. Like, I sort of—my reaction was, you know, when she told me she was moving out, I was still kind of thinking about it, but I was kind of, like, annoyed, but not really annoyed. More, like, thinking, trying to process it because it was, like, kind of big news. [00:27:58] And she was like, "Oh my god, I can't believe you're so selfish. Like, you should be my friend and, like, you should be supportive right now and, like, I can't believe you're not being supportive. Like, why can't you just tell me what you think?" Like, blah blah blah. It's like, she wants me—I think that really bothered me too because it was, like, she wanted to talk about how I was feeling, like, immediately. And I was like, well, hold up...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 28:22) ready. And then, she told you that your feelings weren't OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. And that time she was really angry. But it's like she does it on a regular basis, you know. And then, like, if I try to bring it up, I have this fear that she's going to respond like she did with the Leonard thing. Like, "Oh my god, this is totally inappropriate and I'm not going to put up with this. Like, you're creating unnecessary drama." And so I'm like, well, what am I supposed to do? I feel like I'm in a corner here, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's reverse the roles here. And if you came in here and said, "This is how I'm feeling about my friend and I want to say to her I feel like I should be able to say such-and-such without your responding a certain way and I expect you to be able to, you know, respond without any drama." How would I have you rephrase that in order to decrease her defensiveness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, I mean, I feel like it would be more of a question, like, "Can we talk about this? Or would you be willing to -" You know what I mean? [00:29:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't have the benefit of necessarily sending her to therapy, so you have—so she may not rephrase these things. Some of the things she's saying, probably the intent behind them are not so hostile, but the phrasing is creating a lot of defensiveness because it's making you feel like the child in this situation, and you don't want to feel like the child. So, we don't have any control over how she phrases it, but we have control over you translating it in your head to a way that you can respond in a more productive way. Because when phrased like that, it makes sense that you're responding with, "Well, I don't want to be told how to respond."</p>

<p>So if you could rephrase her saying, you know, "Could we talk about this?" instead of, "We should be able to talk about this." Or "I'd like you to respond without you getting angry," rather than, "I should be able to," you know. You have to again do the work for her so that you can have, you know—if you want to be able to have a productive conversation and she's going to phrase it like that? You can kind of take a breath, hear it in a different way, and see if you can work with the way that you're hearing it (inaudible at 30:39) you're sort of choosing to hear it. It's hard, because your, you know, your instinctual response is going to be there and it's primed based on, you know, in the past couple months, it sounds like having these kinds of interactions. [00:30:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can try that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you can even rephrase it out loud. You know, if she says, "I should be able to talk to you about this without getting mad," you can even say out loud, "You would like to be able to talk about this without me being really angry." Then you get to hear it that, she gets to hear it that way, and it gives you an opportunity maybe to say, "Well, I do feel angry about this, but if you give me a minute, I can maybe talk about it in a calm way." You know, you might need that time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely—I didn't realize I was that person, but I definitely need to—like, I didn't reply to that e-mail. I was like, I'm not going to do anything right now that I'm going to regret later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's probably a good step for you. It's OK to need some time to let the emotions deescalate a bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I think that's a big deal for me, is I kind of have heightened, like, emotional response immediately, but then I, like, don't care after a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can kind of filter it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The problem is that when I sort of care less, then I don't care to return...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To (inaudible at 32:08) back to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so maybe I can try to do that. Maybe talk to her. Because maybe I should expect to be able to tell her when something bothers me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you'd like to have people go both ways. You'd like to be able to talk to her about things without feeling critiqued, judged, demanded of. And she would like to be able to bring up things without feeling cornered or like she's getting an angry response. I mean, it seems like in both directions probably some similarities is happening in how you guys feel like you're responding to one another, and you would both like it to be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, we even agreed in the Leonard e-mail, at the end of the Leonard e-mail, we agreed, like, we're like, "Well, let's just agree that we both have good intentions and get over it." (laughter) And we're like, "OK, fine." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then you sort of moved on, but not really over. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. So I guess, yeah, that'll be good. (sighs) That's just really frustrating. I guess I just expect things to be a little bit easier, but maybe they're not. Maybe that's not a real expectation. [00:33:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's a real expectation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or a real—you know what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think in close relationships there's a lot of potential for friction. And good stuff happens when people get really close. And right now, you know, you're close psychically and emotionally. You know, you said she's spending more time in the house since she broke up with her boyfriend, your schedule changed so you're home during the day (laughter). So you're spending a lot more time in close proximity to one another and you've been friends for a while, so there's this emotional intimacy that's there. And that creates the opportunity to for all sorts of friction.</p>

<p>We end up replaying the patterns with our close friendships that are often our problematic patterns. But it gives you an opportunity to handle it in a different way and that's work. And when you get through that work phase, there's the potential for an easy coasting period. And you're just not in that place right now. Right now you're in the work phase. Hopefully they'll be, you know, sort of a worth-it outcome. [00:34:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully, yeah. I might be moving away actually. And so I was thinking, like, well, you know, do I want to stay in touch with her? Probably, you know, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you moving away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just—well, maybe. Sorry. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is part two. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, part two. I decided—I guess after I thought about it a long time, I decided to apply to (inaudible at 35:03) programs, like, formal programs. You know, the sort of the weighing was really the cost. Like, they're really expensive, but they're kind of worth it, you know. So I'll be applying to two programs...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 35:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: In Philadelphia, I think?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Philadelphia (inaudible at 35:25)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, I'll be applying to those. I don't know, you know, they're really competitive actually, so I might not get in. But I'll be applying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For fall, for spring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For summer, next summer. I think—well, next summer and next fall. So, I don't know. And I've even, you know, because all of this was happening, like, my thoughts—I know, like, it's irrational to, like, think, I'm just going to move away (laughter), but I was like, well, you know, I hate my job anyway. Like, it's not going very well because of all of the training and all of these, like, constant reports and e-mails and every month it's something different. And now more people are going part-time, so, like, I might not even get—like, the one thing that I really wanted was at least a week home, and I don't even know if I'll be able to get that during Christmas.</p>

<p>But I think I'm ready to, like, put my foot down and just be like, "Look, if you're not going to give me, you know, two weeks home, I'm just going to not come back." But anyway, it's been like this whole drama thing again. Again and again and again. Like, it just feels like the company is just trying to take advantage of us and get the most that they want from us for the least pay, basically. But anyway, so that's been going on, so I was like, well, you know, might as well just move early and, like, just move away. (laughter) I guess it's like the fight-or-flight thing in my head. [I'll be, like, all right] (ph). [00:37:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The desire to escape from an uncomfortable situation at work and an uncomfortable situation in your house is an understandable desire. It needs to be tempered with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 37:18) (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, in short term, long term. In the short term, you get immediate relief, right. You get away from work and the demands there and the frustrations of people not hearing what the concerns are, and then what would happen later. And at home, it would be immediate relief because you would be made about the cat litter anymore. But what would you lose and what would you gain by moving away? And so I think the desire is totally understandable because it would give a really immediate relief and some short term gain. And, you know, my concern is that long term it doesn't change anything actually because those same situations came pop up with the next roommate or at the next job. [00:38:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I was thinking too is like, well I'm just going to find someone else and the same thing's going to happen all over again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, slightly different scenario but a similar pattern because, as you notice, these are patterns that are not specific to Julia.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the only thing is I feel like there's, like, an element of guilt associated with that, just because I'm like, well, maybe it's my fault that I'm getting into all of these fights. And I don't know, It makes me feel really (pause), I don't know, bad? Kind of hopeless, like it's never going to get better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it probably won't get better without constant attention to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's the reason you're here, is that you notice that there was a pattern, you notice that there was a consequence of the pattern on your friendships and you wanted to do something about it. And you are. You've challenged yourself to enter into some really uncomfortable conversations with people, and sometimes they didn't work out very well and other times they did. I mean, you had some really tough conversations with your male roommate, who's name I forgot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 39:16) Tim I think? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, some of them were flops and then other times you were like, "Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought and he didn't respond, you know, in a really angry way." So there's change there. And, you know, I don't think it's your fault that things are happening, but I do think that it's partly your responsibility to figure out how to get through them.</p>

<p>People have conflict all of the time, you know. You are certainly not the only person to have conflict in other (ph) relationships. You know, situations impact it, personalities impact it, but you're the one stuck in this situation with whoever else and it's partly your responsibility to figure out how to move through it in a way that is adaptive for you, like, is able to keep your relationships.</p>

<p>How are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I didn't—(pause) I don't know. [00:40:22] It's a little overwhelming to think of, like, all of the problems that I'm having and it's literally how I spend all of my days, either avoiding them or going to work and (pause) trying to figure out how to deal with them or (pause) I don't know. It's kind of overwhelming.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, to have it all in front of you at one time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And especially, like, thinking about home too. Like, I know that when I go home there's going to be problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's stuff there too, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not just because the, you know, the fact of going home but because I know there's thing's I'm going to have to talk about when I go home, like going to Mexico and renewing my driver's license and doing that. I have four days free coming up. Like, that never happens. And I was thinking of what to do and I was like, well, you know, I have a free flight available from, like, frequent flier miles and stuff.</p>

<p>And I was like, I could go visit my mom for, like, two or three days. And I was like, well no, because then my brother would make me go to Mexico and, like, I really don't want to do that. And so, it's like this big avoidance thing now. And I don't know, it just seems like a lot. There's a lot going on and it's a little bit overwhelming to think about starting school again. And it's all just this, you know—it's a bunch of stuff. [00:41:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot of stuff at once, but some of it is actually not right now. So when it starts to feel really overwhelming, one way to tolerate that is to break it into pieces. What do you have to—you know, we're not going to ignore anything, because it's all important. But you don't have to process it all at the exact same time or figure out how to respond to each piece at the exact same time.</p>

<p>So, you know, totally appropriate to be overwhelmed in here when you bring it all up and we make it up not even just what's going on now, but we look at back a lifetime. But in the real world, to make it manageable for yourself to get through, you know, the week, what is it that you need to focus on right now? And let yourself deal with it part by part. Because you can't do it all at once.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me stop there for today and you can deal with just one piece when you leave. I did get your e-mail with the insurance stuff, so we'll put that in. And so then I think today you just owe for copay for today and last time. And we were guessing that's 20?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it might be 30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually—I do. Wait, let me check. [00:43:13]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. [00:01:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. (pause) My train was delayed. (pause) Oh, God. Um, (pause) so we're all settled at Emma and Jay's. (pause) And, uh (pause)—so tired. We had a long weekend. (pause) We've been—it's been going really well at Emma and Jay's, we are really, (pause) like I got to sit—I got hurt, Emma keeps a lot of things, like I do, personally. And so I have to say to her, like (pause) one night I was out with another friend, and I came in late and they were all watching a movie (pause) and I just wanted to be by myself? Like in my room and unpack, and do some laundry and be by myself? And I—she, I could tell... [00:02:14]</p>

<p>Like I didn't want to interrupt the movie to just, like, say to everybody, like, "Hey, I'm going to go do this now." But I could tell that she felt weird, like had a weird reaction to it? And so I've had to say—I had to say the next morning, like, "Hey, you know, I know it maybe felt weird to you when I just came in, did my own thing? I just, like—you know, because you're a person who likes to be on their own sometimes? Like, I just needed the space to be by myself, and when I come home and it's like that, I hope you don't take it personally. It's not anything about you. It's always just about me needing my space and being alone." And she's like, "Yeah, I did, you know." I take that personally a way is if someone comes in and needs to do that I always think that I did something wrong. And she said, "But I totally understand that because I'm a person who needs their space. And so I respect that." So it was nice that (pause) so it's going really well. And we spent all afternoon yesterday cooking together, and just like kind of—but separately, and we were just having a nice time. So I'm really happy about that. [00:03:24]</p>

<p>And, um (pause) on Friday, though, Chris and I got in an argument, and—this is what I was nervous about, having an argument at their place, that makes me really uncomfortable. So we all went out together Friday night, and we were at this one bar, and I was like—I was just tired, and I didn't want to be there. It was too loud, and I was just unhappy. And so I just said, "Hey guys, I'm just going to go home, because this isn't, like, working for me." And, um... Chris was a little bit... "Okay..." you know, but didn't put up a fight about it. And so I just went back to the place (chuckles) and had a little snack and watched reality television, and was totally—like I was in such a good mood. And then they all came home an hour later, and they were (pause) all of them were wasted. [00:04:23]</p>

<p>And it was like, "What happened? I left an hour ago, and we were all—everyone was fine. Like, you guys are hammered." And, um (pause) they were all so hammered that no one would answer the question, I kept repeating myself and repeating myself. And (pause) this is so weird. And then Chris kept touching me, and kept touching me, and kept, like, rubbing me. And I kept saying, like, "You need to stop, that's driving me nuts." And then he would just do it again, and just do it again, and just do it again. And I kept saying—it's like he would forget, like—it was like he was on a loop of like, forgetting. And I don't know if he was, like, blacking out of what. But I was like, "That—I can't, like, you're driving me nuts." And he just, like, smelled like beer, and when he smells like beer I just (mimics vomiting)—I can't handle it. And so I thought, like, "I'm not drunk right now, and you all are, and you're not listening to me, so I need to go to bed." [00:05:21] </p>

<p>So I got up and I went to bed, and I was pissed at Chris. Like—well, first, Jay came in, and he called me a fucking idiot. Twice. (chuckling) He was, like... he was joking, but I still thought it was incredibly rude. So that, it was like a whole bunch of things that set me off. And then—so Chris continued to make me mad, so I just went to bed. And he came in, and was like, "Oh, Queen Jenny, doing whatever she wants. Queen Jenny." Calling me "Queen Jenny." Like, going on. And I just didn't respond and just ignored him. And woke up the next morning, and was really (pause) irritated, and really pissed off, and really hurt about it. And (pause) he woke up a little bit later, and I tried to explain to him what happened, and he just continued to defend—like he'd defend points that didn't matter. And I was like, "Well, like I said, I kept saying to you guys—I just left you an hour ago, what happened?" And he was like, "It wasn't. It was an hour and a half." [00:06:17]</p>

<p>And I was like, would show him on my phone. I was like, "No, see, I sent you a text at this time saying, and then you got one that sent me -" "Okay, it was an hour and twenty minutes." "Well, I don't know why you're hanging onto that. That's not a relevant point to this argument." And so he would hang onto little things throughout the discussion, and I was like—he was like, "Okay. I'm sorry I called you 'Queen Jenny.'" And it's like, "Well, you know, that's not an apology. That's—you're qualifying it. And I just need you to say, that was really rude of me, and that sucks for you, and give me a hug, and be done with it. That's all I need." But he, like, wouldn't give that to me. And then—so I was just like, "All right, I'm done with this conversation." And I was clearly still upset. [00:07:03]</p>

<p>And then Jay woke up maybe ten minutes later, and walked out. And I was making too much noise cleaning the dishes, and he said something about how annoying it was while I was trying to sleep, and I said, "I don't really care! You called me a fucking idiot twice last night, and I'm really pissed about it." And he was like, "I'm really sorry, Jenny. That's really rude of me," and gave me a hug and said sorry? And so I was really grateful—like over the top. Like, "Thank you, Jay! That was a really respectful way to, like, apologize. And thank you for owning that." And, like, going—and then Chris was like, "Okay." And then he wanted to talk again. And then what happens is that he follows me around. Literally on me. As close to me as possible. And it was so embarrassing. Like I was embarrassed that I was, like, having this discussion in front of Emma and Jay, like, in the living room. And then I was like, "If we want to talk about this again, we need to go into our room and talk about this, because I'm not comfortable talking about this in front of our friends. It's so inappropriate." [00:08:11]</p>

<p>And so (pause) we went and talked about it. And he was like, "I'm sorry, Okay? I'm really sorry." And then he wanted to be really sorry. He didn't want to—and it's like, "Well, now it's too late. Now I'm really pissed. Because the thing from last night was annoying, but it could have just been solved by you saying, like, 'Yeah, if I was in your shoes, that would have pissed me off, and I'm sorry about that, and I don't know why I acted that way.' It could have just been done. But now I'm really mad, because you tried to defend every little thing, and you just made it an issue, and made me feel like -"</p>

<p>(pause) I don't know. Like, and so I was just frustrated. And he keep "sorry"-ing, and he was, like, hugging me, and it was fine. And then Jay asks, in the kitchen, like asks something about it. And Chris just offered it up, like the whole thing of it. To Jay. With all of us standing there. [00:09:08]</p>

<p>And I was like, "We've talked about this. We talked about this last week. Like, I don't feel comfortable having people know all my stuff." I'm not a (pause) I'm actually okay with it, even if I had just left—like Emma and I were trying to get ready to go to the mall. If I had left and gone to the mall, and you wanted to talk to your friend about it, I'm okay with that. I'm totally okay with that. I'm not comfortable having me and Chris (pause) on opposite ends having an argument in front of Jay, while Jay's kind of involved. And even though Jay is taking my side—well, not taking my side, but just saying, like, "Chris, you need to just let it go, man. Like, you need to just, like, say you're sorry." And (pause) it's still so uncomfortable for me. Like it makes my... like... ugh! Like, talk to your friend about it. If you need to process that, and the way you do that is talking to your friend about it, I'm okay with that. That doesn't bother me. (chuckling) Wait until I leave. [00:10:03]</p>

<p>Like, I don't need this to be a group discussion. (pause) It made me so [inaudible]. So anyway, Emma and I left, and we spent a long time at the mall. And we came home, and (pause) we talked about it briefly again, and everything was fine and we moved on from it, but that was the one thing this weekend where I was like (pause) (chuckling) I can't [inaudible].</p>

<p>And Emma and I talked about it in the car, and she was like, "He is, like, on you. He is like, physically, like, always on you when you're..." She was like, "It's something that I didn't, like that I've noticed recently, but even more so now that you guys are living with us, and it's weird!" (chuckling) And I was like, "Yeah, it is, he is, he's always, he's always right there on me, especially when he thinks I'm upset with him." Like when he thought I wasn't really accepting his apology, after when he really did want to apologize and—I heard him, I heard him out, I listened. And then he could tell that I was still, I was saying, like, "Okay." But then for me, I just need time. I need, like, five minutes and just, I need a breather. But he stays right here on me. And I just can't handle it. It makes me loony. [00:11:26]</p>

<p>And then he just wants to be, like, touching me, and like... Oh my God, just, like, I need some space! (chuckling) I don't know what it is. (pause) It's very weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think it would really be important for you guys to get into couples' counseling when you move. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yep. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you're talking about it more, or do you think it's getting worse? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm talking about it more. It's getting better. Because I'm getting better. Before I just felt like there were bigger things that needed addressing. This is better, honestly. (pause) [00:12:26]</p>

<p>Because before, Friday would have turned into screaming. Like, Friday, before I was feeling better and feeling (pause) more in control of my emotions and myself? (pause) Friday would have been, like, me dissolving into tears. There was no tears, there was no crying, there was no anything. It was just me saying, like, "For me that's inappropriate, for me that doesn't work, that's not okay." And knowing that, and being really okay in that. Before, I would have felt, like, (pause) I would have felt, like, not... I wouldn't have been able to assert myself as well, and if he—before, when he, like, came with the opposition, like, I would just kind of like, fall into it and be like, "Okay, all right, yeah, I'm making, like, too big of a deal about it"? But then feeling really—and that's why I would cry and get upset, because I'd feel really frustrated. Because I'd still feel like, "But no, I don't necessarily agree with that but I guess I am just wrong." Now I just think, like, if something's wrong for me it's just wrong for me. And like, no matter, like (pause) if you made me feel upset, you should just apologize. And I just really stand my ground on that now. [00:13:51}</p>

<p>And not in a way where I'm like, "You hurt me!" It's not that I want to, like, punish him. I just want him to know that, like, that behavior isn't okay in the future. It feels really, like, matter-of-fact now, and before it always felt like, really, like hugely emotional and hugely—I mean, it was all obviously very emotional, because we're married. But like, it feels more like I have these boundaries and then these things aren't okay for me, and if you can't respect that, then, like, that's going to be a problem, and you need to work that out. You need to apologize. [00:14:24]</p>

<p>But yeah, I'm just talking more about it now. Because stuff isn't, like, as active with my dad, I guess, and other stuff, I don't know. (pause) But before it was much worse. Not much worse, but worse. (crying) (pause)</p>

<p>Yeah, and before I think I was just, like, embarrassed to ever say that there was any problem? Or that, um, (pause) Like I still, I don't think that our problems are, like, (pause) I think it's easier for me to talk about it now because it has gotten a little bit better? Before it felt like—before, when it felt like a huge problem? That was embarrassing. Now it feels like there's definitely issues there, there's definitely things that need to be addressed, but it feels more manageable, and I can see (pause) it doesn't seem as overwhelming. [00:15:37]</p>

<p>Like before, it felt, like, (pause) I don't know. It felt kind of like, I felt kind of lost in it. Like now, I see, like, certain distinct issues that need to be, like (pause) addressed as opposed to, like, "This marriage is kind of a problem." (chuckling) If that makes any sense. I don't know if that makes sense. (pause) But... (pause) (sighs) whatever (pause). [00:16:30]</p>

<p>I think for him it's just like, (pause) it's just (pause) if he doesn't have—we both need control of the situation, and if he doesn't feel like he has control of the situation, he's really uncomfortable. (pause) And then with me, like when I won't, like, accept his apology necessarily. And so he has to, like, keep, like, keep on me and keep on me and keep on me. And for me, it is kind of a control thing. Like, I'm kind of in the power seat in that sense, at that moment? So it is kind of like I know that, and I just kind of like still stay in my zone. But I know for myself, I just need a few minutes. I just always need space that he just doesn't allow me. I think that's one of our biggest things, is that (pause) one of his triggers is me removing myself from a situation—I don't know why I said trigger. But one of the things that makes him upset is when I leave, or like when I remove myself from a situation. And one of the things I need to (pause) like calm down or relax or feel okay, is to remove myself. And so it's just—like it's a huge problem. (pause) (yawns) [00:18:07]</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, because it sounds like he not only has difficulty with that, but he can be kind of aggressive in his expression of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't simply get upset, he gets angry. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. (pause) Yeah. (crying) Yeah, and when he gets to the angry point, like I don't want anything to do with you. Like, I want to be as far away from you as possible. (pause) And it takes a lot to get him to that point, like... (pause) Like he was never angry at any point during this weekend. [00:18:57]</p>

<p>And he was—the other thing that bothers me is that he will just defend, wholeheartedly, anything. I mean, like, he was grasping at straws. Like, I said, "I wanted to stay up and, like..." He was like, "Yeah, we came back and you were in a terrible mood." I was like, "Nope, I wasn't, actually. I was ready to hang out with everybody. I just needed to come back here a little bit earlier and relax for me. I was ready to hang out with everyone." He was like, "Well... me and Emma. Jay was passed out." And I was like, (pause) "It doesn't matter. You're just hanging onto things right now." Like, he'll just like grasp at anything. That's not a relevant... I don't know. That's the other thing that will just drive me up the wall. (pause) I don't know. [00:20:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about some of your marital troubles makes you embarrassed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I don't want to have—(chuckles) I don't want to have marital troubles, I guess? Um, and (pause) I think it's just like, I'm embarrassed that we're this newly married couple, and the whole stereotype is like blissful and newlyweds being perfectly happy, just enthralled with each other, and just joyful all the time (chuckling) is the kind of like, newlywed... I know we've been married for a year and a half now, but like, (pause) I thought that a year and a half into someone's marriage, or even like, when we were having problems, like, six months or like a month into a marriage, I thought we shouldn't have these problems, this is so embarrassing. Like other couples are like, so infatuated with each other they would never fight like this. It just would embarrass me that we would have fights like that. And then we would have—that we weren't getting along perfectly all the time. I always feel that everybody else is getting along splendidly except for us. (pause). [00:21:47]</p>

<p>So I would feel like we weren't doing something right, and that (pause) and then it would almost, like to say, we have really big fights sometimes? Sounds to me—like, to say, early in our marriage we have really big fights, that sounds like a marriage that's like, doomed. And that scares me. (pause)And then I don't want people to judge and think—think that I have a terrible marriage. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would that say about you? How would that reflect on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's my marriage. I don't know, I guess. I don't know what that means, I guess. [00:22:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, it seems like if people thought you had a terrible marriage that would mean you're a bad person, like I'm not sure what that would mean about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that I'm just—I'm not good at being married (chuckling). I don't know. I feel like I have a lot to prove. Like, (pause) I feel really, like damaged and (pause) I feel like I have a lot to prove to myself, and I don't feel that (pause) maybe people had a lot of faith in me (pause) to marry somebody like Chris, and then to have a good marriage because of what I come from. And so... (pause) I think that I get nervous a lot that like, (pause) if something goes wrong it's going to be really easy to be like, "Well, she's the damaged one, and no wonder the marriage didn't work out." Or like, something like that. Or like, not that I have problems because, "She's loaded. (chuckling) She's damaged, and she has problems." (pause) [00:24:12] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This idea that people's behavior reflects badly on you keeps coming up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's not just his behavior, it's mine too. It's our marriage, together, like one person doesn't do anything. And (pause) how could I say that, obviously. Like, hello? Um... (pause) But (pause) (sighs) Yeah, I just, I don't know. (pause) [00:26:05]</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where did you go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I was just thinking about—well, first I was thinking about what I said when I said (pause) it's not just him, it's me too, only one person can't (pause)—like I don't know, but I was trying to think that like, one person can't be the root of all the problems. And I was saying it about him, but when I said that it's like, "Well," because I'm always thinking that I'm the one who's doing everything? Or that like I'm—and so when I said it, I can feel that way about somebody else, but I can't apply it to myself. And then I was thinking how we've only been at Emma and Jay's for like a week, but I already (pause) I don't know. I guess it was just the weekend because it was just, we were all four together the whole time, but I miss spending time with just him, like just the two of us alone. Like we'll walk home together, and sometimes we'll just walk—you know, only really home together. But that's only, like, thirty minutes every... it was like forty, last week, that we did that. And so, I just really miss being alone with him, and I was thinking that, I don't know. I was thinking it's going to be hard over the next few months to stay (pause) connected. Stay, like... mmm. (pause) [00:28:09] </p>

<p>And I think that we need to do something just alone (pause) this week or something, because I know I feel, like, a little disjointed, even after just a week. (pause) </p>

<p>And I know this isn't on topic, but my brother called last night, and he was blacked out, and he wasn't making any sense. And he had called me earlier, but I had not seen it, and then Chris's phone was ringing, and I saw my parent's house so I picked it up, and it was John. And he asked to talk to Chris, and so (pause) Chris was kind of confused about what he wanted, and so he was like, "Hey, man, what's going on?" And didn't reaKatiee my brother was calling to like, talk? Thought he was just calling about the basketball game and thought maybe we were—Chris thought that John thought that we were in New Hampshire and wanted to hang out or something. And so, I said to Chris, I was like, "Did he sound drunk to you?" And he said no, and I was like, you know, I was thinking in my head he was definitely drunk. [00:29:22]</p>

<p>And then two hours later, I get another call on my phone, it's my brother, and he's blacked out, and he (pause) I don't know, he's just saying that he's all alone in this world, and that nobody cares about him, and Chris and I are doing our own thing, and like, he was like first, "You guys are so lame." He was like, mad at Chris and I. And he was saying, he was mad at Chris because he called Chris to talk, but Chris didn't know that, Chris just thought he was calling about the basketball game, he just thought he wanted to watch the basketball game together. And so he was like, "Yep, I called Chris, and it was like talking to a brick wall. That guy is such a loser." And he loves Chris, Chris and him are really close. And he had never said anything like that to me before, and I was like, "That's not true, John. I know you don't even believe that." And then he just kept going on and on about how he wants to run headfirst into a brick wall, and he's all alone and nobody cares about it, and just going on and on about it. [00:30:29]</p>

<p>I don't know what to say. In those moments, he's not going to remember it, but I still feel this need to like, (pause) to say like, "Well, you know that's not true." I said at one point—I can't even believe I said it, but he was just like, complaining about everything, and so down on himself, and everything was awful, and he just wants to like, end it, and I said, "You sound like Dad. This is disturbing." And as soon as I said, I was really upset that I said it, because that's (pause) that was intended to be a jab. That was intended to be like, "Snap out of it. You sound like Dad, and that's..." What I was saying was, "You sound pathetic." That's what I was saying. And it's just driving me crazy now. (sighs) [00:31:42] </p>

<p>Like I don't know what to do. And I guess he feels, like, so... I guess he's just still so depressed, but... (pause) And well, for a little bit, I guess he thought I was Katie, his ex-girlfriend, who he just moved out of an apartment with over the weekend, and I was like, "Well, don't call Katie. You're really drunk, and that's a bad idea, and don't call her." And then he kept saying all this stuff about (pause) I don't know, sounding suicidal or whatever. And I just felt like I wanted to call back the whole night. But I knew if I called back it would just be another half-hour conversation of the exact same thing, and him not remembering it. It's a waste of my time and my energy, and him just saying hurtful things to me. (pause) So I didn't, but... (pause) [00:32:59]</p>

<p>He like goes through these huge swings in it too, he'll say, like, "You and Chris don't care about me, you're on your own thing, I'm on my own." And then, a few minutes later I was like, "Where's Fred? Who are you at home with?" Fred is our little brother. And—not like little little brother, a brother who's just a few years younger than us. And he was like, "Fred doesn't care about us! You and I are on our own." Like he doesn't, it's always like—John is always on his own no matter what. And I'm either lumped in with him, or when he's like really trying to be mean to me, I'm on my own thing and I don't care about him. (pause) It just sounds like my dad, and I... ugh. I'm so glad he's not living there for the summer. [00:33:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you said before that you felt like it was a jab. I guess means maybe you were angry at him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm like really resentful and really angry that he's still doing this. Um... (pause) Like why can't you get your shit together? Like he just got into this engineering program, there's all these things that (pause) I guess that's it, but still, he's been working towards that, and that's super exciting and he has something to focus on now, he's been going to see this woman in New Hampshire, and he's like—you have things to be focusing on. I know that he broke up with the girlfriend and that's really hard, but it's just like so frustrating. (crying) (pause) [00:34:52]</p>

<p>But yeah, I'm very resentful. I'm very angry. I really feel like (pause) like hitting the end of my line with it. Like I can't (pause) I don't know. Even when I say that out loud I don't believe that. Like I don't think I'll ever (pause). [00:35:51] </p>

<p>This being mean to me thing is new, though. Like he didn't ever used to call and get jabs in about me. It's like, (pause) and it's easy to say, like, "He doesn't mean it, he's just drunk and he's just saying stuff to get a rise out of me." But it's hard sometimes to convince myself, someone who thinks deep down (pause) And in some ways, I feel like I just do this because I'm so desperate for... like I feel like I place a lot of baggage from my dad onto my brother. And sometimes when (pause) like I just want him to love me. Just love me, and let me make you better, and (sighs) I don't know. (pause) [00:37:10] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would letting you make him better be an expression of his love?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not being better means he doesn't care?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. I know that's awful, I know that's not true, but that's how it feels. I know this is about him, this isn't about me, I know that logically. But it feels differently. (pause) </p>

<p>And I know that addicts don't change for other people, they only change for themselves. I'm very aware of that. (pause) Or I should say, they shouldn't want to change for other people, they should want to do it for themselves. I'm sure that some do try it. (pause) (sighs) [00:39:13]</p>

<p>I don't know. (pause) It's just something that I don't want to deal with anymore. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the something that you don't want to deal with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My brother's drunken phone calls. I feel really tired and out of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't take them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, but then he's all alone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's all alone anyway. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's depressing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me like my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alcoholics are pretty much all alone, because the relationship with the alcohol is just so intense. Such an intense relationship. And they isolate themselves, and then blame everyone else for their isolation. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. It makes me so sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Yep. (pause) [00:41:30]</p>

<p>(chuckles) I keep wanting to ask how bad mine and Chris's marriage is. It's like, it's just, I can't stop. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you worried about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: That we have a really bad marriage. I don't think we do, but if you thought we did, then I'd be really upset. (pause) But maybe we do, and I just don't know, because I have skewed vision from my childhood. I don't know. I don't think we do, because ninety percent of the time it's really good, and then we have fights. (pause) [00:42:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't feel like the marker of a good marriage is that you, for the most part, feel satisfied in it? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I ever said that I wasn't satisfied.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. (chuckles) Oh, yeah. I guess I don't know why I'm so focused on the fighting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, even in what you're saying, "But I am satisfied," it sounds like you already feel like I was questioning whether you were. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um... I don't know. I guess I really focus on the fighting. I guess—like I can't focus on the, like, the ninety percent. I focus on the... I don't know. (pause) And like, I can't (pause) get to the point where it's like, I don't know. (pause) [00:43:45]</p>

<p>It's like when you said, "Yeah, you guys should really go see somebody together when you get to New Hampshire," that really just struck me, like that means there's something really wrong here. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, it seems like you go back and forth between, like, feeling—because you said that you feel like you focus on the ten percent and the ninety percent, and then you're worried I'm focused on that. And you go back and forth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like—I don't know, that's like the story of my life, though, right? Like I just can't figure out what I'm feeling, where I want to settle. (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wasn't at all commenting on whether you have a good marriage or not, and I guess I have a bias, I work with a lot of couples, and I see that their marriages can be a lot better through couples therapy. I do think his anger and aggression is a problem for you. [00:44:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you feel guilty for it some of the time. And I'm not saying you can't act provocatively. You've talked about it, but there's difference between—and it's true, I guess, if you act less provocative then he would be less provoked. That doesn't mean that he's not responsible for the way he engages with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's true. And that's a recent realization. (pause) And we're having a hard time figuring that out, because (pause) that hasn't been said out loud, that's only been demonstrated now through my actions of really standing up for myself and saying, like, this level of anger toward something pretty insignificant isn't okay. To me. [00:45:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, Jenny—</p>

<p>CLIENT: We have to stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We do need to stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I will see you on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so our last day is whatever the last day in June is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: June 20th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, June 20th. Not the following.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I won't be here that week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yeah, so I guess two more weeks after this. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Okay, great, I'll see you Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks so much. </p>

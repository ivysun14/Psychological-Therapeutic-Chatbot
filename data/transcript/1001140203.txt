<P>TH 1: Alright, uhm, you guys know this routine better than I do. Ah, I really know very little about you. They gave me very little information and I'd like to make this time work for you, be useful to you. Ah, so, if you can tell me what you want to talk about, what you want us to look at, I will look at whatever you want to look at.</p>
<P>M 1: Well, you want to go or . . .</p>
<P>F 1: No, go ahead.</P>
<P>M 2: We came because we wanted better communication with Pamela, and I don't feel we're getting that communication with her. Better self esteem for her, and, um, just, you know, her to be more outgoing with us than she is at home. And I don't think we are getting that and we're still not getting that coming here.</P>
<P>TH 2: I see.</P>
<P>M 3: Because I don't think anybody's really interviewed her or really talked to her about a lot of things or that.</P>
<P>TH 3: About. . .</P>
<P>M 4: About just anything in general or asking her why, why, I feel that, um, she gets very angry with me a lot, and I don't think we are getting this out of her as to why she is angry with me all the time.</p>
<P>TH 4: Pam?</p>
<P>D 1: Not all the time. Most of the time.</P>
<P>M 5: Most of the time.</p>
<P>D 2: Yeah. Why I get so angry. Why I don't talk. I don't know. That's what we are here to find out.</P>
<P>TH 5: What your mom is saying is it's not just that you don't talk, she is also saying that you get angry.</P>
<P>D 4: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 6: At her.</P>
<P>M 6: Yeah. I don't know.</P>
<P>F 2: Well, not only at her. At anything. At anything. She could be playing a game, and she starts losing, she gets angry. I mean physically angry.</P>
<P>TH 7: When you say physically . . .</P>
<P>F 3: She'll bang things, she'll throw things. I don't mean just sitting there saying oh dammit or something like that, you know. I mean she'll physically get angry. She'll beat on stuff, she'll bang her hands, and everything else. She'll go as far as to pull her hair.</P>
<P>TH 8: Pam?</P>
<P>D 5: No, I don't pull my hair.</P>
<P>F 4: Okay, the next you do it I'll remind you.</P>
<P>D 6: I'll bang like, you know, the table or something.</P>
<P>F 5: Or anything that's around. It doesn't matter if it's fragile or not.</P>
<P>TH 9: What's the matter, Pam?</P>
<P>D 7: Nothing.</P>
<P>F 6: This is why we're here. For you. Not for mother, not for me.</P>
<P>D 8: I know. I know.</P>
<P>M 7: Why she gets angry with me a lot, too. No matter what I say to her, she gets angry with me.</P>
<P>F 7: I'm retired. I'm home. She comes home from work usually everything is pretty good.</p>
<P>TH 10: Right.</p>
<P>F 8: The minute she walks in the door, her attitude changes like pulling the shades.</p>
<P>TH 11: Why don't we talk about that.</p>
<P>D 9: I don't know I do it. We're just instinctively do it. I don't know.</p>
<P>TH 12: So, why don't you remind Pam of some situation or something about which you guys get into it so that we can begin exploring this.</P>
<P>M 8: What was it just recently. I'm trying to think.</P>
<P>F 9: Name something. You name something. Setting the table, feeding the dog.</P>
<P>TH 13: All right.</P>
<P>F 10: She goes out and plays bingo. I say go win me some money. She gets angry.</P>
<P>TH 14: Okay, but are you guys saying that you Pam get more angry with your mom than you do with your dad?</P>
<P>D 10: Yeah.</P>
<P>F 10: You just name it, and the attitude just . . .</P>
<P>M 9: What was it Sunday. I asked her if she ate. We were at a party on Sunday, and I asked her if she ate, and she said no. And then, so I just took it for granted that maybe she would go and eat something later. Maybe she wasn't hungry. So I think we came home and I said something about, I asked her if she finally did eat, and she says no I told you no I didn't eat. And she got angry with me right away. Oh, there was another incident too. There was a baby there. And she went to wipe the baby's nose, and I wanted to tell her how to wipe the baby's nose instead of folding the kleenex up into a little tiny piece and wiping his nose that she should have opened it up so she could wipe his nose at one time and then fold it over and re-wipe it. Well, she got angry with me about that, and she said a few words underneath her breath which I didn't like in front of other people.</p>
<P>TH 15: Well, what's happening with Pam right now?</p>
<P>D 11: Nothing.</p>
<P>TH 16: I'm asking your mom to see if she understands what you are going through right now, because you seem to be really bothered.</P>
<P>M 10: Well, she's crying I guess, and she does cry a lot. That's another thing we are trying to figure out, why she's crying.</P>
<P>TH 17: Why don't you ask her what's going on right now, what she's feeling right now?</P>
<P>M 11: Pam, what do you feel now?</P>
<P>D 12: Nothing.</P>
<P>M 12: That's what I get from her.</P>
<P>F 11: What are you thinking about?</P>
<P>M 13: Nothing.</P>
<P>F 12: Why are you crying?</P>
<P>D 13: I don't know, I just do.</P>
<P>M 14: We can sit at the breakfast table and it will be the same thing. You ask her what she wants for breakfast, she doesn't know. So when I suggest the things, I don't know, whatever. Well, you know, I can't decide for her. If I don't make her breakfast on Saturday or Sunday she gets angry with me. Her dad fixes her breakfast every morning, but you know, I don't know what she wants I'm not going to fix her something, or if we are all done eating and then she decides to get up, I'm not going to sit there and cook for her alone.</P>
<P>TH 18: But Pam when your dad fixes breakfast you don't have a problem?</P>
<P>D 14: Well, that's because I'm going to work. I'm on my way to work. Hurry up and eat and go.</P>
<P>TH 19: But when your mom fixes breakfast on the weekend.</p>
<P>D 15: She's always making eggs, bacon and eggs.</p>
<P>TH 20: Right, go ahead.</p>
<P>D 16: Well, after a while you get tired of eating bacon and eggs all the time.</p>
<P>F 13: Then why don't you get tired of eating oatmeal every single day?</p>
<P>D 17: I don't know.</p>
<P>F 14: If you get tired of eating eggs once a week or twice a week, how come you eat oatmeal four or five days a week?</P>
<P>D 18: Well, that fills me up.</P>
<P>TH 21: What would you like on the weekend, Pam?</P>
<P>D 19: Pancakes or french toast or something else.</P>
<P>TH 22: Why don't you ask your mom right now if she'll make pancakes or french toast?</P>
<P>D 20: Hey, ma, would you like to make either french toast or pancakes or waffles or something on the weekend?</P>
<P>M 15: You know I do that every so often for you.</p>
<P>D 21: Or like, omelets or something?</p>
<P>F 15: What?</p>
<P>D 22: Omelets.</p>
<P>F 16: What kind of omelet?</p>
<P>M 15: Wait a minute.</p>
<P>D 23: It doesn't matter.</p>
<P>M 16: Omelets, you don't like scrambled eggs?</p>
<P>D 24: Well, plain scrambled eggs.</p>
<P>M 17: But your eggs have to be burnt. How can you burn an omelet?</p>
<P>F 17: Give it to daddy, he'll burn it.</p>
<P>D 25: I don't know.</p>
<P>M 18: We do switch off with breakfast. I don't always . . .</p>
<P>TH 23: Excuse me?</p>
<P>M 19: We do switch off with breakfast. I do ask her if she wants it, but I'm not going to cook it if she gets up after we've already eaten to mix up pancakes or, I've made her french toast. But I think she's old enough. She can make her own whenever she wants, whatever. Especially after we've eaten and I've cleaned up the kitchen.</p>
<P>TH 24: I don't understand. Pam, you're saying to your mother that you'd rather she not make bacon and eggs, that you'd rather she make pancakes or waffles or french toast, and Judy you're saying, I think you're saying that you don't want to make that all the time, that you'd prefer to make the eggs and bacon. At least that's what I'm figuring because you say occasionally you do make the other stuff.</p>
<P>M 20: Well, he prefers eggs and bacon. I don't usually eat breakfast. So, I'm making one breakfast for him, and then I'm making one for her. If she's there when we are eating, I don't mind doing it for her, but if she gets up an hour after we're done eating and I've got the kitchen almost cleaned up, for her to come in and say well she wants french toast or she wants pancakes or she wants waffles, well there the stuff. Make it then.</p>
<P>TH 25: What's the problem then?</p>
<P>M 21: I don't think she wants to do anything for herself.</p>
<P>TH 26: Pam?</p>
<P>D 26: That might be right.</p>
<P>TH 27: Do you cook?</p>
<P>D 27: A little bit. Not much.</p>
<P>TH 28: So you really depend on your folks to cook for you?</p>
<P>D 28: Um-hm.</P>
<P>TH 29: So, what do you think about what your mother just said?</p>
<P>D 29: It's true. I just don't want to.</p>
<P>TH 30: She said something else, Pam. She said that if you got up at the same time as they . . .</P>
<P>D 30: As they did. Yeah, she would make it.</P>
<P>TH 30: That she would be willing to do it, but she doesn't want to have to clean up the kitchen and then start all over again with the pancakes and stuff.</P>
<P>D 31: Right.</P>
<P>TH 31: What do you think about that?</P>
<P>D 32: That's true. Sometimes I do sleep a little later than they do.</P>
<P>TH 32: Right. And . . .</P>
<P>D 33: And I should be able to do something for myself.</P>
<P>TH 33: Okay, but that's not what I'm asking. You know your mother doesn't want to prepare the pancakes. Let's just talk about pancakes. You know she doesn't want to prepare the pancakes, and she is already cleaning up. Why do you get angry at her at that point?</P>
<P>D 34: I don't know. I don't know.</P>
<P>TH 34: Is it because you still wish she would give you the pancakes?</P>
<P>D 35: Yeah, probably.</P>
<P>TH 35: You do know. But you are mad that she won't. Is that right?</P>
<P>D 36: I guess.</P>
<P>TH 36: Don't say you guess if you don't mean it now. I really want to know what you are thinking.</P>
<P>D 37: I guess I do. I don't know.</P>
<P>TH 37: And then when your mother says well prepare for yourself, what do you think about that?</p>
<P>D 38: I just don't make anything then.</p>
<P>TH 38: Why not? Because you don't want to cook?</p>
<P>D 39: Probably. I just don't want to do it.</p>
<P>TH 39: Why don't you like to cook?</p>
<P>D 40: I like to cook, but in the morning I'm not totally awake yet. I'd rather have someone that's awake to do it.</P>
<P>TH 40: Okay, you and your mom come to some understanding. This is not mysterious now. You guys are understanding each other right now very well.</P>
<P>M 22: Well, yeah. It's not only the . . .</P>
<P>TH 41: Let's not leave this though. I want to stay with this.</P>
<P>M 23: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 42: We're getting somewhere here you know. We're understanding where she is coming from, and we are understanding where you are coming from, and I think you are understanding each other, the two of you right now. Okay? The question is given that you are not going to cook pancakes if you are already cleaning up, and given Pam that you are not going to prepare the pancakes for yourself, okay, now what do you do with each other?</P>
<P>F 18: She'll stay home for a couple of hours, and then after that she will go out to the truck stop and get something to eat.</P>
<P>D 41: No, I don't. Not on Saturday.</P>
<P>TH 43: What do you do?</P>
<P>D 42: Not on Saturday.</P>
<P>TH 44: What do you do on Saturday then?</P>
<P>D 43: I go clean the office, where she works at.</P>
<P>TH 45: But what do you do for breakfast then?</P>
<P>D 44: Nothing.</P>
<P>TH 46: You'd rather not eat then?</p>
<P>D 45: Rather not.</p>
<P>TH 47: You'd rather not eat because you're angry?</p>
<P>D 46: No.</p>
<P>F 19: Because she has to do it herself. But yet what did we have for breakfast Wednesday?</P>
<P>D 46: This morning?</P>
<P>F 20: This morning? Today's Wednesday? Okay. She is off on Wednesday.</P>
<P>What did we have for breakfast today, Pam?</P>
<P>D 47: I had to make it because . . .</P>
<P>F 21: What did you make, Pam?</P>
<P>D 48: One egg, one piece of toast, and that was it.</P>
<P>F 22: And what else?</P>
<P>D 49: No, that was it.</P>
<P>F 23: Did you make another egg? Did you fry the second egg?</P>
<P>D 50: Only had one.</P>
<P>F 24: I thought I smelled a second egg burning.</P>
<P>D 51: I only had one.</P>
<P>F 25: I'm sorry.</P>
<P>TH 48: Let's get back to mom and Pam. I wanted to see what happens with this thing. What's the problem now? You understand each other. What's the problem about breakfast?</P>
<P>D 52: I just have to get up.</P>
<P>TH 49: No, you don't want to get early. If you don't want to get up, why should you have to get up early.</P>
<P>M 24: I think I need help is what I need.</P>
<P>TH 50: What do you need help with?</P>
<P>M 25: With preparing the breakfast.</p>
<P>TH 51: What do you mean?</p>
<P>M 26: Help getting the breakfast ready. If she wants pancakes . . .</p>
<P>TH 52: Are you saying that even if you had already cooked and eaten that if she were to help you you'd go ahead . . .</P>
<P>M 27: Oh, I probably would, yes.</P>
<P>F 26: She's spoiled.</P>
<P>TH 53: Hold on, hold on. You may be right. Okay.</P>
<P>M 28: She is.</P>
<P>TH 54: Okay, Judy, we are making good progress here.</P>
<P>M 29: If she would help, it would probably be . . .</P>
<P>TH 55: Pam, what about what your mother just said?</P>
<P>D 52: Huh?</P>
<P>M 30: I said if you would probably help me, you would probably get what you wanted. But when you tell me you don't care or I don't know or whatever, I have no idea what that means. All I ask is for a decision to be made.</P>
<P>TH 56: Pam?</P>
<P>D 53: That's true.</P>
<P>TH 57: Your mother has made an offer. She said if you help her, she will prepare the pancakes on Saturday. Even if you get up late.</P>
<P>D 54: No problem. We can do that.</P>
<P>TH 58: Judy? What does that mean? That look, your eyes.</P>
<P>M 31: Well, no problem is the . . .</P>
<P>TH 59: You don't believe her?</P>
<P>M 32: No, I don't.</P>
<P>TH 60: Pam, you heard your mother. She says she doesn't believe you.</P>
<P>D 55: Which means I have to prove it to her.</P>
<P>TH 61: Well, can you?</p>
<P>D 56: Yeah. I think I'm going to try to.</p>
<P>M 33: I mean it's just like after dinner well she does help clean off the table after dinner. But then she walks out.</P>
<P>D 56: Because I feed the dog.</P>
<P>M 34: Well, alright, you feed the dog. But after dinner then it's out the door she goes or goes back into the computer and plays on the computer. She doesn't help with the dishes or anything or say "Gee, Ma, I'll do the dishes tonight for you, or let's take turns or something." I get stuck with the dishes every night.</P>
<P>F 27: I'll have to interrupt you on that one. The other night she done all the dishes except for one pot.</P>
<P>M 35: She did. That was an exception.</P>
<P>F 28: On rare occasions that she'll wind up doing the dishes before Judy comes home.</P>
<P>M 36: I knew you would come up with that one.</P>
<P>F 29: I have to dear because you are saying all the time.</P>
<P>M 37: Well, the majority of the time.</P>
<P>F 30: It just happened yesterday or the day before.</P>
<P>M 38: Yes, I knew that was going to come.</P>
<P>F 31: So, you have to bring up the times that she does do it, very, very rare. But she does do it every so often, and she does it on her own. I don't tell her.</P>
<P>TH 62: Let me get to sort of a core issue here. Pam, you agreed with both your folks that you are spoiled, okay. And apparently everybody knows it. Do you want to be spoiled.</P>
<P>D 57: Uh-uh</P>
<P>TH 63: Because that's why you get so angry you know. You get angry when you don't get your way.</P>
<P>D 58: Yeah.</p>
<P>TH 64: And if you're spoiled, that means you are accustomed to getting your way. You want to get your way, and if you don't get your way, you are going to flip out.</p>
<P>D 59: Yeah.</p>
<P>TH 65: But you work, right?</p>
<P>D 60: Yeah.</p>
<P>TH 66: Where do you work?</p>
<P>D 61: At a grocery store.</p>
<P>TH 67: What do you do?</p>
<P>D 62: In the dairy department, stock.</p>
<P>TH 68: And are you a spoiled employee there.</p>
<P>D 63: No.</p>
<P>TH 69: Because they don't spoil you, right?</p>
<P>D 64: Right.</p>
<P>TH 70: So you are quite capable of not being a spoiled kid. Right?</p>
<P>D 65: Right.</p>
<P>F 32: Very much so.</p>
<P>TH 71: So, I'm hearing little bits of information about you that says you are really quite capable of being an adult, a pretty responsible adult. Do you want your parents to help you not to be spoiled?</P>
<P>D 66: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 72: Because it's got to be a miserable thing to be spoiled. Because you are constantly feeling angry because you are not getting your way, and you are going to be angry more times then you are going to be happy.</P>
<P>D 67: Uh-um.</P>
<P>TH 73: Do you want to ask them to help you stop being spoiled?</P>
<P>D 68: Would you guys like to help me get . . .</p>
<P>F 33: How can I help you?</p>
<P>D 60: I don't know.</p>
<P>F 34: How can I help you to stop getting angry?</p>
<P>D 61: I don't know.</p>
<P>TH 74: The question is how can I help you to not give you your way because being spoiled is a matter of getting your way of having people doing stuff for you that you can do for yourself.</P>
<P>D 62: Right.</P>
<P>TH 75: And so that's really the question. Where would they begin to help you to not get your way?</P>
<P>D 63: They can start anywhere.</P>
<P>TH 76: Pick one, Pam. Pick a good one for us. Come on.</P>
<P>D 64: Well, I don't know.</P>
<P>TH 77: Something that you know. Let me tell you why I'm asking you this question. Pam?</P>
<P>D 65: I'm listening.</P>
<P>TH 78: The reason why I'm asking you this question is that you see if they try to stop, to turn you around so you become a responsible adult and stop being spoiled, okay. You are going to fight it. The only way it's going to work is if you want it which means that you have to be the one to tell them, okay? I don't want to be spoiled. Which then means you have to be the one to say I don't you to give me my way about whatever. You have to pick what it is that you don't them to give you your way. Even though it's hard. Pick something.</P>
<P>D 66: Well, like four days a week, yeah, it's nice that dad makes breakfast because I'm in a hurry to get to work. That's fine.</P>
<P>TH 79: Okay.</P>
<P>D 67: Um, I don't know where to begin. I mean there are so many things.</P>
<P>TH 80: Let's talk about breakfast on the weekend then. What can they do not to spoil you?</P>
<P>D 68: Well, I don't know. There are no many things.</p>
<P>TH 81: Is this very hard for you, Pam?</p>
<P>D 69: No, I just do this.</p>
<P>TH 82: You don't just do this, Pam.</p>
<P>D 70: Yeah I do.</p>
<P>TH 83: You have real emotions going on there. I think this is very hard for you. I don't think you know how to do this. Okay? Let me tell you something, an impression that I have, okay?</p>
<P>F 35: Do you want a Kleenex?</P>
<P>TH 84: Let me just get some facts from you Judy. When Pam comes in and says I want pancakes, and you guys have already finished basically, and she is not prepared to help, what's your response?</P>
<P>M 39: I don't think she comes in and tells me. She just says what are you making for breakfast, or if she sees that we are already done with breakfast . . .</P>
<P>TH 85: All right, what happens.</P>
<P>M 40: Then she gets angry.</P>
<P>TH 86: And the what do you do?</P>
<P>M 41: I either get up and walk out and just let her be. You know, if she wants to be angry, let her be angry. I mean, I just don't feel I'm going to spend my whole morning in the kitchen cooking for her.</P>
<P>TH 87: There is no question. Because she is asking you to help her with this. Pam? What can your mom do at that moment. You're feeling angry because you wish she would just make you pancakes when you get there, and then you end up getting upset because she is not going to do it.</P>
<P>D 71: I just don't eat then. I'll just have my cup of coffee and that's it.</P>
<P>TH 88: No, I want it to be nice for you. I want you to stop being spoiled. I want you to start growing up at home, but I want it to be in a way that makes you feel good. And right now it doesn't feel so good. So, let's think about it. Your parents just finished their breakfast. You got up. You love pancakes. You ask your mom. She doesn't offer to make pancakes, and you know she is not going to make them, and you get angry. How can they help you?</P>
<P>D 72: They'd probably walk out or just let me sit there and have my cup of coffee.</p>
<P>TH 89: Do you want then to walk out and just leave you sitting there by yourself?</P>
<P>D 73: They usually do.</P>
<P>TH 90: What would you like for them to do?</P>
<P>D 74: Not for them but for me to say hey ma, come on. Let's make the pancakes. I'll help.</P>
<P>TH 91: Why is that so hard for you to say?</P>
<P>D 75: I don't know. But I just did.</P>
<P>TH 92: You just did. And you said it very well. You said exactly what you needed to say. How did that feel when she said it just now.</P>
<P>M 42: It sounded good. Very heartwarming. Then there's been days when I baked pancakes, and she doesn't want them, so . . .</P>
<P>TH 93: Let me be very clear.</P>
<P>M 43: We just don't eat bacon and eggs every day.</P>
<P>TH 94: I know that. I know that. You guys take very good care of this young woman. She's got to do more.</P>
<P>M 44: For herself.</P>
<P>TH 95: For herself. Okay?</p>
<P>M 45: Right.</p>
<P>TH 96: But she doesn't want to grow up at home. She doesn't mind growing up outside of home, but she doesn't want to grow up at home. Okay? She wants to still be your baby, okay? Right? Okay. What I am suggesting to you is that you can show her how you can still be her mother, still take good care of her, and she can still grow up. That if she grows up you are not just going to throw her out the door.</p>
<P>M 46: Well, that's true. I mean we're not pushing her out the door. I just want her to grow up.</p>
<P>TH 97: That's all we're talking about. I think she's afraid that if she starts acting grown up you are just going to kick her out the door, and she's scared to death. That's my guess, okay? What happened just now was kind of tender. It was touching. I love the way she said it.</p>
<P>M 47: She did a good job of it, yes.</p>
<P>TH 98: She really did a nice job. What I am suggesting to you is that you, okay, try to control your temper and anger when she provokes you. But listen, never make the pancakes for her unless she offers to help. That way you stop spoiling her. But then you say to her, do you want to help? I'll be glad to make them. It's even better if she herself initiates it and says I'd like to have pancakes. I'll help. Can you do that?</p>
<P>M 48: Well, I can try.</p>
<P>TH 99: What's happening to you right now, Judy? What's the emotion about?</p>
<P>M 49: I want to try.</p>
<P>TH 100: Okay. This is a loving thing that can go on between the two of you, but it will be hard because she's scared. This is not an angry defiant person who doesn't care. This is a person who is very scared to grow up. She needs a mother who is not going to do it for her but a mother who says if you're willing to do it, I'll help and do it with you. I won't do it for you.</P>
<P>M 50: Right.</P>
<P>TH 101: About more and more things at home.</P>
<P>F 36: And that only doesn't mean making them that means help cleaning up afterwards.</P>
<P>TH 102: Absolutely. Somebody that says Pam you are not going to leave the table and go to your computer. If you want dinner here in our house, I have to know that you are going to help clean up. Otherwise I don't want you sitting at the table. You're not a baby.</p>
<P>M 51: Well, that's it.</P>
<P>TH 103: But we have to find out whether she wants that. Pam? If your mom were to say that to you, would you want her to say it to you?</P>
<P>D 76: Well, not about the you're not going to eat at the table. I will eat. But I have to help with dishes and stuff.</P>
<P>TH 104: And your mom says from now on I need for you to help me clean up, would you want her to say that to you?</P>
<P>D 77: Um-hm</P>
<P>TH 105: And what if you didn't feel like it?</P>
<P>D 78: Then I would still have to do it anyway.</P>
<P>TH 106: She can't force you to do it, Pam. You are only going to do it if you want to grow up.</P>
<P>D 79: Right. That's what I meant.</P>
<P>TH 107: Okay, but you see what I'm saying to your mother is frankly that I'd say to her that the day that you said I don't want to help I'd say to her tomorrow don't come sitting at this table if you are not going to be helping. I need for you to be a grownup person, but if you don't want to you don't have to be. But just prepare your own meals. That's what I'd tell your mother to do. But what I would rather see happen is for you to say okay mom. I don't really feel like doing it. I'd rather be a baby, but I am going to help clean up the dishes because that's what I want. I don't want to live my life angry all the time and frustrated all the time.</p>
<P>M 52: I'd enjoy having her either helping me with the dishes even if she had to wipe them and standing there talking to me or doing something instead of me being alone in the kitchen and doing the dishes alone.</p>
<P>TH 108: Do you love her?</p>
<P>M 53: Oh yes.</p>
<P>TH 109: You really do.</p>
<P>M 54: Very much love.</p>
<P>TH 110: I thought you did. I thought you did. So I think what's happening, you know, in your relationship is that you are losing the opportunity to be affectionate with your daughter. There is too much fighting going on.</P>
<P>M 55: I just walk away.</P>
<P>TH 111: I know. But there is a lot of anger.</P>
<P>M 56: There's too much anger.</P>
<P>TH 112: Yeah, right.</P>
<P>M 57: Because no matter what I say, she gets angry. If I tell her her blouse is on crooked she gets angry. I mean, if her blouse is crooked. I'm just saying that as an example, but I mean just simple things. She gets angry with me.</P>
<P>TH 113: But, do you know what you have to say to her? She gets angry or something like that you ask her a question. Say Pam, do you want me to tell you when your blouse is crooked or not? Because if you don't want me to, I won't, and if you look bad, I will not tell you, but I'm not going to tell you unless you want me to.</P>
<P>M 58: There is sometimes with the hair I'll say go comb your hair, well I've already done that. I'll say well it doesn't look that great.</P>
<P>TH 114: I would say to her, "Pam, do you want me to tell you about your hair because I have something to say about it, but if you don't want me to I will not." So that Pam knows that if she wants a mother she has to say yes I want you to tell me. Because that's your chance to be a mother to her, to take care of her. Okay. And if she says, "I don't want you to tell me." then you say "I won't." which means then she loses that little bit of your being a mother. You are going to feel bad because you won't have the chance to take care of your daughter, but she is going to feel bad. But you've got to make her feel what she just did. In other words, give her some control over her life. Give her some control over the relationship with you. So if she wants you, she's got to invite you in. If she doesn't invite you in, you don't go in.</p>
<P>M 59: Well, that's it. I just . . .</p>
<P>TH 115: You don't just walk away. I'm saying to you, you say it to her. "Pam, do you want me to comment on your hair. Do you want me to comment on your blouse. Pam, do you want to sit at dinner with us because if you do you need to clean up. If you want me to comment on your hair I will, but I need to know that you definitely want me to comment on it." So that each time she has to make a decision whether she wants to be a grown up or a spoiled kid.</p>
<P>M 60: Okay.</p>
<P>TH 116: And every time she decides she wants to be a spoiled kid, she is going to lose a little bit of her mother because her mother will not get involved.</p>
<P>M 61: We'll have to try this one.</p>
<P>TH 117: Doesn't that sound good, Pam?</p>
<P>D 80: Yeah. I like this idea.</p>
<P>TH 118: See, because she will be giving you the chance to decide whether you want to be a spoiled kid.</P>
<P>D 81: Not a spoiled kid, a spoiled brat.</p>
<P>TH 119: A spoiled brat. I like that, Pam. That's good. She will be giving you a chance to decide whether you want to be a spoiled brat or an adult woman. And the more you are an adult woman, the more you will have your mother. But you are going to have to be consistent, Judy.</p>
<P>M 62: Yes.</p>
<P>D 82: So am I.</p>
<P>M 63: We'll give it a try and we'll see what happens.</p>
<P>TH 120: Judy, don't give it a try. This will work if you stay with it. Now what I don't know is Adrian here spoils her in how own way because he is spoiling her on the one hand, and you try to do this on the other side it is not going to work.</P>
<P>F 37: Tell him how I spoil her.</P>
<P>M 64: Well, he gets up every morning with her.</P>
<P>F 38: Oh, yeah. I'm making the breakfast and making her lunch for her.</P>
<P>M 65: I think that's spoiling her.</P>
<P>F 39: Oh you think so.</P>
<P>D 83: No, that's helping me get out of the house.</P>
<P>F 40: That's shoving her off to work dear.</P>
<P>M 66: She'll work with him more than she will with me. She'll do things with him, but she doesn't care to do them with me.</P>
<P>TH 121: Why is that Adrian?</P>
<P>F 41: I don't know. I don't know. Now ask me who's rough on her.</P>
<P>TH 122: You are.</P>
<P>F 42: You better believe it.</P>
<P>TH 123: But see I think that's why.</P>
<P>F 43: She'll come up to me and give me hugs all over the place, but I don't know if I should say it in front of her or not, but she's a lady so, I think she resents Judy as a woman coming in to me when Judy comes home to me. She comes home to us, but she comes home to me, and I think she resents her as a woman to  woman.</p>
<P>TH 124: I hear you. I think that's good.</p>
<P>M 67: We've talked that one over before.</p>
<P>TH 125: That's true?</p>
<P>D 84: Sometimes, depending on what mood I'm in. You know, sometimes I'll say oh ma how was your day. Just whatever.</P>
<P>TH 126: You know, we don't have time and I wish we did because I like the way this is going. This is going well. But there is a piece in this that you've got to do or this won't work, and I am not sure what it is, but let me throw something out to you. My thought is this, and it's just sort of a general idea. But if you were in effect to say to Pam, Pam if you're not cooperative, if you're not more civil with your mom, don't come hugging on me.</P>
<P>F 44: We tried. It's been done.</P>
<P>TH 127: And?</P>
<P>F 45: She stayed away from me for a long time.</P>
<P>TH 128: And? What happened?</P>
<P>F 46: She started being nicer to her mother, and then she came back to me. She had to go to her mother first.</P>
<P>TH 129: Well, then you got it. You've got the formula.</P>
<P>F 47: There isn't too much that I didn't try.</P>
<P>TH 130: Wait a minute. You got the formula. Let me tell you what happens with kids. What happens with kids is that they will respond to the things that we do. But then when we slacken off, you know, slack off, they go back to the old stuff. So, if you are going to do something and it works, you've got to stay with it. If you stay with it it will work. I think you already know what will work. So all I'm saying to you right here is if you do what already worked and Judy does this new thing, you are going to have a better balance at home.</p>
<P>F 48: Again, this is communicating between the three of us. Her and I, Judy and Pam, me and Judy. But the whole problem is, it happened today, and I don't even remember what it was, but I said something to her.</p>
<P>TH 131: To whom now?</p>
<P>F 49: To Pam. Judy wasn't home yet. I said something to Pam, and you could tell in the tone that she used that she was angry, and she walked away, and she was already in the hallway mumbling her anger, and I turned around and I hollered at her, and says you're talking like your mother, and I can't hear you. Maybe I'm going deaf. But I can't hear you because you are mumbling like your mother does.</P>
<P>TH 132: Go ahead, and?</P>
<P>F 50: So, she went into the kitchen and started mumbling some more, and I said it again, and then she said something out loud. I don't even remember what the words were now, but I can remember the incident.</p>
<P>TH 133: Right.</p>
<P>F 51: And I don't remember what caused it, but this is what I would like to get stopped is this anger and the mumbling under the breath, you know what I'm saying.</p>
<P>TH 134: Adrian, look. I hear you. Let me tell you what's going on. Pam is so used to being a spoiled brat that it is effecting everything that she does at home. Okay? You can't fix everything at once. I am suggesting that you hold onto one thing and stay with it, and I am suggesting to you that it will work if you do that. And Pam wants you to do that I think which is Judy is going to say to Pam in effect do you want me to be your mother? And if you want me to be the mother I need to have you be an adult. Do you want to be an adult, or do you want to be a spoiled brat? That is what she is going to be saying. Asking her over and over and over, and if Pam responds like a spoiled brat, Judy says okay you made your choice. Okay? At the same time what you already tried and worked, if you stay with that which is Pam you want to be close to me and affectionate with me? I've got to see you treat your mother better than the way you are treating her because if not, I'm not playing ball. Just stay with that. I think it will work, and the reason I believe it will work is because Judy really loves this young woman. And Pam is going to have a chance to see what it's like to have a mother, a mother who has a chance to show her affection. Judy will only have a chance to show her affection if she doesn't have to compete with you. If Pam experiences the two of you working together to get the right balance here. It will work.</p>
<P>F 52: We can try. We've been trying . . .</p>
<P>TH 135: But, we've got something new today.</P>
<P>M 68: Try something new and . . .</p>
<P>TH 136: Okay, but it is going to require that you and Judy work together. Say we are not going to let Pam play one off against the other. We are not going to let Pam treat dad like he's great and mom's just a nasty old lady here. And this is what Pam wants, right Pam? Am I right?</p>
<P>D 85: I want both of them to like me.</p>
<P>TH 137: They are both going to like you. That's what we are talking about.</P>
<P>F 53: We both love you.</p>
<P>TH 138: That's the point. And this is your chance to get them both to love you instead of just having one to love you.</P>
<P>D 86: Okay, I see.</p>
<P>TH 139: Okay? So, they will work together to try to get this balance so you feel like I'm close to my dad and I'm close to my mom, and at the same time I can finally stop being a spoiled brat. I can finally grow up. Are you with me Pam? You know what I would like to you to do, Pam? I would like you to reach out with each hand and grab your mom's hand and your dad's hand at the same time.</p>
<P>M 69: I love you. Okay.</p>
<P>D 87: Kleenex.</p>
<P>M 70: Thank you.</p>
<P>TH 140: I think you guys have got it if you stay with this. I think you'll make Pam a very happy young woman. Okay folks. We are done.</P>
<P>M 71: Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 141: Good work.</P>
<P>M 72: Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 142: Good work Adrian.</P>
<P>F 54: Thank you.</P>
<P>M 73: It was very nice tonight.</P>
<P>TH 143: Pam, good work.</P>
<P>D 88: Thank you.</P>
<P>M 74: We will give it a try.</P>
<P>TH 144: Stop saying that. It is going to work if you stay with it. I'm telling you. It can't fail.</P>

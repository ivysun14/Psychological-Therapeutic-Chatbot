<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was one of America's most prominent psychologists. Rather than identifying persons as "sick" or mainly flawed from childhood experiences as the Freudians did, Rogers was interested in how he and other mental health professionals could recognize the strength in people.</p>

<p>Rogers is the acknowledged creator of the "client-centered" approach to psychotherapy. It has also been called "person-centered therapy." His studies resulted in the creation of several totally new mental health therapy techniques. Client-centered therapy is based on the principle of talking therapy and is a non-directive approach. The basic elements involve the therapist creating a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere in which the client is encouraged to reach his or her full potential. The therapist encourages the patient to express his or her feelings and does not suggest how the person might wish to change. By listening and then repeating back what the patient reveals, the therapist helps them to explore and understand their feelings for themselves. In client-centered therapy the therapist's role is mainly to act as a facilitator and to provide a comfortable environment and NOT to direct therapy outcomes.</p>

<p>Called "the quiet revolutionary," Rogers also accomplished what no mental health professional had done before. His 1942 innovation of the tape-recording of psychotherapeutic interviews was far ahead of its time. Many of his taped interviews were donated to the American Academy of Psychotherapists' tape library, and those tapes have now been transcribed for this database.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My name is Dr. Rogers and I'm going to take a little bit of time in order to talk with you some more. I'm interested in people who come to this hospital, and I'm also interested in trying to learn how we can be of more help to them in the future. That's why you're all testing. Now, what I would like would be for you to tell me anything you're willing to tell me about yourself and your situation and how you feel about yourself and your situation. Or I guess, another way of putting it is that if anything you were willing to tell me that would help me to know you better, I'd be very glad to hear it (0:01:14.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where do you want me to start?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wherever you would like to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I'll start with my childhood. When I was a little girl I had this cross eye (indiscernible). And I mean kids poked fun at me, and as the years got longer and I started going into the higher grades, I never had no boyfriends or anything. I mean, I had girlfriends, but as the girls started going with the boys and I mean, and the boys would tell me, now don't go around with me or something like that. And then after then I ended up where I didn't have any girlfriends at all. And around our neighborhood there was no girls my age, so I was calling on these girlfriends, you know, they sort of let me down. And I felt just like I wasn't wanted (0:02:15.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you wound up with no friends at all, and am I getting the fact that you feel that was due basically to your eye condition? Or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, probably the looks, more my looks to. But like in those days you had the kind of glasses that couldn't cover up a cross eye. But in my last year of school I made a friend with this one girl, Joan (ph). She wasn't a very nice girl. And I mean when she was with me she was nice. I mean, if we went out with some guys or anything, she'd start getting funny. I'd get out of the car and then she'd follow me because she didn't want to be there alone. But my husband, he didn't want me to go around with her because he didn't like her. And like most of my friends that I did have from when I was a child, when I lived on the East side, kids who were around the house. But that's when I was real young. And they grew up and they all moved away and I mean I can't even see them, he won't let me see them or anything (0:03:34.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So here's this fun girl whom you like, even though she doesn't have a very good reputation, and your friends from way back but that your husband won't let you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Associate with any of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, like my friends in one spot that are - that like to go out with guys and all that, he don't care for those. And then my other girlfriends that are nice, he don't care for those because he don't like their husbands or something I guess, so then he don't want me going with them. I mean, a woman has to get out once in awhile, I mean to jibber jabber a little bit (0:04:11.2).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to have some...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Chit chat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, like myself, I've got to stay in the house all day long, and with him not wanting me to go with my friends, then he don't want me to go alone anyplace. I mean actually he's the one that would take me out, I would go out with him. And then if we do any dancing or anyplace like that he'd dance with other girls and he won't even dance with me. So I mean, I dance with other guys too. That's - two can play the game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if he's not really going to pay much attention to you, then you can do that too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's good for the gander is good for the goose. So I say - I mean my home situation now is - well, that's part of it, you know my husband won't let me go anyplace, but then there's my mother too. My husband's brother's staying downstairs (indiscernible). I mean I just don't like the idea of it. I mean, my mother isn't married to him, and yet he acts like he's a father to my two brothers and he was living upstairs in my mother's place. And even though I'm married he tries to boss me around (0:05:42.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's another thing you don't like. You don't quite like the situation your mother is in and you don't like him because he acts like he's married to her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I mean, he don't work with the hip. I mean he works a couple months out of the year and my mother's only getting Social Security, and she just can't - I know she can't afford it, but yet she still wants him to stay (0:06:11.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel she wants him to stay but you certainly don't like that arrangement, is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Because she's only living on $20 a month for food already. And with having to have him stay there and eat and, my god, they (indiscernible) it wouldn't be that bad if he wasn't there. Got to be buying cigarettes and all that stuff, could be saving that money for food. I mean actually with the little money she gets, he's actually living off her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you feel pretty resentful of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, well I mean, I don't care for it. I mean, see everybody's up against it my mother's mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, I didn't get that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My mother's mother don't like it either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see (0:6:56.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because well, she don't like to have her daughter talked about by my mother's brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess you're saying, I'm not the only one that feels that way about her and her situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I mean, I'm not the only one, but if anybody tells her anything, she's so bullheaded and knotheaded that she just - if somebody tells her to do something or to get away from him or something, she'll just stay with him. I mean she wants to do things her own self. But even though I'm married, she wants to try to run my life. I mean, I hate the idea of everybody telling me what to do. Even my husband, he don't tell me what to do. Even though I'm young, and I'm married, I mean I'm a human being, I like to run my life myself. I mean I don't want to feel like I'm still in the baby buggy or something like that (0:07:59.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel it's your mother and your husband and everybody tries to run your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's how I feel. I was old enough to bear a baby, and that's surely a lot of pain, but yet they won't let me make up my mind for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're old enough to have a child and yet nobody thinks I can make my decisions or run my own life, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean like, now this is when my husband and I went to California with my little boy. I mean we were more happier out there. He didn't have to run home to his mother all the time, and his mother is another one that we just don't get along. She hated me right from the day she saw me. But when we went to California we had a good time out there (0:08:59.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're saying that kind of shows that when we're just by ourselves, we really get along better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we get along better. I mean we can go to shows and all that and dancing and we have a good time. But when being back in the whole situation, it's just not good. Because his mother is the person that talked behind her own brother's back. She talked - I mean her own son. My husband has six brothers (indiscernible) sister. And I mean she'll talk to one of her sons about one of her other sons. I mean she's that kind of person. You know, although she don't come right out and tell me to my face that she don't like me, I know by the way she's talking about the other people behind their back that she's talking about me too (0:09:54.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel she's just a gossip and you feel she doesn't like you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know she don't like me (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No doubt about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No doubt. Mostly that's the point. And another - and my little girl, she passed away a couple months ago, in November. And my mother did another thing. See, when my little girl was born I asked my mother, I said, how come her leg, her one leg is turned and all that. And she said, well, all babies are like that when they're small. She says, you can't expect them to get up and walk right away. And I said, I know that. And she said, don't worry about it. But I worry about it and then after my little girl passed away, my mother told me that my daughter was crippled. She kept it from me again. She keeps things from me like that. And in a way then I felt responsible for my little girl's death. You know, she would be sitting down and - well, she - well, I mean I'd sit her up in the Davenport in the corner, and I'd put her little legs in. But if I would have known she was crippled I sure wouldn't have done that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That really concerns you that that was kept from you and it concerns you that maybe you didn't deal with her right, not knowing she was crippled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. I mean, I still know that her little foot was sort of like that, but I didn't know how long it was - I mean I didn't know when and my mother said that (indiscernible), I didn't know actually when it was - she was going to outgrow that (0:12:02.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like you're saying I kind of trusted my mother on this, and then by golly she wasn't to be trusted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She let me down. I mean, but my mother, she - I always took the blame home. My mother always, always liked my oldest brother, and I always, always took the blame home. Whether I did something wrong or not. And I got along a lot better with my father. But then my father passed away and then - well actually, I mean I took most - I took all the blame in (indiscernible) that my brother did. And now my youngest brother that's home, he's going through the same darned thing I am. He's taken all the blame on (0:13:00.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel when you were home, whatever went wrong, you took the blame for it within yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, my brother would say that I did this and that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That's what I wasn't quite clear about. You were blamed for everything...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether you had done it or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It isn't so much that you felt you were to blame, but others blamed you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, my brother actually got away with everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you feel that that was sort of true with everybody except with your father, is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things went somewhat better between you and your father.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, they did. I mean, I could go and he'd take me - well, my mother and father, they used to go off all the time (ph), but they went sort of late you know because then by that time I'd be asleep. And I used to fool them all the times because I knew they were going to stop in the hamburger shop. Then they'd think I would sleeping and then when they'd stop then I'd say, oh, I'm awake, I'm awake, you've got to get me one too. And I mean, I used to have a lot of fun when I used to go out with my mother and father, and mostly you know, when I went away with my father I used to help him pile wood, and we had a lot of fun. The neighborhood kids would come over and - boys and girls, and they'd help my father pile up the wood and they'd help him cut it, and it would sell. Then after that we'd all pile in the car and went down to get ice cream cone (0:14:38.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are kind of pleasant memories.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm hmm (0:15:02.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, but it sort of looks as though thinking about those things makes you feel a little bit weepy, or am I wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can remember, I don't exactly know how it went, but I knew I was pretty young, but we went over by my father's relation, anyways - his brother, yes, his brother, we went over by. And then it was I and my oldest brother, and anyhow, the two guys decided to go out and then my mother and my aunt and I and my brother were there and her children. And gee, I don't know if I remember this quite clearly (0:16:21.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard to remember.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyhow, my father didn't come back till real late. And my mother was mad at him. And I don't know, before I knew it, I was going with my father in his car, it was a stormy night. And I mean it scared the wits out of me. But my mother somehow got home ahead of us, my uncle took her home. But on that stormy night it seemed like, I don't know, it seemed so spooky out, just like I was scared we were going to get in a crash or something because Daddy was drinking a little bit. And while he was driving he had his arm around me, I was standing up on his seat. I don't even know how old I was, I mean I just (0:17:24.5)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's something that's so far back it's kind of vague, and yet certain parts of it evidently are very...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vivid to you. You remember his being - not coming back and remember your mother being angry but mostly you can remember this spooky, wild ride with him through the storm and your fear that you might crash up and his holding you, with his arm around you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and even after awhile too, when we would go out for a ride, I mean if it would be at nighttime, I'd be scared to ride - I mean I would be afraid I was going over a cliff or something. I mean I always thought we were going to come to a dead end and we'd go flying over the cliff (0:18:13.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm getting this right, after that it just seemed to you as though you and your father were headed for a cliff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean everybody was with us, but I mean I sort of shut my eyes when I was driving because I was scared to look out the window because I'd think we were going over a cliff. Or I'd be thinking that we're going to be coming to one and Daddy's not going to be able to stop us.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he isn't going to be able to manage it, he seemed to go over the edge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Gee, that's funny, I've never said these things before to the other doctors. And I can remember too when I was small, my cousin, she's a year younger than I am, and I don't know, it seemed like I was always pushed out of the way, she was always better than me. And I always felt when I always tried to improve myself by doing hard work and making good credits and good drawings (ph) and - but even now, I mean, even though I'm married, I mean I never had no really, a lot of boyfriends or anything through my school. But even though now I'm married, I mean I want to look attractive when I'm in a guy's eyes, even though I'm married. I mean, I didn't have that before, and by being married so young it seems like I'm missing it (0:20:15.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that somehow just as you wanted to do things right when you were - and get proper credits and so on when you were young, now you feel as though, well, I'd like to be attractive to other men, even though I am married. So sometimes you feel, I missed out on something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, I mean if I could, I mean talk to the guy and all this and that and kiss, but I mean, really I mean, all guys would take advantage of a girl, every guy would try. But I mean, if he ever did try it on me, I mean I couldn't feel I had the power to even scratch - I mean, I couldn't hurt anybody. I mean, I can't even hurt a - if I would get in an argument with a girl or something like that, I mean and she could be ready just to cut my throat and I couldn't (indiscernible) (0:21:21.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel, I can't really protect myself against any fellas or girls because I just can't hurt somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I feel like if I hurt them, I mean if I got in a fight with them and I really hurt them, that they would die. That maybe they'd send me to prison or maybe I would die or something. I mean that's what always comes across my mind. And I just can't or, even like my husband, he could kill me or anything and I wouldn't even touch him. I mean, I just feel like I was just paralyzed (0:22:02.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel like, I can't strike back because there's the feeling that if I should protect myself, defend myself, strike back, then that would kill the other person and then I'd be punished.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean sometimes too I - I mean, like different times, I mean if it's somebody I don't like, I mean that's when I'm afraid that I might really kill or hurt them bad. But like my husband, I mean I don't know. I mean maybe I saw a show one time long ago that probably made me feel like if it could be a show (ph), like this person probably was trying to - I'll say like this one person was probably trying to kill me. And pretty soon I'd give him a bat or something like that and he'd probably - I'd killed him instead and that way I would be sent to prison. I mean that's the way - I mean you don't, I don't think of it (0:23:11.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not really comfortable, but somehow that's the way it feels to you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you ever struck back when someone struck at you, that would kill them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when I was younger I mean I didn't - I don't think I - I don't even remember when I start feeling like that. I know one time that I took this one boy, we were fighting. And I took him and I bit him in the finger so the blood just came coming - I mean it was just coming out real fast. And then his mother came out and, I don't know, she hollered and then she said, if you want a crust of bread to chew on, she said why don't you run home and get it? Or she'd throw me a crust of bread. I mean, because we got in a fight, but actually this boy, he bit me, so I bit him back. But I mean, I didn't mean to bite him in the (indiscernible). I mean, I didn't mean to hurt him (0:24:10.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But at least you feel, see when I was young, I didn't have this fear I - when he bit me, I bit him back. I even bit him harder than I meant to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I even feel that way towards animals. If somebody would hurt an animal I'd be right there to pick it up. If it was a little bird, if it was a mouse - I'm actually scared of a mouse when it's running, but I mean when it's hurt, I'm not. I mean when something's hurt I'm right there ready to take care of it. But I can't see what made me go into that scared feeling. I don't know when it started (0:24:58.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did I get that fear that if I strike out it really would be fatal for the other person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know when it started. Probably in another way too I feel like maybe I want friends so bad that I don't want to hurt them because I don't want to lose them. Maybe that's the way I feel.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a possible thing, that maybe it is that I feel so much unwanted by people and I want friends so much that I just couldn't take the risk of hurting anybody because I might be driving away a friend (0:25:57.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (indiscernible) hard on the eyes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't hear?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said those little holes up there are hard on my eyes. Is this supposed to make you tired? Or more relaxed?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying that because it feels as though it makes you tired?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean I feel so relaxed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of as though you'd let down a little.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know just because I say it, now my heart's pounding again. I mean, a lot of times too I'm always afraid I'm not - I might talk to somebody and I'm not going to say the right words. I mean I might make friend go away because they probably think I'm stupid or something. I mean sometimes, it's not all times it's just sometimes that it feels like I just want to say something, like I think ahead of what I'm going to say, and yet it comes out different (0:27:09.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's always a feeling look out, look out, be careful of what you say because even that may drive somebody away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't think that it might drive somebody away, but I mean it's probably just a feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It isn't really clear to you is what I said. It's more of an - maybe that is...</p>

<p>CLIENT: The oozy kind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The oozy kind. And just in a vague sort of way, maybe that's what you feel underneath or something like that (0:27:52.4).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know when I got the measles one time, I had an awful dream and I don't know what it was. I know it felt just like something was just, I don't know, like the house was going to cave in. I don't know, I was being smothered like. I always try to think of what that could be. (indiscernible) when I woke up, gee I sure felt awful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was just an awful dream of things kind of smothering you and you wondered what meaning that did have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean in my mind it seemed like it was some kind of a big option. It was a big thing, anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some big thing was really falling on you and smothering you (0:28:54.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it really seemed like a cloud. So just like it was sort of smother me, I mean trying to pull me in the cloud or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost as though it seemed like the cloud was sort of swallowing you up, something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmm hmm. I'm trying to remember way back, because I remembered I would try and reach to the (ph) - I know a lot of times though I felt like running away from home. In a way as much as I loved my father as I grew older, it seems as though when I was young, I mean I don't know but - well I guess every parents has to hit their children once in awhile (0:30:47.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds as though perhaps this is what you're saying, that when you really think back and try to understand your childhood, then you feel, gosh I'm not so sure about my father, he surely seemed to be harsh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean my father has been gone four years now and I mean most of his memories isn't - I mean, I don't have too much memory of him since he passed away. It's either something I don't want or, I mean I don't' have time to think about it because when I'm home, I got my own worries to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know that you don't really have many thoughts or memories of him and whether that's because you tried to - whether it's because you've put them out of mind or whether it's just that you have too many worries of your own (0:32:03.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's like now I'm up here, (indiscernible) I mean, since I came up to the hospital, and I've been here - today is Tuesday. I would be here two weeks tomorrow, and all the while I was in the hospital I didn't even think about the people back home. I only thought of mostly my little boy. I mean I didn't think of them back home. I mean I just wanted to make myself happy and - for a change and I mean, I had - I got other things to do. I mean, I don't have to be worried about when the next meal's coming and when we're going to have some money or just be dying and waiting to go out and have a good time once in awhile. And I don't have to listen to all the gossip between Russell's mother and everybody. And then I don't have to take the kind of treatment I do from my husband. I mean being away from home is the best thing (0:33:16.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're just feeling it's been a relief to be away from all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now that I'm downstairs in 2B I mean, I don't feel actually nervous or where I hate anybody, but when I first went down there I didn't like it because the door was locked. And I thought to myself gee, I never - I was just thinking, what am I doing down here, I never even hurt anybody. But it's different. I mean, there's things to do (0:34:01.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So at first you just couldn't understand it, but now at least you feel, well, it isn't too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not too bad. And then my husband came today, my family came today, my grandpa came today, my mother came today and his brother came today. They all came today. I cried when I saw my mother and grandma coming, just for a few seconds. And then after awhile when I knew they were going back, I didn't even miss them already. And when my grandpa came in, I don't know, all of a sudden I had the nerve to talk. I mean I had the nerve to say what I'd been wanting to say to him. I told him, I said, (indiscernible) I'd say take yourself, Grandpa, for instance. I said, you and grandma, you want to think of me as your little granddaughter who used to run to the store for you, and how you used to pity me because the other ones like my little - my cousin more than me. I said, and I told my husband and I said, and you, I said and the way you treat me around the house. I said you treat me as though I wasn't wanted or I can't do anything. And then I looked at my mother and I told her, and I said and you, you never give me no kind thought. If I couldn't get stuff right away you'd be ready to hit me and scold me and punish me for every little thing. And I mean I had enough. And I never did before (0:35:39.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just feel really surprised at yourself, that by golly you could tell them some of the things you've been thinking and feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I didn't care if I hurt their feelings or not. I mean, they don't think of me as being married, they think I'm just young and they want to make my decisions for me and they want to do this and they want to do that and oh, god. I mean, they think I'm just not capable or old enough to make my own decisions. But I mean I really had the nerve to tell them off today. And I didn't care if I hurt their feelings or not. I felt well, if they don't like what I say, they can just go jump in a lake (0:36:28.7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just feel kind of strong and pleased that you were able to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell them what you felt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They always told me what they felt, only I was scared to tell them that before because I mean, even though they were pitying me and all that stuff, and I didn't have no friends, in a way I felt like I wanted to be pitied. But now I'm married. I mean, that was when I was 14, that's not so long ago. I mean, they still wanted to make my decisions for me (0:37:08.8)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you feel part of the change is in you, that earlier yes, you wanted their pity and you wanted them to feel sorry for you. But now you feel, I'm married and I'm able to make my own choices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because when I was (indiscernible), I wanted them to feel sorry and pity me, because well I didn't have any friends. I mean I wanted to feel at least if they couldn't love me with their whole heart, at least a little pity and a little soul for me, at least that was better than nothing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be better than nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But now I'm married, I want to bring up my family the way I want, and not the way they want me to. Like if my husband were to ask me something, and I would be, and my mother would be in our presence, he would ask me something and before I get a chance to answer him, my mother will talk for me. I mean, I don't get a chance to talk myself (0:38:14.8).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, I just don't have a chance to be a person, everybody's all ready to be me for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Just like everybody, one's got one leg and the other's got one arm and just like they all got part of me and I ain't got none of myself. But yet like, now being on Ward 2 down there, I mean when we had that group discussion this morning, I believe it was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel a lot has happened today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). I mean, nobody wanted to start the conversation. I mean I felt like I wanted to, I mean I want to feel sort of big and I felt like I wanted to be the one to break it. But yet I just couldn't. It seemed like my heart was pounding, I was afraid to come out and say something. And I was the second one that talked anyway, and then we started the conversation. Like, I don't know, it does seem when I get in a crowd that I don't have much to say. But if I go with like, for instance, say like I would go with my one girlfriend and I go talk to her and say a whole bunch of stuff. But if I would go with my one girlfriend and her girlfriend, I wouldn't have much to say because I'd feel well, my girlfriend would rather be off with her other girlfriend and they probably wouldn't want to talk to me or anything. That's just the way I'd feel (0:39:55.3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We always feel pretty sure that if there's any choice, they would prefer the other person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've got to stop in a minute or two and I'm sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Am I going to get to do this again?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do I have to do this again?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you like to or not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know, I said things that I didn't tell the other doctors. I mean, I don't know. I just seem like I can't get relaxed when I sit up and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This really helps to be lying down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now, I can't think of anything that's going to be different. I mean it all seems the same to me is what I mostly - most of it is what I told the other doctors too but, I don't think there's nothing else (0:40:54.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I guess I feel as though I really have gotten to know you quite a bit in this time. I feel you really have been able to tell me who you are. And I guess I'd just like to say good luck to you as you try to be yourself and live your own life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay, I'm waiting for the day. Or I feel like when that day comes I bet you it's just going to feel like a different soul just jumped in me. Just something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you can be yourself that would feel as though a new soul had come into you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Give me a stronger hope and - well I got my hopes up high yet. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not defeated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Nothing's bothering me. I mean what bothers me, I mean I just - if something happens to bother me while I'm down in Ward 2 I just pick up a book and read or I'm making a cap already. I'm starting this afternoon. It's a little before five and I've got quite a bit done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I do have to go. I appreciate talking with you and I really do hope that things go well for you. And the girl will come in in just a minute and she'll take off the harness. Bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

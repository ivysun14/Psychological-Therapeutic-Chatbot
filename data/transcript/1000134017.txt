<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 1922, Client -038. Client 1922-038. Session Number 2, Session Number 2.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've been thinking since Monday about - I figured out that I was sort of afraid of doing this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of what now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seeing a therapist and that I felt in sort of a one-down position; somehow it was a really weak thing to do, to take somebody else's - well, not to ask for help, but I found the situation sort of frightening and I'm sort of wondering how I as the client am supposed to be acting and what I'm supposed to be saying, you know, things like that, so that I end up appearing I don't know exactly what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you thinking about like - well, wondering what impression I had of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And what impression I'm out to try to be making, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And whether I wanted to stay (crosstalk) in the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think I understand that it's now that you're  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had the same feeling when I'm talking with my brother or (inaudible at 0:02:42.0) or something, that I understand that something happened and we both got stuck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so when someone has to tell him something about myself I can correct it, deny it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except none of that's not true. He can't possibly understand. And so in the length [of meaning that] (ph) I don't understand.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That makes you not in control of the situation and sometimes I think - well, it makes me really want to control the situation. Makes me want to make sure that, now, that I say the right things in order to (inaudible at 0:03:39.8) understand myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it was something about somebody else understanding you better than you understand yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's betting (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure it's real clear. Well, it's sort of clear. It's a little like - not understanding yourself as well as someone else is a little like walking around on one holder (ph) and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Somehow it's not being yourself that's - belong (ph) to the other person, assume (ph) that you belong to the other person. It's that you're not in control of yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost like you're trying to step over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is going to get really irritating.</p>

<p>[Audio break]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perhaps also it makes you feel sort of a little bit inferior or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in this situation I'm wondering, "Well, am I supposed to talk or what am I supposed to do?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [So put] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which I need. And that it's a question that obviously can't be answered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I was going to say they don't have anything in particular that I can really say. But it does leave you on the spot, this (inaudible at 0:06:08.1). You still had to find something to do that's vaguely appropriate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Like why am I sitting here [on the desk] (ph)? I really feel undirected at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, just not - just longer, because there's no reason to say one thing more than any other thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, and you want to say (inaudible at 0:07:16.1). That's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, maybe I still kind of (inaudible at 0:07:27.8) things; just if you have something that you had a strong feeling about or something that troubled you or something that's an example of, you know, a general problem that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Well, actually, I've been feeling good past couple of days and I've found I've been playing with - I've just been feeling good. And when I'm feeling good there's no need to talk about all the things that when I'm feeling bad might really bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just seem unimportant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you just don't feel unlight (ph) or unhappy or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I realize that at the time, when I'm feeling good. One of those things that really bother you, they're trangent (ph) and not very important. But when I'm not feeling - when I'm feeling depressed I can't think, "Well, this is strange."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it has to be all that's important at that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, like when you're feeling good you don't have to let - small temporary things shouldn't do that to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can really get some kind of distance from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, and that's what I've been feeling, what I'm feeling right now. 0:09:17.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday I felt really good. I got back from my trip to Europe about three months ago, had a trip, and I had taken a lot of photographs and I might be taking photo lessons (ph)(inaudible at 0:09:51.3) and I got them back and they were really good. A photographer friend said, "Wow, these are really good."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, (inaudible at 0:09:59.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So here's something I could do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did well at something and I just felt happy for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. To just have someone say it's very good, that - I don't know. I guess that's sort of rare for you to feel that you're doing something well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. For me to think I'm doing something well is rare. It's not rare for people to tell me that I'm doing as well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was the photographs; the photographs, I thought they were good, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I really value the opinion of this person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he was a photographer. So that was neat for me, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like it sort of highlights something you need more of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, that's... Yeah. I knew they were good; I had self-confidence about it and that's something that I generally don't have, even if I'm (inaudible at 0:11:23.7) I'm not so confident in that or I know that I'm not doing something (inaudible at 0:11:30.4) doesn't mean much for someone to tell me and I think that's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that other times like what you see and what you're doing doesn't meet your standards, or just that  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I play the recorder; I know I can't (ph) play it well, I'm a very sloppy player, but someone who doesn't know that it's - tells me it's good and I know it isn't, so I don't feel any better about my record (ph) playing. And I think why can't I - and I worry about things like not coming up to my own standards. And I think, "Well, why don't you just realize what your limitations are and just readjust your way of thinking about it and be more satisfied with what you can do and accept - instead of being unsatisfied what you can't do as well as you wish you could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if that (inaudible at 0:13:16.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just doesn't work for me or I need to analyze it, you know  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this is what's wrong with and I need to change it..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Well, the rational way to feel about this would be such and such.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It just doesn't help to be rational about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. And I guess - well, I'm not sure but does it really sort of bother you that you are a bad recorder player?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I was just using that example.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what bothers me about that is that I can't seem to sit down and practice and do what you're supposed to be able to do, even though I really would like to be an excellent recorder player.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That leaves a discrepancy, like here's something that you really would like to do better but you can't make yourself do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's another thing - I don't know, I think you said something last time about feeling like you don't have any will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's the same thing with - I'm [studying that and trying to die] (ph) last - with you last time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well  -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here's something that I should change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I can be rational about it, but it really doesn't help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still want to sit down and practice the difficult parts of the music or stop (inaudible at 0:14:47.0) a million things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's always this dissatisfaction with what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what happens to you, like you've got a piece of little (ph) messages in it and you're sitting around plugging (ph) in the recorder, like what makes you not go into practicing the difficult passages?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think what happens is I usually try to figure out an easier way of playing it or figure out - or I slow down the tempo so that I can get up (ph) and understand making (ph) about mistakes. I get bored with practicing the same thing [done over] (ph). I realize at the time that this is going to take a long time to work out. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to be so long and it's much boring stuff that it really doesn't seem quite worth it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Because I think it would be worth it; it is something important, that like you do a troupe (ph) in B-flat to C, I get really, really satisfied.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Why don't you do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's you get sort of a momentary feeling that just, "Nah, I don't want to do this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that happens. This feels like the time and what if I spend all my time and still couldn't get it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A little bit frightening to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To think that I might not be able to do it anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because like you would have wasted so much time or because it would say something about that, you know, even if you work hard you still can't succeed? 0:17:42.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that, that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That. Like I'm trying it all, I know. Begs (ph) the question, well, maybe I can't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Is there something really scary about that, that maybe you can't do things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, there is. There are a lot of things that I can do and so, again, it's irrational.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but sure. Do you know at all what makes that scarier?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm. It makes me a worse person that there are things that I can't do in my own eyes and in the eyes of - in my imagined eyes of other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have to be good at things all the time or not do them. What's scary is this having people think that I'm stupid or that I'm untalented or whatever it happens to be in that situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's okay. It's sort of - well, the agenda is really (inaudible at 0:19:50.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to think of another situation, because that really isn't that critical a thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I like to cook. I cook well. I like to cook well (ph). I like to see people to enjoy it and I think that Tanya Barber - [Tanya's the person] (ph). And if I make something and I know that it's not as good as it could have been but somebody tells me it's good, I'm still dissatisfied and it's... And do you really like it or are you just saying that, because I know it's not really that good. I mean that's not really very often either so... And I don't know what is important for them. They're all important to me at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But even little things of the moment get to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. So now I feel now that I have to talk about things that are really important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean like you feel a pressure from, I don't know - from year (ph) to the situation that, well, (inaudible at 0:21:58.0) really important?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, from the situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you want to be a good client, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know exactly what that involves so (inaudible at 0:22:23.0) close this down what to do. This situation is more feeling and not conspiring to, but at least that's how my mind is handling, but more self-analysis, where I was fine - like I said, when I'm feeling really good I don't worry about self-analysis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the only time I'm really analyzing why are you doing this, why are you letting this get you down, is when you're depressed and sometimes it seems sick that the more I analyze myself, the worse I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so perhaps the thing to do is not to analyze yourself and not to go into things then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perhaps when you're depressed you didn't go into that, but perhaps your depression [got lost sooner] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. And I feel I'm manufacturing the depression. I get involved in these really elaborate - trying to create a logical, consistent reason why I'm doing what I'm doing so that I can logically "say stop doing it" or - yeah. Things keep escaping out of this (inaudible at 0:24:03.3) or try to put the box in the box and I know that's pretty abstract.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I don't quite follow you. Well, like, when you say that you want to find a reason that explains to you why you're doing what you're doing, explains to you in a way that makes it seem logical or just explains it to you in a way that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Explain yourself in a logically consistent way so that it includes - yeah - so it includes why I'm not doing my papers, why I sit there and look at everything and don't do it, why am I afraid (inaudible at 0:25:03.8) and losing track of myself. And I try to abstract in this and say this is what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But things keep escaping. And then I try to take whatever it is that I think that I have and then I'll say, "Well, why do you think that's what's wrong with you? Maybe you're thinking that's what's wrong with you is merely rationalization and [there's something else] (ph) at it (inaudible at 0:25:41.1)."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're trying to get on top of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, to get on top of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's self-defeat, very (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then "Why are you trying to get on top of it? What are you afraid of?" It's a never-ending series of questioning, why you're doing this and that, et cetera, which makes me even more depressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Something about the repetitiousness, the uselessness of it that (inaudible at 0:26:23.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Disgusting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. How is this really important; like you don't like a good person (inaudible at 0:26:44.6) you're saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And being [a good a] (ph) person to other people is really important; that the other people think just that I'm feeling (ph) person, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And being sure enough that what you're doing deserves to be appreciated; that you don't have any doubts about how they react.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, these are options that I can understand, at least intellectually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:27:55.0)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have some very unpleasant image of yourself; this walking around and not getting anywhere, not able to do things well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm disgusted that I'm so dependent on how other people think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wanted to move (ph). I wanted to feel satisfied with myself. To have to show (inaudible at 0:29:02.5) to somebody else in order to get approval, well, I knew they were going to - I don't like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:29:30.5). Just (inaudible at 0:29:31.7) for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One thing you're not trying just now is to act out the part of yourself that is critical of you, as if you were talking to the rest of you and making the sort of suggestions you make.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah, I mean the situation (inaudible at 0:30:57.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you understand what I mean there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so; to verbalize (inaudible at 0:31:05.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I need a situation. I can't - I've tried to do that in the past, to write it down or to just get on top of it, because it sounds sort of like a nonverbal (ph) level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it usually doesn't work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you could (inaudible at 0:31:46.4) what do you think of this general...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:32:00.0) think that I'm weak. Trying to (inaudible at 0:32:05.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As an internal dialog, generally I think that you're weak. I don't know, maybe you could pretend that you're sitting over there and that you're talking to yourself, sitting in the other chair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Yeah, you're weak, very." It's going to be the same answer (inaudible at 0:32:36.2). "You're weak. You're too dependent on Sarah(inaudible at 0:32:42.6) think of me, that's really disgusting and why can't you be strong? Why can't you just be satisfied with that? Why can't you have your own lives?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hear in that that you criticizing her, feel something that - like sort of a little sadness in the disgust; this "Oh, why can't you," you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Yes, it's very frustrating and it's the sort of thing I wish I could cry now but... We used to (inaudible at 0:33:41.2) really empty because being disgusted with yourself you get - just so long, so help us.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you can or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah (inaudible at 0:33:56.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really wish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. But at the same time part of my - part of this dimension is that I can't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I try to - "You're going to write this paper. You're going to sit down and do it," but then I can't. you know, you sit there for two hours and you won't be able to think of anything to write down (inaudible at 0:34:31.1) no, no, you're really going to do it. But I'm still sure I'm not, and sure enough, two hours later, I haven't written anything. So at least I have the satisfaction of saying, "Well, I knew I couldn't do it. I understand this now. Why don't I not try to do it and then I can not have these worries?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you try going on (inaudible at 0:35:02.7)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, all right. Okay, it would continue like, well, (inaudible at 0:35:38.4) everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless the situation, you know (inaudible at 0:35:44.6) situation, you know, but you still can't (inaudible at 0:35:48.6), still don't know. You still can't do it if you want to though. That sort of thing you're (ph) scared of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:36:07.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's probably better that you (inaudible at 0:36:13.2) how you feel about yourself now and the situation (inaudible at 0:36:18.7) at this time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay, you can come in here and say that you know how - why (inaudible at 0:36:33.4) I understand. (Inaudible at 0:36:38.5) confused. I can't hold onto it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

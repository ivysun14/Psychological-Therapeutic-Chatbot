<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that is progress (other chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had this class one time (cheerfully).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In May (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (haltingly) chronic lateness is a big problem for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Pray tell] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why. Hah (audible sigh). So what's [done] (ph), what's new since yesterday? (Pause) I went to the Career Fair and it was utterly demoralizing. Um, (pause) I spent an hour, after I left here, fussing with my resume, um, adding (pause) my RA appointment and the TAing works that I had done, fucking around with the formatting, until one of my friends said you know, "God damn it, just go to the Career Fair."</p>

<p>So I got there two hours into a three-hour fair, so well the recruiters were just sick of talking to people and I didn't get to talk to all the companies I wanted to talk to, before everyone started packing up and closing up shop. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>And the very first recruiter I'd talked to was like, "Can I give you some advice about your resume? This is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong." And then he gave it back to me and was like, "We are aggressively hiring but only qualified candidates."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was [highly inappropriate] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was a real jerk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause/clearing throat) So, yeah, it, it was rocky and I failed to eat yesterday. Um, (pause) I had, uh, a string cheese before I came here and then I just didn't eat again until about nine o'clock at night, which [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just (pause), at every point where I could've like stopped and gotten some food, I, I had this pro-, process going on in my head saying, you know you've got too much to do, you need to get this next chunk of stuff done and then you can go get food. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>And then (pause), yeah, um, (pause) but anyway (pause) Dave, my husband, tells me about you know I should be pleased about the Career Fair because, um, two recruiters said that they would be calling me for interviews and that that is actually a phenomenal success rate, but I don't believe him because I'm broiling (ph) on all of the things that went wrong, (pause) so (other chuckling), yeah.</p>

<p>Another recruiter from the [License Tutor at Cambridge] (ph) was just epically condescending and rude to me and I don't know why. Um, (pause) but she also said you know "should tweak your resume to make your experience pop more because we're looking for people with exciting, dynamic resumes" and it's like (audible sigh) I have action verbs on my (other chuckling) resume and I have things like you know, um, "architected this, designed that" [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . you know, (pause) but I didn't, how did I know it can be, when you get two lines to describe your job in. [00:03:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible sigh) So, yeah, it's (ph) just very frustrating, (pause/audible sigh) but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. [Silence from [00:03:27] to 00:03:42] What else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. I failed to get any work on my research project done yesterday because by the time the Career Fair was over (pause) I was exhausted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I stayed on campus until about eight trying to get work done and I was just being horribly (pause) ineffective and kept getting distracted by Facebook and I, um, and Twitter and, um, all that stuff, um, (pause) so, yeah. [00:04:11]</p>

<p>And then today after class I went and actually got lunch, which you know (pause) the whole (pause) not eating, either because I think other things are more important or because I think I haven't earned myself a break yet is seeming (ph) a huge problem for me. So, I'm very proud of myself that I actually managed to go get lunch. But then (pause) instead of getting work done, I just played games (haltingly) all afternoon even, I don't know, because I suck (ph).</p>

<p>And, (pause) I've got a big pile of work from my advisor that we need to discuss tomorrow at two! (Pause) And, one of my classmates, from a class I went to this morning, asked if I was free tomorrow at noon to go over the problem set, which (pause) I haven't started work on, and it's due on Tuesday, so (huffing chuckle). [00:05:01]</p>

<p>(Pause) I don't know, I just (pause) keep trying to make myself do work and I can't (pause) and I feel pathetic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh (sighing), um, [silence from [00:05:20] to 00:05:32] that's not good. [Silence from [00:05:33] to 00:06:08] I mean, uh [silence from [00:06:09] to 00:06:30] how did you feel when Dave was far more positive about the Career Fair than you had been, and you said you didn't believe him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else went on for you when he said that? [Silence from [00:06:47] to 00:06:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he's kind of just saying random crap to make me feel better, like (ph) he didn't want to deal with me being miserable, (pause) which he objected to and said that was not the case at all, but you know. [Silence from [00:07:08] to 00:07:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [Silence from [00:07:59] to 00:08:06] Yeah, I mean I guess I'm wondering about [silence from [00:08:08] to 00:08:19] how actively you were to (chuckling) shut down the possibility that he might be right or [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . onto something or you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh (ph). [Silence from [00:08:35] to 00:08:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean it sounds like you have this sort of like revisionist Jujitsu (sp) move for whatever he might have said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possible, yes (other chuckling). [Silence from [00:09:00] to 00:09:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does anything come to mind for you about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible inhale and exhale) [Silence from [00:09:26] to 00:09:36] About my revisionism or about Dave specifically or?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I had in mind why you'd be so intent on taking anything good out of what he said, but I knew that. [Silence from [00:10:10] to 00:10:39] I want to turn this another way, purely for the sake of discussion [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and completely hypothetically.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's say he was right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's say you had a great batting average [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . at the Career Fair. And, not only that, but he wasn't just telling you that to make you feel better because he didn't want to deal with you feeling bad, but rather he was telling you, partly because he just thought it was true, [overlapping voices] [00:11:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and you know partly for other reasons than not wanting to deal with you feeling bad, he thought it might make you feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like how would you feel about that? I mean like what if we entertain for a minute that that's true, where did that leave you? Am I making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You are making sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying to think how to answer the question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't actually know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) I guess that leaves me kind of (pause) set up for disappointment when I don't get any of the jobs I want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it also leaves me (pause), if it's true that that actually was a good batting average, then (pause) that leaves me feeling like (pause) the companies that were interested in me, they must be desperate for (pause) people. They must be hiring really, really aggressively and lowering their standards because (pause) I haven't actually done anything that impressive while in grad school and I wasn't (pause), I had a really hard time finding jobs before grad school. And what have I done in grad school? I've like dicked around with this project that's meaningless and you know got A-s and Bs in my classes; (pause) like I wouldn't hire me. [Silence from [00:12:46] to 00:12:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think you're Jujitsuing me a little bit in that (chuckling) answer, which is fine. And then I'm saying like "what if what he was saying was something good" and you're like "well it could be things are actually really bad over here", see what I mean? [00:13:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, I guess this is very persistent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Am I like clear what I'm referring to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause) and I think the word for this is imposter syndrome.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at least that's part of what's going on, certainly not all of it, but. [Silence from [00:13:32] to 00:13:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Enough? I think I know what [it causes, and] (ph) what do you have in mind specifically about that? [00:13:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible sigh/pause) So I actually have this collection, um, on my blog of (pause) every time something good has happened academically, and they're all tagged with the tag 'fight imposter syndrome' because there's a part of me that really does believe that I am phenomenally stupid and incapable as an architect, and (pause) that I'm somehow pulling the wool over peoples' eyes you know, and I manage to skate through Harvard with the help of lots of kindhearted friends and graduated by the skin of my teeth, and now that I can flash the ring right around and people believe all sorts of things that I'm not actually qualified for.</p>

<p>Um, (pause) but you know there, there have been cases where, (pause) you know I went into my Detection and Estimation Theory class last fall, the first class I took at Tuffs, terrified that I didn't have the math background and I was going to fail out, but I knew that you take three classes in a semester and that was the only one that would (pause) fit. And I ended up (pausing) acing the first exam, and doing better on both projects than the, [the center in the] (ph) class, who was doing his PhD in that field with the professor. [00:15:02]</p>

<p>And (pause/audible sigh) in theory, I believe in the scientific method and (other chuckling) evidence-based reality (other chuckling), but (pause) sometimes I find it really hard (other chuckling) to accept that the evidence seems to point to a conclusion other than I am phenomenally stupid and incompetent as an architect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, so, yeah (whispering). [Silence from [00:15:28] to 00:15:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So when you're referring to imposter syndrome, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . what you're referring to is disbelieving anything, no matter how clear or strong that evidence [overlapping voices] [00:16:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that you're not completely stupid and a total failure? [Silence from [00:16:13] to 00:16:29] And, [silence from [00:16:29] to 00:16:38] again, I would say you hold onto that very, very tightly for reasons that, certainly to me and I expect he, too, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm (barely audible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . are not so clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm (ph — barely audible/pause) okay (ph). [Silence from [00:16:58] to 00:17:08] It's really [silence from [00:17:09] to 00:17:24] I feel like I'm just faking everything, (pause) like I'm certainly faking (pause) having my act together and you know not being a complete train wreck emotionally or personally, that's (pause/audible sigh) — [Silence from [00:17:39] to 00:17:52] And even when I've gotten positive feedback from professors, like when Hartman said I did an excellent job on that project, the best in the class, or (pause) you know where I submitted like an absolutely beautiful midterm project for my Image Processing class last spring, [overlapping voices] [00:18:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I still felt like what I handed in was (pause), did not meet my standards for (pause) what I needed to hand in, right, like I felt like I cut corners and (pause) you know I did not (pause) present things as cleanly or tell as (pause) explicit a story as I wanted to, uh, about the data and what (pause) the papers were arguing, and (pause) don't know. [Silence from [00:18:36] to 00:18:51] I don't know if it (pause) helps, (pause) helps give you a better picture or not but (pause) I was told last spring, when I was TAing that, uh, I was a really, really hard grader and (pause/audible sigh) [overlapping voices] [00:19:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . was giving students lower grades than they, I think, were expecting, based on the way other TAs graded, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. (Pause) Whenever students complained to me I said "you know Hartman's grading this on a curve, so you know whether I give you a 60 percent or a 90 percent" (pause) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, [inaudible at 00:19:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ". . . it's all relative to the rest of the students, so" [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ". . . I'm grading everyone equally hard, so you know" [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ". . . (pause) take it as a flag post for you need to study more" and they didn't appreciate that (chuckling).</p>

<p>R: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was like a strictly bell-curve graded class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Well, yeah, right (whispering). [Silence from [00:19:46] to 00:20:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was wondering, maybe I'm just a perfectionist one (ph). [Silence from [00:20:06] to 00:20:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else is coming to mind? [Silence from [00:20:50] to 00:21:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible sigh) What else is coming to mind (whispering)? [Silence from [00:21:06] to 00:21:29] I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [silence from [00:21:32] to 00:21:42] maybe one function of the imposter business is to keep you further (ph) or to keep other people out, like away from anything else you might be feeling, and to keep you, a big way to keep you from feeling anything other than self-hatred? [00:22:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm willing to entertain that hypothesis.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . one of the ways it does that is to keep other people at a distance from other things you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe if you had believed a little bit of what Dave was saying, [overlapping voices] [00:23:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . as well as, what (ph) I think you also know, in part of your mind, were his good intentions in saying it, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . like his honesty is [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . interestingly helpful. I mean I have the impression that some part of you that is looking back kind of knows that, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . even if you also know that you had a different reaction at the time, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm (ph — barely audible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . then, maybe you would have felt upset about, so that maybe he'll talk to you there or, how anxious you were or how anxious you are about the job search process [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . or how sad that you don't have, not just self-hating but sad, that you don't have more to show for [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . periods of your efforts [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and various efforts you made academically [for a thing] (ph). [00:24:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm (ph — barely audible). [Silence from [00:24:03] to 00:24:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you sense that's what I mean, that like keeping him at that kind distance, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . keeps some of those other things, perhaps (ph) describes your feeling, at a distance as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe (whispering). [Silence from [00:24:33] to 00:24:44] And it also occurs to me that, (pause) kind of like how my father's idea of what would constitute success is a constantly moving target, but (pause) I suspect even if I had gone to med school and become a doctor, I still wouldn't have (pause) hit that target. [00:25:03]</p>

<p>I almost feel like (pause) my own standards for comparison keep moving. Because before I started grad school I was thinking you know (pause) I just need to earn a masters degree and that will prove to myself that like (pause) I am not an academic failure. And now it seems completely likely that I will, in fact, earn the masters degree and I've decided you know (pause) it doesn't count because my thesis is kind of pointless, never mind the fact that you know probably 99 percent of masters thesis produced around the country (other chuckling) are pointless bullshit, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . um, yeah, and not to put too fine a point on it and, (audible sigh/pause) I don't know. (Pause) I told you about how, when I was in high school, I had multiple teachers and coaches who said that they expected me to win a Nobel Prize one day? M-hmm, just (emotional) well that 12, 13-year-old [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . kid, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible] [00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But (pause/huffing sigh) I mean even lowering my expectations quite a bit from that I still feel like my (pause), my threshold, for what would count as not as not a failure, like not even a success but just not a failure, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . is (pause) kind of ridiculous, (pause) like (pause) and it doesn't help that I'm friends with some phenomenally successful people. Um, (pause) one person who I was friends with in undergrad, and then we lost touch with each other after we graduated, her last name is [inaudible at 00:26:34] but she [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . was on the cover of "Wired" last year, like (pause) the first woman to be on the cover of "Wired Magazine", good God! That's like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Who reads that] (ph) (chuckling)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, Limor Fried does that apparently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know another friend of mine started his own company and is you know now making seven figures a year. Uh, (pause) and another friend of mine is a published author, just published her third book and has, uh, a contract for another two books to come. [00:27:02]</p>

<p>And (pause) you know all of these brilliant, amazing, talented, successful people, and like (pause) what do I have? I have like a failed career and a degree from a second-tier (ph) university, like what is that? (Audible sigh) [Silence from [00:27:20] to 00:27:30] And I realize there are many, many people who would envy my position academically and professionally (pause) but (emotional/pause/audible sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I noticed you started out by saying, even for you it's a moving target, what constitutes not failing. [00:27:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause). And there are millions of people who would consider you know graduating from Harvard to be a success, in and of itself, but you know (pause) all I can focus on is the fact that I graduated with a C instead of an A average, I don't know. (Pause) Dave and some of my close friends have told me probably hundreds of times that you know Harvard does not give degrees to unqualified students and that if you have a degree it's because you know multiple professors thought you earned it, not (ph) (pause/audible sigh).</p>

<p>And I don't quite believe it, even though there's another part of me that knows rationally, obviously, that's true, right, like (pause) you could maybe fool one or two professors but there's no way you could fool an entire department into [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . giving you a degree.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there's a part of me that really doesn't believe that, that (pause) it feels like I didn't earn my degree, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I didn't learn enough, didn't do enough, (pause) don't deserve it. [00:29:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then apparently really wants to and is very invested, and you need to think about it that way for [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . you (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I then didn't, I've, in fact, never bought a class ring from Harvard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) you know when I was an undergrad, typically you buy your ring your sophomore year and I just [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . didn't have the money for it and my parents and I were (pause) not on speaking terms, so I couldn't ask them [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . to buy it for me. And then I graduated and I felt like I didn't really earn my degree. I graduated late and I didn't finish by spring term after four years, I took a summer term to finish my senior thesis, and I walked a year late with the 2005 Class instead of 2004. So I felt like I didn't really earn it because I graduated late and my thesis kind of sucked and I had bad grades and this, that and the other.</p>

<p>And you know (pause) I was going off to an internship in Germany, which I got through Harvard, when they guaranteed that anyone who had taken at least two years of a foreign language would get a one-year internship in the country where that language was spoken, so I kind of felt like my job wasn't really a real job, and that I would get a ring once I got my first real job. [00:30:10]</p>

<p>And so I came back and I got this job at DeLong, and I was like you know this isn't really a real job. They were kind of desperate for anyone willing to work for what are really crap wages for you know people with degrees from Harvard, and you know this doesn't really count because it's not an architectual job, which is what I really wanted, so once I get a AA job then I'll get a ring (chuckling sigh).</p>

<p>And then I get the AA job at Oruvail (ph), and I can't remember what excuse I used but (pause) didn't get a ring then either. And I just haven't (pause), I don't know, I feel like I (pause) — part of me just wants to like say "screw this" and go (haltingly) buy my damn class ring, because it's really recognizable and would be helpful to have on interviews, but part of me feels like that would be you know taking unfair advantage of the fact that I managed to squeak through. And [overlapping voices] [00:31:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I don't know, it's stupid, I should just buy the damn ring. And I don't know why I haven't [got or even] (ph) — it just feels wrong every time I try to pick the phone to call Justin's and say (whispering) "I want order this ring", (pause) it's ridiculous. I know it's ridiculous, (pause) and yet (pause) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yet it's hard to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm (ph — barely audible). [Silence from [00:31:29] to 00:32:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think that's how you'd feel wearing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Like a fraud, [silence from [00:32:29] to 00:32:38] which is, again, ridiculous, rationally speaking, but (pause) I guess I'm just a ridiculous creature (pause/audible sigh). [Silence from [00:32:45] to 00:32:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why (ph) there is a different level of organization, according to which this makes more sense, and which we don't know yet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, (pause) I don't know (ph — barely audible). [Silence from [00:33:16] to 00:33:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Seems like you can hear] (ph) and you'll sort of start talking about something, and then get to the point where you actually have this like little burst of anger or criticism at yourself, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and then you'll get quiet, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like just that, when you say "you know I guess I'm just an irrational creature".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ridiculous, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I know. [00:34:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . so I'm sorry, "ridiculous" [full stop] (ph) (other, huffing chuckle). You know to (ph) keep going and then you get to something that pisses you off at yourself, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and then stop, does that seem right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Silence from [00:34:17] to 00:34:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bring it up, partly because I think it's worth paying attention to in here, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . and partly because it's got to have something to do with what gets you stuck everywhere else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like the way that kind of will start somewhere over here, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm, m-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . go along, catches something you're angry with yourself about, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . feel it shut down, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . get stuck. [00:35:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay (ph — barely audible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what did you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No, I know you said [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . okay, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . did you have another thought?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just waiting to see where you were going with that, now [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . that you've described the behavior.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, [silence from [00:35:19] to 00:35:36] I guess my point in describing that behavior [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . or at least describing what seems, to me, to be the behavior [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . is to like give us an opportunity to like think about it [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . or reflect on it [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . in hopes that it may become easier to change [overlapping voices] [00:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . or to catch, as you're in the middle [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . right. And I suppose that says something, although I'm not quite sure what it says.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my first reaction to that is, (pause) you know well, of course, I'm not in touch with my emotions because I am just fucked up, and (pause) curl up into nothing needed, (pause) yeah (huffing chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is you know exactly the sort of thing you were just describing (other chuckling) it then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph — barely audible). [Silence from [00:36:34] to 00:36:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, (other audibly sighing) [silence from [00:36:50] to 00:37:01] we have to stop for now, but we can look at that more carefully. I mean when you [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . decide that you're just not in touch with your feelings because you're all fucked up, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph — barely audible0.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that's a little vague. I mean it's also terribly harsh [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . but I kind of wonder what [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph — barely audible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that means.</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know like what kind of all fucked up means not in touch with your feelings, and you know like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . I guess it sounds to me as likely that it's a way of shutting the door [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . on how bad you're really feeling, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (ph — barely audible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . not just self-hating but all sorts of other [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . very painful things. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does make sense. (Pause) You know, I know we have to stop in like (ph) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . a few minutes but, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, continue with the thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . um, (clearing throat) but when I was seeing Chrissy Goodall, like even before the, the tipping point of just her being completely disrespectful about my sexuality and sexual choices, there'd been this stretch of months where pretty much all my sessions followed the same pattern, where I would you know tell her about what I was feeling and she would say, "You know you would never be so cruel to another person." And, "If someone else told you the things you're telling yourself, you wouldn't let them." And, "Why are you being so cruel to yourself?"</p>

<p>And it got really frustrating to me because she never — it was like a broken record and there was no, no insight. Um, and I almost felt like she was trying to, to shame me out of being mean to myself and saying, you know I would never treat someone else like this, I would never treat a child like this, which is true, I wouldn't, [overlapping voices] [00:39:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . (pause/audible sigh) but it just got really, really frustrating, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . the whole you know "you should be nicer to yourself because that's what your, your moral system requires of you because", so I don't know. So I have a pancake on my head [to let her] (ph) but there was never any real explanation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, (pause) I don't know and I keep nudging around this idea that you know there's this kind of perverted megalomania going on, that you know I'm, I'm holding myself to a far higher and harsher standard than I would ever hold another human being to, because somehow I should be more specialer (ph) and stronger and better in sort [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . of everything, and that's kind of messed up and, and kind of, kind of gross when I think about it, that. [00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, I haven't been able to make much progress on my own trying to get passed that, that realization, and certainly haven't made any progress in like deconstructing whatever it is that's going on in my brain that continues to hold me to that absurd just high standard of perfection.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean one sort of off-the-cuff thought that I [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . have is, I can imagine from growing up, like you didn't know who the hell else you possibly could reasonably be [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . that felt worthwhile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And worth like you know of interest, worth [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . caring about, and any of that stuff, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: M-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . aside from you know an approved or successful person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Silence from [00:40:56] to 00:41:05] Well [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . we can just plan to like [inaudible — overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Same time (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [Silence from [00:41:11] to end — 00:41:17]</p>

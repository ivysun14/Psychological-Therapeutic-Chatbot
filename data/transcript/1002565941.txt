<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [PATIENT NAME], how've you been doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  What's new?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, the Patriots  lost the Super Bowl.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you cheerin' for the Patriots?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Darn, that was a great game, wasn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not until the second half it wasn't great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was kind of boring the first half.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was very boring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was, if they played, as a defensive game, which I don't think anybody expected, for the Patriots especially, the highest scoring team in NFL history.  And—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but they still hold the world's record for the, um, for the most undefeated games.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, in a season, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, they were—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, they broke like four records like most touchdown passes in a season.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Most catches, most like thrills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're a phenomenal team.  They've been dominant.  Well, the good thing about football, there's always next year, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that's what [NAME OTHER] says.  The season's over.  Everyone was like feeling bad for [NAME OTHER].  What are ya going to do.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they're such a, they've been such a good team for so long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually, my friends weren't really, um, got [INAUDIBLE], they actually made fun of me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, they were Giants' fans, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He said yesterday, he goes, it's not going to be fun in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, like I have, I have a phone and I'm like I bet everyone's texting me and like saying ah ha and my mom was like somebody, and I, I texted my friend and he's like [INAUDIBLE] and he's like and then he texted me back saying ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, they'll get, they'll get over it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I said yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, other than the Patriots losing the Super Bowl, how've things been going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I really didn't get to sleep until one last night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my gosh.  You were kind of keyed up from the game?  I think a lot of people—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Soda.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Having soda at the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that does it.  All the excitement and the soda.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I told him that would happen, so.  But you know what?  He got up and, he was just so good about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they have to get up so darn early and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to get up even earlier so I could do something, like get ready, 'cause I wasn't really prepared for today—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I didn't get to bed 'til one so I just turned off my alarm clock.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I went down [INAUDIBLE] whatever and he said I'm so tired.  After he got in the shower and out he went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, good for you [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, last time we talked, let me see when it was, it was [DATE] and you were doing really well in school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Except for French.  You were struggling.  And did you end up doing pretty well in other classes?  Do you remember?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Grade wise?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, his grades could've gone up.  He, he didn't do real well grade wise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you remember what he finished with last semester?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he flunked French.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, gosh.  You know what your grades were?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got like a D in math.  And I got like a B in language arts and like two C's in science and history.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so a B two C's, uh, a B, two C's and a D?  Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And what was your other, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got an A in music.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Music, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so one A.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that doesn't really count, 'cause it's like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, it counts.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, well, no, 'cause it's just like a participation pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's, you still get credit for it.  Those are good thing, yeah, so.  And so do you have to take French over this semester, then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  So it's disappointing, 'cause at the conference, the teacher, the French teacher said that, uh, he had a real gift for language and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did like, I just, I guess I got [INAUDIBLE] my friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So are you, are you going to drop French then or are you going to try—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was just one, uh, semester.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I see.  That's right.  In high school you could take more if you want probably.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, right.  She would like to have seen, she would like to see him, um, pursue languages because she said he's got the talent.  Nothin' happened.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I had [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, um, how's your mood been overall?  You feelin', except for this weekend, you been feelin—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This, this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty happy or sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just today was okay—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Today's a Monday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it was bad, that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about last week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Except for the weekends—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's very—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Except for weekends, I like to stay up late.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's normal.  Do you feel like you have enough energy during the day most of the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What are you signing up for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] we did during, I, I was [INAUDIBLE] joining badminton during [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good job.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he's in P E right now.  What are you signing up for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, basketball.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, cool.  When's it start?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	At school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have tryouts Monday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Practice, tryouts [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like they—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They all make, well, you explain it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's like, like a bunch of kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They all just go up as a team.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But only like, like twenty of them, like one third's back up I guess, one third is defense or something, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You either make this, this—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then if you can't make that team, you go to play intramurals.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which, no matter what, even if you try out, you have to like pretty much go out for that, if you're on for basketball.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Everyone will be on a team.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Either on the competitive team or on the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you get to play.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's the, that's the way it should be, 'cause all kids should be able to play.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what happened in football.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, I'm really proud of him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, yeah.  And what grade are you in now, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seventh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Seventh.  So you're right in the middle of middle school, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't like being a teenager, 'cause everyone says that kids, it be, is the toughest, but teenagers are because they're right in the middle of adult and kids.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like you feel like you're in between?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I'm [INAUDIBLE] mature stuff, but I still like a lot more kid like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He still—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's important.  Hopefully, hopefully never lose that, [PATIENT NAME]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's important.  So, are you enjoying the things you're doing right now like badminton?  Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Art, he's doing a lot of sketching.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, cool.  That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I drew a hot air balloon last night 'cause I couldn't get to sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good idea.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I had to take him to get some supplies so [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, excellent.  And how's your appetite been, pretty normal or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And have you been able to concentrate okay in school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Except when I was tired, like today.  My head just fell asleep during, uh, history.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Um, have you been feeling nervous or anxious about anything lately?  Not worrying about stuff too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was like a year ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I just like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME], I think maybe you got past that one, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, we all have challenges in life that come at different times and some people rise to the occasion and get past it, and some people, you know, stop in their life and you've risen to the occasion and you got past it and I'm really proud of you for how you handled it, so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, you just have to keep tellin' him to believe in that.  You just kept reassuring him and me and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I could do a graph on how it, my life feels like.  So, it's like going up, up, up, up, down, and over the hump and it stayed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you know, they got, everybody in their own life has those times where they go down and again, some people, if they keep goin', keep tryin', they pull out of those.  The only thing you can do that will mess things up is if you quit on yourself.  You never want to do that 'cause when you do, you're stuck in that hole and you can't get out, so.  You kept tryin' and kept fightin' and you got through it so that's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of support, from the school and between [NAME OTHER] and you and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, are you still seein' [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, don't really need to, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what about medication?  Do you use the Klonopin wafers at all any more?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not, I'm not, unless I'm having a really bad day, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I get off a break—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's for like a week or two—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it's pretty rare and infrequent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't even know the last time you took—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took one, I think I took one at the end of Thanksgiving.  And I got rid of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that's why—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that was even before, in October or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took one after Thanksgiving break.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, it's been a few months ago.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He definitely, he definitely has a hard time after like a long weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, and his pals at school have been so great at being there for—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last week, like, it was like five days of school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you did great going back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like, 'cause like, the two year old we have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's like um, she, uh, has Down syndrome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my dad has her, gone to work, like Thursday, I was, no, it was like two weeks ago—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My, my dad hasn't been going into the office lately because mom's been sick and I'm kind of getting it now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so that's had an affect on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my dad had to get to the office so he's just like, [PATIENT NAME], um, I need your help to, um, watch [NAME OTHER] for me and get [NAME OTHER] to school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s the little one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And get [NAME OTHER] to the bus stop and stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	While he goes to work until like twelve and then he'd come home and help me until [NAME OTHER] got home and then I would go out and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I did that for like two days—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I had like [INAUDIBLE] day, so I didn't get back to school until Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You felt like, you felt like you were just trying to catch up on school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was just, I, I missed like all my history days and all my math days 'cause I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you said today the teachers have been great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  They've been really lenient because I missed so many days of school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, good, I'm glad they're being supportive and helping you out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	On the right track.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, [PATIENT NAME], are you having any problems with the Fluvoxamine?  Any side effects you can tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Still can't swallow, but he's trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you find any tricks that work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sherbet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's just, he still take sit in the sherbet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  If that works, that's perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, my mom and dad, like, they like, uh, I like take all my sherbet because I don't want the other people eating, so I put them in the bottom drawer of the freezer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That night, and I go, I can't see them, so we'll just buy more—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, and then I put them back under and I'll go oh, there it's gone and so we, like I have stockpiled sherbet.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The little, they're little sherbet cups.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I just take them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's perfect.  So you just put the pills in the sherbet and swallow it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I, I crush them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Crush them okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I was telling him today I don't know the last, he's, he's so, um, independent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like he does his, like the night before school, he has his clothes up in the bathroom, all in a pile, he does this with all his stuff.  I don't know the last time I saw him take his medicine.  He just does it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the hallway.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, he gets everything in order.  He puts his backpack where it needs to go.  He—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's really good, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very, very, very, his [AGE] sister could learn a lot.  He's just very organized and, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I'm not neat in my locker.  I'm forgetful.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe not the locker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He said maybe not the locker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And forgetful.  Like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But that's why I tell, it's great you do all the things the way you do them.  You get your clothes lined up the night before and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I got, I was so forgetful during gym, I just wanted, uh, to get gym over with 'cause my shoes smell terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And uh, it makes my, uh, like the entire locker smell.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, I'm sure, a bunch of guys, smelly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure, I'm just sayin', that happens in gym.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does.  And so like, I have to like rush to get them, like, off my feet and then put them in my locker so it doesn't smell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so, I forgot one day, I took off my shoes—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and put them in my locker, and I forgot to take them off my shorts—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I just put my jeans over them—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And just put them and I didn't notice I had my shorts on until after I got home at like six o'clock at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I totally forgot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	At least they got home for cleaning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right, that's a pretty good thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was only there for like two days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  It sounds like you're doing terrific.  Probably as well as any time since I've known you, so and I think you're still making progress, you're still drawin' and getting stronger.  So, any questions or problems I didn't ask you about that you want to talk about?  Nothing?  [NAME OTHER] any concerns?  Or questions—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, he's doin' great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Except, he did, we were talking about the tapering off and what not and I think we had all agreed that he should just take that at school, at least in the school year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Yeah, I agree.  That's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's no reason to not.  There's no harm to not being on them or, I mean [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's no advantage to getting off them now and there are some risks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whereas if we wait even until the summer—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There are minimal risks and, uh, so it's much better to do something.  Make a change like that in summer months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then, once I get to high school, then I might [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, [PATIENT NAME], you know, we can see what works for you.  Every, every person's different.  Some kids get off of them, they feel fine, they never need it.  Some kids get off and it feels good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt like I didn't get—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Let him finish what he's saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And over the summer, if you decide you want to try getting off, you don't feel as good, we can even get you back on it before school starts again in the fall.  So we can, in the summer we can kind of reassess and see what you want to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt like I didn't have pressure in middle school, or, not middle school, um, elementary—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I, like I got so used to it and I'm getting like used to it now, so I, I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I feel really comfortable there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I, I, it feels like I don't need it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'll tell you what, all the kids I've ever talked to, including my own kids, have told me is high school is even easier than middle school.  Not easier academically, but there's less pressure they feel because kids are nicer than one another and they're not so into—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Mature.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're more mature.  And teachers treat you like an adult more and they say it's just more fun in high school, even than middle school, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, not really because like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's more freedom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In high school, like if you miss, like if you don't turn in your assignment—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he's saying not academically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But just as far as the pressure, peers [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Socially and all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you'll have known all those people all that much longer and he's got such a nice group of friends.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that helps, too.  Yeah, having friends to go to high school with.  What high school are you going to go to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [DEIDENTIFIED].  Over [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good high school.  So, yeah, I'm sure you'll do really well, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My sister thinks so.  She went to it and then, um, she uh got—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what he's saying, everyone's different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, everybody's different, but I think you're going to do well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She had her issues.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, [PATIENT NAME], let's do this, let's keep doin' what you're doin' for now, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, the only question I have is once we check back again, it's been a couple months this time, we can go a couple months, or we can go three or four months, even 'til you're out of school a few months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait, wait, what's the next month.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or to the end of the school year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's next month?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	March.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the month after that's April?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	April.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We should go for [DATE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You go for May?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we can check in in April if you want to, if you like to, or we can wait 'til even 'til you're out of school, and can call sooner if you need to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doin' great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll probably just wait until like June.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't we schedule when you're out of school and if anything comes up, you can always call, your mom can call me—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can meet sooner if we need.  Does that sound okay?  I don't think we're going to make any changes before then, so.  All right.  Now, do you know [NAME OTHER] when school's out?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, I just know May.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's it's, it sort of, it changes because, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Snow days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Snow days, it makes the school longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, do you want to schedule something end of May or early June do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Early June.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, the, er, first week or June or something like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that works.  That looks like that's going to be, Monday, [DATE].  So, sometime that week?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That sounds fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you want to do a morning or afternoon appointment?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We don't want to do early in the summer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait, what time is early?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I start eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, what would you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can start as early as eight or we can—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm not bringing you to eight in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mom wants to sleep in.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's my summer, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll, I'll make late.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	How about late morning, then you'll have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Late morning</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Late one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to do, hum—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see what we got here.  We can do like a Wednesday, [DATE], like at eleven o'clock is an option?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That sounds great.  And you'll be home in time for lunch and an afternoon of fun.  I don't know what we're doing this summer yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] cruise.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's the [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On a cruise.  Everyone should go on a cruise 'cause you [INAUDIBLE], what cruise does the whole family have?  I mean like dad's always stay—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's a problem, I have to pay for this thing.  My mom's turning [AGE] this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's always been neat, you and [NAME OTHER], or me, you, [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and dad—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know you want dad—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Has always stayed home.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like when me and [NAME OTHER] were in the hospital and [NAME OTHER]'s like, like [AGE], we all went with dad, too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was fun, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but now we haven't gone since [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, [NAME OTHER], it looks like we should be fine on refills, too, but if there's any problem give me a call.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay, yeah, I haven't even looked at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We should be good 'til September, it looks like, so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's the card.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And again, if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to call.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  If we show up in the wrong month, just redirect me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With a toddler around again, you know, it kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Throws things off, doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's darling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  How long are you going to have her for, you know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I talked to the case worker today and she said it's probably going to be a little while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  She's got, as he mentioned, she's got Down's so we're probably the right family and the right fit for her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Also, I uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's in my room—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He gave up his room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well, that was nice of you, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He had some options and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He picked to go—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I didn't have any options.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You did have one.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it was either go downstairs or share with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That wasn't going to happen.  You weren't going to stay with him, huh.  What do you say, thank you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, good seeing you.  Keep up the good work, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And wearin' shorts in snow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I noticed that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's why I like him.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT: (4-minute silence) I don't really want to begin because if I do I have
to talk about my boots and I just feel ridiculous over the fact that
they're still bo—, the, whether I wear them or not is still bothering me. 
And I keep trying to put it out of my mind so I don't have to think about
it or talk about it.  After I left, just right around the time when often
it, something will come into my mind that probably was something I wasn't
recognizing earlier during the time I'm here — it happened again last
night.  And it, I, I don't know, in a way I was getting at it when I was
trying to just tell why I didn't want to have the boots on and why I
thought it was wrong to have them on.  But it just seemed suddenly very
clear to me that essentially it was a fear on, of getting the couch dirty. 
And I don't know, just, not even that people take boots off when they come
inside or lie down, it was just simply the, a fear of, of getting it dirty
or, or incurring your displeasure or anger or something because I had on
something I should have taken off.  And sometimes just the fact that I have
shoes on has bothered me.  So it seems more from that reason.</p>

<p>So today I wanted to keep them on but I couldn't.  Because every time
I thought of keeping them on I, all I could think was that they were
something that had been dirtied by being out on the street and so forth,
and that I just couldn't stand the thought of keeping them on.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And you say you were very strongly aware when you were quiet at the
beginning here today that you didn't want to say what, the things you've
just said, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because it just seems ridiculous to.  (Pause) Now I feel as if
I'm making a huge problem of something that's very simple and in a way I'm
beginning to hate them because of this.  (Pause) And something else that
I'm aware I make more of a problem or diff—, more difficult than I need to
but I was thinking today of a feeling I had last night when I was working
on my paper, whatever.  It's not really a paper but my assignment.  And I
was even aware at the time, too, that it was almost as if I were just
sitting there making it take longer than it really needed to.  And or, or
at least I, I would work for a while and then I would, I just wouldn't be
able to force myself to work again for a while.  And I was trying to see
why I was doing that, whether it was because I wanted a more difficult job
because then I could feel better at having done it or get more sympathy
from MSCZ or, I don't know.  But then when I thought of how I felt it
seemed more that I was so afraid of, of not doing the right thing that it
just took an awful lot of energy just to actually finally commit myself. 
And so I'd go in spurts and then I'd have to stop for a while and finally
I'd feel the passage of time strongly enough so I'd make myself go on a
little bit.  And then I'd stop again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose, well, I was saying it yesterday, that the way I sort of
mangle english is part of this inability just to come out directly with
whatever it is I want to say.  And sometimes when I reread what I've
written I can't believe I wrote it, it's just so confused.  And I was also
thinking about well, in terms of my reaction to your question on what I had
said when I was talking about flinch and filch and how I had used the words
incorrectly and just the fact that your question made me feel very
uncomfortable and very uncertain.  And very often when I'm in conversations
with other people, any type of person really, if it's a person I know well
I, I will feel angry and defensive and if it's a person I don't feel we—,
know well, I'll feel very uncertain and much more tentative in the way I
talk.  And I just do talk in a very tentative way and an imprecise way and
—</p>

<p>ANALYST: And which way did you feel about me, then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I felt that I must have been wrong again.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I mean, but angry or —?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, very —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Tentative?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of, well, embarrassed that I might have made that same mistake
again, or, or another mistake and sort of stupid.  Partly, too, because it
just seemed — no, I guess that wouldn't make sense.  I was just going to
say it would seem that at this point I should know if I had made a mistake
(laughs) whether — but then I wouldn't have made that mistake so that —
well annoyed at myself if I had made another mistake with it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you feel you had made a mistake here, that that's what I was
asking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I looked it up when I got home (laughs) because I wasn't sure. 
But I, I was wondering if I had yesterday when you asked what word I had
used.  And all you were asking for was the word, comb.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I thought that meant if, that you couldn't understand what I said
because it didn't make sense with the word I'd used previously.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So in this case you were not angry with me but angry with yourself,
feeling you were stupid, you had done something wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  Well, in a way that's how I always react when anybody asks me a
question.  Practically any time I am asked a question I will react that
way.  But it will either, it will either come out that I will become very
tentative and unsure or I will be very defensive but essentially the
feeling is the same, that well, mabye I am wrong or maybe I have done
something silly.  (Pause) And so, I, I was just wondering too if that's why
I sometimes have a habit of talking very fast and not really enunciating
very clearly.  Because I don't, I want people to guess so in case I have
made a mistake they, they'll give me the benefit of the doubt.  But if they
ask me to repeat a word they just didn't understand I'll immediately become
very upset that, again, I had made some error.  I think I even do the, I
talk that way here when I don't feel too certain about what I'm talking
about and how to express it or if I don't want to say it really.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And in a way, in a way it's the same kind of thing that happens when I
sense a criticism from my, uhm, headmaster.  And indirectly it happened
again today.  And it might just be he, it was again a question of whether
or not we're moving fast enough in the material.  And I, I just interpret
it as, he's criticizing me and the other teacher that we're not doing our
job and he might just be questioning, "isn't it, is it possible for you to
go a little faster?"  But then from some of the things he asks, again
indirectly — I, I never speak to him about it personally — it would seem
to me that we just basically disagree on what children of the age I'm
teaching should be doing.  And whenever anything like this happens — today
I was told that he feels we're not moving ahead rapidly enough and he wants
children reading at an earlier stage and so forth.  And I, I just think I
disagree with his approach.  But then I begin to think, well, maybe I am
wrong and do I dare go out on a limb because what if I am wrong?  And then
there's just something I can't put my finger on, but that bothers me about
getting any kind of displeasure from him.  And I'll keep thinking, well, it
must be because I don't want to have to go through the process of looking
for a new job and it's comfortable to stay where you already know the
routines and the limits and so forth.  And I'm sure that's a part of it but
I'm not sure if that's it entirely.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And another feeling I had when I was rereading my assignment: uhm,
so—, sometimes I would already see things that I would correct or a new
thought will occur to me and I, I will be terribly frustrated that I can't
include it because it just, it seems to me it would make all the difference
if I could, which is pretty ridiculous.  (Silence) And it's funny because
sometimes I'll have a feeling about needing to include these thoughts that
occur to me after I finished the paper.  And, and this need will be strong
enough so that I'll, I might even add them after I receive the paper back
again.  And then I never look at the paper again.  But I somehow have to
have it written down.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was thinking about when I was coming down here, that, what we
would be doing in class today.  And we'll be working with clay in a
different way but we'll still be working with it.  And I for some reason
have built up this feeling about clay and I just don't want to work with
it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I suppose in a way this feeling comes from the fact that when you
do finally end up with something that you've made out of clay, it's
completely yours, that clay was, had absolutely nothing when you started
with it and any, most of the other things we've done so far, at least, have
had some quality of their own which could be pleasing, for instance color
in, in the different paper we've used or paints.  Just in itself it had
something that was pleasing.  And clay is just absolutely nothing until you
make it into something.  And I know I've felt a certain well, just a
complete lack of confidence that I can judge anything I do do.  And I don't
really even know how to work with it and how to make it into something so I
just feel completely unsure about it.  (Pause) And I suppose I'm afraid
partly, I don't think this is entirely it, but that in fact that I can't
work it or do much with it so that I can feel I like what I do, that this
inability suggests that I, I can't create.  (15-minute silence) (About a
half a minute before she speaks there is the sound of some movement.)</p>

<p>I've never felt quite this way about saying something before.  And I
kept hoping in a way, you'd ask me what had happened because I wanted you
to make me talk.  I just didn't feel I could and yet I wanted to be the one
to start too because it just seemed that I would have lost something if I
couldn't be the one to start.  But I, I've had so many reactions just in my
thoughts but I was, I began by thinking of how I asked MSCZ at home what
word I could use when I wanted to talk about bowel movements.  And he said
the, one of the words that I had been searching for, which was feces.  And
then it just occurred to me that part of this whole feeling about talking
about this type of thing is that I'd, well, I guess I associate it with
something dirty and ugly and just that word, feces, brings an image in my
mind of something horribly ugly and unpleasant.  And then it just seemed
sort of strange to me because I'd never thought I had reacted that way to
it before.  In fact often, after I've had a bowel movement I have to sort
of control myself from looking at it.  For some reason I have this urge to
see what I've done.  And I also was surprised at this real feeling that I
just couldn't make myself talk about it that was much stronger than
whenever I've wanted to talk about intercourse or anything like that.  And
I'd always thought that I'd find intercourse the hardest thing to talk
about.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I thought of the word, defecation.  And I thought well, now I
can talk about it, that's the word I was looking for.  And then I became
very unsure that it was the right word.  And I felt, well, I'll have to
check and make sure it's the right word before I use it.  And I just, I
kept going back and forth thinking I'm about to talk and then I'd have all
sorts of reasons why I couldn't begin.</p>

<p>ANALYST: "Defecation" doesn't seem as dirty as the other words, hm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that and it, sometimes I think I was looking for the word for
the process and that was the only word I thought would fit at times when
I'd need it.  I suppose too, it didn't seem as dirty.  But I had the
strongest reaction to "feces" and I don't know why.  Because I hardly have
ever used it.  And somehow my mind always goes from clay to this. 
(Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

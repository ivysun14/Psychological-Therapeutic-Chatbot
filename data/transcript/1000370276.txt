<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) When I got home yesterday it, ah, suddenly occurred to me that I had, it seemed as if, in, uhm, in the back of my mind while I was here was always this feeling of comparison between myself and my assistant, that I'd been doing lately.  And today I found that I was suddenly, out of the blue, at least it seemed that way to me, I was thinking that I'm not as good as the person I replaced.  And when somebody replaces me they'll probably be better too and, uhm, sort of suit the person, the supervisor I have more.  And then I was thinking about it when, when I first came in here and, I don't know, it just seemed to be, just talking about this feeling of competition didn't seem to be as much on the point as other things I was saying but it suddenly struck me that this kind of comparison and feeling that I was inferior to my assistant that I've been feeling lately or that she's a lot better in a lot of things than I am, uhm, seems to have come mostly after my supervisor praised something that she'd done.  Or at least it's certainly been more intense afterwards.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, I just realized that today when she took another group painting to do the same thing she'd done before and then, then I saw the results, I was thinking to myself, well, they're not really that much different from anything I've ever done.  And I somehow felt I had to justify to myself and then almost go to my supervisor and justify my approach as opposed to hers.  And so it all seems to be stirred up, anyway, by this feeling that she's doing what my supervisor expects and I'm not.  Or that, because she praised one thing that she did it means that there's nothing to praise that I'm doing so far.  (Silence) And it's funny, too, because sometimes I feel strong enough so that I can really encourage her to, to contribute her ideas to what we do in the classroom and I'm eager for them and, and I start out feeling that we, it doesn't really matter who thinks of what but we can both work together on it.  And then, as soon as she contributes a good idea I get all upset inside, as if somehow I'm in a much more vulnerable position.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just keep comparing the 2 of us and it just, everything seems to point to this feeling I have that she copes better with situations than I do, no matter what the situation is.  (Pause) And I, well, I don't know why it bothers me so much.  I suppose there are many reasons but right now, one that seems to me is a reason it's bothering me is that the things she does that I feel often I don't do, that they're all things that I know are good things to do but, despite my knowledge, I still can't seem to do them.  (Pause) And anyway I suppose I just want to feel I know a little bit more than she and teach a little bit better and handle situations better. (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I was thinking, too, of the, well, it's practically a fear I have, I guess, of making a mistake in front of her or admitting I have or that I don't know something.  So I'm always pretending that I know more than I do or that I'm more sure of myself.  But if she makes a mistake, I have this, I have to fight myself all the time not to point out every single one of them to her.  Or, if she could have just done a slightly different job and it might have turned out a little bit better, it's my tendency to want to tell her all these things, sort of overwhelm her, I suppose, so it builds me up.  (Silence) I also began, just now, thinking about MSCZ and how I suppose it's a similar thing as with my assistant, I find it, been finding it very hard to, I don't know, really think about him or feel close to him unless he sort of leaves me alone.  And (pause) I think I just want him there for companionship right now or as somebody to talk to once in a while.  Sometimes I don't even think I want him there for companionship.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And in a way, uhm, I was just thinking of my reaction last night when he indicated he wanted to have intercourse.  And at first I just, I knew he might really want to but it just seemed as if he were doing it to tease me because it seemed to me very clear that he should have understood I didn't.  And he wouldn't be acting that way unless he wanted to tease me.  And then the comparison just came to my mind of, when, just the last 2 weeks, when he has wanted to have intercourse my, I'd feel, well, how can I think about — I have to think about him if I do and how can I do that right now.  And it seemed very much like the reaction I had when a friend of mine called who'd come in from out of town and wanted to have lunch with me.  (Clears throat) And again my reaction at first was, how can I sort of readjust myself so I can think about her too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So what did happen last night, then?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  He got mad and we didn't have intercourse (laughs).  (Clears throat) But it upset me.  And sometimes when he gets up—, gets mad, then I will begin to think about him and will, I'll end up being able to have intercourse.  And (sighs) I don't know, it's sort of, it takes that for me to even begin to be able to think about him.  Because I, I felt more today that I'm in a more considerate mood toward him than I have been for a long time, just in considering, well, maybe he'd like it this way or perhaps he'd like that.  Sometimes it, I don't even think in that way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And there's something about it, too, I suppose why I think he's teasing me.  Because he's always, when he starts out like this, in good humor and, uhm, he keeps insisting I really want to, and, I don't know, perhaps in a way I do but it seems what I really want is to have him ask me to have intercourse.  But then I want to be able to say no in the end, after playing around for a while and (clears throat) even if it's just protesting for a while, in the end I want him to accept that we're not going to.  But then sometimes when he does, that upsets me so I really don't know what I do want.  (Pause) But I think very often I have the, my initial reaction is what I recall I had last night, of feeling, just simply feeling, well, I can't, it doesn't, I can't even think about what I want or don't want, I just simply can't do it.  And I just feel I have to curl up into a ball and close myself up and what I can't do is open myself up, even to putting my arms around him.  Sometimes I, that's the hardest part. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it just seems that there's (clears throat) I don't know, something in the way that, some obstacle I can't get beyond because once something in the way that some obstacle I can't get beyond because once I get beyond it, I enjoy having intercourse.  And it's a matter of getting beyond it and how much getting beyond it affected, I suppose, my attitude at that moment.  But, I don't know, it's almost that it's something that has nothing to do with having intercourse.  Because I can have such varied attitudes toward it, depending upon, I don't know, the mood I'm in or the state of mind I'm in.  (Silence) And thinking about it right now, it seems, more than it ever has before, that intercourse is just symbolic of something for me and it's something else I'm afraid of or don't want.  It's something bigger anyway, maybe a fear of letting myself love somebody because of the feeling that I might not be able to, I suppose, create love in that person for me and, and keep it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And it seems that I — I was thinking how can somebody love me the way I act so much of the time.  And I suppose I act the way I do a lot of the time because I believe that I'm really a pretty disagreeable person.  (Pause) And it made me think of the reputation that I had in my family.  I don't know how much I have it now but, and I don't know when I got it or how much having it made me act the way I did throughout high school.  But in any case, I was seen as the disagreeable person in my family and it was just assumed I was going to be.  So after a while I did feel caught in a role that was given to me or expected of me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was thinking back to how so often I have to make MSCZ angry at me or in some way unhappy when he wants to have intercourse before I'll agree to it or I'll ask him when he withdraws.  And I suppose it's, I can only reach out to him when I'm feeling guilty for having hurt him or, well, hurt him, I guess.  And it's so often the case when I, I'm just thinking now generally, I don't really think of people until I feel I've somehow wronged them or ignored them in a way that might be upsetting them.  And then I'll — or if I'm feeling guilty about something I did.  And then I become very nice and thoughtful.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was, it just seems when I'm thinking about when I'm nice to people, even if it isn't from a feeling of guilt, it almost always seems that I've somehow thought that there's something in it for me, that there's some motive, which when I think about it now, seems to be sort of a horrible way to relate to people, that I'll benefit from being nice in some way.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I suppose it just simply is that I practically always put myself first.  Because I began thinking of relationships with people that are somewhat colored by the fact that I worked out something I think I'll get out of it but then I can honestly enjoy them for what they are.  But somehow, there's always this quality that I've put myself first and I'll consider myself before them.  And it seems to be very rare when I've been able to feel the other way and considered somebody before me or just simply that I didn't seem to be important to even think of what I might want because the other pers—, what was happening to the other person was more important.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

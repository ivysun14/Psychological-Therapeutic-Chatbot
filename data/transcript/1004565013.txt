<p>CLIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry I'm late. How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Sorry. I had big plans to go — since I hurt my back last week I haven't been to work out. I had big plans to go work out this morning, but of course it didn't happen. A little disappointing, but what can you do?</p>

<p>I've been working this week for another family. Well, the family that I work for, they went to the City for the week. When they decided to go on their vacation, it was approached to me as like, "We'd love for you to come too." They go to her sister's apartment, which is a one-bedroom apartment, and I sleep on the couch and they'll sleep in her sister's bedroom. [00:04:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds comfy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's cozy. It's so lovely. I'm a person who really appreciates her own space — really, really likes her own space — so I wasn't dying to do it, but I wasn't dying to take the week off unpaid either, because those were my two choices. So there's a family that works around the corner. Remember when I did the nanny share? How could we forget? So I knew that she was still in a pinch. I texted her and I said, "I don't know if you're looking for care this week, but I might be available." She needed somebody to work, which worked out great for me. She does four 12-hour days, and then Fridays off, so it's been long. [00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you have to work more than 12-hour days because she has to go back and forth to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She goes out of town. So she goes for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so it's just the dad in town, and then today she'll work from home. So I just work 12-hour days and then she works whatever she does, and he does — yeah, so they maybe probably work like ten. So yeah, it's been long. Makes me feel really bad for their kids when I think about it, because they only see their parents for 45 minutes a day. Their dad on the day that — I get there at 7:15 and they've been awake for maybe like half an hour, and then he gets home at 7:15 at night, and they go to bed at 7:30. [00:05:55]</p>

<p>Anyway, these girls are a handful. They are difficult. The older one — I know them because I've been seeing them for two years now, or a year and a half (inaudible) I think. I know that with their mom they throw tantrums and stuff. I figured they would be different with babysitters, but that's not the case. It has been a challenge, but I'm kind of loving it. It's really stressful in the moment, but I (pause) — it's like — I definitely know I used to be better at this. So it's like, "Come on," trying to get myself back into it and get myself refocused. [00:06:45]</p>

<p>Because yesterday the older one had, I mean, the biggest tantrum I think I've seen in years, over not wanting to get to wear a certain thing. And we had to get to school. We had to go. And she was screaming to the point where there was — and she kept saying like, "I don't feel good. You need to make me feel better." That was her thing. She needed an adult to — which I wasn't about to come down, you know. I had to leave the situation for a minute, for myself and for her, and try to regroup. Then it was like, "All right, we're going to make this a game and set the timer." You know, it was a whole game after that.</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't know where I'm going with this. Just that I know I used to be much better at my job, and I feel like — it was frustrating seeing that I know that I could have handled these situations better years ago, but I feel like I've been lazy. Because the girls that I watch now are really easy in the sense that I've been with them for almost three years, so we know the routine and we know each other and we know — everyone knows what to expect. [00:07:56]</p>

<p>I'm just not as creative anymore. I'm not as — I don't put the effort in that I used to, and I'm just kind of — I'm like, "Come on, you know what to do here." And they're really good girls, so they listen. But I know that I would have been able to do a better job at handling those meltdowns a few years ago, which was frustrating. Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with that.</p>

<p>I was taking it really personally at first. Like when she was freaking out, when she was having her meltdown, I was taking it really personally, like, "I'm a terrible person." Then I brought her to school, and I pulled the teacher aside, who I know because she's also Sadie's teacher, the girl that I watch, and I said, "Valerie, I need some suggestions. I don't know what to do. Does she do this at school?" Valerie said, "No. It's so strange when her mom said that, because she doesn't do that at school." [00:08:57]</p>

<p>I was talking to Valerie about it for a while. And Valerie didn't say anything in particular that made me feel any better, just that this is what happens with this little girl at home. It was this realization like, "This isn't me. This is just — this little girl has had a different caretaker every week for the last two months." It was just like, "This isn't personal. This is just how she behaves in her environment, and she doesn't know what to expect because it's somebody different all the time." I think I need to do that in more situations, where it's like, "This isn't personal." This is just how certain — even though she's a four-year-old kid, I feel like that can go for a lot of other — that applies for so many other scenarios. Some people just act certain ways in certain environments, because that's life. I don't know. So it was a good kind of realization for a minute. Yeah, I don't know. [00:10:04]</p>

<p>The other preschool teacher who was in this class contacted me last week. She's also moving to Concord and she had been trying to get my contact info, I thought just to be friends when we moved there. She wrote me an e-mail saying that she's not having much luck finding a teaching job, but what she's done in the past is run small preschool groups out of her home, like four mornings a week with a group of three to four-year-olds, and would I be interested in helping her do that? So I'm meeting with her this afternoon to talk about it. I have a lot of reservations about it. Chris is really excited, like thinks it's great, like jobs aren't falling into people's laps these days. [00:10:52]</p>

<p>I am excited about it also because the schedule is really — it would be three or four mornings and it's this woman that I know. But I am nervous about — I really did want a little bit of a break from working with kids for a little bit. I just don't know that I should necessarily pass — I mean she's still applying to other jobs. So I'm just going to meet with her this afternoon. There are some logistical things that I really want to be clear on before I even go — like she said something about under the table, but I want to make sure that she's going to get licensed and stuff like that that makes me kind of — there are certain things that I need to ask about. But I still don't know what I feel about it. (pause) [00:11:53]</p>

<p>I mean, my gut says I don't want to be working with kids, but then the other part of me is thinking like, "Well, if you're really up front and honest with her, and you say that you're probably trying to start a family, and then if that could happen then you're only really available for eight months at the most." (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>Then it's like, "Well, what else am I going to do?" So then I go back and forth about these other things. It's like, "Well, I talked about getting a waitressing job at a breakfast restaurant, and if I'm huge and pregnant am I going to be wanting to waitress at a breakfast — like getting up at five a.m. and going to waitress?" Or I could get a job at an office, but every job that I've been looking at, even for secretary positions they want people with a college degree, which is so unbelievable to me. So I don't know. [00:12:53]</p>

<p>I've been looking into best careers for people without a college degree, and it's like elevator mechanic, just things that I don't think would really work for me. So I don't know. I have to meet with this woman [and really see.] (ph) The thing about it is too — there are some things in my job that I don't like now. Part of it is being alone all the time. I feel like I'm isolated and lonely, and this wouldn't be that case because I'd be with this other woman. And it's really short hours. I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud. [00:13:52]</p>

<p>And it's not that relationship that I'm just starting to really — it's starting to ugh (ph) me out. Just where you feel like you're this weird role in somebody else's life. I feel like I'm transplanted into somebody's life for a certain amount of time each day, and then I'm taken out and put back in mine. That feeling just — it's starting to — I'm really starting to not like it. I don't know what better word for it. So that wouldn't exist. (pause) [00:14:50]</p>

<p>So for the weekend my girlfriends came down, my girlfriends who I went to high school with. One of my friends' husband was out of town, and so she said, "Come down. We'll have a slumber party and it'll be great." So my closest friend, Chrissie, came from Chicago, and then our friend Devorah came from Concord, and we all hung out. It was really nice. It was really nice. We've all definitely changed a lot, but it still feels really similar when we all get together.</p>

<p>The weekend before this I had talked to my friend Trish, the one who lives here whose husband was out of town. She's my oldest friend. Our moms went to high school together, and even during everything that went on in high school, Trish and I always stayed — she always was talking to me and everything. Trish and I just have a different sort of dynamic. [00:15:55]</p>

<p>When we had been out two weekends ago, I had said to her — I don't know how it came up, but I said, "You know, I've been thinking a lot about everything that went on in high school, and I just still sometimes feel like I'm trying to make up for it, or feel like it's still just something I hold on to, and I still feel desperate to portray a different image of myself to you guys, almost on a constant basis." She told me that she hasn't thought of me that way in years, and that — we just had this really nice conversation about it. It felt really great to hear her say, "I don't think of you that way, and yeah, you've had a lot of problems and you were really uncertain — you were like unpredictable, but I don't see you that way anymore." It felt really great, so it kind of gave me this — [00:16:58]</p>

<p>She wasn't really the one — I sensed we didn't have anything that was really bad go on between us. She wasn't really the one that I needed to — I mean, it still existed between the two of us, but I really needed to talk to the rest of the girls. One of them wasn't here because she's in med school in a different state. Since it went so well, I kind of felt more confident going in, so towards the end of the night, I brought it up with everybody. I just said — I don't know. I brought it up kind of abruptly, and just kind of threw myself into it because I didn't know how to ease myself into this one. [00:17:44]</p>

<p>I don't remember exactly what I said, but I said, "I've been thinking a lot about it, and I'm just still really hurt and still really hang on to a lot of the stuff that happened. I feel that I wasn't really treated the best when we were growing up, and I'm kind of resentful of that, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I still feel like maybe you guys see me that way sometimes, and I still feel this need to pretend to you guys that everything is great and cheery and lovely, because I feel like you guys see me as so damaged and such a problem child that I have to put this thing on for you." They both — Chrissie and Devorah reiterated what Trish had said. "Look, we don't see you that way at all anymore. You've changed and grown, and you're such a great person now." Said a lot of stuff that made me uncomfortable, because having that much praise thrown on me always feels fake. [00:18:42]</p>

<p>Then I wanted to talk more specifically about the stuff that went on in high school, just to get it off my chest so that I could say it and then move on from it. So I just said — I don't even know what happened [in there] (ph) but I said something, and I said that night — Devorah, my girlfriend, she was really open and honest, and really said, "You know, you just scared me. The decisions you were making scared me, and I thought you were making these choices that you could never take back, and everything in your life seemed so unpredictable and so — it just scared me."</p>

<p>I said, "I felt the exact same — that's how I felt about my own home life, and then the choices I was making with us as friends, and the choices I was making with guys. I was feeling those same ways." She said, "I know, but as your friend it's hard — as a teenager, as a kid, you don't know what to do, so I just had to cut you off because I didn't — your choices were so scary to me." And I could understand that. You know, it makes sense. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>But they didn't know about one of the things that had happened. It must have been — there was a night at a party — I don't know — like everything kind of hit the fan, and one of the things that happened was there was a guy friend of ours, and he was really pissing me off. He kept talking about how hot my mom was, and I was so tired of hearing it, and I just punched him in the face, because I was over it. It was his thing, that he constantly had to talk to me about, and I just socked him. And it wasn't — I mean, I'm a girl. It couldn't have been that hard, but he was pissed, and it was one of the things that made me seem unpredictable and scary.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think upset you so much about that? [00:20:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was — with this kid it was literally — it was almost bullying. It was every time I saw him. It was, "How's your mom?" and "She's so hot." This is a kid who I had hooked up with, and who — I don't know. What upset me about it was that it was so constant and that — because at times it felt almost like a cool thing. Like, "Oh, that's cool." Like I kind of have this mom that people — but then it got to a point where it was like, "Shut up about it already." I get it my mom is really hot and I'm not as hot as my mom, and as a teenage girl, that's not what you want to be hearing. You don't want to hear your peers, your guy friends, telling you how much hotter your mom is than you. It feels really — it's really not okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you felt they were insulting you by saying that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not insulting me, but it was — I mean when it was said that my mom was hotter than me, that's insulting, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I wasn't sure if they were saying your mom was hot, or your mom is hotter than you, which seem like two different things. [00:21:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely. I mean, he would be the only one that would say that. My other friends would say my mom was hot, but he would be the only one to go there, and it just wasn't nice. And it's something I already knew. Like, "Obviously I already know that, so why are you rubbing this in? What is the point of this?"</p>

<p>Anyway, when I woke up the next morning from this party, the whole house had been cleaned up. But I had to walk up this flight of stairs, and this list was written of terrible things about me, and I thought they were all part of it. In my mind, they had all sat around together and written this list out. I told them about it, and my friend Devorah started to cry. She had no idea that that happened, and they were all really upset about it. I don't know. I genuinely believe that they didn't know anything about it. For that reason alone, I'm kind of glad that I talked to them about it, because I all along had thought this was something that they had all done together, kind of as a (pause) banding against me thing. [00:23:22]</p>

<p>My friend Chrissie, the one who I'm closest to, who doesn't really talk a lot about feelings, especially other people's feelings, she didn't say anything the whole time. Like the whole time we were having the conversation, she didn't say a word. I've lived with her for a few years and we're the closest. I mean everybody — it's just Chrissie and I are best friends, and it hurt my feelings that she didn't say anything. I don't really want to bring it up again, because I feel like what I needed to say has been said, but it was a little hurtful. [00:24:12]</p>

<p>I don't know. (pause) I don't know. Devorah and Trish both apologized and said that they were sorry for anything that had happened, I mean "We feel bad," but just nothing from Chrissie, and it just kind of felt like — even if you don't feel that way, just pretend for my sake. Just say — make something up. (pause) [00:24:56]</p>

<p>I guess I'm also just a little resentful because it feels like every — she has a lot of boy problems, and so she's been seeing this one guy for years off and on now, and I hate him and everyone hates him. But she's back together with him, and then she sees this other guy. I'm really honest with her, but it feels like all we talk about is about her and her guy problems. It just seems like that's all we talk about. So I felt a little resentful, like "There's one thing that I need to talk about that's about me, and you can't even offer up a little bit of something?" So I felt a little bit bad about the way that that played out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait. I missed the last part. She doesn't like to talk about it? Is that what you're — [I don't understand.] (ph) [00:25:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if she doesn't like to talk about it. It's just that she just couldn't — I don't know. Like I don't know what — she just didn't say anything. I don't know if she wasn't happy about talking about it, or — I don't know. It's just I'm a little bit irritated because I feel like we spend so much time talking about problems that she's having, and I was having this thing that I needed to talk about that involved kind of everybody, and I just got nothing. So that just frustrated me a little bit. I don't know.</p>

<p>Then there was this sweet moment at the end where I just said — I was talking to them and was explaining how it now affects me still today, and I was saying, "I just always feel different in the way that you guys always remained a unit. You guys always were similar in high school. You guys had these family structures, and I know that not everyone's was perfect, but mine felt like the really big outlier. Then you guys all went to college and I was the outlier. Now I don't feel as different now, but there's still" — [00:26:59]</p>

<p>Devorah said, "Well what can we do to make you feel more like us? Is there something" — and I said, "No, there's nothing you guys — it's all about me. I mean it's like now there's this weight, and it's like I'm the one who's got a weight problem and none of you" — I was like, "I feel like there's always something with me that makes me that outlier." (pause) It was a really sweet moment where I felt really touched by their friendship, just saying like, "What can we do?" And there is obviously nothing that they can do. It's just me, but it was a very sweet gesture, and a very sweet — I didn't expect it. (pause) [00:27:54]</p>

<p>I don't know. So I feel really good about it, and — I don't know. I've been kind of going back with certain people now who I have these relationships with, and either trying to work on them, whether it be these girlfriends from high school, or Emma, or there was a — I haven't talked about her much in here, but there was a family friend of ours who I babysat for a lot. They lived pretty much right in our backyard, and I spent a lot of time with them growing up. They pretty much took me in. They had a room that they called my room, and I used it as a place to — I would spend the night there when I — like if I would babysit and I knew they were coming home late-ish, I'd just go to sleep so I knew I wouldn't have to go home. And they would take me — I would go boating with them every weekend, and then in the winters we would go skiing, and they'd take me on vacations. I just used it as a place to escape, even though it was right in my backyard. That was almost more comforting because I felt like I could always get there. [00:28:59]</p>

<p>The mom really took me in and was so, so good to me. I'm still really close with them, so I wrote her this card, and I just — because I've always wanted — I don't think that she knows how much it meant to me. So I just recently wrote them just a card, just a quick card. I didn't want it to be awkward, but I wanted her to know how much it had meant. So I wrote her a card and I never heard anything back, and I was still wondering like, "Oh my God, did they think that was weird?" Like, "You're a freak." But I got a text message from her yesterday saying, "I'm embarrassed I haven't written back," you know, sent a really nice text. [00:29:52]</p>

<p>So I feel like I've just kind of done all these things that I've wanted to do for a long time with these big relationships in my life. I feel like now the last one I have left is kind of my mom, and it's the biggest one because there's so much there. It's kind of what all of them — you know, all the other relationships — not why they had — but, you know, that's the epicenter of it all. That's the — I don't know. I feel like (pause) — part of me is like, "I don't need to" — I'm like, "You don't need to talk to [her about anything."] (ph) But I know that I do need to, and I feel like I'm going through this thing right now where I'm just trying to — I don't know — heal relationships, or just be really honest with people about where I stand and how I feel — I don't know. I don't know what this is. I don't know what I'm going through right now, but it feels like some sort of transformation. I don't know what it is. That sounds cheesy. [00:31:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're doing an awful lot of work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm trying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To have things be more resolved, and feel sort of less raw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's impressive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. It feels better. And it doesn't — I don't have this need any — it's like it's all out there now. I don't have this — and like I can't hide from anything either. So when I feel myself with Emma getting annoyed, it's like it's all out there. You've already talked about these things, so if something is bothering you, you need to just address it because it's already been said. Now anything that you use — it's so obvious because it's already been talked about. [00:32:07]</p>

<p>So it makes it easier to move forward and harder to fall into those bad habits that I had before with certain relationships. I don't know. I don't really — my other girlfriends haven't seen them and they don't live here so it's not the same, but I feel like it'll be the same. Or sometimes I would hold on to things, or something would happen or be talked about and I'd think like, "I don't remember that happening." I probably wasn't — I feel like that won't really — maybe it will. I don't know. But it feels like moving on from it. Anyway, I really want to talk to my mom about it, but (pause) it makes me really nervous. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want to say to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want to say that there's still a lot that I'm really hurt by, and that (pause) — I can almost understand the stuff with my dad more than I can understand the stuff with Caleb. Like I can understand staying with my dad for financial reasons, and I'm not even mad about her staying with him. I'm mad about her staying with him as long as she did, but I'm not even — like when she was with my dad, I held her to such a high standard. I thought that this woman was the protector of all, and would just do anything for me. Then she married Caleb and I felt like I was thrown by the wayside, and I realized that it made me feel like a man was so much more important than me. I'm still really angry about it, and it really changed my opinion of her. I feel like that's a really harsh thing to hear from your kid, and I don't know how to say it in a different way. Because that's really not going to feel good. [00:34:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you feel thrown by the wayside?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this guy just came along and he just made — he was the priority. She met him, and then a month later he moved in even though we were still clearly so damaged. Like the priority wasn't us; it was him. The relationship with the two of them was priority more than the relationship with the four of us, and (pause) it makes me angry. It makes me angry that John just moved out instead of Caleb moving out, and that for the last ten years his word has just been the word of God. Like we just follow — like anything he says goes. And I hate it. I think he sucks. [00:35:19]</p>

<p>I almost hate more that my opinion of her changed. And maybe it would have just naturally changed that way because it came at such a — you know, at 15 that is a weird time. You're growing up anyway, and you're seeing adults for kind of more who they are, so maybe these opinions would have been shaped naturally anyway but (pause) — I don't know. I just — it really changed how I saw her. I still always desperately feel like I'm trying to get her attention back. Always. (pause) It's a really pathetic feeling as a 27-year-old woman. [00:36:16]</p>

<p>I have this disgusting cold. Do we need to stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pathetic because you feel you need her so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that I need her attention.</p>

<p>Sorry. This cold is really gross.</p>

<p>Yeah, that I'm like — I feel like an adult woman, it's just I'm like, "Mommy! Mommy! Look at me." [00:37:00]</p>

<p>(pause) I don't know if that's going to — I don't question that she loves me. She loves me unconditionally. I'm fully aware of that fact. I'm very conscious of it. That's not something that I'm worried about. (pause) I know that I can't be her priority, obviously. She has an eight-year-old and she has a marriage and she has a life, but I feel really damaged by the fact that when I was supposed to be her priority, when I was supposed to be the thing that she was focusing on, I wasn't. And I feel like I'm now just constantly seeking that. [00:38:11]</p>

<p>Because at 15 I should have been, and I shouldn't have felt guilty about needing her attention, or her time, or, you know. And because it just wasn't fulfilled — and even before — I mean if I'm honest, I never really was because she had a lot of other things going on. I think that I just always feel really desperate for it. (pause) [00:39:01]</p>

<p>But I don't know how to say any of this in like a — it was so much easier with my girlfriends because it was a group thing. It wasn't like a you — and as a mom it's going to — you know, it's like I know that — I don't know what it feels like to be a mom, but I imagine that being the most — feeling like the most upsetting thing to hear your child say, "I don't" — I mean in so many words like, "You fucked this up. You dropped the ball and this didn't go well." That's not going to be easy. That's not what I want her to take away from it. I don't think she entirely broke me and I'm irreparably damaged, but I do think that she dropped the ball. (pause) I don't know. I wish she could come here. [00:40:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It would feel safer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Safer to talk to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I really don't want to hurt her feelings. So maybe I shouldn't tell her. Then when my brother just comes out in these ways, like he just gets drunk and lashes out and freaks out, and I don't want to do that. At all. (pause) [00:41:00]</p>

<p>But I'm also just nervous about us moving there and then me saying like — the second day I'm going to be like, "Hey, can we sit down and can we talk about this?" And then there just being this funk. Because sometimes she just doesn't handle things well. I mean, I take things incredibly personally, probably because that's been the model that's been set. I mean, how could you not do this personally. Obviously, this is a very personal thing, but (pause) — she's very, very sensitive. I know this is a sensitive issue, but she's sensitive like, "How much salt did you put in this dinner?" (pause) I don't know. I just don't know how she's going to take it, and I'm nervous about the aftermath. [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because? What do you imagine the aftermath to be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That we're just living in her house for the summer, and then there's just this stench, and there's this thing that's been talked about and then it's not good between us. Because now we're fine. We talk a few times a week. Things are fine with us. And we'll joke and — but I do — I don't know. So why do I want to disrupt that? I think that's the reason I wanted to talk about it, is because of what I almost said while I was saying that. It's because there's always this level, this underlying level like something there that isn't talked about or addressed, which is the thing that drives me crazy about everything with my family. So if I want to change, then I have to be the person to change it. So I guess I just answered my own question. It's just now a matter of actually doing it. [00:43:16]</p>

<p>Then I hate just knowing that I want to talk — this is how I felt about the girls from high school, is that I knew I wanted to talk about it, and then it just sat there in my head for weeks. It just kind of eats away at me. I don't want to talk to her about it over the phone. It's not going to happen until we move, but there's going to be this tension, this knot in my stomach. I already have so much that I'm already anxious about with moving, and to add this onto it seems like a bad idea. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you want to repair not only something between you and other people but inside yourself too. [00:44:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's mostly inside myself. It's almost — I mean it's definitely — I'd say it's 30 percent my relationships, and 70 percent myself. (pause) That's probably selfish but I don't really —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it sounds — I mean it's like I should want to — I should be saying like, "It's a 100 percent the relationships in my life, because those are what enrich me." But in reality it's like I want to be a happier person, and I want to let go of these things. I want to move on from them. So that's just become my priority. [00:44:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're going to need to stop. Do you want to — [because I'm not going to tell you.] (ph) Do you want to see if we can find a second appointment time next week? Or what would you like to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think — I don't know. I think we'll be okay. I think one day will be fine. Thank you though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you going on a trip?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. (inaudible at 00:45:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well enjoy it. I hope the weather is cooperative.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. You too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bye-bye.</p>

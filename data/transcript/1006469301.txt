<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dumb day to ride a bike. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dumb day to ride what? Ride a bike in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. That was a question. I was not asserting that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is a dumb day to ride a bike, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. You mean because it’s snowing and slippery?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that was what I was thinking when I saw you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I just wanted to make it clear that I knew that it was not a great day to ride a bike. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Noted. (Pause) [00:00:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You want some cookies? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I’ll have a cookie. Thanks. [Do you] (ph) have more cookies? </p>

<p>CLIENT: You want another cookie? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I’ll take another. Thank you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. [00:01:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. That’s very good. Thanks. Are they lemon sugar cookies?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They’re lemon sugar cookies. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmm. Very good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: My good friend was diagnosed with MS the other day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. That’s horrible. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is horrible. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me also just bring up, [either now] (ph) or another time, but the names for (inaudible at 00:02:34) is probably like a bit of a conversation that’s not a (inaudible at 00:02:39).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it’s probably—yeah. I need (ph) talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Like now, you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, yeah. In a few minutes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or today. (Pause) His name is Bryan and he’s the boyfriend of my best friend in my program. So we’re [all really friends] (ph) with one person in my program, Erica. [00:03:29]</p>

<p>And she and Bryan have been together for almost the whole time that we’ve been in graduate school. Bryan is so wonderful and gentle. Very much like Jeremy, in some ways. He was Stanford educated. And has that sort of Stanford (inaudible at 00:04:07). He’s studying Human evolution at Yale by way of looking at teeth of very very big mammal, like sheep. He has his colony of sheep that he’s been taking care of daily. </p>

<p>Anyway, he—yeah, I went to the ER on Friday. Erica was out of town. His brother, who’s also at Dartmouth, was out of town. They all showed up eventually and yeah, he was having sort of like dis-coordination, un-coordination on his left side. And couldn’t type, couldn’t really walk like properly. Like, he was veering towards the left and was feeling fine but everything was a struggle. Like, taking the stairs. And it happened a week before. The same thing. So when it happened again he got himself looked at right away and people were pretty alarmed. Eventually led to an MRI, which led to a very very clear diagnosis based on a lesion in his brain. [00:05:52] </p>

<p>We saw him yesterday, Jeremy and I. Erica has been there for like, 48 hours, coming off of a red-eye from Baja. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s staying at the hospital?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s at Mass General. We actually walked him home yesterday, so he’s home now. So the one lesion is active, so that’s why he was experiencing symptoms. And when a lesion is active, the current standard of care is to take steroids. Like suppressive immune system (inaudible at 00:06:44). The immune cells that are causing the problem. </p>

<p>So he will be doing outpatient steroids by IV for like another day now. (Pause) It felt so good to be there with them. I haven’t really spent any time in a hospital with a friend. Spent a lot of time in hospitals with family members. It was very different. It was like—we have no sense of contractual obligation. We just like, really really really want to be there. Like not that that’s the overwhelming sense when it’s family, but somehow very different. Very easy to like just sort of be there as if we were in Bryan’s shoes. I think that was maybe what was different. [00:08:54]</p>

<p>Yeah. (inaudible at 00:09:06) (Pause) And then also on Saturday—ajooba, my grandfather fell. I don’t know how much I’ve told you about him. He is almost completely blind. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I didn’t know that. [00:09:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—this is the one who lives with my parents. He’s 89. He’s going to be 90 in November (ph). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He has a thriving meditation practice. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know what the state of his meditation practice is. (Chuckles) I certainly don’t know what the state of his guru is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs) We’re working [on it though] (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah? (Laughs) He’s had five strokes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. I did not know that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He’s the main one that I’ve spent a lot of time in the hospital with. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And after one of the strokes, he had a month long stay (ph) at a nursing home as part of rehabilitation and then like a day of trying it as a permanent thing and my dad and he—it was like their whole world caved in and they couldn’t handle it. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He nor your dad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He nor my dad. So this story is more about my dad than ajooba. But yeah, there’s a long history. I mean, going back to when my dad’s mom died and then when his brother took his life. My dad has one remaining sister and in that culture it’s your son who you sort of take up as your main place of living if you’re old or if you’re a widow. So he came to live with my parents the day that they got married and has been sort of—he lived like half a year with them for the first like 10 or 15 years. [00:12:04]</p>

<p>Yeah. So he took care of us for that time. He would leave in the summers. Well, maybe he’d leave in December. Anyway, it wasn’t like a schedule that made that big of an impression on me. It felt like he was always around and maybe some years he didn’t leave. Yeah, so they have been sort of entangled in a caretaker, like patient kind of way. Or not patient, but person who’s cared for. He was diagnosed with diabetes when he was like 60 maybe? He started losing his vision when he’s 70 so like, since then. So now he can’t really get around too much and he has Margo, who’s this very strong, large woman who has been with my family for 3 years and she lives at our house 5 days a week. Then goes back to Staten Island where her family lives (ph) the other 2 days. [00:13:52]</p>

<p>And so then, like nighttime routine is—so she sort of helps him with everything. I think he can wash himself in the shower by himself and he can wipe himself by himself, but he needs help with all the surrounding…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like getting in and out of the bathroom and stuff like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And my parents obviously take care of him and always on the 2 days that Margo’s not there and then they spent like many months doing it before they found somebody. So Saturday morning at like 6:00 in the morning, he has a commode by his bed and he was going to use the commode and he fell. He’s fallen before many times, you can imagine, without eyesight and that many strokes. [00:14:52]</p>

<p>So he didn’t hurt anything major, which is very lucky. Very hard to imagine not breaking something. He fractured his right ring finger and got some pretty bad lacerations so he was bleeding a lot and needed to get stiches, but that was it. What was disturbing—so my parents sound very very upset. They are like very seasoned by now, but they sounded very upset. And I think part of that is, there’s so much more where that came from. Like, there’s not too much they can do to improve that transfer from the bed to the commode and there’s not too much they can do to improve things at all. So where there’s a way, my dad will do it. [00:16:10]</p>

<p>So at 6:00, my parents were still sleeping and most of this has happened at night and he usually will call somebody if he’s having any trouble, but it’s a big issue that he doesn’t, as it is with most people who used to be independent who are now (ph) struggling. So he called out—he has his whistle. So my dad has a history of fainting, like me, when he is—it’s sort of like similarly like constellation (ph) and triggers when he’s very sick, when he’s been put under for a surgery and he’s coming out of it and he’s kind of loopy, he’s fainted before. Like when he has a fever is the main thing. [00:17:22]</p>

<p>But when ajooba (ph) calls in the middle of the night is another trigger. So he has fainted like four times responding to ajooba’s call. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mentioned three things that –one was coming out of general anesthesia. Another is a fever. And then there was another one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said the same thing twice. When he’s sick. So not necessarily fever but when—he’s fainted when he’s had like stomach flu. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And when he hears his father whistle, that’s another one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So there’s like maybe not anxiety, and then there’s like anxiety in my reading of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? [00:18:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will elaborate. So it’s like complete circus. My grandfather, the [three of the times] (ph) my grandfather is having a stroke and my mom has to deal with my grandfather and then my dad who’s like on the floor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fainted? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Fainted. And like, Margo can’t drive and she doesn’t speak super great English and it’s just like total chaos. There’s a lot of humor around it now because it’s just happened enough times. So my parents have started to deal with this. My mom now will be the one to respond to ajooba. So Saturday morning, she was like, “Don’t get out of bed. I will go.” And he experienced the same symptoms, so it’s not just fainting. And actually, I don’t know that he’s actually gone unconscious every one of those times. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He gets light headed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He gets like drenched with sweat, he goes nauseous, his muscles go limp and yeah, sometimes he faints. So Saturday morning he said that he felt everything coming on and he worked so hard to get through it and not faint and stayed in bed and took like 15 minutes. And meanwhile, who knows what’s happening with ajooba (ph). He didn’t know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It must be very frightening.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It’s very very frightening. So he called me in the afternoon. He doesn’t usually… hang on. I’m unable to think of words when I’m lying down. [00:20:37]</p>

<p>Daylight savings time is really screwing with me this year. I feel very jetlagged. So maybe that’s (inaudible at 00:20:57). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it’s [what you’re talking about] (ph).I guess I’m thinking like you had just got to the part about him lying there and not knowing what’s going on. Not able to do anything, [feeling pain] (ph), having a hard time and then having to call you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He called me like after it was all over. But yeah, I am very preoccupied with it. I have been, since he called me. [00:21:46] (Pause)</p>

<p>So he called and he told me what happened and we talked for a while about it. And he asked for advice, which he’s never done before. You know, “This thing happens to me, the same thing that’s happened to you. And I tried breathing and sort of like, you know, try to calm myself down and it kind of worked this time because I didn’t think that I wanted to know what you—if you would recommend anything for me, based on your own experience?” [00:22:36]</p>

<p>That felt like, “Yes. I would recommend a lot of things to you and it’s very very big. Feels very big that you’re asking me. So I am, in many more words than this, told him that my experience with my fainting is that, first of all, all but gone. </p>

<p>You seem like really really engaged, and it’s making me distracted. [00:23:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Thanks for being so engaged. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels very juicy. What happened and what I’m saying. [00:23:56] (Pause) </p>

<p>So, I can’t really remember the order. I told him that I thought that anxiety played like almost the entire roll in the fainting for me. Like maybe one time –I told him that it was really complicated. It felt really complicated and it’s not clear to me what causes what and what then like feeds back. But that I thought it was a manifestation of anxiety for me, and that maybe other people have different manifestations of anxiety and so there’s some combination of like underlying physiological makeup that’s leading me down that same group of symptoms. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s not manifesting in OCD or insomnia or something [like that] (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s right. Right. Those are much better examples. I was like, “Other people might have…” But I couldn’t really think of anything. Like sweaty palms? But wait. We have sweaty palms when we faint too. [00:25:27] (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you aware of what kind or reaction you’re having to my [being specially engaged] (ph)? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It’s the same very very sad and very very seductive like split, that I’m telling you something that’s like for once not about me and you. But what’s so over shadowing always is what is about me and you? It’s about whatever I’m telling you about. And it’s very exciting to tell you about it, especially because much of what I told my dad was sort of what has come out of here. [00:27:25] </p>

<p>So it’s kind of like—it’s exciting and sort of like, I kind of feel like I’m honoring you and the work we’ve done. And telling my dad what I told him and telling you about it. So I feel pretty strong (pause), like clinging to that. Like wanting more of it, like wanting it to last forever, wanting to draw this out for like [4 sessions] (ph). [00:28:26]</p>

<p>And I almost feel a pretty strong—[wait a minute] (ph). (Pause) There’s a lot of sadness. Like it’s going to end soon and I’ll always have something like this to tell you and maybe one reason why it’s so exciting is because maybe I was like you’re affected by what I’m saying and longing so much for that. [That’s what I think about] (ph). [00:29:40] (Pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. My hunch is that I think there’s a kind of feeling of passivity that goes along with the stag (ph) part? And my hunch is that maybe that combination of sadness and worry and passivity, may have related to the fainting? [00:30:39] (Pause) </p>

<p>Like, I think of you having trouble finding words as you’re telling me about it and thinking about something lost. In particular, losing me or losing this, or losing the time to tell me about it. And then I’m obviously thinking also about your dad and his father. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s very tender. It’s not just the passivity and the sadness though. There’s something about the energy and the excitement. He’s very anxious. And it didn’t start out that way. It actually felt clear and natural and calm, which I still kind of do. I think it helps to talk about what else is happening as it’s happening. [00:31:58]</p>

<p>I don’t want to talk about this script (ph) much longer because I really do want to get to talking about them (ph). I told my dad that I thought therapy and meditation were really really important to me and specifically with respect to this manifestation of anxiety and encouraged him to—whatever he wants to call up at that time as a calming practice, we do it every day. So if it’s breathing, whatever it is, so he’s going to do that. [00:32:45]</p>

<p>I also encouraged him to see a therapist or somebody who could talk to him about how he’s feeling about his (inaudible at 00:32:55). He had this very classic—I recognize it myself. I know that I’m very anxious about ajooba. I know that I have a lot of anxieties about not being able to get to him in time, not being able to perform, and I’m very very very aware that one of these times might land him in a nursing room and like, I think both he and ajooba are sort of petrified. It’s like this looming thing because he hated it so much. The one day that they—I mean, it was a month, but the one day that they sort of made the decision. [00:33:35] </p>

<p>He said, “But I’m aware of those issues and I talk about them.” And I was like, “Okay. It’s one thing to be aware of them. It’s really really good that you’re aware of them.” I imagine it’s very deep and very bold and that actually that is what’s contributing. And he also had this classic reaction, which I also did, which is like, “I’m going to see my doctor and make sure there’s nothing’s wrong.” I was like, “Dad. You’re 100 percent healthy. He’s not going to find a thing wrong with you and if you need to be reassured of that, that’s great. Go see your doctor.” Hence (ph) Dad had a thought that maybe he and ajooba could see someone together. Because ajooba is like 100 times more anxious in terms of his helplessness and fear of losing my parents than I think (inaudible at 00:34:50). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven’t mentioned it but I guess I’m also imagining his dying, hanging over the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It’s almost like if he died today everybody would be happier. I think dying is very scary and bad, but I think being…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something about the nursing home being more so. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Being unable to care for your parent is like—being able to care for your parent is the main point of life for my dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. And to have him alive and someway available but be unable to do is what’s so drastic, not sort of losing him altogether. [00:35:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think there’s a lot of sort of spiritual and just joint acknowledgment and support of death being something that’s going to happen and it sort of feels like there’s a little bit of buffer around that and a way to talk about it. And I don’t think there’s the same thing around slowly losing all your functions. (Pause) [00:36:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, does sound like if he were to (inaudible at 00:37:18) helpful for them and that would actually make it easier for him to take care of him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he’d probably do more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: To take care of him? What do you mean? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, if he wasn’t worried about fainting…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. In that moment he would do more. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [How many] (ph) other things like that, I don’t know, but if he felt less anxious and sturdier, he could probably do more for his dad. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think there’s a lot to be gained. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I also meant—honestly that’s an angle that I’m thinking cynically of our trying to sell it to him, or trying to sell him therapy. You know what I mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s what [he cares about] (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m worried about my role in this. Sort of like the same excitement and worry. Like my dad and Ben are both going to change… You know, it’s sort of like a dream. I couldn’t finish my sentence. I can’t really say what it is. Like, change something important. [00:39:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there something too about the way they’re putting themselves in your hand? (inaudible at 00:39:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Not just that they’re putting themselves in my hands but that they’re both really self-aware, I think. They both care a lot about themselves. They’re honoring my hard earned sort of wisdom or whatever. Yeah. It’s like who they are and what I’ve done that’s special about it. Not just that they’re helping (ph). There’s a lot of acknowledging on my dad’s part that he cares about himself too much to ignore this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s all really great. [00:40:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I feel an urgency about it because ajooba’s 89. That’s why I feel worried. It’s also hard to know how to find somebody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We have like five minutes. Should we talk about Jeremy (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So… (Pause) Yeah. I’m happy to reconsider this. My thought is that you and I talk a little more about what would be helpful or the kind of person you think would be helpful and then if I can come up with a few names and maybe he can start with one and decide if he wants to shop a little bit. That seems probably better than my talking to him. (inaudible at 00:41:07) talking to him, but it actually is necessary. (Pause) I don’t think that kind of match making would have a lot of (inaudible at 00:41:28). </p>

<p>CLIENT: You think that would take away something (ph)? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Pause) Yeah, it’s complicated. In a way, I don’t think this needs to be—I mean, if I thought that there’d be real advantage in my meeting and talking with him for a while about it, like [it would really] (ph) help me find the right person. You know, I doubt it will. [It’s not going to help] (ph) that much actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:42:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:42:09) tough to find somebody who’s good, who is…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jeremy has decided that he can see somebody on Friday any time. That’s what he has been doing. He’s been not going into Framingham on Fridays to see Susan. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So is he—his work is usually in Marlborough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. If there’s someone really good in Marlborough, I guess that would be better. But he doesn’t have a car out there. He’s part of this car pool, like really cool, nice people who’d probably let him borrow their car but I don’t see him embracing that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So [he’s out] (ph) in Marlborough four days a week. (Pause) And then he’s around on Fridays and can see somebody on Friday. And he’s gone all—he gets back around quarter to six? [00:43:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He gets back at like, between 5:10 and 5:20, 5:30. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he gets back to Porter (sp?)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He gets back to Central (sp?).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Right. He’s carpooling but he’s not (inaudible at 00:43:26). Okay. And are the carpoolers all in Waltham? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you should tell us people who are good and he can figure it out. He might decide it’s not worth seeing them because it’s too hard but that - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. That’s good for me now. So this isn’t necessarily that urgent. I’ll give you the names of the people that I think would be best or most appropriate. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ben has seen too many therapists for too long and this feels—the quality of this feels very very different. This feels like—I want to see someone who could help me change my life. [00:44:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I want to hear—we’re going to stop in a minute, but I want to hear a little more about what kind of (inaudible at 00:44:30). </p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s a knocker. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I want to hear a little more about (chuckles)—I have sort of two types of people in mind. I can give a couple of people who are sort of about my age and (inaudible at 00:45:06) very good. One’s in Providence and one’s in Waltham, and both of them I’ve shared patients with and who I have colleagues who know their work quite well and think very highly of them. You know, and then there’s sort of the other possibility would be the heavy-hitter (ph) sort of person, which would be the person like, mid-60s or something. Sort of a senior person in the field and I (inaudible at 00:45:34) people like that as well. I mean, some of them I think are very good. Problem with those people is—actually probably not any harder to get in to see. They’re a lot more expensive is the thing, potentially. But those are the two sorts of people I’m thinking of and I can think of a few people in both categories. </p>

<p>But I want to hear more about who he’s seen so far before I –it’s probably like 10 minutes or so. How long has he been seeing the person he’s going to stop with now? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like exactly as long as I’ve been seeing you. He stopped with her. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. All right. We just - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Can I write to you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can. Does it feel like this is more urgent than talking about it on Thursday? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of. I don’t know if it’s just my own…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. Well, think about it. I think it’s probably a phone rather than an e-mail. [00:46:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So… </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will write you an e-mail about it later today—about making a point to talk about it before Thursday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So I guess [his seeing you] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don’t think so.</p>

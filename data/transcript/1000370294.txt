<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) Something had occurred to me last night, uhm, after I got home, on the same things I was talking about yesterday.  And I, when, as soon as I came in here today, I began immediately to think I want to remember what it was.  And I can't remember what it was, although I think it had something to do with, again, just how I feel about men in general.  But instead I remembered something else that, I think, when it happened disturbed me very much because it somehow again seemed to be, well, I ha—, wrong, I guess.  I had some kind of guilt feelings about it.  And this was, uhm, when I was probably in my early teens or younger.  And I don't think, I think it was right before I knew exactly what happened to conceive babies and how they were born and everything.  And I just remember having dreams that sort of made it, they weren't that specific, as far as I remember but when I did find out exactly what happened, it seemed like I'd already, I knew it already.  And I can remember feeling very upset when I had these dreams.  So that they did seem vague to me afterwards even if they weren't at the time, because there was something wrong about having them.  And then later I, when I was in high school, every once in a while, I'd I don't know exactly what the dream was but it was almost as if I were having a baby and, uhm, sort of as if had some kind of a maternal urge that was coming out in a dream.  And again I felt very guilty about having these.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you remember any of the details of any of them?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Ah, well, it's awfully hard to because I can just remember sort of putting it out of my mind when I realized what I'd dreamed.  And, and when I was, the first dreams, it was just more almost becoming aware of that area of my body.  So it must have been around the time when I began to menstruate.  But I don't remember exactly.  Or at least now it seems to be more, simply that I was aware of a new part to my body and that the dreams were just sort of expressing this awareness.  Because I, as I recall them, it was the feeling, just that vague awareness that I was even upset about and that there really wasn't any detail, except just sort of this general awareness.  And I, and I, it seems to me, when I think about the other dreams, that well, there was never any man or boy involved in them and so it was almost the birth process that I was dreaming.  I'm not sure but it seems that way now.  And there was something very pleasant about it.  And then when I'd wake up — I, I think I had those several times.  And then when I'd wake up, I'd be very upset that I'd been dreaming it.  And it, and I can recall afterwards, every once in a while being aware that I'd had a dream like that and feeling, well, guilty, I guess would be the best word for it and as if I'd done something wrong.  (8-minute silence)</p>

<p>I began just, after what I said at the last time, uhm, thinking about school again and thinking first about how I've sort of felt a little bit disassociated from it the last 2 days and just wondering how much these other thoughts have been on my mind, causing me to — somehow school just hasn't been very important.  And then I just began to think about my day again.  And I just now realized that I don't know whether, again, it's an excuse not to talk about what I'm thinking when I think of school, but it's just, it's annoying me that I keep thinking about it when I'm here because I feel as if all the things that I think about I've said and it's just different incidences, really basically involving the same things.  And so it annoys me that that's all I think about while I'm here.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You said at the beginning that, uhm, there was something you'd thought about last night that you tried to remember here and you couldn't.  When you try to remember right now, what does come to your mind, what do you think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I think of, uhm, thinking of men as something that's going to attack me.  And (pause) and I know it had something to do with realizing that yesterday I had all those separate incidents when I thought in that kind of way.  And it had surprised me when I started saying them all and realizing how often yesterday I'd thought that way.  And I think it was that that made me think of whatever it was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: There was one situation in particular that you did not express any of this kind of fear of, where you're alone with a man.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean being here?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Umhmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I've said that other times.  I wasn't aware of feeling that way yesterday.  But perhaps, because I'm going to be in here, however I feel, I have sort of pushed it to the back of my mind since, when I do feel that way, I can hardly stand being in that situation for long.  (Pause) Because the other thing that just comes to my mind right now is, well, I think of, uhm, the fact that, at home, it was always, when we were little, my father was mainly a person who was always yelling at us and attacking us in various ways by either yelling at us, hitting us or saying things that, well, demoralized us, is what comes to my mind.  I don't know if that's quite the right way to express it.  But it made us feel very stupid and insignificant and so forth.  And I was afraid of him.  But then, if I carry that to why I'm often thinking these things about men today, I can also see that I'm very competitive with women and I don't quite understand if, if this would go back to my mother, what was happening.  Well, I suppose in a way I do because I was always fighting with her.  At least, there's many times I can remember I was.  And then for the time I don't recall, she claims that I was.  Or it's just simply, we've always had a problem in getting along.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I can recall feeling, too, a very ambivalent feeling toward my father because I was afraid of him and he was constantly doing things that upset me very much, making me feel stupid and so forth.  But on the other hand, there was, well, I don't know, I suppose love for him.  Or it was always very exciting to me when he came home at night.  And he was the one that, if he was in a good mood, was a lot of fun to be with.  And I did sort of look up to him as somebody who, in one way, could do no wrong.  Although, on the other hand, when he hurt me the way he used to so often, with being unjust and saying cutting things, I used to feel I had to fight back and show him I didn't care.  (Silence)</p>

<p>For a moment, I could almost feel the connection between how I used to feel toward my father and, and how I react now.  But then it just, when I was trying to get words for it, just sort of, I, slips away.  (Pause) And I seem to have had a sort of cool feeling toward my mother because she was somebody that I just took for granted.  And I could feel angry at her for not giving me things that I wanted but I'm not aware now of having any particularly strong feeling for her that I also was giving to her.  I only can recall feeling that way about my father.  But so often I was hurt into withdrawing giving anything to him.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And then I remember, at college, that I, I immediately switched and just found fault with my father in everything and he lost all that stature of being somebody who, in so many ways, could do no wrong or who had so many virtues or whatever.  And (pause) and I guess now I can see him more in terms of his own life and what he is and I don't feel so disappointed as I did when I first was at college but I can't look up to him the way I used to, either.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But there was something about when I was thinking in terms of my old reaction to my father and then how I react to men in general, there was something about just instinctively being on my guard, no matter how nice a man is being to me.  I'm not aware now of thinking, well, I can't get involved because if I do, I might be hurt but sometimes when I, just with MSCZ, am holding back from feeling anything, there doesn't seem to be any other explanation why I'd be holding back.  (Pause) It was, it's almost as if it's a sense of my father's, my feeling that, with my father, he didn't really care about me as an individual, he only cared as far as I was an extension of him and how I reflected back on him.  And so I got the feeling that, "If you don't care about me then I'm not going to care about you.  And you only about yourself so I'd better just care about myself."  And now, with MSCZ, I'm just aware of often just caring about myself.  And somehow I think I find it very hard to believe he really does care about me to the exclusion of caring about himself, or at least along with caring about himself.  (Pause) And if he does something thoughtful, sometimes, I don't know, it just, well, it surprises me.  I don't know what else.  And it makes me feel — it could be some little thing that he's thoughtful about but it can make me feel extremely good because it seems so unusual that a person would be that thoughtful.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And that makes me think of something that, well, I just accepted as, on, on, its face value before I was married.  But since I've been married, MSCZ's, who come from a family who feels very differently, has questioned how much my family really does feel the way it claims it does.  And this is regarding recognizing holidays and birthdays and so forth.  And my mother — well, I, I think my father is sort of off in another world about these things but my mother's always claimed, for herself she doesn't want any big thing made.  And I don't know, just generally she kind of takes feeling out of these things or any sign that she might care.  And it's the same with — well, we talked about this at my grandmother's funeral, my, MSCZ and I talked about my mother's reaction there too, not showing any emotion and almost claiming that funerals themselves shouldn't be.  And yet I think it's because she's afraid of how strongly she really does feel about these things.  And I know I've grown up thinking the same thing, well, I don't really care if nobody remembers my birthday.  But the fact that I can be so pleased by people who do, must signify that I really do care.  And recently my mother told me that FNA hadn't remembered her birthday and how upsetting it had been to her.  And she also hadn't done much about communicating with my mother when my grandmother died and how this had upset her very much too.  And this, both of these things, were sort of, my mother being honest.  Because she usually would indicate that she really didn't care if somebody didn't do these things, that they weren't important.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it just seems as if my family has, and I too, doing what they've all done, just denied all the different ways that people can relate to each other or show feeling for each other.  (Pause) And I can see how we all would rationalize and, and justify our attitudes by saying, well, we, we would start caring about things that are more important, like issues and things like this.  But I don't th—, I don't know, I can, I don't feel now that they're more important.  And now when I look at the way we would handle issues too, without any feeling for human beings and an ability to relate, I don't see really how you can even turn to those things.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just thought I should ask, "Are you here on Friday, this Friday?"</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.  Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because, uhm, we may be going away again.  I, I guess I won't know until tomorrow but we might be going right away tomorrow night.  Again it's going to PTN and I, one of the reason we aren't sure is because of our car, since we did have an accident.  But the other reason is that I can't decide whether I really want to be up there when my parents are up there.  And I think it's, and there'll be some friends of theirs up there.  And there's somehow the feeling the way I get put back into the daughter of the house role.  Or at least that's the way I'm feeling about it this time.  And it, if I even think about it, I feel so lethargic and then I can't stand the thought of spending a weekend feeling that way.  So, and I sort of anticipate feeling very annoyed with my parents.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

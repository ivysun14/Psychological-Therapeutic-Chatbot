<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's nice in here, nice and cool.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I saw you ...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was October, five months ago, five months ago. We see each other every five months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, but I have this letter from you from February about all the patient assistance program.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh I wanted to add that to my list of things to talk to you about. I'm on Medicaid now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You are?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah well I had applied for public assistance and I got rejected and um I also applied for Medicaid and I thought I was rejected at the time but it turns out the paper was pending and so now I've been approved for Medicaid and I wrote [NAME OTHER] who's handling the case and wrote her and told her that I'm now on Medicaid...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And for the time being, I don't need to be with the patient assistance program. I told [NAME OTHER] I said if she...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, sorry, so she handled all of it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll tell you after. I told [NAME OTHER] the situation, I said if you get any medicine to phone in. You shouldn't be getting any medicine from patients assistance program but if you phone me I'll pick it up and send it back to [NAME OTHER]. So, she knows the situation, I told her I'd been approved for Medicaid and... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, fine. All right, I saw you [DATE], your mood was fine, you were not sad or anxious, your sleep was fine, your energy was okay, you're walking, you're reading magazines, you're listening to radios, you weren't suicidal, you weren't especially paranoid, you're weren't hearing things that weren't there, you're weren't scared, you weren't obsessing that much, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So far you were in pretty nice shape, on, hold on, on Risperdal 2 mg.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you've been taking that every night and doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. How have you been in these five?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been okay, it stayed the same, no problems I'm doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay so let's belabor that point, your, your mood is okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you paranoid at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't feel like people trying to hurt you in anyway?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you hear anything that's not really there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you anxious much of the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your appetite?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You gaining or losing weight?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I stayed the same.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is your energy level okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's fine, it's fine, it's average.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sleeping well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm sleeping okay, sometimes the neighbors wake me up, you know, but I'm okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. Self-esteem okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's about the same.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, are you working in anyway?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, right now I'm not working.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Find that to be a problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I was doing a few things, but I'm not doing anything right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What's stopping you from getting a job?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm looking, I'm looking for a job...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, so what's the problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I had the [DEIDENTIFIED] the month last November, the [DEIDENTIFIED] and then I had my, lasted a month...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How did that go? Tell me about the case.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um opened 30 over 30 cases...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did I try to get you off that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No you didn't. I did ask you to. But you said you couldn't help me with that if I wanted it...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Usually I don't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I didn't want any help. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you would have pushed me I probably would of...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But I, I like people to take part, I've done it. It's not so bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's nice to meet people. It's nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of cases?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm not allowed to discuss it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm sorry. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took an oath.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hold on, I'm your shrink, you're...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's just classic murders, the sexual molestations...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, juicy stuff.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some of it. Some of it. I'm concerned today the [DEIDENTIFIED] now...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The [DEIDENTIFIED] does what? They're the ones to say whether you should indict.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There so, so [INAUDIBLE] anxiety of whether the case should go to trial.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you got, how many of you were there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There was um I think 19, one of the persons was pulled out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you had to see if there was enough evidence to uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it was 24, I think there was 19 or 24, I forget.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You had to say whether there was enough evidence to indict.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We had to judge the evidence. We had to take and read both sides. Sometimes there was just the one person.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And were you guys fairly tough?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, we were very tough.  We were mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Were you more towards the let him go side or were you more tough indicting?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was more tough indicting. But then after I regretted, I felt bad for some people, there was this one guy in a wheelchair and the lady next to me said, it's all an act, it's all an act, but I felt bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh so the people actually came before you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some of the defendants came.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or there's mostly lawyers.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was um, it was the D.A.'s office doing most of the...doing all the lawyers from the D.A.'s office. I'm glad I'm not on the [DEIDENTIFIED] today deciding about the [NAME OTHER]  case. It's a rape kind. They said on the radio this morning. If it's the [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] who decides not to indict the police...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then there might be a rape problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah because of [PHYSICIAN NAME], the lawyers.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, that going to happen today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah that's going to happen today. They're worried that [NAME OTHER] were worried about possible rape, [INAUDIBLE] [NAME OTHER] thing happening, anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] thing was more substantial.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but there was the problem in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There was a problem in [DEIDENTIFIED] I remember that day I went to the city and then everything shut down and I had to take the subway and all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] beat the kid up in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, there was that too? I don't think I was in the city for that. Anyway.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, how's your, so that was the month of November, now we're in March you're not doing so well with the job search.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I have problem in December with my teeth.  My teeth and my gums.  I had to go to the dentist and have my tooth pulled out.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why? What happened, you had an infection?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh my tooth, when I bit into a piece of chocolate it cracked, it cracked in two my tooth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it happened, it happened actually during [DEIDENTIFIED] and I didn't realize it had been loose. I touched the side that wasn't loose and um anyway in December I got it pulled out. That was a problem.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Are you having, do you think you're on enough for a Risperdal?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, yes I think it's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you sure?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'm doing okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because it might be that some of these, some of your psychiatric problems are interfering with your ability to get a job and that maybe with a touch more Risperdal you'd be able to function a little better.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think I need more Risperdal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't think so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you happy with the side effects, is there a problem?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't have anything weird happening with my health. I don't have anything weird.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well listen, you've been on this dose for three years. I have here [DEIDENTIFIED] we dropped you down to 2 mg. We really have been okay since, except my hope is that you could function a little better, you know, get yourself a job.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm looking, I'm looking for a job now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How's your dad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's, he's okay. He's working in real estate right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED] yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And is he co-writing a dictionary?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No not right now no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that market's dried up? I mean...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's having problems with his company. His company, he said he's having problems with his company so he might be getting a job I real estate. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do you mean his company? His, you mean the publisher?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The publishing company.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They don't want him to write books anymore? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Anymore he's had proposals for them and they don't, they haven't accepted any. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so he needs a new way to make money.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah he says he does. He says he does. I think he's just doing it to keep busy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you think he has enough money?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know, but you don't know with my father so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's working as a real estate agent.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he successful?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> From what he's told me, he hasn't sold any houses yet, but he works on commission he says.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right and, but he doesn't have any more work to throw your way.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right now no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you making ends meet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well I'm using my [DEIDENTIFIED], part of my [DEIDENTIFIED] to pay bills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's paying the maintenance on the, on the apartment. That's how it's working out right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's not a good long term plan.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no, well I'm, I'm going to be looking for the job so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, I...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took a proof reading course, a course for proof reading, so I'm gonna be studying that to see about, about the proof reading, to become a proof reader, you do legal proof reading, there's what they call block lining where you um, prepare attorney's proof to the, original proof to the new proof and I have to study that and see if I can get a hang of it and become a proof reader.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you considered again disability?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I talked to the people at social security about that...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said that I don't qualify for that, that my resources are too high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What resources?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My [DEIDENTIFIED] is too high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but no..</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They said my [DEIDENTIFIED] too high.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, no. That's not relevant.  That's not relevant to your need for disability. Disability's about whether your able to function at a job and I think, because it takes a while to get on it and you've been rejected in the past, I think you really should strongly consider applying again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I read the literature. My father got some literature from the social security about it and I called them up and talked to them about it and they said that I didn't qualify, but eventually I'll run out of my [DEIDENTIFIED] so I'll end up qualifying eventually.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It has nothing to do with that though.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But you have to have a certain level, it's like with any government program you have to have the guidelines...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you have to have a certain income, either income guidelines and resources.  Resourcefulness. There's a limit to the...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you're getting bad information. I, there's a patient just recently who was helping with a legal assistance firm, probably free who are helping her get disability. Can I give you their number?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you can call them.  Because I think you're getting bad information and at this point it's mostly about your medical status, about what you have clinically whether or not you are eligible for disability. There's no doubt that you are.  There's no doubt in my mind that you are eligible and then you can work out how much you get based on how much money you have...that...that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not how much you get its for initially to qualify to even apply, to even apply, the, the, the resource, the limits, the income and the resource limits. It was all in the literature my father gave me.  There are certain limits to even apply to be eligible to even apply.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For regular social security?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Regular yeah, social security disability, he gave me the literature.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's hard for me to believe.  Let me, let me give you the number, hold on. Here I happen to have it right here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's free he says.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think so.  I, I know this lawyer contacted me about an application of someone else and, and so he's helping this other person, you know, get benefits. I think you really need some legal assistance.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER], what's the last name [NAME OTHER].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let me re-write it, hold on.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sorry, doctor's hand writing.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I got a pen. I just want to make sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just call, he can at least guide you on what the next step is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He has people in the government program?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He's a lawyer, I think it's a whole kind of center that helps people who are disabled.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's, you don't have the name of the, I got a pen, no it works.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's [DEIDENTIFIED] something, I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You say it's a center for disabled people, legal...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think so, it's like a legal aid.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Legal aid for disabled...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right to help you with the application process. I would be as supportive as possible with my write up and I think this is something you need to be thinking about before the money runs out and then you're in real trouble.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My father contacted a lawyer about it and he said that, that it couldn't help. He said that they were right or whatever about what I can still contact...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Contact this person because this is what they do all day every day...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is legal aid for the disabled.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so they know the laws well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my...he spoke to you on the phone?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah I spoke to his... he'll know... he might remember me. I can't tell you the patient who we spoke about because of confidentiality...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well what do I, what do I say, [PHYSICIAN NAME]...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME] referred me to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, just say [PHYSICIAN NAME] referred me to you about the disability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he helped with a patient get on disability.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Are they located in this town?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't know where.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a [DEIDENTIFIED] number, so they're probably nearby and because you know it's a whole process ...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I know, you, you go there. They don't give you the application anymore. They used to...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They send it to the doctor.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You used to be able to get the application and fill it out and um now you have to go...you go to social security but you have to make the appointment without getting the application before.  The only thing bad about it is in the literature it says that if you can sense, if you can walk and if you can remember that you won't get disability....</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's wrong.  That's for a different kind of disability. You know, that's for people who have different types of disability. Your level of psychiatric disability is definitely enough to get disability, okay...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And it wouldn't stop you from working. I mean they would have to adjust the benefits based on how much you work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you should work when you're on disability?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You can work.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh, so you'd be getting more money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They would adjust the benefits based on how much you earn. There are specific limits, you can make this much, whatever. But that doesn't matter.  At this point I think  you need to go through this process. I think it's very important that you have some kind of support. I mean if your father doesn't, isn't able to support you at some point, you know he's getting older, if, if when the [DEIDENTIFIED] run out, I mean things could get quite tough for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you agree?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, but I need, I can't count on my father because of illness or the money. He's just not helping me and the fact that I need to get a job. That's what my goal is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But this should be part of this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, and you know, you have been trying to get a job... for the... I don't know nine years I've known you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't though, always been going out and consciously looking. I haven't been doing it day in and day out for nine years, during the time before I was taking care of my mother and working for my father, so I wasn't conscientiously looking, seeking employment.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I think we both probably agree that you have some trouble getting a job.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, if somebody, [NAME OTHER] offered me a job, I'm sure I can do, someone offered me a job I'm sure I could do it, you know. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm just being silly, I'm being silly. I'm sure of someone gave me [INAUDIBLE]  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think if you got a job you could keep it, is that you're point?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's my point.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And, but getting a job is the problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because there's not many. I just had a few questions, when I see the word disabled like in a magazine, if I find an organization for someone is disabled...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or in the newspaper like a job fair for the disabled, does that mean just people who are physically handicapped or is that mental also? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could be... I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh you don't know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It could be either. It could be either.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's usually the physical for certain I know that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's for certain.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Usually doc, but then I was wondering if it also meant mentally disabled.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It might. You can call the organizers to find out if the others are welcome.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh. Because it sometimes doesn't mean the mentally disabled, it just means the physical.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, that's right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Or if they recognize an organization on the radio they say it's for the disabled, again it could be just for the physical and not the mental... you have to call them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, right, call them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um and then I just had another question, um I might need a note to say that I'm disabled because I got a form from Medicaid this morning um saying about they might need proof, I need to talk to my father about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want me to write something now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What do they need? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Saying that I'm disabled.  Just saying that I'm disabled and um what else did it say, that I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I'm mentally disabled.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and why do they need that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's to prove that you're disabled. It was on the form. I might not even... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why don't you wait to see exactly what you need and then just call [NAME OTHER], she does those letters all the time.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was my question, I know you go on vacation near [DEIDENTIFIED]...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No problem.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because that was my question about when the office is closed because usually you close like the month of March, I remember sometimes you close the whole month of March. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no we don't. No, never. I'm sometimes not here for a long stretch but the office is always open.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, she's here even when you're...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She's here with your chart she can always write letters for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Write letters, like if I need.  </p>

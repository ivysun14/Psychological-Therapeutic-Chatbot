<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that's right I put you on Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And your mood better or not better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I don't know, like it's been so long since I was on the Lexapro from the last time, I mean 2 1/2 years is a long time, I don't really know, there are days where I think it's helping and there are days where I really can't tell a difference.  Um, I feel overall like slightly less mood swingy I think um, I haven't noticed any side effects you know, like my appetite is the same, which is some days I'm hungry and I can eat and other days I'm not hungry and I don't eat so it all depends on what happens when I wake up, um, I still like my job, the car I'm driving and um, I'm not really sure if I'm doing the right thing by being engaged with Mike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh really, why, what's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well last night, like uh, well he came with me to meet the trust guy and uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The new guy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The new guy and we had coffee and it was fine.  Um, I left, talked to him a couple times throughout the day and then uh, I got done with work and I changed.  I don't feel like being in my work clothes anymore um, 1 of my friends had stopped up at the restaurant and she's like "hey, do you want to go out for a little bit?"  And I was like "you know, yeah, maybe" so I changed and then, um, it took forever to get the tips from the servers because they tip me because, for their bartender um, after I clocked out and changed and was just sitting around waiting, by the time I got my tips it was 11:30, I'm like "Man, you know what, I'm really tired I think I'm just going to go ahead and head home", well I already changed and I got grief because I had changed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got grief from Mike from -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From Mike?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From changing.  He's like "You never change, you always come home in your work clothes" so I lied and said oh, I spilled water on my clothes, you know, because if he thought I was going to go out he would have accused me of trying to sleep with someone.  So, I was just like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he done that before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he thinks I'm cheating and I'm not, like, I'm, I'm honestly not, like I don't have any desire to, like 9 times out of 10, I'm happy and content with him and I think we can have a good life and then things like last night happen and it just throws me off and it's just like, what the heck, I can't change after work and drive home comfortably in jeans and a tee shirt, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What the heck and so he then checked my clothes, to see if they were wet and I said that I hung them up to dry and they were fine and he was like "whatever, you're lying to me", I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why don't you just confront him and explain to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every time I try to confront him, he gets in my face and says that if he feels threatened he's going to punch my face in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He threatens to hit you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he ever hit you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why do you want to stay in this relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know anymore.  Like, like I said 9 times out of 10 I, I do love him and you know, he does make me happy and we have a good compatible companionship and a good compatible home life you know, we have a lot of the same values, we're both working towards bettering our lives but then he pulls this crap and then he says "You going to, you're trying to break us up" and I'm like "No, I'm not, you're the one who's accusing me, when I just came home in a pair of jeans and the shirt", you know, I'm wearing whatever I wore last night for like, because I worked for an hour.  You know, and he was like "You always come home in your work clothes, you always call me when you get done with work", and I'm like the last few nights when I've called you to say "Hey, I'm done with work, I'm just waiting around for my tips you're like why are you calling me, just call me when you get done with work and you're on the, and you're way", you know?  So it's like, I, I'm really now believe I don't think I'm the problem, I think he's the problem and I don't know what to do because he says that he's done everything right and all this and he's trying to make us work and it's my, my fault that we're not working and I don't think that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The best relationships have the most trust and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He doesn't trust me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can't, you can't have a successful -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's had me followed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before, because he was like "How else would I" when I bought my shoes a couple weeks ago, because I took him out to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a really nice dinner, it's like "let's go out for a romantic dinner we've got some extra money, let's just blow it and have a nice dinner" and he didn't like the dinner, he ordered a porterhouse like 20 oz and he was like "it was too tough" and I'm like "well, you should have gone with the filet mignon, yeah you don't get as much meat but it's softer, you can cut it with my fork."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, it was just, I'm doing little things to you know, it, he had 2 teeth pulled the other, on Thursday and a temporary filling put in, so I made um, hard boiled eggs for him, because that's what he said he wanted, warmed up meatballs and mashed potatoes and I had made a nice fluffy white cake with frosting for him, because it was soft and he can kind of just, you know, just kind of just melts in your mouth and I keep the house clean and I'm keeping up with the laundry.  Yesterday he was like "Well I'm going to go home and do some laundry", I get home at midnight, I'm like "Did you get any laundry done?"  "No I don't want to have to do the fucking laundry if I don't want to do it", "Okay, you just said that your were going to do it", "Well, I decided not too", I'm like "All right then", you know, don't, I can't do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, all this tension, I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I'm working -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Courting stage still I mean essentially, I mean you know you're not even married yet so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then he -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It will get worse after the marriage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then he's like "Why won't you marry me", I'm like "Because I don't know if I want to marry you anymore, I know that I still love you but in terms of spending the rest of my life with you now, I have a lot of doubts" like the other day he called me fat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where's that coming from?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know and then, then like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he overweight?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no but he's got a bit of a belly like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I'm wondering maybe he's projecting, I mean if he's calling you fat because you're definitely not fat and he's a little overweight, he'll wonder with the, uh, uh, uh, you know, sexual with other people if he's projecting because he's doing it or he has feelings about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And he's thinking you could be doing it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I told him I've never cheated -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um, we had a threesome once and he fooled around with another girl but and that's why I don't trust him but I don't grill him about it, I told him "I'm over it, I'm done with it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Whose idea was the threesome?  His?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> His.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't like to share.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I wonder if this was what projection, he's so paranoid that you're doing it because he has all these feelings about being active with other people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, but like I said I can't confront him about it because he gets angry and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He gets in my face and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am worried that 1 of these days he's going to slip up and hit me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's had 3 years of anger management but I don't think that's helped, you know?  I, I'm finding out all these little things, like he never used to be like this when we first got together and it was just really um, you know he goes through my phone to see who I've been texting, he's like "You've erased messages" and I'm like "No."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No trust.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you can't, I'm telling you, [PATIENT NAME], you can't be in a relationship if there's no trust.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But how do I get out of it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you afraid he'll hurt you if you try to leave?  Hm, that's a real problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He um, he said that I, he would ruin my life worse than I could possibly imagine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you try to leave?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When did he say that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When hasn't he said it, he said uh, about a month ago -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he said it yesterday and you know, I don't know like I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, like I know that he still cares about me and I know that like, there's still like the good him there, but I'm not seeing the good him, hardly anymore I just see all this like negativeness and now, like this morning when I was thinking about it, like I was like doing the dishes and running the dishwasher and doing laundry and I'm like I don't think I'm the problem anymore, like I don't think it's me.  Yeah, I was depressed and unemployed and maybe I like lost some interest because I was depressed but I'm working, I'm happy, happier I wouldn't say I'm happy but I'm happier.  I'm content with myself, I feel like I look halfway all right, I'd like to get a little more toned but you know, for [AGE], having lost over 40 pounds in less than a year, I think that's pretty damn good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's wonderful, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know and that was with like no special diet, okay, being broke and not being able to afford to eat kind of helped but I can afford to eat and I still choose to eat healthier.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you know, there are days where sometimes just coffee is all I want, you know.  So I have coffee and bread and that satisfies me and then there's other days like um, yesterday I had like a bunch of Mexican pastries, it was great and then I had a cream cheese muffin, you know, I mean, I balance out my days where I kind of gorge myself on days that I eat small, healthy, proportionate meals.  So, I, I don't know but you know, and then he's, he's definitely got a bit of, of a belly and he's working in a dead end job and um, you know, I got along really well with my [DEIDENTIFIED], or the guy who's in charge of moving it, and my main go to guy, got along really well with him and my life is now getting really on track, like I've got plans for when, what I want to do with the money and I'm pretty much just kind of waiting until I get this, more control of the trust before I leave, but I'm locked into the lease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, that's a, how long is the lease?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A year and it's a rent to own lease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm, then it's in both your names?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Boy, hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like it, I would rather not leave but at the same time there's days where I'm like okay I wonder if I got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can you stay there alone and have him leave?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if he would leave.  He would know where, I mean, I don't know if it would be safe for me to stay there, to tell you the truth, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I would have the feeling that I would have to completely leave the area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You really feel he would hurt you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really think he would destroy my life, like he, he has said it on so many times, you know, that he would really mean and out of everything that I hold near and dear would be in gone and you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My horse, I would move both of my horses, I would have to change my cell phone number, I mean like there's so much I would have to do just in order to even feel safe.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And like I said, I can't, I can't talk to him about anything because he gets defensive, gets in my face which then makes me more suspicious because it's like okay why are you always accusing me of doing stuff that I'm not supposed to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah he's, I think the more you talk, the more I think it's a projection, he accuses you things because of the feelings that he has and that's why it's abusing you but this is a whole other situation about, I guess first you want to make a decision, if it definitely is that you want to leave and then if it is then we got to figure out a strategy as to make you safe to get out of that.  I don't know how, I mean, maybe a restraining order or something, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think a piece of paper would make a difference.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Make a difference, it won't -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I would worry about my mom and dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  He would hurt them?  Boy, oh boy, hm.  Well first, make, let's make sure this is the decision you want, so I -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then if it is, then we'll figure out a strategy as to how to get away from him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe try to spend a little time away, if it's, now, as see if you feel safer and more relaxed or, could you, would he be upset if you said you wanted to go to your mom's and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, like the other, like a couple weeks ago I said I wanted to go spend the night at my grandparent's house in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was like "Who does that, who goes, who goes to a new place other than to spend time away from their significant other", I'm like "Well you know, we kind of said that maybe sometime apart would do us good" and he was like "You never used to want to do that, what are you up to?  Who are you going to go sleep with?"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm, well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm like "No one, I'm, would, just literally go over to my grandparent's house" and like if I had the time and could, could do it, because I, the only day I have off is Mondays and I usually, I have to work Sunday night, tomorrow night, otherwise I would go up to Wisconsin to my grandparents, to [DEIDENTIFIED] because he doesn't know where they live, he's been there once and I drove, so he doesn't, he's horrible with directions and he wouldn't be able to find it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I really think I would have to leave completely leave the state.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I was wondering could I get, move everything out in a day, just take the stuff that's important to me like the dishes, the, you know, all of my stuff and furniture and I'm like what would you do if he came home and there was nothing there but like his stuff and my cell phone number is changed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That might enrage him even more.  What's the best way to do it, I guess um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know the other day we got into an argument and I was like "Do you want me just to leave?"  And he was like "Do you think you're going to threaten me by saying you're going to leave?"  And I'm like "I'm asking you, do you just want me to go away?  I will do it" you know, I'm like whatever and he was like "No, did I say that's what I wanted?"  I'm like "Okay", he's like "I'm trying to make us work", and I'm like "What do you think I'm doing?  You're the one who keeps like getting angry and irritated with me for nothing that I've done" like last night me coming home in street clothes, like pissed him off to no extent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's like he wants to control my every mood, move but at the same time like he wants me to be independent, I, I don't know, it's like I think he would be perfectly happy if I was the 50's housewife.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't want that.  I am my own person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, no you have to be free to be you and it sounds like because of his controlling nature you're stifled, on your own and then -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am happier when I'm not around him right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like I don't ever leave work early anymore to rush home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're more safe at work than you are at home.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, luckily for me I think my boss might be connected with uh, some people of unscrupulous natures so I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you told him about the problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've told my coworkers a little bit and um, one of my coworkers that I'm really close with, uh, he was like well, you know, it's like, our boss is Italian.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He knows people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If there's a problem -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm yeah, there's a new job, you don't want to start getting him involved in all this intrigue and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well I've been there since, you know, the middle of February.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ah but, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he, my boss does like me, you know I'm a good worker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, and not in that way or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no, just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he older?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How old is he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fifties but he knows I'm a good worker and I try hard.  If he asks me to do something I do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm a good employee and I don't get into arguments with people at work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm wondering if you can just tell him that you're going to your grandparents, I mean, not ask his permission but say you know you want -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I would have to ask his permission because I don't have a vehicle at my disposal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, I see, I see .</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I'd be worried if I said well I'm going up to my grandparents house that he's going to call the cops on me and report the vehicle stolen -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Even though my name is on the insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, hm.  Yeah, you're kind of locked into this relationship because of the house and because of the car and because of -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been telling my parents and my grandparents that I needed this trust moved ASAP and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just, do your parents know about the problems he's giving you too or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little bit, like I told my mom about a month ago that he had threatened me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what did she say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I swore her to secrecy I'm like "Don't say a word to anybody right now" I'm like "Because I could be in jeopardy"</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, don't want you to get hurt but uh, hm and there's no way he would maybe go to see a counselor with you together as -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would love if he would come with me here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to ask him and I can at least assess him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would, I would think that would be really good but I think he is um, he knows how to turn on the charm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And fake it, I don't know if we could -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But at least we could open some of these issues in terms of the fear element you have, see how he responds to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would just be worried what would happen when I would come home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING] and it's storming too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I hear it.  All right, let me, let's think about this and we'll -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I, I mean, I don't think I've ever been like not wanting to go home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you're afraid and that's a real unhealthy place to be, at home.  Home should be the safest place you are and it's not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah I mean he gave me a hickey the other night when we were having sex and I saw it the next morning and, you know, was in a rush to get dressed for work and didn't think about it and then we were in a rush to get out the door to go the dog park with some friends and then, the next morning I was like "Oh yeah, hey, I forgot, you gave me this" and he was like "No, I didn't", I'm like "Yeah, you did, I remember you sucking on my neck", or whatever side it was on and he was like "I would have remembered if I gave you one", I was like " I, what the heck, you gave me one".</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Was he drinking too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he drinks a lot of Mountain Dew and then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Got ADD probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably, like well I told you that I tried to get him fired and everything like that and um, then he bitches and moans because I don't, I won't bring him lunch -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> At work and I'm like "Okay well first off I work during lunch, I can't leave to bring you lunch, second off I'm not allowed anywhere near [DEIDENTIFIED] so why would you complain and bitch" and I'm like "I make you a lunch that morning and send it to you in a bag" and he's like "I don't want to be carrying a bag into work".  Well, I'm sorry then, I, I can't help you because I can't bring you lunch yet you don't want to carry a bag to lunch, for work, with, you know, with, what the hell do you want me to do.  Like I, I feel like I'm just, I'm lost as to how to even act half the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I really, I, I, the more I think about the situation the more I'm believing I don't think I'm the problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He tells me that I'm the problem, he keeps telling me that I'm the one who is messed up, he's threatened to put me in a mental home, he says "All it takes is 2 signatures".</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah we have some real issues here, all right, why, why don't we do this, I mean, the Lexapro we don't know if it's working, but let's continue it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's only been 2 weeks, I think last time it took um, closer to a month before I really knew.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's continue it, I'll give you more samples -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And talk to him about the possibility of meeting together.  That's all you're taking now is the Lexapro, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and don't do anything rash between, you know, now and when we decide what to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, I, I don't know what to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

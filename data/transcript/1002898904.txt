<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>

<p>David Mee-Lee is a leading expert in co-occurring substance use and mental disorders with over thirty years experience in person-centered treatment and program development. He is not your usual psychiatrist, nor is he your usual educator. He writes and speaks in down-to-earth, jargon-free language and makes learning challenging and enjoyable. Audiences consistently express satisfaction with his combination of rich content and practical approach delivered in his engaging style. His down-to-earth upbringing in Australia coupled with his Chinese heritage makes for an interesting mix of dry humor and quiet wisdom.</p>

<p>David is a Board-certified psychiatrist and is certified by examination of the American Board of Addiction Medicine (ABAM). David has trained and consulted for hundreds of organizations, ranging from small mental health centers to government departments and national behavioral healthcare companies. David has also authored a number of book chapters and papers in a variety of professional publications. He is Chief Editor of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria and is a Senior Advisor to The Change Companies.</p>

<p>David's medical, psychiatric and addictions training began in his home country of Australia. From there it took him to Ohio, Massachusetts, Hawaii and eventually California. He has trained and consulted in almost every US state, and his international work has taken him to Australia, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.K.
David Mee-Lee is the Instructor in the session that follows. In this role-play, he is trying to engage a "17 yr old young man" to illustrate moving a client from his 'victim-of-the-system' role.  It attempts to engage him around something that he wants –i.e. to remain in his current living situation- rather than be moved to a foster home or something less familiar.</p>

<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. So now is this a male or a female?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Male 17 year old.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: A 17 year old male and let's be HIPAA Complaint. So, we won't give him his real name but what would be a name for the 17 year old male? (inaudible at 0:00:16.3)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: We'll call him Anthony.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Anthony. All right and you're in an outpatient or inpatient setting? We're still doing the set up here so yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: It's outpatient crisis foster care children only.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Outpatient crisis foster children only. So this is you're working with the crisis team or this is in -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I'm on a team.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You're – okay. And this is a young man who's in your caseload or -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: For the team's thing?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: My caseload mainly.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. So have you seen him on a regular basis or something?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: For about a month and a half.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: You probably would need to know though is this is like he's eighth foster home. He's also been at two foster homes with physical abuse. [0:01:06.1]</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: And I am like his tenth therapist.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: He's also been in wrap around so he knows what it looks like high paced as well as – well he doesn't know what low paced looks like.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So he's very –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All right so this is an easy client then. Right? And your name though is what?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Christina.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Christina. But we're going to talk to Anthony. He's a 17 year old young man whose foster homes, crisis team, many therapists. You've been with him for a month and a half you say.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And what we're going to try to do is to just use this as a structure. Now remember, techniques and models, there's no magic about them. But sometimes if the structure helps you to get closer to the client then it's a useful structure to have. So, we're just going to try to demonstrate trying to work through the what, why, how, where and when to see if I can build some relationship with Anthony and identify what he wants. [0:02:06.2]</p>

<p>So I'm going to be first looking for what does Anthony want? See if I can say why does he want that? See if he had an idea about how to get that and where and when he wants to work on that because if they have their own very fixed ideas, I can't just rush into my assessment and tell them what to do. I mean I can. But if I want them to actually make some changes, I'm going to have to engage them in that process.</p>

<p>So I'm going to try to follow through the what and not move from the what until I think I have that. Sometimes people want more than one thing. And so then you have to try to work out which is the most important to them because if that's what's going to drive the plan. And then I'm going to go through the what, why, how, where and when. And if this works, that's what I'm trying to demonstrate to you. If it doesn't work, I'm trying to show you how not to do it. So.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Either way I win. But no, no this is really about then can I engage Anthony. And you just be him (inaudible at 0:03:03.7) [0:03:04.6]</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: Be Anthony.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: I mean don't punch me or anything but –</p>

<p>(Laughter and comments)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well Anthony, thanks for coming to see me. You know we've been –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: (inaudible at 0:03:10.7)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Working together for a little bit. But, I was trying to think about what to help you with and I realized I don't know what you want me to help you with. So, why are you here and what do you want me to help you with?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: You guys are making me come here.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well yeah, we want you to come here but what do you mean making you come here? I didn't see anybody drag you. You walked in.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Well if I don't go here then I don't get to stay with my relatives. Then you're going to move me again. And I'm just sick of all of it.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. So you want to stay with your relatives and -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: I mean –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I mean they're better than the rest.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. So you think if you don't come here to see me, we won't let you see your relatives. And that would be bad?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: That's what the caseworker said.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. And so you're here. So let me – would that be something we would want to work on then helping you to be able to see your relatives? [0:04:02.3]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Well I'm staying with them so I guess the caseworker just said if I don't go to therapy –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Then most likely I'll have to go to a lock-in unit or residential.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: And, I don't want to be with other people.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. So you're kind of good enough happy with the relatives where you're staying now. But if you don't come here, you've been told that you're going to be locked away to some other place.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. How would that be if you had to go to a place? You said you don't want to do that.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I don't care.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You don't care? Really?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Not really.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well so you don't care where you go then. So if you don't let you stay with your relatives, you wouldn't mind?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: (Sighs) I guess. Why do you always want answers? I'm tired.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, I know. Well it's – is that what you want to work on because I'd be willing to work on getting to – how not to be tired? Or I mean just what's the most important thing?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That works.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Which?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I want to stay with my family.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. [0:04:57.3]</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. All right, well I'd be willing to work on that. I mean you don't have to but you must want something or else you wouldn't have shown up here. So, how about we work on not going to this other place there where you have to be with other people and staying with your relatives even though it's not 100 percent for you. But it's better than the alternatives. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. But it's – I don't have a problem. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, what -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: They always stay I have an anger man – I'm not angry.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I'm really not angry.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Yeah. Well, I can see that. Yeah. So –</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: We don't have to work on anger if you don't want to. I mean what you –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Good. I don't want to.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: What you want to work on is not having to be sent off to this other place where you –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And staying with your relatives. Isn't that what you want?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: I mean that's why you showed up here today, isn't it?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Um-hmm. But you guys usually always want to talk about past.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Well I know.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I don't want to talk about any of that.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: We went to a workshop and we're trying to do something differently now. Because we heard this fabulous guy that told us that –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: We may have been doing the things the wrong way.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I've heard that before. [0:05:57.4]</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And yeah – no, but really Anthony I'm actually interested in helping you get what you want. And you showed up today and I thank you for showing up. And, what I understand is most important right now is not to get sent off to some other place and to stay where you are. Right?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: But not to work on all these other things that people have been telling you –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. I want to work on that.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. All right. So, now why is it so important though to stay with these relatives? I mean you just don't want to be with other people or what? Why is it – I mean because it's not the perfect place, is it? But –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No. Well, I've got a year left till I'm 18. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So I just want to get out. I just want to be –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Done with changing homes. I don't want to deal with –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Strangers. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I just want to get 18 and get away from all these people.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. So you'd rather just stay for the year with them?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Even though it may not be perfect but it's better than –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Anything else. Well, okay. So this is important to you to try to work on getting you to stay there.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. All right. Now, do you know how to get to stay there? What have people been told? I mean I'm just being – you've had 10 other –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: (Sighs)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: People working with you. I'm just kind of new. And what have people been told that you have to do to get to stay with them? [0:07:01.8]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Well the caseworker said I can't threaten.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I can't have any more probation issues.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No more fights –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Or else I'll get kicked out.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I don't know. She had this big list she gave me.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: And she just said therapy will solve it all. So, I'm here. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Wow. Wow. Gosh.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yep.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And you've had 10 therapists though or something, have you?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Just since I was four.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Wow.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I've seen all of you.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. No. Well, see –</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All of those things that you have to do, they're saying that if you don't get into trouble again or don't threaten people, they won't take you away from where you're living. And you can stay there.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Is that right?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: But those are all lies.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: That's not true. I didn't take a knife on the foster mother.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I did not graffiti the house. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I did not do any of those things.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: They're all lying.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Well then what you and I have to do then is to gather the information to show that they (inaudible at 0:07:54.2) worry about that because they were just all lies. And that they don't have to worry that you're going to ever threaten anybody again because it didn't happen. And that you – [0:08:02.8]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. But the police have a report. And, you know they always believe –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh. Really?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Them. They never believe me.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: You know?</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So we are going to have to work with this. They've got a report. We're going to have to be able to show how even though this report's there; your actual behavior isn't anything like that report. Is -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Because I'm not – I'm not like that.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You're not that way. Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I'm not violent.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Right. Well, so that's some of what we're going to have to do about getting you to let them stay where you are is to show that you're not the way that everybody keeps accusing you of being. Right?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And, would you be willing to work on proving to them that they're wrong and that you don't have an anger or violence or threatening problem? And that this was just a set up or whatever or the police misunderstood what you were doing or whatever?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. I want to prove them all wrong –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Because they're all lying about me.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Well, I'd be willing to work on that with you. Now, that may – I mean where do you want to work? Are you willing to work with this on – with me or – and keep coming here? [0:09:04.5]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: You're as good as anyone else. Sure.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, I don't know if I'm any good but I'd be willing to work on – now you – now what's that again we're working on – that you want me to work on the most?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I don't know. (Yawns) I kind of forgot. Hmm –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Ah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Something about staying with my family?</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: That's what I thought. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Is that still the most important thing that you want me to work on until you -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean we could work on being not tired if that's more important to you.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No. I just get tired when I do things I don't like to do.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. So. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, that's why we'll keep this as short as possible because I'm going to let you –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Oh. Good. Good. Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. No. I know you don't want to be working on this for a long time. The main thing is if we can gather the information to show you don't have any of these problems then we can – I can write a letter and say don't worry about this. He's not doing this stuff. He's shown that he's not dangerous and making threats. And then they won't move you. Right? Is that your understanding? [0:10:01.8]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Well, I mean we could always try but they always switch things. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Before you know it they'll say I have to get A's or something crazy. I mean –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I think it would – yeah, I'm willing to try it but I'm just –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Letting you know.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: That you know the system doesn't seem to be working well.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: And they just always drop the ball and –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Well –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: That's what you and I have to work on. And if we discover one of those things where there's – they dropped the ball, I'm going to try to help you with it. I mean I don't have all power but I'm willing to work with you on this. Now, do you know the list of things that they say that you do that you say you don't do which we then have to show them that's not a problem? I mean you mentioned a bunch of things like –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Threats and probation you said. What you have to get off probation?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Will you have to get off probation? Will you have to not (inaudible at 0:10:46.2)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Well this upcoming court case with assault. But again, it wasn't my fault.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Okay. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I mean it was mutual so I don't see –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Why I'm getting –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: The ticket and the problems.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: See I don't know that whole list of things that they think that you have a problem. So, do you have a list or is that something you'd be willing to work on for us to find out together what is this – [0:11:05.0]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: List of things that they (inaudible at 0:11:06.4)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Probably ask my aunt. She usually takes care –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Of that stuff.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I wasn't really paying much attention.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Well, I'm willing to ask your aunt. So we can bring her in? That's something you're willing to do? Have me - ?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: But doesn't that mean I have to be here longer?</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, aren't we trying to get you to be staying with them? So we have to get whatever information we have to prove –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: (Sighs) Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So how long that takes depends on – I mean if you don't show up, it's going to take longer. If you don't – if we don't have the information, it'll take longer. So that's why I'm just trying to find the quickest way to get the whole list of things that everybody's worried about. So how about this? I'll find what I can find out in terms of this list because we probably have it in previous records.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: If you could think about the list. Now when you say do you have to be there, if you don't know what the list of things we're working on is, you're the first person that needs to know. So yeah –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You have to be there to know what people are accusing you of if that's not true. [0:12:01.9]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Well the main thing is fighting at school.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Fighting at school. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: They say one more time and I'll be suspended. And then –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Be taken to court. I don't know. They just said (inaudible at 0:12:10.6)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Oh. Okay. So that's No. 1 you think. No. 1 is not fighting at school.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I think that's their No. 1.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: It's not my No. 1.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: But –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well, what would be your No. 1 thing to prove that you are – should be allowed to stay with the family? Are there any other things that you -?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I think they should just know my family is crazy. Of course, they're going to – I mean it's them not me.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Well, are they the ones you want to stay with (inaudible at 0:12:34.8)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No. No. But my mom, you know the rest of them.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: The rest are crazy.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well how about this because I don't want to keep you too long here. I know that you don't love being here too long. And I don't want you to be here long. So, how about you list all the lists, your No. 1 about what would help you to stay where you're put with this family. I'll find out the list of what other people are saying. We can meet with your aunt to find out what she knows. And we put together a list of the top things that are going to keep you – that we have to work on to keep you where you're at. And when we meet next time, we start making a list of the most important things to work on to keep – to prove that you shouldn't be sent away anywhere else. Would you be willing to do that or not? [0:13:19.7]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well you don't sound – I mean what are we working on again?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No. I want to stay with them. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Okay. All right. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: It just sounds like a lot of work that I just you know.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So yeah. Yeah. No. No. I mean you don't –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: That's a lot of work.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: I mean we don't have to work on this if there's something else you want to work on.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Oh, they're going to make me do it anyways –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So I might as well do it.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Well, so why don't you then think about what would be the top reasons you should stay with your family. I'll find out what things they're worried about. We'll put our heads together.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And then –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Can we work on my list first though because I don't really like their list.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well I'd be happy to work on your list first.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: If that's going to work. I mean if you work on a list that they say no, we don't care rather that – that's not what – how we're going to make our decision then we might have to talk about it. But no, I'd be willing to work on your things first especially if that's going to get you to be able to stay there. That's what we want to work on, right, getting you -? [0:14:08.2]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. All right. Now, so great. So you bring in your list. Now of course, if you don't bring in your list next time we meet that's going to make this process longer. So if we want to be as fast –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: As possible –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Make sure you bring the list.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I'll bring it. I'll bring it.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And I'll bring my list. And then we'll go on.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Okay Anthony thanks a lot. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Thanks.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: We'll see you next week then. Okay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All right, thanks. </p>

<p>(Clapping)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: That's – stay there. Stay there. All right.</p>

<p>(Clapping)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Now –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Did I give you too much attitude?</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: No. You –</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Okay.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Were a –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Because I was just –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Very polite adolescent. Yeah. Now as Anthony, not as your worker watching Anthony but just being Anthony; I don't know how much you felt you could get into the role. But just being Anthony, how did that feel? Did we feel like we were fighting? Or did you feel like we were working together?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Or did you feel I was forcing you to do something or what? [0:14:58.7]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: It felt forced but it felt forced because I knew I had to do something.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So you just kind of kept trapping me into making me do stuff.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: I see.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So I felt – I felt -</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: (inaudible at 0:15:09.7) wait, I have to say yeah now (inaudible at 0:15:11.6)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So it was hard to be resistant (inaudible at 0:15:14.0)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. It was very hard to be resistant.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And it (inaudible at 0:15:17.3) because now you're kind of being held accountable which you kind of didn't want to be (inaudible at 0:15:21.4)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. No. I totally wanted everyone else to deal with it. Not me. So.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. It was much more fun to blame everybody else. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So forced in that way but not forced in the sense of, I mean, that I was making you do something against your will or –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: No. I mean you kind of made it clear I could back out. But every time –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I wanted to I was like but I – I'm thinking if I'm him, I can't.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Because I want to stay. So I'm going to have to –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You want to stay.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Decide. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Yeah. So it –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Which one.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Kept coming back to well what do you really want?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: You can not do any of this stuff but what are we working on again? </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I like how you kept coming back to it.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Because I was really quickly already trying to space out like he would.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: So it was good that you bring it back around.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Okay. All right and so it felt somewhat collaborative even though you didn't want to be here is what you were saying? [0:16:05.4]</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay. Well that's a right answer so we better stop there. </p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Now as the worker now, you're going to have to work with him. Did any – did you get any sense about what you might do when you see him based on what you experienced here or not?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. I put more responsibility on him.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Kind of just show the (inaudible at 0:16:24.3) different choices and see where he goes with it.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Put it more on him verses me saying well let this goal. Let's go for the goal. Come on. You know you said you want to do this.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right. </p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Instead of like encouraging and kind of being –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: A mom almost. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: I'm like come on. Being more like now these are your two choices and deal.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: He's 17 (inaudible at 0:16:43.6)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So you felt yourself being a bit of a cheerleader or trying to –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: In a way do more work than he's doing. He's sort of sitting back –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: (Yawns) Oh, well you know.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. Which I can't stand. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: It's so irritating. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Right.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: That's right. Yeah. So whenever you feel like you're doing more work than him –</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah. [0:17:01.1]</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Or more into let's go for the goal. Rah. Rah. Razz. You know this.</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Well then that's a form of arguing. It's a more – yeah. All right, so you back off that and come back to what are we working on again?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yeah.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Remember, he showed up so he wants something. Otherwise he wouldn't be there, right?</p>

<p>CHRISTINA: Yes.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All right, so just sit there tight for a second and let's get any questions or responses or observations from you seeing that role play. Any questions or thoughts that you had in seeing the role play from your point of view? Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: Not on role play but a comment. I'm looking back to a case I had one time where the kid sitting in that chair wasn't as polite. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>MALE PARTICIPANT: He was aggressive and hostile and combative (inaudible at 0:17:47.7) So how would you have dealt with that?</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So if you had – he was saying if somebody was more aggressive and combative. But if he was here, now obviously if he was about to punch you, you'd have to set some limits. But again I would want to reframe that and say well, thank you for being here but you seem to be so angry about. I mean what is that about? I mean you – I didn't drag you in there. I mean what would have happened if you didn't? I mean if this is a kid who comes into the appointment but he's angry and – yeah. I'd say remember the first principle is express empathy. Wow, you sound really furious and I don't blame you for being mad but I don't even know what you're mad about. I mean you're here so what -? [0:18:25.1]</p>

<p>Now if he's about to punch you, you have to set that limit – whatever. But if not, the first thing is empathy about what are you angry about? And anyway, what are you here for? I'm just here trying to work out how to help you. And you chose to do it. Remember Anthony said they made me come. Now that – the only person who can say they made me come is if you – if the person gets dragged into your office with their heels dragging like in those peace protests.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: And somebody slams them in the chair, wraps a chain around them, locks them in then gets a whip. And every word they utter is only at response to being whipped. That person can say they made me come. But if they walked in, they chose to be with you. Thank you for choosing (inaudible at 0:19:11.0) What's the most important thing? So I would first go for empathy. What are you angry about? What do you want? And go from there. Yeah. [0:19:18.8]</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: I know (inaudible at 0:19:20.3) through all the questions. But I'm wondering about if a similar situation would continue. For example, I have one and they're referred by their teacher for cheating, lying, stealing, failing, depression, anger. But what if there's really no (inaudible at 0:19:37.3) like the school isn't going to take them out. If they do get kicked out of school, they don't care. (inaudible at 0:19:42.5) </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: The student doesn't care about anything. So –</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: (inaudible at 0:19:47.0)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: So this would be a case where somebody where there aren't consequences and nothing. Like in this case, the consequence would be I don't get to stay where I want to stay. But my question would be if somebody shows up and you feel there's no consequence because if they get kicked out of school, that's fine by them. The question is did the person show up to your appointment? So you're talking about a person who actually came into an appointment? [0:20:10.1]</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: It's on campus – school.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: And the only reason they show up is because they send a little slip to the teacher. The teacher takes it to the kid.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: The kid has to come to where he's called. He doesn't want to be there. (inaudible at 0:20:24.5)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All right, but as soon as he finds out that he's got to see a counselor or something; did he run out of the room or did he stay there?</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: He stayed there but it's a stretch to make a 10 minute session. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: Okay.</p>

<p>FEMALE PARTICIPANT: And sometimes he won't even actually answer me. He just kind of stares at (inaudible at 0:20:37.0)</p>

<p>(Overlapping conversation)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTOR: All right so here's a kid who's there even for 10 minutes. But what I'm suggesting is you reframe it in your mind and their mind that if they're there even for one minute, as soon as he found out that this wasn't just a report to get a new free ice cream; that it was to have to talk to somebody and he didn't immediately run out of the room. I'm going to reframe that as he wants something. So I'm going to want to say or work on what is it that you want that you're willing to stay here for 10 minutes? [0:21:07.2]</p>

<p>And sometimes kids come like that because what they want is to get out of a class. I'll see you because then I get to skip geography or algebra or something. So that would be the (inaudible at 0:21:20.7) doing it to – and then say I will work with you to help you to stay out of the class. But why do they want you to come and see a counselor anyway? And, what are they saying that you're doing? Well, I ain't doing nothing. Well yeah, but what are they saying you're doing? Well they say I do this but I'm not doing it. </p>

<p>Now you say what will happen if you and I don't do anything about this? If they say nothing and if it's true that there are no consequences that's where you have to work more with the system to say there's nothing that I can do to make this person change their ways if there's no reason for them to change their ways. And that's where like you work more with the system. So a principal is - the higher the circle of resistance of the identified client the more you work with the system to create the incentives. [0:22:12.6]</p>

<p>If there are no incentives to change, they're not likely to change. None of us would stick to the speed limit if every time you went over the speed limit nothing happened. Right? Afterwards you'd say it doesn't matter. Now, even if it happens that you get a ticket and you don't get a ticket every time you go over the speed limit. So you slow down for the next three weeks and then you're back normal again, right? </p>

<p>So if it's true that you're working with people where there are no consequences for changing their ways then that's what you have to focus on more than on the client. But if they are there even for 10 minutes, focus on why are you even staying here? I appreciate you staying here. Well, it gets me out of class. Well then let's work on getting you out of class. But then we can't do this just to be out of class. And then you go with it from that point. [0:23:04.7]</p>

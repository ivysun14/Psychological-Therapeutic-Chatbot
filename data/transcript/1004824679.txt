<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also need a couple more light bulbs in here. That would help. It's dark.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) A little bit. It's atmospheric.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. That's generous.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I started physical therapy today, which is nice. What was good was the physical therapist was very supportive, really nice. The previous physical therapist I had seen, pretty much ignored me and was just like, "Go do this," and then would just ignore me for a while. Or if I would say, "I can't do that," they were just like, "Yes, you can," and it wasn't very helpful. But she was attentive to what I was doing and what I was feeling and just conferred and all of that. [00:01:12] She also had asked me if I was changing my work schedule. She was the one I had talked to about going on short-term disability; and she was like, "Working full time, going to class, plus physical therapy is a lot." It was just very nice to have her be, not just supportive, but being like, "Yes, this is a problem that you're having and you need to work on it," affirming that it really is an issue, so it was really nice. [00:02:02] At the end it was kind of—I don't want to say depressing—but I was also talking about how I was having a lot of lower-back pain and she was like, "Yeah, basically you developed a habit of walking and standing and holding your whole body incorrectly." (sniggers) I was just like, "Ohhh." I was kind of aware of it. It's like you walk to compensate and that can cause problems, but it was weird to sort of hear, "Okay, your back isn't in with the correct position," and it really hurt. And she was like, "Watch yourself in a mirror while you're walking steps." I was like, "Oh. I'm listing to one side." She was like, "You need to concentrate on not doing that and that's part of the exercise." [00:03:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Will the physical therapy likely ameliorate it or help ameliorate it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. It probably will. It's sort of like practicing a new way of doing something. You have to do it a lot. It kind of reminded me of when I did sports in high school and we would just train on doing the same motion over and over and over again to make yourself . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did field hockey. I was a goalie for a couple of years. It was strange. It was kind of enjoyable, kind of not. I did all the same exercises everyone else did but I had 20 pounds of gear. I didn't understand why that was a thing that we did. [00:04:16] It just sucked because I'm like, "I'm really sweaty and disgusting." And, yes, I'm totally the slowest one doing a sprint because I'm wearing . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All that stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like leg pads and crap. The other thing was afterwards—I did physical therapy, I went to go vote, and then I got home and was just exhausted. I passed out for a couple of hours. This was the other thing that I had forgotten how tiring exercise is at first. I really like lifting weights a lot and I used to bicycle pretty frequently and I just kind of forgot that, at first when I was doing that, I was like, "Oh, my God. I've done this for ten minutes. I'm going to die." And then it gets better. But (laughs) I walked for three minutes with a little bit of weight and I was exhausted. One of the exercises was basically a yoga pose and I was like, "This is exhausting. This is horrible." On the other hand, I feel like it's probably doable. The thing that's frustrating for me more than anything is that there are a lot of things that are uncomfortable to do, like walking up stairs and riding things that no one who looks at me thinks it should be a problem. If I get on the bus I should really ask the bus to lower, but I don't always remember to because whenever I ask the driver always looks at me and I have to repeat it for them to lower the bus. Or, like here I just grabbed onto the stair edge, it's like, "Oh, you can just take the stairs." I can't do the stairs. [00:06:36] This is just frustrating and also doing those things anyway would be bad for me and would cause injury or, at least, a lot more pain. I guess that's part of what I've been doing at work a lot, just being like, "No, it's fine." I'll just do whatever and continue working while I can't sit up straight. "No, it's fine," and I'm also thinking that six weeks is probably not long enough of a leave. Once I start being like, "I'm not going to be getting up and going to work and doing all of these things." I started thinking about it more on Friday. I was like, "You know what . . ." Not being able to stand up straight after sitting at work is bad, especially when it happens multiple times. I guess I hope for a lot in physical therapy working and am more that it just takes time. It just takes time. [00:08:09] It's definitely hard to concentrate on doing schoolwork. The other reason why I'm having a hard time concentrating on doing schoolwork is because of the election. I decided to just not do anything until tomorrow because I've been trying to do an assignment and I was like, "Oh, my God. No." There is just no point. (sighs) The other thing about being home is that my cat has a cold again. When she gets a cold I have to wipe her nose, which is hilarious and kind of sad because she has all this congestion. She won't eat sometimes because of all the congestion. (sighs) We just bought another cat and another friend's dog is dying so I'm thinking about it a lot. I don't mind caring for her a lot. I don't mind spoon-feeding her. She still seems perfectly happy, toying around, doing her little cat things, but it's really awful to think about her being at the end of her life, especially when I look at old pictures because I have a ton of pictures of her. She's been a fat cat and now she's so, so skinny. [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:04) being a little bit fatter, so it's kind of weird to see him being more adorably touchy, although he still bites and claws, and her being skinny. I guess basically what I'm thinking about is the election, my cat, physical therapy . . . I don't know. (pause) Last night I mentioned to Ashby your comment that I would feel better if my mom took anti-anxiety medication. (sniggers) She was still like, "Yeah. That would be really awesome." Ashby's mom started taking some anti-depressant after Ashby left home for college, a while after. A little later she was like, "Sorry, Ashby, for being kind of a dick at certain points. Sorry." I just find it great how her mom is much, much better to deal with now, although for her she feels like it's too much water under the bridge. Then I'm like, "Oh, God. What if my mom wasn't anxious? It would be so nice." [00:11:38] Not even anxious, but just not controlling in weird ways. It would be awesome if she was more expressive about the emotions and having them and all of these things, but I don't think that's going to happen realistically. I don't think that she's suddenly going to be like, "Oh. I have them." Then it's okay for me to have them. That would be awesome. It's also kind of odd to think about [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:30). Are my parents expressive with themselves in private? Part of me thinks they have to. It's like they've been married for a really long time and care about each other, et cetera; but then I think maybe not, which is also very disconcerting. It's kind of like my mom asking my brother things about his wife. [00:13:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It has an effect on her own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that we have such a different [phenomenal] (ph) concept of romantic relationships and when I think about it I guess part of what's weird about it is I never think of my parents as having said, "You know, it's really great to not talk to your partner or spouse." And yet, that's kind of what they do. (pause) [00:13:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's different growing up. You said she's pretty different from how she was and maybe as a response to what happens with your brother. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. I definitely have memories of her being more physically affectionate. When we camped and were folding up the tents, closing them up long-ways and kind of meet in the middle, they would often kiss in the middle and kiss when they were folding. They would hold hands periodically. Through high school I remember wanting to go to the house for some reason and they were holding hands quietly and talking about probably college for one of us. [00:14:59] They really don't anymore. [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:02) I'm not around at the time anymore. They're also both incredibly awkward with expressing physical affection towards my brother and me, which is a change. They never have been very good at displaying affection, but I feel like they used to be somewhat better at it. Now if my mom hugs me, it's a really stiff and awkward, kind of artificially jovial thing. It's almost like I'm hugging a co-worker or my boss or someone who I don't really know. It always feels forced in this really weird way and makes me really uncomfortable. In my head I'm almost like, "I don't want you to do that. I don't want this creepy artificial hug," or "You really pat my shoulder way too hard or pinch my cheek," which she never did. I understand what they're trying to do; it's just coming out a whole other way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it was pretty easy when you were a kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I would more often initiate that, but still if I was upset my parents would definitely hug me. I remember college graduation was not super awkward. It was the culmination of whatever. I guess it's hard to think about how long it's been; but I guess it's been a while that it's been hard that when they express affection it feels strange. And I want them to but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But it's strange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's no good way to say, "You're being weird about hugging me or expressing affection. Please stop," or "Please change," because it's kind of hard to explain what it's like, except that it's weird. (pause) [00:18:31] It make me wonder if in doing their focus support group—it's almost like someone told them they should be more physically affectionate or hug my brother and me more and so they're like, "Oh, right. We're supposed to do that thing," except I can't really imagine anyone saying that. (pause) [00:19:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there is a forced quality. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've also gotten used to a lot of easy casual hugging with a lot of people that I know who are friends, which makes me feel it more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. It really stands out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it's kind of like they don't really know you guys as grownups. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you're the one living in this body along with their kid. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It sort of sounds really creepy in a science-fiction horror movie kind of way. [00:20:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's because I read too much science fiction. (both laugh) Wow, I wish there was a brain transfer. But, yeah. Some of the awkwardness is like when she's pinching us in the back and I'm like, "Agggh. That's what you do that to little kids, except you never did that to me as a little kid."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I'm not sure your mom interacts much with the adult part of your personality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. (pause) It's odd because she definitely has a lot of . . . sometimes I feel like she doesn't quite believe I'm 37. I also think when I'm in arguments with her sometimes I think, "My God. I'm 37. I shouldn't be this stressed or upset." One of the things I was texting about not coming over for Thanksgiving and Ashby was like, "You know, as an adult [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:12)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's funny I think you've said something sort of similar to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just really hard because I'm like, "No, but . . ." And she was like, "Even if she drove here and came to the door and said, 'You have to leave,' you (sniggers) don't actually have to leave." Yes, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I imagine that Ashby's and my reactions suggest is that you have some feeling or belief that actually she's going to send you to your room or ground you or something. [00:22:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really feels like I'll get in trouble in some way for it. It's sort of like in class and in school, a lot of students who are younger are really concerned about X, Y, and Z. I'm like, "This grade doesn't matter. You just need to pass. Don't worry about it." That's a terrible thing to tell people, except it doesn't matter. (both laugh) With this [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:28) we're having, a lot of them seem completely freaked out and convinced they will never get a job if they don't understand this one part of [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:38). I'm like, "Seriously, no one cares." I really kind of do want to just explain, "You just need to pass this class. You should pay attention. That's about it. At no point in your work life will someone quiz you on this." I just think about how I understand that she can't send me to my room or ground me or anything else because I'm a grownup with independent finances and a life and everything, but . . . [00:24:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but there's a somewhat sort of usual version, especially like in the first few years after leaving home. When you were 20 it was probably like, "Okay, when I'm talking to my parents I'm like 15 again." But this sounds kind of more extreme than that. Clearly, both of you. It seems like it's more on her side. I don't know. It doesn't quite sound like at 16, it's younger in a way. [00:25:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. My parents weren't that controlling when I was 16. Also, I couldn't do anything when I was 16.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also you might not have been that scared when you were 16. Even at camp which you hardly ever did, at least that's my sense of it, like, "Okay, they're going to ground you or they're going to take away something that you want or not let you do something that you want to do. That may suck, but . . . " Do you know what I mean? There's like a level of anxiety that's more like a little kid. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's true. In college when we were deciding what we were going to major in I was the only person in my department who wasn't worried about telling my parents and frustrated about going into ornithology. Everyone else was freaked out. I'm just like, "It's happening." I called and I was like, "So you guys aren't mad?" and they were like, "No. We knew this would happen." I think my mom made some comment like, "We'd be more confused if you weren't." [00:26:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your folks backed down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was probably like English maybe. I think I might have even said, "I could major in English, nahh . . ." My mom was like, "That's completely stupid. It's obviously what you want to do." I was like, "Yeah. Okay." Their comment about me being terrified over the weekend—I hadn't really thought about it that way, but that is pretty much how I felt. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's sort of just you and something that you're kind of doing. I think it's something between you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like our interaction. [00:27:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like you both have this fantasy of you being pretty young and very much under her wing and her control and there being a kind of danger in your seeing it otherwise. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She's actually more—I don't want to say involved—but more concerned about what classes I choose than when I was actually in college. She was completely freaked out for a week when I talked about taking [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:57) on my course and then eventually . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something just occurred to me. One thing that I thought a few times and then as we were talking today is that often when an adult child deals [ ] (inaudible at 00:28:28), there's a real regression on their part and the part of the parent where they become very close and very dependent, very dependent. It's like there's this real return to when [Wanda] (ph) was really little and needed that kind of help and you see it on both sides. [00:29:03] You see it especially sometimes where the person who has developed it is functionally very dependent on the parent. It's not just a practical thing where the kid needs more help and support and the parent then provides it. There's something much more emotional and primitive about it. Clearly, it's nothing nearly at that level, but I think there's some echo of that and it got displaced onto you, who wasn't the one with the onus in the first place; but somehow it wasn't going to happen with your brother and she did it with you. You maybe did it with her a little bit. I'm not quite sure how that could make sense, but . . . [00:30:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes a certain kind of sense. It doesn't sound wrong. It sounds like, "Oh, yeah. That adds something to it," because certainly when my brother disappeared/ran away when he was in New Mexico my mom was calling me to do research on where he could have gone and try and figure out all of these things. I was [corresponding] with his friends in New Mexico and some other people. So, certainly in that interaction she was definitely like, "Okay, Karen is an adult who is doing adult, independent things." (pause) That's why in a way I don't know if she would do that again. That was something, my mom being like, "Okay, you're an adult. I know you can handle these and whatever." I guess there are ways in which I don't feel like that as much anymore. When I was in school and obviously constantly broke, I would usually buy a one-way bus ticket and make my parents pay for the ticket back because I couldn't afford it. (chuckles) Even the classic they'd give me a ride home and I'd be like "Buy me some groceries because I'm broke." I don't need that anymore. Sometimes my parents will get really into insisting that that's what I'm going to do; like, "Oh, you probably didn't buy a round-trip ticket." I'm like, "No, I did," or like "I didn't because I wasn't sure on the return." [00:32:24] My brother has always been really adamant about not accepting any . . . They give him financial help in some ways, but he's never let them buy him groceries or he doesn't like it if he's home and my mom is like, "Do you want me to buy you a new winter coat?" or whatever. Since he started college that was the thing where he was like, "No. I don't want you to do this," where I was like, "Sure." [00:33:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if this relates to all of her fantasies about your [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:12) disorder or something like that. It's like you're the one she can be doing this with much more so than your brother. Your brother is much more like—yeah. It sounds like she's sort of displaced the whole thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and also my being much more physically close. My brother spent such a chunk of time on the Coast.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On the Coast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he was also not [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:53) [ ] for a while and he was also on the West Coast for a long time, so I was much more available for that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (pause) [00:34:16] I wonder if she's playing a lot of it out with you because she can and it relates to what happened to him and whatever it stirs up for the two of them. She's sort of playing it out in a way that also stirs up a lot for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) The first time my brother ever got engaged, my mom was excited or concerned or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He was engaged to someone else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was engaged to this woman, [Fuson] (sp?)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you had mentioned it a while ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's super depressing. They got engaged.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her family or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, totally her family. Japanese-American. Except for her it's just her whole family has Japanese citizenship and they were living in Japan. Her whole family was extremely opposed to them getting married. They were sort of okay with them dating or they never said anything, but the minute that they got engaged her whole family waged an all-out war to get her returned. It was really weird and awful. That was really horrible. So my brother got engaged to [Tricia] (sp?) and was getting ready to marry her, my mom was sort of having this like, "Yes." She even said Tricia will make sure that he stays stable in this way where—my brother, Tricia and I were like, "What? I don't think it works that way, but sure." [00:36:35] She seemed very like "I don't have to worry about Seth having health problems and that because he's married and has this wife who will deal with that." When Tricia and I were kind of married and you're doing—sometimes she'll bury it some. She's very much like, "Okay. You're like a married adult and you're doing your thing," but then sometimes she doesn't understand why Seth and Tricia might want to spend some time alone. Like during Christmas or anytime the whole family is together she's like, "Why do they go off and be alone for 30 minutes?" "Well, I don't know. They're married. Maybe they like that." I think one time he even said, "Mom, you want grandkids, right?" but we were at a museum. I'm like, "All right, that's true, but it's not what you're getting right now." [00:38:02] It's weird and I think she sees me as because I'm not married, therefore I haven't achieved some kind of adulthood or something. Which is also [ ] (inaudible at 00:38:15) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's got to keep worrying about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because there's no one to take care of me. I'm not attached to anyone. I think she would love to displace that onto my roommate, Ashby.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ashby's going to take care of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think at least part of her desire for my roommate and I to date is because then we'd be dating and my roommate, Ashby, is very prodigal and will do all of these things and I'd be all set—which I don't want to do. It also wouldn't work like that. (pause) [00:39:13] And also her sort of worries about my job have definitely changed over time. Her vocalized concerns now are about I don't have a career or a purpose or I'm not going towards an end goal or something. I don't think she knows what that would be. "But you don't have a career and what if . . ." I'm like, "That's okay." I've talked with her about my dad. "You know people don't do what my dad did—work for AT&T for 30 years." I've worked for the university for 15 years. "It's really weird to work at someplace for a very long time." My mom is definitely like, "You need to have this career that is this one thing that you do until you retire." Getting a [library] (ph) degree is like—that's the thing. I still think it might be that she thinks I'm not going to get married so if I have a job, that's equivalent to marriage. [00:41:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It provides you some sort of structure, stability and support.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One time she said to me that she wasn't going to consider my cats her grandkids. I was like, "Of course not. They're cats." (laughs) Like, "I would never ask you to. That's weird." (both laugh) I guess someone's kid said that. I was like, "No, mom. It's cool. They're animals." But she sort of said it a couple more times or said things since then where I'm like, "No seriously, mom, I'm close with my cats but they're still little, fluffy animals." It was very weird. Last Christmas she bought me a bunch of things that had cats on them or had cat themes. I'm like, "No. I don't collect things with cats on them. I'm just really into my own cats. This is very weird." Also I was opening it and I was like, "What makes you think that this is a thing that I would want?" [00:42:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really doesn't have very much to do with you liking cats. A lot of this stuff is typical in that way. Is she really anxious because you're not married or don't have a career in the way that she defines that? Or you're this huge cat person. She's trying to find these sort of roles for you or something to allay her worries and you don't worry about these things. [00:43:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not worried about getting married or not married.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I certainly have never heard you talk about that or maybe once in a while some of the career stuff will come up, but it's never like, "Gosh, I wish I had something to do so I felt secure." It's always more like, "Ehh, I'm still in college. Half of me wishes I was doing something more like some others are doing, but I'm so glad I'm not." That's what comes up to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think my cats are child substitutes because if I don't have a kid, that's okay. I'm still like, "Well, at some point soon it's kind of like I guess my ovaries are done with that," but I'm not particularly anxious about it or feel like I'm a failure because I never had a kid. [00:44:27] But I think my mom thinks that I care much more than I care, in ways in which like I previously had discussions with her where I'm just like, "Mom, I'm not getting married anytime soon." And she was just like, "Okay. That's fine." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's different. We can stop now. I think the code works the front desk, because that's how I got down to the lobby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then what was the other one?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: #.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

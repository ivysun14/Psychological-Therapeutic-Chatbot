<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Client 1922-038. This is Client 1922-038. This is Session Number 1, Session Number 1. </p>

<p>Okay. I don't even know what your last name is so I  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Bradley.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bradley. I guess when you came and talked to Eric he told you about the research and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. You know, and I went to see whoever was doing research and took tests (inaudible at 0:00:47.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:00:49.9) 20 sessions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, uh-huh. I had a question about the going, because I was under the impression it was going to be once a week, which is 10 times 20.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And $20 a week is like a third of my paycheck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm wonder if it could be, you know - exactly how  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I was thinking about that, because when I talked to you earlier [at the big nursing department] (ph) expected to come once a week. Would this work? Could you just pay $10 a week now and then, you know, $10 a week until you finish?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. All right. There isn't any particular or right place to start. I think it's better to (inaudible at 0:01:36.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well, I decided to - I'd been thinking about going to a therapist for a long time and when I finally decided to go it was because I was together enough that I could make a decision that impacts (ph) have been too confused and too afraid to go on to that [end, money] (ph) so, you know, what (inaudible at 0:02:04.0)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I usually - or - well, I dropped out of school, I think I had to [pay for] (ph) NYU after three years. I had all sorts of (inaudible at 0:02:15.9); couldn't do my work, so (inaudible at 0:02:19.5) to do. And I had these periods of real depression and I couldn't do anything; one lasted about three days, all night. I was just incapable of it, and I was about two years that I hadn't done anything that severe, studies. I'm worried about my inability to relate to people. Really afraid of whether I'm being accepted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's really hard to talk about, too, to define.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean that you're lonely and don't have as many friends as you really want (inaudible at 0:03:10.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have a lot of friends and everybody that is my friend says that (inaudible at 0:03:16.6). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A friend that doesn't really help me to feel like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, to feel satisfied.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:03:24.5). And most of my friends are female friends, and I have male friends but they're harder for me to relate to (inaudible at 0:03:39.9). It's not that I lack friends, it's such (inaudible at 0:03:46.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're having trouble relating especially to men.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you want maybe something like quality relationships?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I always feel like I'm playing a game. I'm not - often not relating to people as people and I feel that they're relating to me that way and  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Almost as if you're lost and going through [a set of] (ph) emotions.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And people like me because I listen now, you know, which means I know how to sit there and shake my head when - at the proper time and seem as though I understand so I'm on, but that's not necessarily true. Also, I have this feeling that I'm not coming to grips with most of the decisions that I really have to make; that's concerning my career. I have no initiative to get my [mission on] (ph) complete.</p>

<p>Do you have to answer the phone?</p>

<p>And the problems that I have with my family I'd just - rather than try to deal with them, I just try to escape. I dropped out of school because I couldn't do anything. Rather than do something I'm afraid to do, I just don't do it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're avoiding this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely. And it makes me feel I'm very empty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, (inaudible at 0:06:05.4) maybe you are empty because the things you should be doing, like you're not doing them, and so you're not involved in what you really should be involved in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I feel not involved really in much of anything. Nothing is - I mean if I don't come to school it's a game (inaudible at 0:06:29.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My relationships with people are (inaudible at 0:06:33.8). And so yeah, empty is just the only way to describe it. It's not getting really unhappy and not depressive all the time. Sometimes I wish, you know, I could be really depressed. Well, you'd be afraid when you leave something to do - just something halfway and ordinarily a client isn't being any good at  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you understand what follow-up (ph) means?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:07:13.7) </p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess what you're thinking of is something along the lines of trying to turn around and then start dealing with some things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm, yeah. I have very little self-confidence in that. My intellectual forte is my - being as a person, as a woman (inaudible at 0:07:47.1) which is the reason why I go and do these things. I'm afraid I'm not going to be successful. I'm afraid it's going to be (inaudible at 0:08:00.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't - I don't try to do these things. You know, (inaudible at 0:08:06.2) another one that I'm frightened to know them, or likeable, all those sorts of things, but it just doesn't win.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, like you don't believe it, in a sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way that would do you any good anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you let (ph) something do you feel like what you're saying is - like it would stupid in a way? And if you're meeting a person you don't feel like you're making them like you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it took me months and months to develop all that shit, seeing maybe a new face, someone every day (inaudible at 0:09:11.1). But it's months before I feel comfortable with anybody and can just be myself and not be worried about say this, do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:09:28.2). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was when you were really a long time being subconscious and careful and sort of testing out what you do as (inaudible at 0:09:44.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'm not really sure what sort of expectations I have for myself and whether they're my own expectations or whether it's because of what my parents want. And I can't really sort out lots of times how I feel about something from what I really feel like that. But when I - I feel like that because I think I'm supposed to but whether or not you'd stay (inaudible at 0:10:15.1) high. Sort of lost touch with the basic commotion for long (inaudible at 0:10:26.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can't really definitely say this is what I want, this is what I feel like, this is what I am. </p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:11:01.3). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:11:18.5)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Saturday night  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow. Are you cutting down now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I am trying to cut down. That's not why I'm... About to say, Saturday night I had this really strange experience of - for 1-1/2 hours of it, sort of a d�j� vu thing; where anything I saw I had seen it before and I just couldn't get myself out of it. And then I said to myself, "Well, I won't look at things." Everything I saw and had seen before it was like a dream that I had or something, but I don't really think it was. So I closed my eyes and not even remember having decided not to look at things as well. (Inaudible at 0:12:03.1) no way to get myself out of it, and it just went on and on and on. And I happened to be on grass (ph) at the time but it was really scary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, very painful of  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just goes on and on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if I, you know, understood it fully but what comes to my mind about what you said is that - like sort of being forced to look at yourself and not hating what you see or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that makes sense, sentiment. It happens - it often (inaudible at 0:12:37.4) at a stop sign because it often happens when I do that. But even when I'm under any sort of artificial stimulation, sometimes happens where there's self-analytical and I do something and I think why did I do that? And I think why am I - worth (ph) want to do that? And more than that I (inaudible at 0:13:02.3) and then continually trying to extract experiences.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just reaches a level of certain infinite regression. I used to feel like I was in this sort of constellation (ph) that it kept getting narrower and narrower until it just sort of tapered out and then it was completely immobilized.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what happened during that three-day period when I couldn't move and then it went away. I don't really know how it went away. I didn't talk myself out of it. I didn't come to any insight, it just stopped. And I get really frightened now. I don't know how to deal with it. How am I  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I guess what happens is that you get - the farther away from your experience in life, the more abstract it gets. So you more what (ph) - to feel less and less real and you start feeling less real, and then that gets scary because you're not from part (ph) real life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I live with it and understand it and don't know how to deal with it (inaudible at 0:14:36.8). You'd have to go to sleep, which is what I usually end up doing is trying to - I guess trying to avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It isn't going back though, I mean that's - when you say (inaudible at 0:15:08.9) I guess another (inaudible at 0:15:12.2) that this to be more clear about what you're feeling and to feel more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have more ups and downs and more queer, distinct feelings that - you know, that you know what you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And be able to wind it until it's justified in the situation or whether that I'm manufacturing things that people are doing to me or looking exactly what is real about what I'm going through and what I'm making up. Why should I be frightened when is it really irrational to be afraid of this and just, well, doesn't it matter what somebody thinks about you, things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess that must be another way that you don't feel quite in touch with your feelings or that like you don't know how to look cool. You don't know how to take the feeling that you have, other than take it as a serious and justifiable foray (ph), sort of irrational (inaudible at 0:16:35.8) as opposed to being shoved off in the corner.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm also really worried about my parents. I've lost about 50 pounds in the last two years and I feel really guilty whenever I'm eating. I don't understand exactly why I'm doing it, but I'm more likely to eat when I'm feeling guilty about my life, unhappy, and it's really impossible for me to go on some sort of a strict diet, except when I'm really busy and when I'm not feeling depressed, which doesn't occur very often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that happens to me too; that your - generally all of our (inaudible at 0:18:34.9) and I was sort of, you know, feeling the energetic or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's not that because I (inaudible at 0:18:56.9) it's more related to how anxious I am about different anxiety levels or something. When I'm really anxious I more likely to eat, which makes me really anxious about  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which makes me eat more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you get into a spiral.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And you know, I realize that that's what's happening, but there's - (inaudible at 0:19:18.8) you can do with the pain.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But (inaudible at 0:19:25.1) the trouble with what I'm saying is how you react to the first time you eat something you shouldn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like your own reaction to it makes it all worse than like  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Your impulse is to have to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you feel sometimes disgusted with yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. Yeah. I just can't have them - in a world I can't decide to do something I can't (crosstalk). The same thing with my school work that I just couldn't do. It's not worth it yet to do it, or lots of little things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And somehow you can't respect yourself and you can't - almost like you can't paste (ph) yourself if you can't do what you decide to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess also I'm getting this slant (ph) and drifting and...</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes it doesn't bother me because I can feel like a drifter, and you generally can tell [when what's] (ph) coming on and stuff by what you're doing, where are you going, what are you going to be doing in five years. I just have to make some kind of decision, you know, and do something and then when I worry about it (inaudible at 0:21:17.5) to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. I don't think I quite understand that, Mary. It's just (inaudible at 0:21:33.6) like the more you were (inaudible at 0:21:37.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but then I worry about having to make decisions, you know. And now I worry about having to do with, you know, less able to have (ph) to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:21:50.2).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't consciously (inaudible at 0:21:54.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or just a waiting (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: - together and thinking about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that you get so upset with how you're not doing it that you haven't gotten any strength left over to get into discussions? Is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like I'm afraid to do it. Hey, I really don't understand it. I mean it's like a fear. I'm afraid to do this thing, but why I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it's because I think I'm [off there} (ph). But I think that this becomes sort of paralyzing, to be conscious that I'm afraid of doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being afraid of being afraid of doing it, yeah, so it freezes a lot of the capabilities. I'm able to deal with, well, the job I have now, which is, well - I think because it's so unchallenging, I mean (inaudible at 0:23:09.6). And somehow I can go in there and I have certain responsibilities and things that I have to deal with and I can do all the time, but it doesn't challenge me. I'm not involved [if I'm] (ph) working; therefore I can do it. (Inaudible at 0:23:24.7) telephone operator, and I could do it and do, you know, one job. But I think it wasn't (inaudible at 0:23:32.2) challenging. I don't want to have to do things all my life that I'm not afraid of doing, because like I said, it's not the damn contest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, yeah. You want to be able to do something that doesn't involve you and is challenging you, and it would - just routine that you can take care of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But somehow I'm afraid of getting involved in things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Well, like when you're sitting down in the chair and starting to think about writing a paper, like, do you have a moment of anxiety before you think of an excuse?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't really say that I do. I usually get really involved in research. I'm really interested in what I'm doing now. It comes time to write it and it's just impossible to order this to say what needs to be said and that gives it (inaudible at 0:25:00.9) always so much stuff and it's always confusing and then it's - and it's not going to get into any kind of reasonable order that I can deal with it. And I'm usually afraid of - you know, even in a riot (ph) just to break on something, to say this is the way it is, tomorrow is (inaudible at 0:25:27.4) even decisions about - the job decisions from research; it's very indecisive for (inaudible at 0:25:44.0) study. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not lying to you and referring to (inaudible at 0:25:51.8) taking a position which (crosstalk).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:26:11.7) not wanting to appear - (inaudible at 0:26:00.7) say something that maybe isn't true because of something else so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just that you're aware of all the little things that, either way, that you'd like to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you can't say it, just say it like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Sometimes it feels like the easiest thing would be just like to stop trying to make decisions, stop - I'm just going to stop everything and I thought of that in CSI (ph) and Warren (ph) got me really frustrated and disgusted with my (inaudible at 0:27:29.9) was saying the only way to go would be to stop trying to head them off, which is frightening. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because not to be able to act seems like abject (ph) - an off grade (ph) what a person should be to... And I guess that wasn't right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm not exactly, but I don't know how to say it any clearer. Now, I'm not holding myself up against any ideal (inaudible at 0:28:37.1). It's just that what I'm doing isn't worth it to me and it would be easier for me not to do it. I'm not dissatisfied necessarily with myself in a relationship and outside, you know, standard (ph). But I just feel empty in myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Just that you're not engaged in something meaningful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I feel as if the problem is with me. I'm not - that loss (inaudible at 0:29:33.2) could be me, but I'm not making it  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I really don't want any like (inaudible at 0:29:40.2) on my job or at Brightonand I always bring the stuff. I'm not getting as much out of it as I should. Of course I could...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Perhaps also you just get tired of trying and trusting (ph) within yourself and not being able to be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just really tired, mentally exhausted from fighting with myself all the time and the easiest thing to do is just not (inaudible at 0:30:17.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just gets to the point where you just get so tired of it that, you know, you'd really like to fall (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But that takes some sort of active will, too, to decide this stuff and then I've sort of got 00 that's an inconsistency; if you're not going to decide anything, you can't decide about yourself and I get real (inaudible at 0:30:50.2) the logical (inaudible at 0:30:53.6) of my action.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you can't even say, well, you want to commit suicide because it looks like  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's two definite actions (inaudible at 0:31:04.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you see all of the things that go against it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though the time is starting to (inaudible at 0:31:10.9).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just a big complexity and ambiguity.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it seems like a lot of people that I talk to feel the same, like they're all saying to me - say that they feel the same way, you know, and that doesn't help either, to know that they're weren't any (ph) people to help me and just (inaudible at 0:31:56.8). But it's more frustrating to know that. It makes it seem more impossible for me, for me to get out of it and with some many other people (inaudible at 0:32:05.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You know, (inaudible at 0:32:14.1) well, if there's something wrong with me and that can probably be fixed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah. But there's less hope that I can be fixed if there's so many people that can't (inaudible at 0:32:30.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I half expect that (inaudible at 0:33:13.6) that you badly want to be really living.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure what that means. I can only say that I'm dissatisfied with how I am now. I'm also kind of worried about turning out like my parents, who are both intelligent people and both of them have been alcoholics. My mother has not been drinking for several years and my father is still an alcoholic and there's this tremendous sense of waste there that I have when I see how they turned out and how they despair and how, you know, (inaudible at 0:34:33.6) divorce and I tend to be aware of some maternal or paternal toward my parents, just feeling sorry for them. And I see myself in my mother and in my father, lots of things, and that bothers me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you could so easily waste yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it's enough of a messed up life (inaudible at 0:35:36.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have two brothers that are still at home and I worry about them. I can't really deal with their problems. I can't talk to them about their problems. I can't talk to them about mine anyhow, and so - which is part of my mother's problem; that she could never talk to anyone about her problem, about really how she was feeling. And I could always see her as a child, holding everything in and getting angry, a little nervous, and really unhappy. And so it's like so I've been unable to talk to her about her problems or mine. And I can't say that I got very much from the relationship with my parents, with my family. Now I just basically ignore her; visit her very infrequently and I just hope they're dealing (ph) fine, but I can't deal with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Partly because you can't - there's nothing you can do that's at all helpful or constructive and you were kind of (crosstalk).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're - if I could do that surely (ph), if I could - like I talk to my mother at all, but like it's more - something I have never done. I've always known that I can't talk to her about this because she'll get upset. Or she's got her own problems, or I'm not supposed to know what her problems are. After all, I was the [smallest one] (ph) and wasn't supposed to know that my parents were drunk. I wasn't supposed to know that (inaudible at 0:37:33.4) problems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:37:36.0) I learned I wasn't supposed to know, but of course I did, so I had these contradictions (inaudible at 0:37:39.4) myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you've got all of these sort of inhibitions or rules or something to overcome to be anything genuine and it's like you'll have to acknowledge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then (inaudible at 0:37:58.0) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The rules of the game like - and are really big crust (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the whole thing was forced onto me (inaudible at 0:38:17.6) two or three years now. I received these letters from my grandmother. {Even though] I have different rules (ph) she's not supposed to know that I know about how my parents are and I'm not supposed to know how much she disrespects them on this, this sort of thing. </p>

<p>And she sent me this letter saying that - I guess my mother had started drinking again and it was my fault. I had called up on the phone and realized that she was drunk and then something happened. I guess I couldn't deal with it and I started to cry, and then which made my mother very upset and she was upset about telling me. It's like I don't love her, I can't accept her anyway, which is true. </p>

<p>I get so incredibly tired when that happens and always we just had a hang-up; it was the mother saying that it's my fault that you're into this, on and on, and again, I got really tired (ph) and I started crying and crying and crying, and which I hadn't cried since I was in third grade and I decided not to cry any more because I hadn't cried and had these really embarrassing times to let - to have been so emotional in school. So I just gave it up, not going to do it again, so I just didn't until this time. So it was a really amazing thing for me to adopt and it just brought [her down] (ph) and I find the easiest thing to do is (inaudible at 0:39:53.0) don't have to go through all these emotional experiences. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. It's just so painful and if you're involved you can do damage. If you're involved, can you get partly responsible for what happens? You can't carry the nut (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that doesn't sound quite right. It's not that I'm afraid of being responsible. It's just - I just feel really drowned (ph) in myself when this happens. I feel hurt. I feel how could you do this to me, instead of so much have to do this to yourself, although I'm aware of that, too. But when I'm really going through this thing I just think, you know, how could you do this to me? I feel terrible. I can't deal with this, have you cheated me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like that. It's more - yeah, it really is. I'm accusing them. If I hadn't (inaudible at 0:41:38.0) you're not doing what I think you're  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're not a good mother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why couldn't I have a real mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I know that she's right to [do her] (ph). At the same time I know how she feels. I can really understand why they drink, why a lot of these things have happened, but that doesn't mean that I can stop feeling hurt, that I can all of a sudden say, you know, "It's all right, I can deal with it now," and they feel they still can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's one thing to be able to understand someone who (inaudible at 0:42:34.0) just stop picking at a time (inaudible at 0:42:38.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't really figure out why I feel she gets hurt when this happens. I can't point to anything and say this is what really upsets me. It's sort of out of my control when I get really psyched and demindful (ph), started crying. I guess that's been something I could not handle. I would just - just a path and I couldn't, you know, control it. When I go home now I have this - I'm [always] cheerful, I have no problems. Oh yeah, definitely is fine. We have nice friendly visits, but say absolutely nothing that's important. I hear her trivia, she hears my trivia, but nothing actually important to either of us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interests so many years; like it's been important to keep as much of the fa�ade as possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um-hmm. </p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not even sure that I want to break it down. I can't see myself at all becoming open with her. I just can't even conceive it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would just be really frightening thing. It would be like - somehow be - just seem a very weak thing to do, some sort of admission of weakness or something. I guess I always had to be really strong and take care of things by myself. I just really can't be that - that I could be emotional about this; that I can feel this way, which personally maybe I can't feel  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you want them to be proud of you for being strong or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was always very independent as a child. I was left in charge of the other two kids who were about six. I would be babysitter, which was one of the things my grandmother thought that we - her (inaudible at 0:46:07.6) this issue of challenging me (inaudible at 0:46:11.6). Even at the time I, you know, thought I had to protect my brothers from what I had gone through, from feeling real frightened on the (inaudible at 0:46:30.0) saw things and I wanted (inaudible at 0:46:30.8) protect them from that. So in a way I had to act like an adult (inaudible at 0:46:43.7) then always seemed to be on top of whatever I was doing; I'm always getting good grades in school, doing lots of things, being respected by my teachers. "You're really a good child. You're not what your grandmother tells you you are," you know, in spite of, upfront (ph) what all the rest of my family knew (inaudible at 0:47:16.7) especially be a bad child. In spite of that, I had to be certain [I'm a lost] (ph) child and not doing the wrong things and get good grades and et cetera. (Inaudible at 0:47:32.0). And I lost my train of thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About having that - you should be open with your parents and be (ph) some kind of weakness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, right. (Inaudible at 0:48:10.7) it would make me seem too strong or something, to have been deceived (ph) all this time. But [it's just under the layers] (ph) of deception that - which is sort of the whole stability in my relationship with them; that I had to be cheerful and she has to be such a  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't imagine that [when they do] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. It's as if your cheerfulness with each other is, you know, sort of like (inaudible at 0:48:43.6) it's all right and then (inaudible at 0:48:50.7). I don't know, (inaudible at 0:49:23.4) pain that's more than either of you (inaudible at 0:49:27.5).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so, yeah. And same thing with my father (inaudible at 0:49:46.0) mom; no one respects the rest of his family other than that - the mother, his mother. He really feels like he's not a respectful person (inaudible at 0:49:59.6) he acts.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I realize it so I can't talk to him about it. Again, it's such a long message along [the line] (ph) because I can't imagine him (inaudible at 0:50:12.5) any other way, or him changing or me changing the relationship. In a way I'm sure he acts out of respect (inaudible at 0:50:30.2) because, you know, that it's (inaudible at 0:50:32.4) life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But it won't be - it would be peculiar, difficult thing to do too, to try and talk to him too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always try to be - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's easier now (ph) to reject  - </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't fall apart when he's drunk. I can deal with that. I can like be sympathetic or try not to, well, be disgusted, which I'm really not. I'm just sympathetic with my mother. I just - I'm immediately disgusted, immediately. (Inaudible at 0:51:25.7) it's really tight. Just sort of tighten up and - but I guess there's (inaudible at 0:51:38.8). Yeah, I always thought that this would make me stronger, having had to deal with all these things, and I guess it probably did (inaudible at 0:51:58.4). But now I feel that I'm really weak and I can't be really dealing with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That must be so strange after being that sort of strong, capable child and adolescent to, all of a sudden, end up change over.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I still impress people as being strong and capable but I know I'm not because I can't do - I do things but I'm not (inaudible at 0:52:31.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There are lots of things I did I didn't do a (inaudible at 0:52:34.8) not important, where I do better than someone else but I don't do as well as I know I could. So to me it's still very dissatisfying, whereas to others I appear competent. I just feel really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know, it must be frightening to feel weak and incompetent; looks like your parents.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:53:24.4) for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, okay, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Do I get a bill or how is that handled?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you just bring in $10 and a check on Wednesdays (inaudible at 0:53:47.7). See you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye-bye.</p>

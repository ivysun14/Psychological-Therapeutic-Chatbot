<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. So, I went to couple's therapy with Franklin last week. It was like we, okay, last Monday. So, like not this Monday when there was a hurricane.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But the Monday before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We, we're like have been talking since like Sunday and he was like feeling and I was basically telling, telling him—like he's just been acting all like sulky and like we did shopping and he turned it in to like this sour puss thing, and—. Whatever. And I was like telling him that this is not like conducive to what we're trying to do or whatever.</p>

<p>And he's like "well, I just feel like you weren't trying and so I'm not". And I was like well; you're the one that should be trying in the first place. So, like, I don't know what to tell you. So, we had this whole big thing and like then he was like "well, then I guess we just have to be done" and I was kind of like fine. And then he's like is so fucking dramatic. Defriends me on Facebook and blocks me. Like, you're a crazy person. Then like we talk again on Tuesday morning and we had this appointment for this, for therapy on Tuesday night. So, then I was like well, we have this freaking appointment like we're talking right now again obviously, so like let's just try it. [00:01:27]</p>

<p>So, we went to the therapy. Hold on. So, it's like, I was, obviously like that was an important step and like something like different that we've never done. Blah, blah, blah. And like so I've been thinking about it a lot and like thinking about like we'll see her again probably next week and blah, blah, blah. And then like obviously wants to like talk about it here and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I—he went to therapy on Wednesday and, and I asked him about, you know, like, you know, what did he say about the, how the couple's therapy went or whatever. And he was like "oh, I actually didn't. I like forgot to mention it. I was just talking about some of the other things". And I was like okay and like obviously like yes, I understand like it's his therapy and like whatever. But I guess I just felt like well, I felt like—because we did talk about some stuff in the session that like I thought. I mean that feels important to me. To like kind of talk about individually as well.</p>

<p>And so, like I imagine him just like just talking about like his friends and himself and his life and his whatever. And I feel kind of frustrated at that. I mean, inside of the therapy session, like, it's, I, it's I didn't know what to expect until like the format obviously is different. And so it was more like me. Like we kind of gave her the like lay of the land in terms of our relationship and why we we're there. And I brought that up. [00:02:52]</p>

<p>And then we just kind of like talked about stuff and she just listened and took notes. And, so we started talking about just, you know, our, our conversation kind of was going in terms of like me talking about what happened with the (inaudible at 00:03:04) and how did it happen in the past a couple times and talking about that and then—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who do you think you saw?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did see her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I know I had given you a name that (inaudible at 00:03:16) I referred to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was a while ago, so I—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and she's nice. Whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I've never had a therapist with an assistant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She had an assistant?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like—I was like e-mailing her to like schedule a new appointment and she's like my assistant will and she has two offices. But I was like assistant? Like how does this work in terms of like privacy? Like, I mean I don't care; I'm not like questioning it. It's like, whatever. What do I care?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was just kind of struck me as interesting. I've never experienced that in my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be related to seeing couples because a lot of times one just—I mean people who see couples there's more turnovers. And like, like more people coming in and so—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:03:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so those, seeing individuals and so the scheduling needs are different, So, my guess is that relates to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But anyway, and the conversation kind of then went in the direction of him talking about things that he feels like I don't do. That he wants me to do. Like he talked about like "oh, you know, like I like doing these little things like waking up and cooking breakfast or whatever, but I just wish that you would more" and stuff. It's like okay. And then I was like but I do other stuff that I feel like maybe it's not like the same, maybe like folding the laundry and paying the bills like isn't like the same to you in terms of like doing something sweet? But like for me that's a big deal because like that stuff is work and it is difficult and, I mean not difficult, but like relative to like work. Like hard work, but, you know, and that is something that I think that is one of those little things that he's talking about. So, that like already frustrated me.</p>

<p>Then he like went on to talk about how like he is just so upset because of how like I'm not that enthusiastic to like go out with him and his friends or like when I do I like think I won't have fun, so then I don't dance. And then I, you know, and then I say that you, I, you tell me you don't feel comfortable dancing and this and that and I was like well like, and then, well, I'm just going to say it. [00:05:27]</p>

<p>Like, first of all like I do. Second of all he can like walk in to a place like where there are his friends are there and they're playing the kind of music they like. Like funk and whatever they drink too. And like whether or not there's like a circle. Which there often is like a circle. And then people are going around and doing other things.</p>

<p>Like first of all, like if you think I'm like going to do that then you're out of your mind. And second is like he could walk in and like immediately just like start dancing. Like he's already, like whatever. Like, I need a couple drinks. Like let me have a shot or something. Like, is it okay if I sit here? But, and then, and then he says this statement. He started crying. Like he was like tearing up and crying right with me. I don't mean to laugh at him, but like I'm so mean. And then I started like almost crying because of frustration mainly. Because then he says, "I just, you know, I want to dance with you and I don't and I feel like you don't want to dance with me". And then as far as like his other metaphor. Oh. God. Well, now it is. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I was like—it was funny because I'm like oh. I mean like I know like she's just, you know, whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like in, in the fact, in the context of like how I know how our communication is and how I know how he is. He's like, "yeah, I guess" and it's like well, great now like I don't want to dance with him and funny like he wants to dance with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:06:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really not the case.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I mean for you it is less a metaphor than it was drama.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Drama! Like you're being over dramatic about this and you're really just shrouding the issue which is yours. And, and making this about. So, that was like mainly what we ended up like discussing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she kind of like recapped. Like you feel like this about Trina and what she doesn't do. Blah, blah, blah. And that obviously there are issues of trust like and things were various mutations of trust. And all I could think was I love that like we have some, some super specific conclusion that we've now come to in this first session about like something big that's a thing for about you. But like for me, it's like and then there's like trust issues. Like that's all I walked out of there feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the conclusion?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That like he, you know, oh you feel like this about you, about Trina not wanting to like—not being as like involved or whatever as you wished she would be and then there are the issues of trust. And I was like right, which you don't really even know about yet because we really haven't had a chance to talk about me at all because he took the whole session complaining about me and like making up things that are like an exaggeration of the truth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you had some stuff that you wanted.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but she didn't really focus on that. And I think it was hard to because he kept overshadowing the conversation with stuff. And, well, she was talking on the phone and then she and then I had trusted you too and— and like we've been getting along great all week. We went out on a date on Saturday which he planned which was nice. I couldn't do part of it. Part of the plan was to do bowling and my back. Like I think this last week between that conference that I had going on and just all the stress and everything going on. We had like six events. Like crazy. [00:08:42]</p>

<p>Like I had really. Like I was in so much pain. So, we had dinner and then like some drinks and I literally was like I just like need to keep drinking. Like I, I took like four adalet (ph). We had heat pads like for feet. I was in real severe pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like part of me was like immediately annoyed that he wasn't like well, let's just go home. And I mean part of me was like no, no, let's just keep trying. Well, because then the other part of it was going to this Halloween party that we've gone to every year that this guy throws. It's this big Halloween party that like his crew like gets invited to and they were going to DJ. His crew leader was going to DJ. And then we were there and it was packed. Obviously, I'm not going to like dance. I want to sit in a straight backed chair and like the drinks were gross. It's really sweaty and gross there. I really don't like that party.</p>

<p>And then the like the police came and were like you've got to quiet down so they like took a hiatus from the music and I was like please. And, but it was nice and we've been getting along. And we're going to go back and see her, but I think that like as kind of as predicted like I knew this was going to be difficult because I knew that this would happen. That we wouldn't really be able to talk about the stuff that we still haven't ever talked about. Like, like I would like to, you know, like, I still dwell on the fact that, you know, she once she either realized or was told by him or somebody else that like I found out or whatever about this stuff and that she had sent me that message about like oh, you lied about your relationship. But like you don't even give me an apology after humiliating me and hurting Trina. And, you know, I asked you about your relationship and you lied. [00:10:19]</p>

<p>Like, I still don't know and he claims, you know, well, she probably knows that you were checking them and so she wanted to just get a rise. So, those messages weren't directed at me. Those messages were directed at him. So, whether or not she knows, figured that I would be looking at them if they weren't directed at me. And that's what he's kind of trying to make it seem like. And like that's something that I'd like to like discuss in like a mediated setting. And so like I just need to bring it up and be like this is what I would like to talk about because otherwise it's just going to go whatever direction it goes. Because it's really hard for me.</p>

<p>I mean every time I try to concentrate, I mean it's just like excuses of my excuses about like the girls from the beginning and how he was confused and coming out of that marriage and blah, blah, blah and—but like I don't know his like memory is wrong because he's like no and if you'll notice like I did stop talking to them. And I'm like no, you didn't. Like I checked the phone bills. Like I knew you were still talking to them. You'd see numbers with different names. Yeah that's because they kept texting me and I wanted to know who it was. And I was like well, what about all those texts you answered? Like, what is that? Well, because, like, you don't, like, there's no point in not answering. I was like yes, there is. Your girlfriend says she doesn't want you to. But like, this we didn't get to concentrate on this. Like this conversation like he ended up just turning it in a different direction. So, that she didn't even get to really comment on what I was saying. [00:11:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this a metaphor?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, God. I was like really? I mean it doesn't matter. And I mean I'm sure she was like this is what happens. Oh, he's crying. Oh. Like, so I don't know. And meanwhile, like I, somehow like I just, he complains about money and I'm like you're no longer paying for like anything in terms of like credit card bills. So, that's another $250 in your pocket. I just want to explain something. He does get paid $2,400 a month. His rent is $75. His bills, oh, I'm sorry. $475. His bill are $475. So, that's $550. Then he has like a loan for like $110. Okay, so that's $660. Then he has his phone bill. $100. So, that's $760. Okay. So, $760 out of $2,400 a month. I'm really not sure where the struggle is coming in.</p>

<p>Even if he spent $700 on going out to dinners, he'd still have like a thousand dollars. To like put in savings or whatever. So, I'm really not sure what his, his money struggles are all about. And on top of that, he's told me that he has, he does have I guess like $800. I don't know why he doesn't have more already, but whatever. And, but he has to give it to his ex, because she's still hounding him for money that they like owed on rent. Which, first of all, I'm really not sure what that's about. When I'm done with a relationship, like I'm done. Like, I'm not going to go chasing somebody down for money even if it is $800 or $900 or $1,100. I'm just not going to do it. [00:13:26]</p>

<p>Like, I've walked away from long term relationships I've lost money. I mean, I'm not, you know, just in terms of like whatever. I don't even know. Just random stuff. Like plane tickets or, or things we didn't pay each other back for or whatever. Like, you just move on. Like this is three years already. She has a new boyfriend and I really don't understand the, the preoccupation with like really chasing him down.</p>

<p>So, okay, but secondly I never saw the divorce certificate. And I think he was supposed to go to her like in August or like September. And he hasn't mentioned anything about it and I'm like I don't understand. Did you get divorced? Like why would it take that long for the certificate to come if like they completed all of the court stuff? If they completed everything and they were just waiting for them to like mail them the certificate. I don't know how the court works, but I imagine that it doesn't take that long. [00:14:21]</p>

<p>So, then I keep forgetting to ask him about that and I want to because it's like really? Like what's going on there? I don't know. He's a mess. And he's, doesn't, he's still talking about like not wanting to hang out with friends and I don't like understand. He doesn't like study. Like, I know it's hard to do stuff. Sometimes I like slack on my school work or like don't work out when I say I'm going to or whatever. So, like if he's so bent on like not really hanging out with people that much because he feels like it's a distraction or whatever then why every time I call you are you like watching a movie or like standup comedy or something? Like, if you hate your place so much then like go out somewhere and study. Like go to the library. Like I don't know what to tell you. You know, you bought this bike and I don't understand. He doesn't ride it. Like he wanted to ride a bike. He doesn't want to or doesn't do it. [00:15:18]</p>

<p>And about the money. Like, he said something to me that I was kind of like hmm. You don't see the connection there, but I do. Which was talking about like being out of work. Like, like taking days off or whatever and he's like yeah, you know before, you know, I just like would love to like have like a day off every like couple, you know, week or two or whatever. But, now like I feel like I would rather have like, you know, like I,I need the money. I'd rather have the money. So, you know, I'm not as preoccupied with that. And I'm like oh, you mean because before when I took care of all the bills and made more money than you and you could buy everything you didn't have to worry about taking out, but now you do? Oh, that's called being a grown up. The money thing is, is, is really frustrating. I don't, I really don't understand how he's—what he his issue with money is. That he can't figure out how to save and that he doesn't have, you know, he isn't putting money aside.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't really matter, does it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's just don't complain to me about it. [00:16:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, I mean like— my impression is that, that I think this may be a bit true with the couple's therapy session as well as what you are talking about now. Like, like there's something about being very frustrated and kind of bitter with him or about how it went. That's sort of much easier and more comfortable to take up now, but very hard to take up in the moment. [00:17:22]</p>

<p>You know, like in the couple's therapy session do they—what I suspect you think which is this is bullshit. He's being dramatic. You know, he has this history of like having inappropriate, lots of inappropriate communications with other women behind my back. You know, so then he, as far as I know he was going to go over and see this woman. He told her he would and I don't even know how much of that has happened before and we're not even talking about it here or something. And this is a lot of the problem in the relationship and then you say casually at the end that oh, well I have trust issues. Well, you know, you totally missed the boat. And I don't think I'm telling you something you don't know, but I think I'm telling you something that's very hard to say when you're in there. [00:18:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then similarly with money. He sort of, as long as he sort of goes to quite some lengths to explain how he's wrong or all the things he's wrong about or how irresponsible he's being or immature, but really have a lot of trouble taking it up with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Directly. I mean the thing about thinking about his finances and this and that and the other thing and like it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, you know, let alone like paying the $250 a month on the credit card that he owes half of while he pays his old girlfriend of three years ago $1,100 or whatever it is, nine hundred bucks that he owes her and you don't take it up with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I think you sort of, you know, pretty understandably furious and feeling badly treated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:19:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, especially, but it's made worse I think by not being able to confront him about any of this. Or make him responsible. I mean there are plenty of things you could just decide not to do for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, like what do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's not as though you don't have any leverage or whatever you say doesn't matter or get you anywhere. I mean he seems, he clearly continues to want to work on things with you and he wants things from you and yeah, so on and so forth, but you sort of give so many things away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'm not at all trying to defend the counselor here, but, you know, you could certainly say that if you don't, you know, you felt like your—. You didn't at all, feel like your concerns were really listened to or responded to at that time and that if that doesn't change you're going to walk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, that you think this business about dancing is more drama and bullshit then metaphorical, and that—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, sorry, go ahead.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, that's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I do, but like then also it's like is there something to be said about like this, this something that's important to him and like maybe I really am not paying attention to it? Then like I do want to like, put it in like this work of having the, you know, thinking about is, is— [00:21:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the problem could be that you really haven't thought about your role in this thing at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean I feel as though I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, there may well be things. I have no idea about that. In other words, like I have no idea how sort of legitimate in a sense his complaints or concerns are with you. But, the way that clearly takes center stage is clearly a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. Maybe forever. [00:22:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The issue isn't that maybe there are things you need to think about and work on and maybe he does have some good points about how you've been and, and reasons which he's upset. That could well be, but I mean you've been telling everybody for months that, you know, he hasn't really changed a damn thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: After having said he's going to work on this and work on that. I mean, you tell me every week like how little follow through there is with any of the things that matter to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is not saying he doesn't have valid concerns, but why say like oh, well maybe, you know, the real issue here is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean I've definitely been upset about when we meet with her. I want to be more vocal about what I'd like to address. And hopefully that will go someplace. I mean but that's all I can hope for, but I mean even in the first session, you know, I really thought that starting a discussion about that would be possible. Like in that setting and that he would talk about it as opposed to taking it to in another direction. [00:23:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about completely ignoring what you said and talking about something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Something completely unrelated like. (Talking at the same time.) I think the way he's connecting it is like well, this is what makes me upset about how you act and so that's obviously like gives more justification in to like what your complaint is. I think that's like kind of the way he, it's disconnected for him. You know, like well yeah, this did happen but that's because I was feeling this way and I have been feeling this way and you haven't done this for x amount of time and you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [00:24:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's fine. Those may be valid concerns. Like, but that has nothing to do with what you did. Yeah. I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But I think it's my impression is that it's very difficult for you to say something like that then. Like, you know, he has, that he's upset about the way you were with him and was feeling alone, but of course the way to deal with that is not to go out and like flirt inappropriately with other women a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And also not bring it up with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In any real way. At least from what I've heard about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he brought it up and I mean like if it's something that is clearly not changing by you that you've talked to me about you need to make it more serious. Not just you whatever because you feel sad. Like make it, like sit me down. Like make, like, the same way I try to make things like that with him. Like this is really important to me that you hear me. Like for instance I'm not talking to other women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you even know what he really wants you to do differently besides from dance more? [00:25:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, okay, like my temper is an issue with everybody that I'm close with pretty much. And like I have to work on like stop snapping up at people just because like I know like they'll won't get mad at me. So, there that. Then there's the, there's issue of like going out, to like being more enthusiastic about going to things with his friends and even though there's that, yeah, but like even when I, even if I'm not always like so enthusiastic or whatever he thinks I should be, for the last three years like we primarily go like with his friends and we've done tons of things with them. So, he says, you know, like well, when I go out with your friends and even if you're talking like about high school the whole time and I'm like I just try to have a good time because it's like your friends. And I'm like but I don't do that either so like I do, but I think for him it's just, I don't know what it is. That, that I don't, I'm not like hyped enough he wants to dance, me to dance with him more. Those are those issues and then I guess that I cook breakfast sometimes. [00:26:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you know I'm—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, those, I see the issues. Okay, but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and you don't actually feel they're all that bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. The breakfast thing is bullshit. Like fuck you. I scoop the cat's litter and I do the laundry and I wash most of the dishes many times. I've cooked a million times. I pay the motherfucking bills, which is like the most irritating like to keep track of the household budget is like one of the more difficult jobs because like you really have to keep track of it. Especially like when we have a lot of bills, you know. I mean and then all of the countless things I've, he's complaining that since he's moved there's not very frequently offer him a ride in the morning to the train. Like, so I should go up to his house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like he moved out and he's complaining that you're not giving him a ride to the train?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be nice if I offered to pick him up or drop him off. Right. [00:27:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he like already knows that if I hook up with somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even after you asked for him to stop and he does this whole big thing and said he wasn't going to do it and he kept doing it. And that whole issue had blown up two years ago or something. And somehow and this is the part of it that is you. It was hard to put that out there in the session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying like everything has to happen in the first session, but—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's also pretty clear at this point that that's you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And it's because I don't want to like make it confrontational and I feel like it is confrontational when I have to like—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it is confrontational.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:28:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You have things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're clearly angry about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that he doesn't see the same way as he (inaudible at 00:28:48) has shown.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the other confrontation you don't want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, the, the after the session too. Like, like I don't want it to like turn in to like hard feelings. Like, well I can't believe you brought that up like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're breaking up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you haven't, you haven't said much about wanting to get back together with him given how he's—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. [00:29:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —been. I guess what is it about the hard feelings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to feel like he's blaming me for stuff, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it makes me more angry. Because it just makes me like—because then I like, because it makes me angry. Because it makes me feel like saying fuck you, you fucking idiot. Like I don't give a shit if like that's the way that I had to tell you. Like you don't fucking listen because you just change the subject all the god damn time and want to talk about bullshit that you think I don't do for you when I've done countless other things. And then I want to say that and then he'll it's just very angry. Like it's fighting words I feel like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's so bad about fighting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess nothing. I mean I, I guess part of the fear is also like turning in to like a well then never mind we can't make this work. Like final. But, he's said it so many times it's like fuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you've told me that this isn't going to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way it had been going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Right. But I don't think it will work in a way that I need it to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't think it's going to work? [00:30:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And like I just don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what are you doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trying to avoid breaking up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Right. And like then—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not going to get easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't know. Like I just didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you feel really alone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would. Maybe not really, but pretty. And that I feel guilty somehow too. Like sad for him. Like with his issues and stuff. You know. And feeling like, you know, like I mean for what it's worth to me, like the session was like we were talking differently than we had, then we had like when we were alone. You know, like it didn't turn in to like a blow up or a fight or anything like that. And I did listen to him more than I probably would have normally. [00:31:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's not really a problem. I, I'm glad that it was helpful at all, but—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And really, honestly, I'm like it's all bullshit if you really don't think that you really as sure as I think you are that this is going to work. I mean you don't really actually want it. I mean you want it to work, but if the terms under which it would you're pretty confident the terms under which it would work aren't going to be workable for you or acceptable to you. I mean then the whole thing is kind of empty. [00:32:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think there's just a part of me that was like wanting to go in to the therapy session and like be able to explain the situation and be able to talk about it and like actually talk about that and at least—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least that would have been satisfying—</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —for you. Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean if the point was not to try to salvage the relationship, but try to have the conversation you've never been able to have about how he's behaved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But since it wasn't that it has just has left me feeling like the same. I don't know. And like also his drama makes me, it's also part of my, like, hesitance or delay in like actually saying like I don't think this is going to work. Because he's so dramatic that like I just don't want it to be like a, you know. Drama about the cats. Drama about the stuff he still has at my house. Drama about you know, like, old, just keeping it up and I don't know, don't worry, I don't want it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It isn't going to get any easier I don't think. [00:33:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but like when like what am I supposed to do if he's like I don't, that that's it. Like I don't ever want to talk to you again? I don't want any of my stuff. Like, you want your stuff? Like what am I supposed to do in that scenario? Say okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you know sort of what you probably think is the right thing to do. I see you're having a really hard time doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, like I did want to give it a chance, but like I just don't think it's like the chance that I feel like is getting smaller and smaller. And I think he really, truly feels like, like the fact that we love each other is enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to tell me any realistic scenario at this point under which things would work out. [00:34:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Because like aside from the trust issues and all this stuff, there is just stuff about, I think him and I and how we differ in general that can't be resolved. And I'm having a really hard time like seeing that or just like, whatever. And like—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess really hard to end it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. And like when I think over the idea of it just like ending and like not talking to him anymore like that's going to like, I know that it's going to feel weird and it's going to feel sad and like whatever. But then like I'm also like thinking about like, like how I'll feel to not have a boyfriend. Like what I'll do and what I, whatever, like whatever I want. I guess. [00:35:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a situation that's likely to change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you'll date somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Yeah. I imagine so. And like not super keen on the idea of like dating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not talking about—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but I mean like in general. Like the idea of like, like having to be out there or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean being in a relationship is certainly reassuring, you know. But I mean plenty of people do it, I guess. A friend of mine just got engaged and she's about to be 34, I think. And she's like well, like whatever. We shouldn't fight each other until all it (ph). I mean not that I don't not find somebody something like that, but, I don't know. But it's very complicated the things that I feel about this situation. [00:37:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean maybe it is I'm not so sure like—. It seems like you want to try to find ways to believe it will work and then you're, you're actively doing things to maintain the illusion that it could work. Such as not being more confrontational with him. And then getting really frustrated that you haven't had the conversations you want to be having or that he's not acting any differently. And that you know it's not going to work, but you're going to feel really ad and lonely and probably guilty if you break up with him. So, it's really hard to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it is a little complicated, but—.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem like the complexity is the main difficulty. [00:38:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, no. And we're supposed to have dinner tonight. We like made a plan, but then we ended up having pizza last night together. And so like I'm planning on canceling for tonight because I have some other stuff I want to do. Like I want to clean my house. Like I'm supposed to go to Chicago tomorrow and like I want to leave nice and early because I don't know what traffic's going to be like blah, blah, blah. And I'm sure he's going to be like oh, like of course you're looking forward to that thing. I'm just going to. I mean it's going to be one of these times like one of the first times where I'm just going to be like because I don't want to. Like, because I just don't. Like, I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but I just am not able to. Not that, you know. So, we'll see how that conversation goes. He's probably get all depressed about it. [00:39:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As I mentioned, it seems you really feel much better or not quite as guilty in a way when you're sort of taking care of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very important.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which has always been the key. Which is probably why I'm unable to do it myself because it's just—.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it's your fault you get too excited (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I mean I understand that you may kind of contribute, but, it's not at the of the day your fault he can't do that because he can't afford it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's a grown up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He certainly is. Meanwhile I have to reschedule next week too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just remembered that. I'm going be gone for the long weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. Let me see what else I've got next week.</p>

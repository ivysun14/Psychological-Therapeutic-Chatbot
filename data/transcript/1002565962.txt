<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll just set that over here, and that'll be that.  I'll make a copy of these for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do I need to date that, doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, I already did it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, other than that, we'll go on business as usual.  Um, how are things working out for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll tell you what, and the reason why I called is because [DATE], I fell and hurt myself at work, and I am still having therapy and then [DATE], I fell again, and I damaged, I got blunt trauma to my knee and I got L4 and L5, um, discs that's herniated, and I've been through three doctors and therapy three times a week, and then three weeks ago, my husband had a heart attack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I honestly thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown through that one.  When they helicoptered him to the hospital, they didn't know whether he was going to make it or not, and, um, just numerous things.  I started getting bills in from the hospital, and, um, you can imagine what those are, but I've told you, you know, I pay, I have private pay, but I do have an insurance policy that covers, uh, if you're admitted to the hospital, will pay 80% which has paid thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.  I'm so lucky that I kept that.  And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think caused the falls?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I tripped over a, um, a rug in the hallway where the tile was up, and they had to put a throw rug there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just an accident then, not a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I was carrying something for one of the detail guys.  It was some floor mats and I had my right side of my arm, and I was showing this new man where we put those, and, um, it was late in the evening, seven fifteen, and I was in a hurry and I just tripped over it.  And it so happened, that protected my face, and this arm protected a lot of the fall, but when I landed on my knee, I still got, my knee is so messed up, it took a month for the bruising to go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It wasn't meds or blood pressure—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, absolutely not, and I, and I was, when I went to the hospital, I showed them the medicine I was taking that you gave me, and that was the only medication, and I told them I don't think I had took one other than early that morning and it was a half of a Xanax, the generic form.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right and that was 1 mg, that's what we had, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I filled out the prescription in October.  It was 1 mg one half to one four times a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, but I don't take them four times a day.  That day while I was up in [DEIDENTIFIED] when the helicopter came up in [DEIDENTIFIED] first thing I did was called and I got—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you were taking [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I made sure I had another prescription 'cause I was really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you were taking him in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, soon as doctor, soon as he told me take me to the hospital [PATIENT NAME], I think I'm having a heart attack, and my husband shows no pain, and they couldn't believe his tolerance for pain, and I, he was out in the car honking the horn, and my OCD kicked in, and I've been doing so good with that, and my OCD kicked in and I was going around the house checking every door, checking every door, checking every door, checking every window.  You know what I'm saying?  It was just weird.  I didn't know how long it was, but that kicked in and I could hear the horn honking, but I could not draw myself out to that car until I checked everything two and three times, and I've been really doing good, doctor.  Sometimes I've been able to just walk out the door and not go back and check it the second time.  Just say oh, if something happens, it happens, but under those situations, it just kicked in and I couldn't control it.  Thank God I got him there in time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How have you been sleeping at night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've had, um, some pretty rough nights.  Doctor, they got me on some medication here that gives me the awfulest case of diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it must be Lunesta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have eliminated that pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that a little blue pill for sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I don't think it's a blue, this is what they gave me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let me see what we got here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have the acid reflux real bad, and which we've talked about that before, that, um, there's the four.  They gave me something Zantac or something for, oh, that's what I'm taking.  I put napkins down in that because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's your Xanax here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have refills?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Those turn to powder if you carry them so long, and you don't put tissues and stuff in it, they turn to powder and you just waste them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I asked him for a smaller bottle and a cotton ball the last time and they said no, that I got it filled when I was going to the hospital.  He had that I think on the [DATE]of last month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me give you a word to the wise here [PATIENT NAME].  Do not carry those pills outside of that bottle, and that goes for probably those Darvon here, Darvocet as well.  These are controlled substances.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can get in big trouble if you don't have it in the original prescription bottle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, you did.  You did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I'm afraid if I was in a car accident or something, I would want someone to see what I'm taking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, the other thing if you got pulled over or something or somebody hit you and they found those pills on your person without that bottle, then they haul you in for having dope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I've seen it happen to people, and you know, in order for it to be legal because it is a controlled substance, it has to be in that original bottle.  You cannot put it in a little pill container or in another bottle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my medication is always in.  Like I said, if anything was ever to happen to me, I would definitely want them to know what I was taking so they would know what they could administer to my—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you got Darvocet, and ranitidine for your stomach, Meloxicam what, that's stomach, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm a telling you what.  They wanted me to take it twice a day, and to take that twice a day makes me hyper.  Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  There's three of them that I take.  These pain pills I can't take, whichever the pain pill is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Darvocet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got the pain here.  I can't take those things.  I mean I just can't take them especially try to work every day, you can't take them, and I take my two Advils, but doctor, these, I take these three, and now I'm down to once a day, but if I, these two give me diarrhea.  Those things are nasty.  They, I'm sorry if you're taking a drink, but it's, the diarrhea is like it's black, and they told me the reason why they gave me the things for to coat my stomach and stuff is because if you have acid reflux, what do you call it, ulcers or anything, it can make them bleed.  Well, see my mother died because of her bleeding ulcers erupting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that can be serious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I'm really, some days I'll go without taking those until I can get my bowels regulated again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is work going for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm doing all that I can.  I have to work, you know that, doctor?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, I don't know.  It's just like ever since I've hurt myself, I'm having anxiety attacks and like crazy, and I'm just back to having those again.  I think everything that's happened has just added, just kind of brought everything to surface.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just brought everything to surface, and it's just the OCD has kicked in there a little bit.  I don't know.  Now, it takes me two or three hours to get ready for work, and I'm not curling my hair or doing any of that because of my back where it hurts, and now I'm pretty much walking without a limp, but I'm getting better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME] it looks like we had dis, or you had discontinued a lot of your medicines back in October of last year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As of then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was doing pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No Celexa, no Geodon.  The only thing you had been taking was Xanax, and then I think we were going to start Effexor, right.  No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think I started another medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, that was a while back.  I'm sorry.  That was last year.  Um, all right, so then you've just been taking the Xanax up until now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But it sounds like you're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to tell you what.  Up in [DEIDENTIFIED], there was some nights that, 'cause from nine to six is the only time I could see him, and I sat out in my car and waited until the next morning when I could go in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, it was on my mind and I was sick anyway, in pain.  I shouldn't have even been sitting in that position, and doctor, all of a sudden, I'd be thinking about things and an anxiety attack would hit me.  I would just get up and try to walk, but I probably took about, there were some days probably about five and a half Xanaxes that I had to, I had to cope and not let him see that I was starting to have problems.  You know what I mean?  I had to be calm with him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, do you feel like you're getting any better now or [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's why I called you.  I really don't.  My sleeping, I can, now, before, it got so I was only sleeping four or five hours straight, but now if my leg, if it starts hurting me or my back, I can only lay in one position and that is it.  And trying to keep up with doctor's appointments and physical therapy, and not missing this, not missing that.  And taking care of [NAME OTHER] and my poor dog died.  Just one thing after another.  It's just, I think this brought something to surface that I was really working hard on getting all that behind me 'cause I had finally opened up to you about a year ago, and I think that helped me more than anything is opening up to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About some of my guilt which may be—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I think it helps to talk about some of those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there's, you're the only person I've been able to trust.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's probably one maybe you want to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not talk—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I definitely don't want to talk about that.  Definitely not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you don't want that on the recording.  Yeah.  Um, well, you know, I think, I think put that behind you pretty much.  Um, that may be flaring back up now because of the circumstances.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of things is flaring up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of things is coming back that I'm feeling guilty about, and then my husband, when I saw them taking him in the helicopter everything I'd ever said or did to that man was just facing me there, you understand that?  I have guilt, and I was talking to God, and I know he was too busy to listen to me asking for forgiveness and I was probably asking the wrong one for forgiveness on a lot of things.  All the arguments we ever had seemed like it surfaced, but I just started, it was just anxiety and on my drive up there, didn't know anything about how to drive there, and I was doing all these facial crazy habits again, and this side of my eye's twitching and just doing stupid stuff, just dumb stuff, couldn't eat.  I couldn't eat.  I couldn't sleep.  I was sleeping, I got, he was there for, was it six days, and I probably, I counted one day and it seemed like I had eight hours of sleep.  I could not sleep.  And then I'm sick too.  I mean I probably should have been home in bed, and just dealing with it all, and I couldn't take this medication.  I had to be totally alert, and the only thing that I think that I can take to calm me down and kind of get my mind settled and get it off of the stupid stuff that I need to quit thinking about is my half a Xanax.  I don't think I'm addicted to it, doctor, because I can go a day and maybe take a half of one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I may go another day and not have it, but since my husband had his heart attack, I'm taking my four a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The print wearing off the bottle because you've had it so long, that hardly looks like an addict to me.  However, with everything going on, I feel more comfortable I think seeing you on an antidepressant for the time being.  I'm wondering whether the Xanax by itself is really going to be up to handling this, and particularly if it starts slipping into more of a depression and the OCD symptoms.  In any event, antidepressants work on anxiety as well, and I'm not saying stop the Xanax.  Continue that too, but, uh, I'd say temporarily at least, for a few months maybe until things stabilize just to have insurance to get back on Celexa or Lexapro or something like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've got it counted down to eighteen minutes exactly.  You told me if I, if I waited too late, 'cause I know when I'm going into an anxiety attack, and you told me sometimes if you can stand it, put it on your tongue or under your tongue.  I've got it counted down to eighteen minutes, it'll start working on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And if I just swallow it, it may be twenty minutes, twenty five minutes, something like that, but when I, there's times you're around people where you just can't say, you know, pull out your half a Xanax and take it, and then by the time the conversation's over and the customer leaves my office or whatever, then I, um, I'm just like this.  I've already got, I've got a full blown anxiety attack, and doctor, I just want to get up and run.  I just want to get up and run outside and just scream.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I think you see you'd be a basket case without the Xanax.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's no doubt about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But would you be okay with going back on say Lexapro or Celexa for a few months anyway?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Will it not make me sick or drowsy and can I take it with this medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, and yes.  You can take it with that medicine, and you had taken, well, you were taking 40 before of Celexa.  I'd say let's just go with 20, um, just to have some insurance.  Not only would it go with the Xanax, but it would actually enhance it.  The Xanax would work better with it, but what I'm worried about is Xanax won't cover you as far as slipping into a depression.  It'll do the anxiety, but you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I, I, when I go home and stuff, I'm totally depressed.  When I get up and lock my office door, I just [INAUDIBLE] but even my husband's like the least little thing he says to me, and I'll say [NAME OTHER] I know you've changed because you've had a heart attack, but it seems like everything he's saying is hurting my feelings.  And then my sister, if I slash back at her when she says something to hurt something to hurt my feelings, then I feel like the bad guy.  It's just, it's a no win situation sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's do this, and I'll give you some samples.  You pay for your own medicines, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yes, I have to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	"Okay, um, Lexapro comes in 10 and 20 mg.  It is equal to twice the relative amount of Celexa.  They're very similar, derived from each other.  So, you were taking 40 mg of Celexa in the past, but, um, let's shoot for 20 Celexa, but rather than Celexa, we'll do the purified Lexapro which would be half again as much.  So, in other words, 10 mg to equal 20 Celexa. "</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, they charge the same per tablet for Lexapro.  It comes in 10s and 20s.  It's going to cost you about two bucks a pill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Gee manilly.  My husband's medicine is four hundred and something now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's easy to break in half.  If you're going to pay the same amount for a pill, then we'll write the 20 mg tablet, break it in half, you only need to get 15, but I'll give you a bunch anyway.  So, in other words, I'm going to give twice what I want you to have and say break it half, and cause that will save you twice as much money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you only have to buy fifteen pills a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, that's why the half pill and you know, the purpose is not that I've gone loco, but it saves you, it saves you big bucks, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, fifteen tablets and that'll probably cost maybe fifty dollars, but I'll give you enough for a couple of months at least, just when and if that happens.  That's why—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, I can take what you give me first before I have to go in a couple of months to buy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay, I'll be fine.  I'll be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  You got it.  You got it, and the Xanax same as usual.  It doesn't have to change one way or the other.  Sounds like you, um, you take it when you need to and don't when you don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	"Late at night if I, if it's say two or three, four o'clock in the morning and I can't go to sleep, I'll take a half a one, and, cause I know there's something keeping me awake and I know what it is, and then maybe I fall asleep at night at eleven o'clock, but I'll wake up at three or four in the morning and can't go back to sleep, and I know I'm sleepy, but then I got a whole day's of work that I have failed even at work.  Just every little thing is driving my crazy.  I just. "</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, again, that's normal considering what you're going through, and we don't want to see it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I went through a lot in the last few months.  I have doctor.  I really have and I'm not a whine baby or nothing like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, you're not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my husband is just a pro at what he's went through.  He's, even the doctors said they'd never seen.  This one doctor did his, put his stent in said they'd never seen a man that could tolerate having endurance for pain like he does, and it just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, have you maintained your appetite okay?  Have you seen any change with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything, well, I'm following his fat free diet, all that forty five pounds that I lost, I gained that back and more.  I'm so overweight now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much do you weigh now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I weigh about a hundred and eighty something, about a hundred and eighty two.  No, as a matter of fact, a hundred and seventy six.  I'm sorry.  I lost seven or eight pounds.  I believe in one week, in one week, I've lost you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How tall are you [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Five foot tall.  I'm so overweight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You're not overweight, you're under height.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There you go.  Hey, I like that better you saying it like that, but I know I'm obese, but with my back and my leg, I cannot exercise.  I am absolutely ready to start a diet, but you need to exercise too when you diet, but doctor, you know, when I finally set my mind to it, I'll drop that weight.  In four months, I'll drop the 45 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's check your blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, last time you checked my, for the sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm going to be honest with you, I took a half a Xanax about an hour ago, so my blood pressure's probably, it's usually right on normal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopefully, that's, that's what we want to see happen there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have good blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We do not want to see it [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This time I took the elevator for the very first time.  I know the steps is good for me, but not with my knee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I think there are better ways to get exercise than to hop on up upstairs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can get a sprain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know my father in law died also.  My dog died.  My mother in law won't come and live with us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One forty four over 95.  That's a little on the high side.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's high for me.  I'm usually 120 over I want to say 70 something or 80 something.  Mine's usually just almost perfect, to be overweight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it probably just reflects this pressure on you.  Okay, well let's get that rolling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We will.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] is a 27 year old Caucasian female who was self referred for evaluation of current depression, anxiety, insomnia, non responsive to antidepressants.  She has had a history of this since the early part of her life, since starting her menses.  Um, let's see, what else. She has a benign history without any medical problems.  She has no allergies.  There's no alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine abuse.  She does have certain things that go along with an affective disorder such as restless legs, Raynaud's phenomenon, nail biting, and temperature regulation problems.  Um, today it is a, um, cool but not cold day and she is sitting in front of me with 2 sweatshirts on.  Her legs are not moving as they were, although she does move them from time to time.  Her pupils are still enlarged slightly.  Her eyes still track quickly and her hands are cold.  Um, she is now on Alprazolam 2mg, #30, 1 at bedtime; Wellbutrin 100mg SR, #30, 1 in the morning; and Lamictal 150mg a day.  So how are we doing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you?  Tell me what good is?  I see that you're still cold, does that happen all the time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's just chilly outside. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it's - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's the weather change.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, okay.  Is your mind still racing?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're mind is not racing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, that Lamictal really works.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, um.  So how would you describe how you are right now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.  Well, I've had some changes at work so I'm having to adjust to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What is that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because we're slow right now - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They've taken third shift on my line down and moved us to a different line - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The hours have changed and it's just, I'm starting to adjust but it's just killing me, the hours are later, we get more overtime.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What time to what time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's supposed to be from 12 to 8.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> P.M. to A.M.?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we've been having to go in at 8 and 9:30 at night, work until 8, 9 o'clock in the morning if not more.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Where, where do you work?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In [INAUDIBLE] and it's just taking me some time to adjust to it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can imagine.  You're doing that how many days a week, 5?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  What do they do there?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is starting my third week.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, all right, so you've got jet lag, it's probably now when you're beginning to adjust to it.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then some days I can get more sleep than others because my son has soccer practice from 5:30 to 6:30.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so on Tuesdays and Thursdays, if I don't get into bed until 11,11:30, maybe 12 o'clock, I have to get up at 4:30. So it's just taking me some time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I can imagine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was a little frustrating at first, not as bad as I thought.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are they going to shift, shift you back later on you think?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When things pick back up, I hope.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  I'm going to bump you up to 200 of Lamictal, okay, um, and see if we can get rid of the temperature sensitivity and also, um, you're a little tense.  Okay, you're sitting forward a little bit, a little tight, you know, and your pupils are still a tad enlarged and this may be too much but if it is, you can do, um, 3/4 of a tablet, a 200mg tablet, it'll be the same dosage, okay, but I think if we go to 100 twice a day then I think we'll get things better, okay.  Is that copacetic?  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> As far as like the Wellbutrin, is that supposed to just level out the Lamictal?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's supposed to have an antidepressant effect, is it doing it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You still feel depressed?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's just that I've been taking it and it's just, you know how sometimes when you take medicine, at first it works for you and then you take it for so long and it just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Poops out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, I can increase your dose if you want me to and maybe when everything smooths out for you, you know, and your temperature gets back to normal and everything else does, then your mood may pop up, that's what I'm expecting, okay, but I can increase your Wellbutrin to 300 and see if that helps and it should help a little bit with your, um, jet lag.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm sure it has a lot to do with this whole change at work because that was a big change for me and I'm used to knowing exactly what time I have to be in and what time exactly I get off.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean because I was getting in bed before 10 o'clock in the morning and now there's no telling when I'm going to get home, what time I'm going to get to bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it's just a different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're running around with sleep deprivation is what you're doing and if you don't have sleep deprivation and phase inversion of what you're doing, um, that's going to be a problem.  You know what I might do is to, um, not do the Wellbutrin and give you some Provigil.  Provigil is an alerting mechanism that you can take during the daytime that can keep you awake and should decrease the number of accidents you make and the mistakes you make and this kind of stuff, okay.  You may still need an antidepressant but I don't know that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And, um, you make take a few days to get there because drug companies, um, do not like Provigil because it costs too much and we always have a battle with them but we can, this is a justified thing and so I think you won't have any trouble with getting it through.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I did have a question about the, um, Xanax.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Is that one of those things that you can increase the dosage or if, once I get immune to it, if I get immune to it, would I have to be put on something else?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes but, um, but if we get you, if we get the excess energy in you under control with Lamictal, you probably will not need to change it, okay, because we'll get rid of your general alertness - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're hyper alertness and sort of startle those sorts of things and that will allow you to smooth out during the day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, but I'm not surprised, you're going to have some trouble sleeping right now because you changed your schedule and you're rushing everywhere you go, to go to bed, go to sleep, get up, all that stuff, you know, just ridiculous.  You're like somebody going through internship in medicine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then my daughter wants to do cheerleading classes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you married, you married?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do have a boyfriend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, how helpful is he?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Very, he does live with me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, so that's good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we work together and live together so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my appetite has increased since I've went to that line.  I don't know if it's because I'm doing, I mix the color that they use to paint with - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And when I was on my line, they don't go through as much color and so I've noticed that my appetite has increased since I went there.  I've been trying to eat a lot of fruit too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Especially with it becoming wintertime soon because last year I got really sick working around all that water.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not sure what you're saying, what about the water, what's the water got in it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well some of the water is recycled and some of it's clean water but it's just, we have, the end I work on is called the pouring in - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because that's the end we actually paint the stones and they put the mud in -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we're constantly having to wash the floor because of the paint -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, are you breathing it?  You are.  You get a lot of paint fumes?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not, what it is, is it's just powder - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we have to put water and glue in it and mix it up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not like paint that you would paint the wall with or something like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's just the powder they make to make the color, glue, and water but it's just the powder you're constantly inhaling that powder?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you got a mask?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It don't work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You got 2 masks?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes it makes it hard to breathe when you have a mask.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, you've got to take a look at that because you can get, do you remember what happened to people at ground zero where they breathed in all that dust, a lot of them have gotten their lungs clogged up with dust and they're having trouble, okay.  There's brown lung disease that you get from, um, industrial areas, you know, where you get your lungs clogged up - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Working in those textile mills used to do the same thing from all the cotton dust in the air, so, um, you need some sort of, some sort of filter even if you say it doesn't work, it will help, you know, a mask or something like that around your face</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  They have like those little, the doctor mask that you would put, not like the flat ones but it's the ones with the holes in it, the hole in it- </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's got that white thing on the outside of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, I sure would use it, even if it doesn't help, you know, if nothing else, once you breathe a few times, it's going to clog up some of the holes and it'll help more and more but you don't want to be breathing that stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Actually, I won't have that job much longer.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I went and took a test for the post office, so hopefully I'll - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Whoa.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Do all right and go work for the post office.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Great.  We'll DC the Wellbutrin, we're going to add Provigil and I'm going to continue the 2mg of Xanax we're using as a cheap sleeping pill and we're going to increase the Lamictal to 100 twice a day and that ought to stabilize some of this stuff and I'll see you back in about 6 weeks.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

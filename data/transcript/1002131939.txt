<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was one of America's most prominent psychologists. Rather than identifying persons as "sick" or mainly flawed from childhood experiences as the Freudians did, Rogers was interested in how he and other mental health professionals could recognize the strength in people.</p>

<p>Rogers is the acknowledged creator of the "client-centered" approach to psychotherapy. It has also been called "person-centered therapy." His studies resulted in the creation of several totally new mental health therapy techniques. Client-centered therapy is based on the principle of talking therapy and is a non-directive approach. The basic elements involve the therapist creating a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere in which the client is encouraged to reach his or her full potential. The therapist encourages the patient to express his or her feelings and does not suggest how the person might wish to change. By listening and then repeating back what the patient reveals, the therapist helps them to explore and understand their feelings for themselves. In client-centered therapy the therapist's role is mainly to act as a facilitator and to provide a comfortable environment and NOT to direct therapy outcomes.</p>

<p>Called "the quiet revolutionary," Rogers also accomplished what no mental health professional had done before. His 1942 innovation of the tape-recording of psychotherapeutic interviews was far ahead of its time. Many of his taped interviews were donated to the American Academy of Psychotherapists' tape library, and those tapes have now been transcribed for this database.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: The last time I talked about, the last time my feeling of "should" about having to sort of be responsible for this (Inaudible) and yet feeling demands that I was unable to respond to and didn't want to respond to it. So it made sense this week, you now, "Why should I? This is the place where I do have limits and should have them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, and be much better for me to recognize them and just ask them and not feel hostile about not being clear what my limits are on setting them straight. I think it's uh, have new meaning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. And as maybe I have accepted the fact that I need and must have limits here and set them. Then I wouldn't feel so hostile.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm. And I think that really touches a, a wide area in my life. I think it's been very hard for me to, to set limits and to feel that I have the right to have them, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so they've been way out someplace without my being able to call them for help sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm, mm-hmmm. Sort of that you hadn't had any protection for yourself or any feelings or that you had any right to such protection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm. [0:01:49.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If somebody demands something you must give it to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm. And thinking back I can not think of specific instances but I can certainly recall many times, I mean, as a total when I have, uh, felt I should do something. Felt called upon to volunteer thought I had to be the one to be responsible for it and then would have such a whole lot of things build up that finally I'd just feel overwhelmed by having so much to do. And now I feel very annoyed about the whole thing and resentful. And really, there's nobody to be mad at (chuckle) except me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And at first it's whole lot of in a way, I mean it seems like being willing to do things and being a nice person really it's being very, um, very self-opinionated, I think, to think that one can do all of that. [0:03:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I could do all of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I, to think one has no limits.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. So even though it seems so giving and so reasonable and everything actually it involves a pretty, uh, almost egotistical feeling about yourself that you're able to be responsible for so much. And that you can give everything that is demanded.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think it's going to be sort of a real relief to feel I don't have to be the kind of person who can do everything that everybody wants. Or everything that I want even but just sort of consider things and try to (clear throat) to really know what my limits are and what I can do and what's too much. [0:04:23.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just feels like a lifting of a considerable burden to feel I could select the things I can do and want to do. I don't have to do everything that's asked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not even everything that I demand of myself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess it may take some practice, I don't know (chuckle). I may become aware of these things although I think I am because I feel so (Inaudible). But I think what will happen is that it will hit me in the face. I mean this is a place where I do need to set them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. That is if I get what you mean there. I think it isn't so much a matter of planning but just when something comes up you'll have the feeling, "Well, this is more than I can do or more than I want to do or something."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I hope it will be that way. I'm not really; I guess I'm not really quite sure that's how it will happen. I'd sort of like it to be that way so that I know at the time rather than to make a, feel like it's trailing along behind and I sort of start to respond and then have to change my mind afterwards.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd like to be aware of your feelings about these demands right at the time they happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of having bright thoughts afterwards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I guess what I'm hoping is that will be the case so that I don't get involved. And I have been aware of my, not so much right now but, not too long ago in terms of maybe last year. I'm sort of aware of myself as this person who does have at times quite a bit of hostility.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. [0:06:42.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would come out if I were very tired or something my defenses were low. And (clear throat) I'd sort of like to get to the bottom of that and I'm sure this is one thing and just talk about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. But you're quite sure you're often do feel a good deal of anger both in regard to this trips and other ways and you wish you could get more to the roots of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. I've been aware a little bit recently that uh, (Inaudible) in a way I thought it might be. I sort of feel hostile to, towards women as they are in groups. I mean I get so tired of the feminine club where there's nothing but women and they have a business meeting. I feel so out of patience with this whole, I really don't know. The way they go about things. (clear throat) I find myself really enjoying a mixed group where there are men in the group much more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm just wondering what that means because in the traditional sense of getting along with mother, I always have. I mean we seem to be much alike and we always had a good friendly relationship so that I can't seem to connect with anything of that. </p>

<p>But last Wednesday, for example, it came to my attention that I had to have an X-ray and I was in a room with other women who were waiting. And I had taken in some studying to do and I thought I could spend my time that way. And they were almost hysterical, I mean I was nervous. I was scared to death, they were sort of letting off steam in such a way that it was making me feel far worse. And I thought, "These females, what's the matter with them?" I thought if this were a group of men sitting together how much more comfortable it would be. They would be sort of more reassurance with them. It's just a way of functioning that isn't so hysterical I guess. [0:09:22.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you realized that even though you don't see a reason for it in your background, still quite often you're feeling is, "All these women."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Quite annoyed with-</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet on the other hand, I, on the other hand I do have good friends that I like a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when I don't know them as I didn't with this group lots of noise (Inaudible) I think they function as inefficient, scatterbrained women.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of the feeling that women in general or women as a group, "Oh nuts to them." [0:10:14.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm. And in a way it's, I think it's sort of a relief to find that, that really I do enjoy men's company quite a bit and like it. So I'm able to see well I really do and I think that that's - I'm sort of pleased to sort of recognize that and be able to say it.</p>

<p>But on the other hand I'm a little bit, I don't like that I feel so impatient about women too. Well, I don't know I think that women's clubs really I don't think I do well (chuckle) have much to do with them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. So it's kind of nice to be able to say, "Yes, I like men." And I guess at first reaction is, "And I really shouldn't dislike women." But then when you think of some of these situations you feel, "eh". [0:11:43.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. I don't really know where to go from there. Because I can see that I do enjoy (clear throat) friends. I like to do things with them and yet I have this impatience in me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is here these two kinds of contradictory feelings - that I like some women very much and I feel very annoyed at women in general. Now what do I do about that? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Kindly just stay away from women in general. (Laughter) Don't get involved with women's organizations. It's that simple. (chuckle) But it seems like it would be something that I could explain. When did it start or whether that's important or not. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel sort of drawn toward the question, "Why do I feel this way?" [0:13:53.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe as I think of this I think of my, when I was a very little girl when my grandmother used to live with our family. And I guess she was a regular mother-in-law of the worst kind. She was my father's mother. (clear throat) And I was very much aware from as early as I can remember, of the very poor relationship that existed between my mother and her. And, uh, my mother took the raw end of something and I was very much concerned about her. And, in fact, when I think of my childhood I think of being so worried about her because she didn't seem to be able to cope with the situation really. And sometimes I feel I never was really young because I was so worried. I mean sort of a-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose the other kids were worried too but it was sort of a feeling of being older than my mother somehow or other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was so sorry for her that she wasn't able to be happy and sort of cope with this old lady who was just sort of a dominating tyrant who was just nasty. And at the same time that I was angry with my grandmother for what she was doing to my mother, I was sorry for her too. There were all sorts of mixed up emotions, really too much for a child. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost feel as though all those mixed feelings of anger for your grandmother and sorrow for her and feeling kind of worried about and responsible for your mother, almost robbed you of any real childhood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. I'm thinking that maybe there may be a feeling of resentment that I may have had without my knowing. Somehow they couldn't work this thing out in some way. I mean why did my mother have to put up with it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If she had said, "Well, let's..." maybe it wouldn't have happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you feel that perhaps there was sort of an undercurrent of resentment toward her on the basis of, "Why doesn't she settle this thing? Why doesn't she set limits as to how submission she will be or something?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you could kind of summarize it. "Why doesn't she handle it like an adult?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Inaudible) could be. And that may have, I don't know, may have given me a lack of belief in adults and (Inaudible) because it seemed to be such a mess and it resulted in such awful experiences for me. Because sometimes the sort of undercurrent fights between them would spill over. My father would get into it and then he would lose his temper. That was his way of handling it. That was just ghastly. I would think he would leave and go away and then everything would sort of fall to pieces.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. Am I getting this right? That you felt that if he dropped out of the situation then it would just be a complete mess. Somebody would be able to handle things. [0:18:19.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess it was sort of, I hadn't thought of that before. Because when I think of those times when he got into this real fury and anger, I had a feeling that he might - because I remember once he, I guess he had his slippers on. And he took his slippers off and put his shoes on; I thought he said he was leaving. And I thought, "Oh that was just the worst thing that could happen."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that in all of this feeling I've had about my father, that really I did very much want a good relationship with him. And I think that's the part of my upset that I wanted so much to have him care for me and I didn't seem to get what I really wanted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet keep on trying even, I guess even today in certain things. Because then when I, it used to be when I'd go on vacation and I'd find myself wanting to buy him a present first of all and send it. As though well my mother would understand it but that somehow I had to do something special for him. I'd keep on trying and trying. [0:19:36.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel it all along and to some extent even now. You would like so much to have him care for you and that governs a number of the things you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. And yet in a certain way, see I realize that he does. I mean he would say it but it just haven't get to me somehow that there's real caring. I mean it's words service, lip service. Or a caring that's, wants too much to hang on sort of control completely that's a frightening thing for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would this be putting it right that you're saying that, "Perhaps he does care but at least all that gets through to you is words about caring and demands on you."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. Demands that I just feel too sort of tired to be able to come up to and so I respond to it by, "It's just too much." [0:21:04.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just a hopeless feeling that I can't possibly meet his expectations or demands. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Because once I meet one then there's another and another and another. And I never really meet them. I mean it's sort of an endless demand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. It sort of makes you feel tired right now just to think of this endless chain of insatiable demands.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. Knowing the kind of mother that he had, it's probably, oh I think it's possible that he was just trying to find a mother and never found one because his way of being a husband was to demand an awful lot from my mother in terms of just pure service. And that's another thing that makes me mad about her and was that she did it. At the final I think she just destroyed herself almost and physically just worn out by all that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's another one of those feelings that you hold against women. Here she just gave in to all his demands for service and help. [0:22:51.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there again if she had set limits he would probably have accepted them. But she just didn't. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel that if she had been able to say within herself, "I'll go this far but no further." It would probably have been all right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because he respected her when she did set any limits although it would be an occasional time when she would. And that was it. But she didn't do it very often. And, of course, I've always felt I'm sort of, I've been sort of like her as being rather submissive and not setting limits.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in a sense you feel, "Here I am following in the same kind of pattern that she set."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. And not liking the pattern even while I love her a great deal I'm just feeling that she allowed herself to be taken advantage of and in a way she didn't need to. [0:23:59.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you're saying, "I really don't respect her for the way she just kept trying to meet all the demands."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And really not wanting to be that kind of person myself and feeling that it's not a good way to be. And yet I think I've had some accountable efforts of the way you have to be in you intend to be thought a lot of and loved that kind of feeling too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh. A really contradictory feeling that, "I don't want to, I don't want to be a person who just gives in to all demands." And yet feeling, "That's the only chance I have of being loved."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so much of the time I'd just feel, "Oh if she'd only sit down and be with us a little bit." So, be a mother in the family group instead of always doing things. And, uh, it was only later when I was an adult that she started to do this as she got older, I think. And I feel that if she had done it when I was younger it would have meant so much because I didn't want her to be doing things all the time. She thought that was being a mother but really if she'd just been there a little more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you just wish she hadn't felt so obligated to do everything and wished she could have relaxed a little more and really been in a relationship with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. [0:28:28.8] I was thinking the other night I was feeling really blue about the way I felt and I thought, "Well, maybe I wish I had my mother here in the way that she was." Because she used to be sort of reassuring when I was ill, she would do little things, make some little dish like custard or something. It was sort of reassuring to sort of have her around because I know that she wasn't able to be that way at all. I don't know what that all means. For a minute I thought, "Well, I really miss her. I sort of need a mother at this point and yet it's sort of impossible."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even though it's factually impossible, the feeling was, "Gee, I miss her. I wish she was here to take care of me and look after me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, huh. And yet at the same time I felt, "Well, a little later, well maybe that wasn't what I needed. Maybe it was the more adult sort of companionship in some way rather than a mother." But I needed something, somebody. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't really feel sure in yourself but what you wanted was someone to really give you close mothering or whether you wanted some more grownup kind of relationship. [0:30:40.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then in another sense I felt, "Well, maybe it's just something I have to go through alone."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's hopeless to wish that I could be in a relationship with anybody maybe I have to be alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing that sort of has thrown me this week is that I feel better about this physical condition I talked of last week. And I have sort of made friends with my doctors. It makes me feel a little better in some ways not just quietly fighting without saying anything. And I think that I have more confidence. I know I read some, I read an article about this and it's very hard to diagnose so I don't hold that against anybody. But he feels that he has to be sure so he sort of (Inaudible) himself and getting X-rays. I'm frightened because I kind of feel that they're having to be sure that it isn't cancer. And that really, really frightens me terribly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:31:54.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And uh, I think its when I let that thought come in, maybe it is and what if it is. That's when my thoughts are of dreadfully alone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's as though, "If it's really something like that then you just feel so alone."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really a frightening kind of loneliness because I don't know who could be with you at a time like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this what you're saying? "Could anyone be with you in, in fear or in a loneliness like that?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Crying and sniffing). [0:33:23.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just really cuts so deep. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it would feel like. I mean if there were somebody around so that I did feel I had someone to lean on in a sense. I don't know if it would make me feel better or not. I was trying to think, "Well if it's something that you just have to grown within yourself to sort of stand." Even just the thought of it, I mean, it will take two weeks I suppose before they know. Would it help if somebody else was around? Or is it just something that you just have to really be intensely alone in? Well, I just felt that way this week so dreadfully, dreadfully all by myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're feeling as though you're so terribly alone in the universe almost and whether it even, whether anyone could help. Whether it would help if you did have someone to lean on and yet you don't know. [0:35:02.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess basically they're be a part of it you would have to do alone. I mean you just couldn't maybe take it even and pass along some of the feelings. And yet it would be sort of a comfort, I guess. I like to be alone. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It surely would be nice if you could take someone with you a good deal of the way and your feelings of aloneness and fear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I just have. [0:36:09.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe that's what you're feeling right this minute. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it is a comfort. And I guess the feeling that I have now as well. I'm probably looking at the very blackest part of it and maybe there's no real need to bother, you know? It may just take time to reassure me. I mean all of this may sort of be unimportant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although I shan't forget, I'm sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very (Inaudible). But it's sort of hard to be optimistic about it. I'm usually able to see the bright things but this is something that's thrown me, I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you feel as though you've really lived with the blackest possibilities even though the facts may turn out to be quite otherwise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it has been hard. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I supposed it all has something to do with thoughts about death, I don't know, lots of implications to explore if I got down to it. Because there have been times when I've thought, "Well, if I were to feel, keep on feeling the way I've been feeling the last week forever, I really wouldn't want to stay long. There's that side to it also, a real not wanting to face death at this point, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Real feeling of not wanting to look that possibility in the face. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I suppose if I'm really ill it wouldn't be the worse thing. [0:39:44.4]</p>

<p>The worse thing I guess would be the pain. I have a low tolerance for pain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that in some ways, if it came right down to it death might be easier to face than pain. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to think of either one really. Not now anyway. (crying) Well I finding it very hard to get down to business these days. There are things that I'm supposed to do. I'm just worried, I guess. It's not so bad, the pain isn't there. If I can forget I can seem to get along. When it's there I'm just continually reminded of it and that's so frightening and really is uncomfortable (Inaudible). [0:41:53.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel, "I surely am not very efficient when I'm in pain or when I'm worrying." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Frightened. I think I feel sufficiently, deeply involved in this interview that has just finished that I haven't, uh, too many intellectual reactions to it. Uh, I guess uh, perhaps the thing I could comment on a little bit is that um, in what for me was the most deeply moving part of the, of the interview where she uh, realized that this relationship is, in a sense, the kind of thing she has been hoping for and wishing for. Uh, I certainly feel very much emotionally involved at that point. [0:43:06.5]</p>

<p>I think that um, there have been strange and unfortunate uh, ideas about so-called counter transference in therapy. Uh, and often those ideas leave almost no room for the real feeling of the therapist toward the client. Uh, I do have warm feelings toward this person and in a situation of that kind uh, I feel them very keenly and feel her appreciation of those feelings very keenly. </p>

<p>Uh, I think that in some sense what goes on in therapy is that you feel enough caring for this person to really let him or her possess his own feelings and live his own life. And that you also recognize that the most that can be given to another person, not the least but the most that can be given to another person, is to be willing to go with them in their own separate feelings as a separate person. And I feel that uh, there was a good deal of that in this interview. [0:44:43.7]</p>

<p>And I'd also say that um, one other reaction I had at the very outset of the interview, was that uh, to me her face in the first, I don't know, five or ten minutes of the interview seemed more uh, more relaxed, less tense uh, more open, more full of life than uh, I think I have ever seen. I don't know whether the camera will uh, be able to pick up changes as subtle as that. But uh, it seemed to be that uh, there was not the strained, tense uh, facial expressions that uh, have been so customary with this client. And that instead she was really uh, living more freely in her feelings of the moment. And uh, I suspect that I feel that in a large measure carried through even though the feelings in the latter part of the interview are those of fright and dread in facing some of life's uh, very ultimate problems in a realistic fashion. [0:46:13.4]</p>

<p>There's another way of describing the uh, this heightened moment in the interview where she uh, realized that in her desire for someone to go with her in her fear and loneliness that actually she had experienced just that uh, in my going along with her in those feelings. Um, I think one could put that in more general terms and say that what the individual experiences in therapy uh, is the experience of being loved. And I think that there's no question that's what she was experiencing at that moment; a non-possessive kind of feeling, a love which is willing for the other person to be separate and to uh, possess his own feelings in his own way. And I think in most instances of deep and successful therapy, the person really experiences that. </p>

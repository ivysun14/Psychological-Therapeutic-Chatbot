<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been successful at working six hours the days you’re supposed to or whatever we’re doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You have?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m trying. I mean I think I would be even more successful if I didn’t have a lot of my pieces that I’m still struggling with, I mean to try to put things back into perspective.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Medically?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Medically I -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Personally or -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Primarily medically, primarily medically and I’m really concerned, as you know, I’ve been saying this since I walked in here a year ago, you know, that my kids and my house, I really think my house, this whole thing, has made me very sick, the whole like environment, environmental thing and I’m having somebody come back out on Saturday to look at my house, to reinspect it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really, what kind of -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Floor by floor of mold because we’ve got -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh for mold.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> We’ve got so much construction work in our house and I think that is my, the more research I do and I’ve been tested positive for yeast and I’ve been extremely ill and [INAUDIBLE] and I’m really concerned about the other symptoms so I have all of that, all of that focusing on my head which inhibits my ability to focus and concentrate because my mind is everywhere. This is my life, you know, this is something that I -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Especially when it comes out of nowhere.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It could have been building up and I never recognized it. My body, particularly, just crashed and burned because I wasn’t getting nourishment, my immune system is [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean are you on things still or no?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] does have me -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know on that stuff a couple of times a day. She wanted me to take that Tindamax and I really was really, I didn’t, I raised my hand to say the information that I read on there to take, but I was taking the Diflucan and taking the Tindamax does not interact well and I was like, I told [NAME OTHER], I said I’m really skeptical on it and now they think that I’m resistant to the Diflucan.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I thought you were being resistant to take the Tindamax.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I haven’t really taken it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That was the Nizoral. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, meaning -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B>  Different -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I get you.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Your questioning them but they think you’ve developed a resistance to the -</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> Diflucan. So now she’s doing research to see what else they can give me.</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> I never heard of that. People develop resistance to that?</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> Yeah, this is, this is, I mean, it’s just something that’s just bizarre and I basically forced myself, as you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME] picked myself up -</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> I mean in many ways just to [INAUDIBLE] keep a roof over my head.</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> Yeah, it’s been pretty amazing. So what happened with the, they were fine with your hours?</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> They’re not fine with your hours?</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> Um, they want to put a stake in the ground because, you know, I told you last time I was here, my counterpart left going to another assignment, my boss and I are taking care of over five thousand employees.</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> Your boss wants to put a stake in the ground?</P>
<P><B>PT</B> <B>:</B> Yeah, so -</P>
<P><B>DR</B> <B>:</B> Tough shit. I mean what are they going to do, fire you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um yeah, they could.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because you’re medically ill?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, yeah, because my, well the thing of it is is my disability has expired so I have no disability and yeah the work restrictions that she said that she, you know so I was like fine because, you know, I’m not getting paid. You know, I don’t get supplements.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, you get paid like for the hours that you -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I don’t get any disability anymore. I was getting a little bit of supplement.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, but you don’t even get, I mean you work more hours than you get paid for anyway.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well with the disability I didn’t mind because I was still getting the forty hours.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But now, I have no disability and so, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I have no -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What kind of stake?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I don’t know, she’s, she didn’t really say.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What did she say? You have to be full time?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah. She said well as you know, because I said, I said granted, I said my goal is to get back to part time -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Full time.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or full time, but you know I really need to work it out before doing that, you know, I don’t even go there to tell her all that I have personally going on because, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> She’s not, yeah, that will just [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t whine, I don’t say anything. She asks me how I’m doing, I was like I’m fine, that’s it because, you know - so to answer your question, she, eventually I need to, I know I need to ramp up -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I said, you know, I said I have to work it out anyway financially since I don’t, since I have to make a lot of adjustments since I’m not getting my full time pay. She said well, as you know we really don’t have the luxury or the ability to have people working part time so that’s why I want you to put a stake in the ground and, I mean -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What did [NAME OTHER] say when you talked with her?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Crazy to be working this much?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> She wanted me to be out on disability, you know, pretty much full time.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yes. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I am just really struggling to keep my benefits. I mean I would have lost my benefits and everything, you know, which I just can’t afford to do for me and my family.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now if we ramp up like an hour a week, I don’t know, would that be, I mean if you, if there is some kind of a plan where the end point is forty hours a week and it’s inviting would that shut her up or is she going to complain that it’s too long, you know, I mean right now, two, four, you’re thirteen hours under forty a week.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Um -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Now this week, I’ve been trying to do six hours a day just to try to, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> This past week?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Did you tell them that or no?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I told them. I told her I was going to try to do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you getting paid for that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right and how did that -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I said I’ll let you know if I don’t do it but, you know, I push myself to do it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And, I mean did you go in yesterday?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. [NAME OTHER] came and picked me up. Actually, I worked six and a half hours yesterday.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Who picked you up?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]. I drove to work and he picked me up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, oh, oh, after, yeah, yeah. All right. So it’s working, this -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s what’s called, you know, keeping a roof over your head or meals on the table, that sort of thing. I mean if I wasn’t to this point and all these other things, I could do it, I could do what I’m asked to do, although it would be a lot of stress and pressure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In terms of things to do and -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I just try to keep in this little like cocoon. I stay under the radar. I mean, I’m like I don’t -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> At work.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I stay under the radar big time. I don’t know how long that’s going to last but I do my best to, you know, not jump myself out there for projects, although you know. The one thing though, I do not, I really can’t travel and so if there’s travel involved, I want that definite restriction, cannot travel.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so what if we did this. If we said this week and next week you work six hours a day.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I’m approved until the twenty-fifth to do the six, I’m approved to the [DATE]. MetLife approved me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To do, oh - she is to remain on six hours of work, oh, six and five, five and six. Okay. So -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> After the [DATE].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. So [DATE]. [INAUDIBLE] before our next evaluation on [DATE], so basically you want me to start on this Monday the [DATE]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right. I mean -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And what do you want to do? Do you want to do that you can do six hours a day and say, I don’t know, then you want to add a seventh hour on Monday and Friday? Something like that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. Yeah, I guess we can do that. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So I’ll say you can increase hours to six per day, even though you already have more or less, so by [DATE], we’ll say on [DATE] to increase hours to seven on Monday and Friday and six Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and then on [DATE], to increase hours to seven on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and six on Tuesday and Thursday. And then, that’s [DATE], so in April, then like on [DATE] -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Did it just start abruptly?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Monday through Friday.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it was like coming on but I never recognized any signs.</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In the fall [INAUDIBLE] so sick that my hands are starting to get numb. Do you remember everything? The doctor who was my surgeon, you know it’s your, it’s only your nerves, oh it’s nothing and so I was like, my whole system, I went in to overdrive with really like you know, my daughter started high school, that was stress, like it’s lack of sleep, lack of nutrition, all the stress and pressure I think my whole body just went into overdrive. In September, I got really sick and my whole system, my whole body would just burn inside like I was on fire, on fire head to toe and like I was in an incinerator or something. I would just go and cry. That’s how it got, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], because they were like you’re crazy, we don’t want you anymore. By the grace of God, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] got me into two doctors that listen to people and said this girl is not, not [INAUDIBLE] her, you know, it’s not, it’s a physical illness -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It attacks the mental aspect because you do feel major amounts of depression and, you know, the high times you feel like you’re out of your body, you know? It’s been a very very rough time.</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Did they think it was virus?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said that viruses, bacteria, and this other stuff [INAUDIBLE] -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s what -</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> It sounds like it’s nerves, you know, inflammation of, you know, like it sounds like almost could be nerves with the illusion of burning like that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No question about it.</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> You know having pain.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No question about it. I would just go and cry. I mean, I’ve been tested for Lyme disease every which way and that’s what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] really thought it was but then the more I talked to her, the more I gave her my thoughts and she’s like there’s one lab that does it, but I don’t want you to spend money, I think we need to try some other things and she, you know, I’ve done research and I mean this is, you’re so right, the thing of it is though is my arms have burned for years and I thought it was always nerves. I never paid attention to it, and then whenever all this stuff went haywire in my system, from head to toe I burn like a [INAUDIBLE].</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Burning from, you know, the chest and arms from [INAUDIBLE], you know spasms will give you that sensation of burning.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s the only part of my body that hasn’t been checked is my heart. I mean, I’ve been through so many invasive tests, I can’t even tell you and every thing’s come up negative except for things in my blood that she tested.</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> So they’d take cultures or blood cultures and it turned out you had some weird viruses, and bacteria that they can’t [INAUDIBLE] -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. So let’s do this. I just looked through this. I did the work plan to get you up to full time by [DATE]. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I yeah, I don’t think they’re going to like that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well then can fuss at me. You can go faster if you need to but, um, you know, I don’t, I don’t want it to backfire. I don’t want you, you know, absolutely you can’t travel, that will screw everything up.Yes, yes. Thank you, bye.</P>
<P><B>NR:</B> Thank you for letting me [INAUDIBLE] and I hope you feel better. Hope that works out for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you very much [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right, we’ll see you [NAME OTHER]. Okay, um we’ll see. This is what I want to do. Okay, on Monday [DATE] you can increase your hours to six a day every day. On [DATE] increase your hours to seven on Monday and Friday, six Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. These are two week intervals. On [DATE] increase hours to seven Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and six on Tuesday, Thursday. On [DATE] increase to seven hours Monday through Friday. On [DATE] eight hours Monday, seven hours Tuesday through Friday and a week later [DATE], eight hours Monday and Friday, seven Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Two weeks later, [DATE] eight hours Monday, Wednesday, Friday, seven Tuesday, Thursday. [DATE] eight hours a day, that’s like three weeks later. The patient may not travel at all, this will significantly set her back and impair her ability to work the hours specified above. Now, you know, you may go faster, it just depends but you don’t want to, um, you know, you can try slightly before, you can go up a little like you are now but I’d be careful. I mean what’s the difference if you work seven hours or eight hours. I mean if you’re building up and you have a plan, it may be okay. So, anyway, well let’s see what happens with this stuff with the, you know, when they’re checking your house and thoughts about the organisms and stuff. All right. So right now, you’re not really using the Remeron, you’re just doing the Cymbalta. You’re doing thirty twice a day?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then, you should have refills still.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then what about the Seroquel?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Seroquel.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not taking it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I take it when I need it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Okay, you have some, so that’s good. So I guess we’ll see you in like a month or so, right, that’s what we’ve been doing?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is that okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. You know, I haven’t seen [NAME OTHER] in a couple of weeks, I’m not sure where that’s going. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not sure that it’s going anywhere positive or useful?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean did you talk specifically to her about where it’s going or what your goals are or - yes, no?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, the last time I had a really bad time when I went in there to see her - talk to her about something I was very upset about and it was like, I just felt really bad when I left there because it was like, I just left with like nothing, you know, I didn’t know what I was looking for but I was very, I mean I know I need relax and I hear that a lot.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But, you know, I just, you know, my mother really upset me over the holidays and it just, I fell apart and it was like, you know, oh geez type of thing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I just didn’t know, I don’t know, I just, maybe I should make another appointment with her and tell her but I’m just really, I’m feeling really bad about it and, you know, and you’re like you really need to talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I would say, maybe you should. That’s a good idea. I mean it may be very uncomfortable to do that but I would think that’s the best and if you feel that it’s not helping or you can’t get into some positive direction, I can have you maybe see somebody else that’s more of a kick-you-in-the-backside kind of person. You know, I mean, but not to force you to do things but to sort of maybe more forcefully get you to see things and what is this decision you have to make, what are the positive, what are the negative, what do you have to give up to make a decision, to work full time what do you have to do, what can’t you do without being dead and work full time, how do you get rid of those things without, you know, and still have a house and a family and a husband and, you know, I mean is that the kind of thing you’re -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well I think it’s -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> To some extent.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That’s, you know a small part of it. The bigger thing is a lot of the issues that I’ve had. I started a couple of different things and then it was like, you know, I don’t know, I started [INAUDIBLE] one time. I tried that once and then, I just, you know, I don’t know, I think, I know a lot of it’s me because I’m like all over the place, you know, but I’m very, you know, this has just taken me by storm and I just really, you know, I mean who wouldn’t in their right frigging mind be, you know, be a lunatic and have to survive with everything that I’ve been through.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, that is a good point. Who wouldn’t be? You were for a while, right? I mean you’re not now. I mean, it might feel like you’re -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But I struggle with it, though.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Next to losing it every minute but -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Cause I don’t know [INAUDIBLE] -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But you’re, you’re coherent and, you know, you’re not like psychotic like, you know, not that you were, well I mean, I think that with all the stuff going on and everybody pushing you into the corner telling you you were crazy, you know, more or less, you felt that way and you really, you know, you were having a hard time struggling, keep a grasp on reality, you know, what was really happening to you, you know, having second thoughts about what you were imagining. Did you do this to yourself, you know, stuff like that and I think you know somewhat differently now.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well I’ll be honest with you though, the more I’ve researched and stuff, there was a lot of, you know, negative thought processes as you probably know, really like remember [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, I mean -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I never knew really how to be positive. I mean on the outside I did. Boy, I thought, you know -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No, other people, yeah. But not just -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m a big actor. And I suffer inside.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You keep it all bottled up and then -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It destroys me.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It basically ate away whatever, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It destroyed me and it’s a big part of what I’m going through right now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And so -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean part of that is - what do you have to do to survive. You can’t keep putting on this show, a show, you know, you can’t look, you know, good and run around -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Look like you feel good, um, you know, and be dying inside.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve aged ten years. I’ve aged ten years since last year, no kidding.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yeah, so how do you confront those things that are eating you up inside? Like how do you, how can you be comfortable going up to your boss and telling her to go F herself if that’s what you need to do -</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Not that you would do that, okay, because what you don’t want to do is all the sudden, you know, and this is a great fear of a lot of people, once a little bit comes out, man there’s no control, and I’m going to be telling people to go screw themselves and, you know, that’s not likely to happen in your case but I don’t know if that’s one of the fears you have. It’s one that commonly is.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s like a Pandora’s box. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah you know there will be a Pandora’s box to some extent because you’re going to have to reevaluate your relationship with everybody because people, I mean, you are the kind of person that you have your way of doing things but people will come and ask you for things and they’ll ask you for help until they suck the life out of you and you have nothing left. All right. You’re going to have to reevaluate your relationship with various people to protect yourself. I mean, obviously, when you look sick and you are sick, people tend not to ask you so many things but as you are more functional and look better, then you’re going to have to get a grip on that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And you know what? And you’re right, and people do think that oh [PATIENT NAME], they have no idea how I get up every morning and it takes me two hours to get up and, you know, my alarm goes off at five so I can get up at seven, and how nothing is, you know, my system is all screwed up. I mean my system is totally screwed up. I mean, physically.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Are you going to sleep okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you know what I do, I make sure that I really focus and meditate and pray before I go to sleep. I really do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Did we ever talk about Provigil?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> What is that?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Some medication, let’s do that next time.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s this stuff - um, do you have tr- you don’t have any trouble, you sometimes have trouble falling asleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I make myself go to sleep. I absolutely, believe me with all the things on my mind, I still make sure I sleep and find a way to go to sleep.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I mean in the morning, it’s like you’re coming back from the dead almost.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, because then, you know, here’s what it is, the biggest thing is oh shit, here’s another frigging day that I’ve got to face this shit. Pardon my French but that’s exactly the way I feel. This insurmountable thing, this thing that’s bigger than a mountain that -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean it is and you’re going to have it lingering. I mean we do have to figure out how to deal with it better. All right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I -</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Tell me what you think because if this doesn’t work out, I may want you to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. I mean he’s my partner but he does a lot of work with anxiety and cognitive behavioral stuff, a lot of experience. He’s the only person here that [INAUDIBLE] than I am. We’ve had a lot of experience. [NAME OTHER] the nurse practitioner, [INAUDIBLE] but therapy-wise.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Did she join any [INAUDIBLE]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> No. Can’t you tell? She’s going to be doing management stuff. Oh she’s great. She’s really nice. All right, so let me - </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] I guess so I can -</P>

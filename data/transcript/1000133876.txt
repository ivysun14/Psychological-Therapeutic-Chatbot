<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: The last one. Yep. That's too bad. I don't know. (inaudible) It's really kind of bad. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I decided though. I decided I figured out that nobody's going to do it. So. I'm in one of my confused, bewildered states of mind. I don't know. I on the thing where you know as far as Tanya's concerned, just I don't even ... I'm on this thing like I don't want to see her again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's just really ... I don't know. It's just really weird. It's really. I don't know. It's just kind of like a feeling. I don't know. Maybe it was all the events that took place over the weekend or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like I'm fed up. I don't want to see her anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It's you know it's like, you know even I was even at the point where you know I was ready really glad to see her go. But you know. I don't know. It'll probably change tomorrow. Who can tell?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it sounds like you are kind of just really upset about (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't ... yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not sure if (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But she ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's in one of her arrogant moods.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I just figured forget it. You know. Just ... well we were out Friday and went to my folks' house. We were just sitting there. She fell asleep. She had some wine and she fell asleep. That was all right. It really didn't bother me. I thought it was kind of rude (inaudible).</p>

<p>0:02:12.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just sitting there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. We were just sitting there and talking, and she fell asleep. So that didn't bother me. You know. So she stayed the night Friday night and we made love on Friday and it was all right. Then like the next morning, I didn't really feel like making love.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you woke up and you just didn't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just didn't feel like it. You know. But she was rather insistent about the whole thing. So it was like, and I was very capable of making love, but like I did it in spite instead of anything else. You know like I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh? Well I did it ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you did make love?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah in spite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you didn't really want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really didn't want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of felt like you were doing something kind on your own (inaudible) just to get (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It was just like, "Okay. You want it? Okay. Let's go".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a duty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Like there's nothing and I think she really felt it too. So when was it ... yeah. That Saturday. And then we went and I said, "Well I have to go to the store and see if I can find something for my father". So we're looking around the store and it's like as if she was following me, which she was. I just felt like saying, "You know. Please don't follow me".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hey. You really want to get rid of her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. As if ...</p>

<p>0:03:36.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was just getting on your nerves.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She was really making me nervous. Then we went up to this counter and they were having ... they had all this shampoo on sale. And they said limit one. I said, "I'm going to get one". She said, "If you want to, I'll get one". I says, "Okay. I'll get two". So we go up and I handed one to her and the girl says ... what did she say? The girl at the counter said something like, "Well, I'll sell you both of them". Or something like this and Tanya just said, "Well we are two entities", or something like this. She gets all huffy about the whole thing. Jesus. That really pisses me off. And I just couldn't really see (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's getting worked up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really worked up about it. Some old man with a shopping bag bumped into her and she says, "Well don't say excuse me".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh man. It sounds like she was really ... sounds like you, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know like wow. I just said, "So, the old man bumped into you with his shopping bag. So so what?". So then we went and we were lying on the beach and I said ... we were supposed to go to this party that night. And I said something like, oh I said, "Jim I don't think has arrived". He was a friend of ours, because he has a cast and can't drive. I said, well I'll call him up and see if he needs a ride. And the plans were previous to this was that I was gonna ride home with Tanya because she was driving. She lives out where the party was. Then I was going to ride home with somebody else who lived in my area. But then I said, "Well I'll call up Jim". Tanya says, "Well he couldn't drive (inaudible) far". Then I said, "Well I don't know if he'd really want to". And she gets all huffy about that because I wasn't riding with her.</p>

<p>Well we got to the party. She was still pissed. And she said, it got down to the point where I was insensitive. And I said ... you know at that time I couldn't really visualize myself as being insensitive, but then she said something like, "you know you're willing to do anything else for anybody except me". Then it still didn't darn on me, but after the next day, it darned on me that it was true. That I really ... I wasn't doing anything for her, but I would do anything for anybody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sounds like you really don't want to give into her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Like I really would for anybody else. And she was just ... it was really just a whole. And then Jim was sitting there and he says, "Yes. You are insensitive". They were both ganging up on me and I said, "You know, I just can't see it".</p>

<p>So then we were talking about going to California. Jim and Tanya were supposed to come to California with me and my family. So I got a letter from my cousin. I mean my folks got a letter from my cousin saying that this place is gonna cost $300.00. So I was tabbing up the people who could pay. The people who had jobs. Right. And they were the ones who were going to pay for it. Well, Tanya said that she didn't think it was fair. She said, "Why?". Because she says why she wouldn't pay for somebody else and I said, "Right. You're correct in saying that".</p>

<p>0:06:49.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Paying for someone else who will ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: People like say for instance my aunt can't pay because she's on social security, but she can get enough money to go there. My sister can't pay because she's going to school. My cousin can't pay because she's going to school. So people who can't pay, aren't going to pay is the way I figured it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would pay. So Tanya said that she couldn't see paying for somebody else. And I said I can understand this. Then she says, "well why don't you ...". She thought that we could let someone else take care of it or something like this. I said, "If you really don't want to ... if you really feel this way, you don't have to go". And then if you really feel this way, you don't have to go. She says, "Oh I knew you'd get all mad about it". And I said, "No. I said if you don't want to go, don't go. If you don't feel you want to pay for it". She says, "What are you gonna do if we don't pay? I mean, if we don't come, who's going to pay?" I said, "Well, we'll probably just end up paying more that's all". She says, "Well, you see you'd do it for them" or something like this. She says, "There you go, being taken advantage of again". I said, "It doesn't bother me" I said, "If it bothers you, then it's me who's being taken advantage of being taken advantage of. You know, not you".</p>

<p>It was just all bad. It was just unbelievable. Like I could ... I even went to the john and she followed me up to the john. It was just unbelievable. I'd turn around and she was there. Feels like I just didn't want to see her. It was a party. You want to see other people. It was just really something else. And then we came down from the john and oh and then it was like, then it was ... the thing was when she does come to California, am I gonna pick her up at the airport. And I said no. I said, "It would be much easier if you took the limousine to Disney Land and Disney Land is close to the beach and we can meet at Disney Land". She thought that was terrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I wouldn't pick her up at the airport. I said, "It's just a matter of convenience". I said, "If you've ever been to LA, you know that traffic is really a hassle to get to the airport and to the beach". It's like it takes a good two hours and I just don't think it's really necessary. And she says, "Oh you've never been to an airport alone", or something. And I said, "I have. It didn't bother me. Well, it bothers me and if you really knew that it bothers me, you should". I just don't think I should. I just don't think I should. Then Jim was sitting there and he was, "Well, I will". I said, "Well you go right ahead". Because I won't. Then she says, "Yeah. There you go again. Won't do for me, but you do for all the other people". That story again.</p>

<p>0:09:43.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it just kind of (inaudible) following you around, saying things. It's kind of like you just don't really feel like you want (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It was just like I want .. it's like forget it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just unbelievable. Then we were talking in the yard. I don't know how this ... well we walked from the front to the back. We were talking in the yard, talking about me being insensitive again. I said something like, oh this is it, "when we were in bed together, we had finished making love, all I did was move over and go to sleep". And I said, "Well, I was tired". And I said, "Well you can't ... men aren't built like women. They aren't ready to go the next minute". I said, "Well I just you know like". She said, "You just laid over and went to sleep". And I said you know what can I say. Then I said to her, "Well I think I remember telling you this again. It's that there are times that I really have to be alone and I just don't want to be bothered with anybody, even you". I said, "I just don't want to be bothered". She said, "Well what's gonna happen 30 years from now?" I said, "Don't talk to me about 30 years from now".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt really being pulled (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. You know. I said, "Just don't talk to me 30 years from now". And then I said, "As far as sex goes", I said, "As far as sex goes, I don't need sex that often". I said, "To be truthful I can go for two weeks, a week to two weeks without having sex". So then she started crying and I said, "Now what are you crying about?" So, well anyway it turned out that her ... her gynecologist told her that she was very sensitive and she needed, she was very high strung and needed sex, and it was .. and she said that he had asked her about me. And he said that it's a very big mistake for two people with different biological makeups to plan to get married or something like this. So she was all upset about that. I never really thought about that before. It never really dawned on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow you might be incompatible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like she just has a bigger appetite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This is what this doctor was saying. That we would be very incompatible. And she was bawling about this and I said ... we just sat there. She says there's nothing you can do about it. You know, there's really nothing you can do about it, which is true. There really isn't anything to do about it. So that was that.</p>

<p>0:12:38.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When she told you about the doctor, how did that make you (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that point, it was kind of like well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you just didn't want to (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It just ... at that point, it was really, it was kind of like yeah. It was really kind of well ... that's too bad. Like yesterday we went over to my uncle's and even then ... maybe it's just me, but I had this feeling as if she was just following me. It was just unbelievable. Like my cousins were there, two of my cousins, and my cousin's girlfriend. And they were all living in California and they came back because they couldn't find a job. So I hadn't seen them since last December. So we were talking, sitting around and stuff like that. She was kind of being out of place, not being in the family or anything like this.</p>

<p>I was playing ping pong with this little cousin who's about 7 or something. Playing ping pong with the kid and she couldn't even play. I was just playing ping pong with him. Tanya comes up and says, "Let's you and I play ping pong". I said, "I'm playing with Mandy".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you really felt her just commanding something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As if I'm supposed to forget about everything else and just my attention, everything is supposed to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everything (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Evolve around her and I ... really it's too much. Too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of why you're feeling like she's just too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Um hum. Yep. Last night I was thinking about her going to Spain and I said, "Oh this is really gonna be kind of nice". Thinking about these girls who I am going to ask out again and stuff like this. Then I was thinking about oh then she'll be coming to California. Then I was thinking oh maybe she'll meet somebody in Spain (inaudible) .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Trying to get out of it graciously without hurting her feelings, which is really unbelievable. I just called her up. We were supposed to go to ... oh she had mentioned she was going out with this friend of ours, Jessie. They were going to go out to dinner tonight. I really don't feel like going. I had a lot of work to do though. Do my laundry and stuff like that and I really don't feel like going because I really don't feel like seeing her.</p>

<p>0:15:09.8</p>

<p>So I get on the phone. I was being very nice and I said, "Well I really don't feel like going tonight". I said I'm tired and stuff like that. I said, "Besides, that will give you and Jessie really ...". I said, saying it factitiously, "Oh that'll give you and Jessie a good chance to talk about me". She says, "Well you're being very egotistical". I said that's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like kind of you had it up to your eyeballs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's just unbelievable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When is she going home?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Saturday. I don't even know what to do between now and Saturday. I'm sure it's gonna ... I don't know if it's gonna boil between then and now or whatever's gonna happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) your last week before (inaudible) gonna be a continuation of what the last weekend was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. You know like, we really don't have a chance to see one another that often. Like the end of school and you got to get everything ready and stuff like that. I'm sure she'll be busy packing just like I have too. I don't know.</p>

<p>I was trying to think well maybe it was just me. Maybe I was just really feeling rotten and I just didn't ... it was really unbelievable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of maybe it was just kind of a situational (inaudible) turning into a long-range about your compatibility (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I was thinking about okay when we were having sex, maybe this is what affected her that she was so arrogant because I was so insensitive about the whole thing. That maybe this is why or something ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. That she is gonna become real nasty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Just really nasty. And that party, just really bugged me to death. There were a lot of other people that she knew, that she could have talked to. I went in the house. She was outside with Jim. I just went in the house and was talking to these other friends (inaudible) .</p>

<p>Also it was funny that you know I kind of felt the same way, I mean like this when ... even before I started seeing you. It was kind of like that way before. I was becoming very insensitive toward her and I just kind of really had been fed up. Even before we had started having sex and stuff like that ...</p>

<p>0:18:19.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like when you were just friends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you know she would get on your nerves (inaudible) Now it kind of makes this relationship change and (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... because it was kind of (inaudible) now its kind of she's just trying to get on your nerves (inaudible) even within the basis (inaudible) relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. Uh huh. That's really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost kind of like she can expect more and demand more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Really. There's some quote that I read this weekend about marriage. The first part was all I remember it was "maintaining one's independence". Then there was something about something else. There were two other things, but that I remember. Maintaining one's independence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can't even go to the john without somebody following you. (inaudible) I just ... I really couldn't see telling her that ... well I did in a way when I was trying to say there are times that I like to be alone and stuff like that. But you know like just coming out and just saying that, "You know, you really bug me".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's probably like you feel like (inaudible) like a pressure cooker.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:20:03.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just makes it boiling and boiling. And the more you're around her like she follows you like ... it's like when she follows you to the john, it was like the last (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. Just get off my back. Oh I know, she said ... that's when I said there are times I want ... she said something like, "It's such a short time before I leave, I wanted to spend every moment I could with you". That's when I said, "well you know, I just don't want to spend all my time with you".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I just ... she was really just grabbing hold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I said, "I don't want to spend all the time with you. You know there are times when I want to be alone. You know, just let me alone". Then, "what are you (inaudible) 30 years from now?" Who cares now. I can't think ahead that far. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the truth. That's the truth. Then I said to her, I said, "I really don't know if there's something wrong with me". I said, "I heard it all before that if you're really in love with a person, madly in love with them, and you just want to be with them every moment of the day, but I don't". I said I don't. (inaudible)</p>

<p>I'll start over again. Not unless I do something else about it. I mean, start going out with someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you .. I guess you're saying like that's something that you're really do want to do. It sounds like you're saying (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's true. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you feel, well kind of when I was hung up sexually, it hung me up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was afraid of (inaudible). Well maybe not afraid of being (inaudible) it developing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Developing. Right. Yeah that's true.</p>

<p>0:22:56.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) feel free from that (inaudible) build a wall around you (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess ... does it feel better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It does. It really dose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) feels better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh hum. Oh what do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I'm asking you if you don't feel that kind of (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. No. You know. There's no reason now. I was thinking about that last night and I thought to myself, "Little does Tanya know what she let loose". I mean really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she kind of helped you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Really you know. I was thinking little does she know what she let loose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Really. I was ... I can see you know like Tanya was getting really upset because I was talking to my cousin's girlfriend. My cousin's living with her folks now and her. I was saying, "You know we'll have to get together during the summer". You know, since we were all going to be in New York and stuff. Blah blah blah. So I was asking Tanya for a piece of paper and she goes (inaudible) so that I can get their phone number and she just kind of ripped it out of her checkbook and I thought, "Oh Christ".</p>

<p>Then I was thinking of bringing up the point with her about going out with someone else this summer. What she would say about the whole thing. Or kind of like saying, "if you want to go out with somebody in Spain, feel free". But then, that would really be (inaudible). There's just no way to get out of it graciously when you kind of think about it. There really isn't. There's no way at all. Unless I could write her a nice letter in Spain. That would be really rotten. That would just really be cruel. (inaudible)</p>

<p>0:25:21.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. You know there's just got to be some way. I can practically visualize the girl I'd like to go out with, but Tanya doesn't fit the bill. It's really something like that. It's just like her (inaudible) attitude. That's the only thing that's really upsetting me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just don't know. I'm just thinking now should I just say to her, "I'm sorry. I just don't feel that I really am truly in love with you and I don't feel that there would be any point in going on further", or ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or if I should just let things ride and see what (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's see what happens when you see what happens (inaudible) the way she feels to when she comes back (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. This is what I was thinking of too. I made that mistake I might find that I really am happy to see her. Right. Maybe. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you know, you think about it, it's hard to get over ... it's like thinking about just after this weekend (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you're saying I don't know. I might regret that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Right. You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) .</p>

<p>0:27:18.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course, that's kind of like the way any decision-making is made, but you don't want to make it too hastily. I don't know. I was just thinking what I real undoubtedly see her before I leave and if I feel about her the same way that I feel now, I'm sure it'll show. There'll be no doubt in my mind. I can't fall over someone who I don't want to be with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you just don't want to put on (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I can't. There's something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tentative. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's like after we had gotten back .. when I told her that I was picking up my, she says, "Well then I might as well just go home". So at any rate, she just got herself together and I said, "Well, I'll walk you out". You know, she's gonna get her stuff and leave. So we're sitting there and I said, "Well, you know. What are you so mad about?". She told me nothing. Then she was like, "Are you gonna call Jim?". So I called Jim and I was on the phone and then I said, "Well what time did you want to go?" and she was, "Well, I don't care. Just don't let me inconvenience you. I'll be out (inaudible)". Something like this. Then I said, "Boy. Aren't we pissed off." Then I got off the phone and I said, "Well what is it?" She just kind of clammed up. I said, "Well God. I'm not a mind reader".</p>

<p>So I guess it's just my whole attitude. I said, "Well is it my attitude or something with yours or something like this?" She said, "What do you want to say?" Then at the party I said to her, "Well I asked you what was wrong? I said I asked you what was wrong and you wouldn't even tell me". You said something like it was your attitude and I said that doesn't tell me anything. She says, "Well you can't expect someone to say something if you won't even touch me", or something like this. I said, "Do I have to touch you in order to ...". She says, "Well it makes it easier to say some things".</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when you asked her what's the matter, so did she want you to give her something before she could (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I ... hold her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to show her ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. You know, hold her or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind she just realized she wants this sign and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were just sitting there and I asked her and she wouldn't say anything. I was interested to know. I really was because you know. And then I got to the point where I didn't care. I said, "If you're not gonna tell me, then I don't care". I'm not gonna worry about it. But she said that I wouldn't, didn't touch her or hold her. Then she said it would have made it easier for her to tell me if I were to have held her. So you just (inaudible) . You just could have come out and said so.</p>

<p>She must have the same feeling. I've wondered what she must feel like if it's a strained, more or less like it's been a strained weekend. Like it was really very ... like it was really at the boiling point. Just very strained. Like it was difficult to bring up conversation. You know, like one of those things. You just sit there and ... I was thinking of you know like me being very so precocious, me saying that she will always be there. Something like this. Like being dependent upon her. Seeing that I really hadn't gone out with girls and I thought to myself that was the easiest thing was to, as long as Tanya was there, it was very easy.</p>

<p>0:32:40.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like ... it's kind of scary at first on account of she was there and you know her. It's kind of like easing yourself into water.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was very, it was the easiest thing for me to do. Then I (inaudible) this summer really giving me an opportunity to see how I really react toward a girl I never took out or something like this. Which really kind of interests me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you do have your standard (inaudible) being a freak or something. I mean (inaudible) well maybe I (inaudible) may not be (inaudible) she's the best thing. (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact, while at this party I was thinking to myself, gee all the girls I could ask out now if only Tanya wasn't here. I was really (inaudible) . I was missing this great opportunity.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I don't know. I'm thinking about California. I thought to myself, well this is my vacation. It's sure is gonna be a hell of a vacation if I feel the same way about Tanya.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like spending weeks with her and just like I'd be really miserable. I thought oh kripe. I thought to myself, you know if I really feel the same way about her and if I really feel like going out with someone else and she's there ... It just be too bad.</p>

<p>0:37:06.4</p>

<p>I was thinking like you know what my sister did at one time. She was going out with my brother-in-law and it's kind of like a cooling off period. You know like they could both go out with someone different if they felt like even though they weren't gonna see anybody for ... they weren't gonna see one another for a month. Or they could go out with someone else for a month. It was really kind of ... it seemed to me as if it was really silly. Some kind of a joke.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You need some cooling off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was just thinking it. It really wasn't so dumb. I could really kind of understand it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do they do now? They're gonna get married.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. That also just entered my mind. What do they do now when they're married? There just isn't any way you could go off. I feel there really must be something else. Are you married by the way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just dawned on me too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you were married or not. I thought I ... it never really entered my mind before. I didn't even presume if you were or you weren't. It's just a question and I just brought it up. Just dawned on me. So then you can't answer. I was thinking if a person still remains the all American dream. If the person's really in love with someone, they wouldn't need a cooling off period. Then I think to myself that I must not really be in love with Tanya if I don't want to see her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to know. I mean ... I guess there's ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no basis of (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if its black or white.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's probably true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. I have no basis of comparison. I really don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know like could I feel strong with her (inaudible) because you haven't felt (inaudible)</p>

<p>0:39:15.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Really. I really don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you kind of feel, gee I hope this isn't as good as it can get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. That's the truth. Because if this is it, it's really ... wow. And then you know, I just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Most people should get married for (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it. That's what I'm saying. It's just no reason why. There's nothing. There's no reason at all. You just shouldn't. (inaudible) the movie again. You're like really in love with a person, you'll know (inaudible) . There'll just be some awe about you or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just don't know (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really. There's just something I don't know about. I say I'm going to a party Saturday night and Tanya won't be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's really awful. It's really kind of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the way you feel, that you feel it's pretty rotten.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pretty rotten to feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) looking forward ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Looking forward to something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's really done a lot for me. You know. She really has. (inaudible) just rotten. Just to say I'm really looking forward to going out with someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hum. Really. In fact I was thinking of I should get her a gift before she goes away or something like this. Then I thought oh Christ. If this is just gonna prolong it, I just don't want to. But probably I'll do the right thing other than accept it. Say the right thing, you accept it then. Because I'm sure she'll be able to (inaudible) . I'd be interested to read her mind (inaudible) .</p>

<p>0:43:33.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Read her mind about what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What she's thinking about. How she feels about the whole thing. I really would. I thought well maybe she's feeling the same way. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Maybe she just (inaudible). I wonder if they'll let me know if I have to be tested?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They'll call you during the week probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they'll set up a time (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he should be calling you shortly. I totally agree it would be easier this week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. They'll still be around next week won't they?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. (inaudible) office is down the hall (inaudible) It isn't (inaudible) to take those tests (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not going to change drastically in over a week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Not really. I wasn't gonna try to avoid you. Right?</p>

<p>0:45:51.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) cleared up sexual hang-ups (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's got to be something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just gonna ... it isn't what you exactly feel that you want to. You're not sure of that. You don't know (inaudible) .</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just not in your dream.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's not. I accomplished a great deal. It's something better off than where I started from that's for damn sure, which is really terrific. But anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. No. I wasn't. I wasn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think your time's up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I'm ready to go out and meet the world.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually I don't think it has anything to do with what's going on, but just to make sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess this just . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's how many I can have or whatever. I did it last year, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I have to send treatment forms to Blue Cross requesting additional sessions and this is a response to the most recent one of those. This means that starting on May 21st, which is the beginning of the authorization; you're authorized for 12 more sessions. When that's up I will write them again so they will authorize 12 more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's changing anyway, right? You're going to get off of the . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am. I don't know when the last time we talked about this was, so I believe I will be on Blue Cross until January 1st.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. January 1st. If I remember right, September 1st.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Originally I was going to leave in September, then the whole thing happened with—did I tell you about this? They kicked me off and then they said, "Yes, we'll put you back on immediately," which they were supposed to have done earlier this week although I have not heard from them. It just seemed like it would be easier to leave with the new year because for you [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:40), that's when the enrollment period ends. I just figured it would make it simpler. [00:01:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That's helpful. Guess I'm not the only one making that (laughs) process longer. Great. So anyway, I'm off today. I have the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner tonight for this wedding and I've really not been looking forward to it all week. I've kind of just been like, "Ugh." It ended up turning into so much work and more than I'd bargained for. I said I would take care of ordering the catering for the after party at the Tavern, so they sent me the menu, I sent the menu to Sandra and Dan, they sent me back their selections, and then I was supposed to send it to the Tavern. I don't know; I think maybe subconsciously I was just kind of like, "Ugh, I'll do it eventually," or whatever because maybe it was one less thing. I don't know, but I didn't do it until Tuesday and then the person e-mailed me back, "Oh, it's too late to put the order in for the kitchen," so I was freaking out. This great bartender who works there but also does stuff in the lounge for the catering orders was like, "Okay, I pulled a few strings and got all this stuff." I was like, "Oh, thank God," because that just would have been like, "Oh, Lord, after all this." Anyway, it's supposed to be 92 tomorrow, which is the wedding. [00:03:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Degrees?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Degrees and I'm sure humid. It might rain so we have to practice both the ceremony outside and inside, in which case it would be in the same location as the dance floor. It would kind of suck. Then the cocktail hour would also have to be in there. Hopefully it doesn't rain. I'm looking forward to it. I'm kind of just like, "Let's just get it done already." It almost feels like I'm back at the hotel working the wedding. I almost feel like not going into it. I'm hoping that I can enjoy it a little bit. It's good because, obviously, it is pretty exciting that there is a possibility of doing this on the side for myself because this is something that I love. [00:04:03] If I could make money eventually doing it, then great. So I'll have pictures and I'll have a testimonial from them and I can maybe start a blog and put some energy into that. That would be awesome, so I'm looking at it that way also. It's my friend's wedding and I would like to just be excited about people I haven't seen in a while and hanging out; leave all the other shit, which is true. Anyway, I'm looking forward to that. [00:04:38]</p>

<p>I guess continuing what we were talking about last week, Franklin (ph) and everything, this week I got irritated with him a few times, but not in a way that I could really say anything to him. A couple of times we were hanging out with friends. The first time, we went on Tuesday, the night before Fourth of July, because we didn't have to work. My friend, this kid that I went to high school with and knew pretty well in high school, happens to live a few houses down and I had . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds funny. [00:05:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's funny. I saw him on the street and was like, "You live here?" and he was like, "You live here?" We hadn't had a chance to go over there and he was like, "Oh, we're having a couple of people over, having a little drink. You guys should come over." So we went over. It was guys and there was this other girl that was a friend of one of the roommates and me; and then this other girl came. I ended up talking to her about music and dancing and then they started talking about working out and so then Franklin was giving his expertise and I got so irritated because I felt like, "Why do you insist on being the f**king expert on everything?" I almost felt like it was a little bit embarrassing, like what if people are like, "Okay. Whatever. We get it." He would just go on and on. Then, again, on Fourth of July in the evening to we went to the [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:11) cruise leader and his girlfriend had a little barbeque get together. I came into the conversation in the living room between Franklin, this guy, Loman, who's on the crew with him, and Loman's fiancé, Kristy. They're like 21, they live with their parents, they've been together since they were like 12, and they're engaged or whatever—long term engagement. [00:06:41] They were talking about what they're going to do, if they're going to get an apartment and move to an apartment. Loman is saying that he wants to buy a three-family—do that whole thing first. They're talking about the pros and cons. Kristy is like, "I don't know. I'm not ready for that. I'd rather wait a little while." He's like, "No, I think we should just live at home and save up and then immediately buy." She said, "I'd rather move to an apartment." Whatever. So this conversation is going on. [00:07:05] Franklin starts to give his expertise on buying a home and home ownership. I'm sitting there thinking, "What are you talking about? You don't own a home. You don't know what you're talking about." Then every time I tried to say something—I was kind of on her side—it's simpler saving up money getting approved if you have a co-signer, which they do, and getting property. But you're starting a new job. You're 21. He travels a lot for work. Do you really want to be landlords? Do you want to be dealing with this and all the money you have to spend on furniture and save anything up before you can get a renter. Every time I say something, Franklin is interjecting, "She doesn't know enough. Don't listen to her. She doesn't know what she's talking about. This is what you need to do." I literally got so annoyed, and I know these people well, whatever, so I wasn't trying to be like "ha-ha". I was just like, "Okay, I'm just saying. Shut up," and I walked away annoyed. It was f**king annoying like, "Okay. You can say whatever you want to say but if I want to say something, don't brush me off like a jerk." Then he was like, "Are you going to stop being rude now?" I was like, "I'm not being rude. I was just trying to say something and you interrupted me." He was like, "All right. Whatever." "Okay. Don't act like I'm the jerk when you were clearly just being a jerk." And then he's even explaining the first time home ownership program thing that they have in Boston where you can take this course and the city will match it. And then he's like, "It's as simple as this, breaking down mortgages. If you have any questions about it, let me know because I know a lot about it." [00:09:04] I was like, "Why would he say that?" Then I was like, "Oh, because he took a business course and some of the problems and economics—whatever course it was—were mortgages and how they work and how interest works and all of that stuff." I was like, "Okay, just because you did that homework assignment does not make you the expert. If she has questions, she should go to a realtor." I don't understand. [00:09:33]</p>

<p>I was thinking, "Okay, besides from all this other shit—meanwhile, I haven't really been checking the phone bill because it's ridiculous. I haven't really tried to see anything, but the other morning he left his phone on the bed and it was open to Facebook, so I clicked on a message just to see who the first messages are. First message is from this same chick that I said to stop texting and he's [ ] (inaudible at 00:10:11) an e-mail for a f**king marketing thing. Five messages of her asking questions about how a camera works or whatever. I said, "Okay, great." It wasn't like, "Thanks for sending me those pictures," or whatever. (chuckles) But at the same time it's almost like—first of all, obviously you're not talking about marketing stuff. She's hitting you up for help with stuff that you know stuff about, which is, I guess, whatever. But if you're going to stop talking to somebody consistently then don't answer everything that they ask. [00:10:47] There was a long string of messages. I didn't look through all of them because I wasn't going to sit there and look through his phone. Then the other day—I just kind of noticed a couple of things like he's messaging while on Facebook. The other day I caught him out of the corner of my eye erasing a conversation on Facebook. It's uneasy to have to feel like that or to have to wonder. [00:11:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you don't trust him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I say to him, "I don't really trust you," then it will be my problem. Like, "I don't know why. You have no reason to not trust me. I tell you everything. I'm not talking to anybody. Blah, blah, blah. You have no reason not to trust me." And then if I bring up something like, "Well, because of past stuff I have had a hard time this whole time." We've had this conversation before. Because of what's happened in the past that has been inappropriate, I have a hard time. "Why are you always bringing up the past?" Those feelings, being frustrated with that situation and feeling of mistrust combined with being really irritated when he goes overboard with f**king talking and being an expert and commanding the whole attention of the world, I was feeling really uneasy the whole week about our relationship because of that shit. I don't know how to approach it. (pause) [00:12:46] </p>

<p>It's especially difficult because he obviously doesn't even have any idea that something is wrong, so for him everything is just great. Also, I feel like we spent too much time together last weekend. We spent the whole weekend together and I was like, "Ugh, why? I don't know. I almost feel like because he doesn't make plans or he makes plans to hang out at home, then I feel like I ended up just making plans to hang out at home. Then he doesn't feel like it's too much time or anything like that. He's fine with whatever. I felt like it would have done us both good because I was really irritated by the end of the weekend. (pause) [00:14:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you describe it is as all of this being very much on his terms and as though that's unavoidable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does feel unavoidable without conflict.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. I guess I don't want to have conflict. I don't know how to approach it and have it not be [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:44) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether the conflict is explicit between you or just in you, there is conflict. You don't trust him. You, at the very least, clearly feel you have reason not to trust him. As you said last week, not so much because you think he's having an affair, but because you feel like he's acting inappropriately in ways that are hurtful to you. But yeah, you don't trust him. In one way you sound pretty confident in your reasons why you don't and, on the other hand, you can't think of a way you can talk to him about this that wouldn't cause conflict between the two of you—but it's kind of already there. [00:15:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I guess part of me also feels like maybe I am making a mountain out of a molehill or maybe I should just leave it alone if it's just chatting and whatever. Or that other people will be like, "Really? At least he's not cheating. Who cares?" But I can't agree with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The punch is that I think you tend to minimize how you feel. It sounded like 50 text messages a day for five days straight, whenever that was, was really not okay with you and not something you feel comfortable sort of shrugging your shoulders over. And that it was also, as you put it then, a pattern of behavior—it wasn't a one-time thing—which also led you to not want to shrug your shoulders. I think you tend to minimize or sort of deny how you really feel about how he's acting because you're really worried about the conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. [00:17:11] Part of worry about the conflict is having tried to have a conversation where I explain how I feel about it, but it's always not gone well, (sniggers) so I just don't know how else to approach it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you worry that you're really putting the relationship in jeopardy if you really put your foot down about this and if you're insistent about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like what am I insistent about? Don't have friends that are girls at all? Don't talk to any girls? That's what he has said. That's also what I don't know because then he'll ask me that question, too—should he just not talk to any girls? "I'm just not going to talk to any girls." I don't know if that's what I'm saying. [00:18:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's so hard for you to stay with what you're upset about, I think. In other words, I think you really don't like conflict. I think you're really scared for that relationship because you know full well there's a difference between his having girls who are friends and his texting somebody excessively and being secretive about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I'm not stupid. I also know the difference between having friends that are girls that you only talk to and that I never met and that you never initiated or hang out or plan with, and people that we hang out with. Or, for example, my friend living around the corner inviting me over explicitly, but obviously bringing Franklin and not being like, "I'm going to my friend's house." Or bringing people around when Franklin is there like, "This is my friend" whatever it may be. This is how I behave with friends—all friends—friends of the opposite sex as well, because it can be a little bit awkward sometimes if you maybe don't know a guy and your girlfriend is talking to/hanging out with. I guess in that sense part of me is like it isn't the hanging out, so is that better or worse? It's almost worse because you're getting some weird satisfaction out of only having girls as friends that you talk to. It's a little odd, you know? [00:20:02] </p>

<p>Even if I do have guy friends that I just—and I know I'm doing this whole justification thing—but if I do have guy friends that I talk to like I only know who they are like, "Oh, I talked to my friend Brian that I traveled with. He hit me up and said he might be going to Europe." Whatever. Who cares? But he's sending to people every day. I'm just talking about it. First of all, we have this on one hand and avoiding the conflict. I don't want to do that. Then on the other hand, there are these personality traits of his that are so f**king irritating to me and that's even a more difficult thing to address because that's who I am. There are things about me that I'm sure he doesn't like and that make him feel that way in social situations, so where do you draw the line in terms of figuring that stuff out or what you compromise on and what you don't? Or what you don't want to or don't feel comfortable doing? See, I am having a lot of conflict within myself. (sniggers) I don't want to bring it outwards. (chuckles) (pause) [00:21:39] I do, between those two issues, if I'm going to compromise on something it's going to be personality issues that are irritating—I at least can talk to him about minimizing or "Sometimes I feel this way when you act this way, and I don't like that," as opposed to a trust issue which, for me, is a bigger and more present issue because it's less controllable. You have it or you don't. If somebody doesn't trust the other person, it's the person that's not being trusted's job to make sure that person feels like they can trust them. I think. Yeah. (sniggers) [00:22:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also seems to me there is a third issue there, which is that I suspect for reasons to do with each of you, very difficult to communicate about this stuff. I think part of the reason you're so worried about conflict between you and he, like stuff out there, is because you feel like he'll shoot down what you're saying or, I get the feeling, sort of bully you into feeling like it's your problem. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then kind of guilting me about it in that regard. The whole "I'm not going to talk to anybody then." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And that itself is another problem that there is a way you can talk to him about this where even if he disagrees, at least it feels to you like taking seriously where you're coming from. [00:23:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So I'm kind of at a loss about it at this point. (pause) [00:24:19] I'd like to be able to go into a discussion about it with a game plan of some sort. The same way that we had a talk about all this stuff that we were breaking up over a few weeks ago and how I felt like finally he was open to hear what I was saying and being responsive and talk more about it—he was feeling whatever—but I don't know how to do it about this. Unless I just say straight up, "I really don't trust you with talking to girls and messaging them, not because I think you're doing anything, but just because it makes me feel uncomfortable and feel that you're secretive." It just sucks because literally I'm saying this and I'm already hearing his response because I've been through this before already. "I can't have a private life then?" How is there going to be any conversation if his immediate reaction is just to be defensive and come up with what he thinks is the only solution to make me happy, which is to just not talk to anybody and blah, blah, blah, but it's like, "How am I even supposed to know that's going to be the case?" That's not making me feel any better about it. What am I supposed to say? "You're a weirdo for talking to people so much like this?" which is probably what I think; it's weird. Am I supposed to say that and I'm a weirdo? I don't want to be mean. (pause) [00:26:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had said to me before that you feel like—I'm not sure why this doesn't come up more—but you said before that you feel like he's probably looking for something, like some kind of flirtation, some sense of being attractive and desired. That's trailing along those lines from this and I guess my sense is that that's part of what's hurtful to you. I'm not sure why that doesn't come up more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like here or between him and I? [00:27:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, both. If that's what your best guess of what about for him and, I think, it inherits what makes it so hurtful to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When we talked about the texting with the girl, before I knew how much they were texting, I said to him, "Honestly, I'm not saying this in a nutso way but I'm asking seriously—are you seeking a little bit of attention and is it some of the attention that you like about it?" At first he was kind of like, "What are you talking about?" Then he was kind of like, "Yeah, I guess, a little." He kind of paused for a second and I was like, "Well, I don't think that you have any reason to seek that kind of outside attention and, if you do, then I really would like you to talk to me about it so that if there is anything that I'm not giving you attention on whenever I can." [00:28:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that's an important part of how you think about it. "It's troubling to me if you're showing to me that you need some kind of attention . . . "</p>

<p>CLIENT: Insulting me . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ". . . and if there's some way I'm not giving you enough or the right kind of attention, you need to let me know. I want to talk to you about it." That sounds to me like part of the story. [00:29:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. How do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The other part of the story seems to be, I would imagine, "I find it hurtful and angering and it makes me feel like I can't trust you when you do this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And that part I didn't say. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow it got left out. (chuckles) I guess I imagine it makes it easier for him to shut you down when you're not being as assertive about what you actually feel and how it bothers you and how you think critically of it. That stuff is all there, I'm pretty sure. In other words, I think you really do have a problem with his doing this. I think it really upsets you and I think you feel critical and mistrustful of him for it. If I'm wrong, let me know, but I think that's how you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems much harder to speak to that part of it. Like, "If I'm not taking care of you in some way that I could be better, stuff like this wouldn't happen. That's not hard to say. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the, "Well I think this is wrong and hurtful and inappropriate and it makes me feel like I can't trust you," that's much harder to say, I guess. I'm not trying to prescribe what you should tell him or how you should say it, but I guess I'm trying to point out that . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I can't think of what the outcome would be. If we have cross words, that's not what I want. I don't want him to be like, "Okay, you can have my Facebook password, my e-mail password, check my phone all the time and blah, blah, blah." I don't know why that's the outcome I see happening; I can't see anything else. I don't know. How do you build trust with somebody if they're—okay, let's say he's like, "Okay, I want to rebuild the trust." [00:32:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think the first and most important thing is that he's really listened to what you've said and taken it seriously. I would imagine that would actually go a long ways in itself to fixing things, instead of saying, "This is your problem. You're so suspicious. What do you want? Me not to talk to anyone?" he said, "Gosh, yeah. I can understand why you're upset and why this is hurtful. I can see why you think I was acting inappropriately and we really should do something about this. Let's try to figure out some way where you can come to trusting me more. I'll stop doing this." I mean, that would be at least half the battle right there, I would think. [00:32:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just from what I said, is your sense that when I have approached him that I haven't explained really why it makes me upset or that I'm not able to trust him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not real clear about that. I've seen you in here in the last few minutes, back off of that kind of thing a number of times. It seems like you want to avoid the conflict with him in the first place—that you're really concerned about him shooting you down; and that when you do imagine what you'd say to him about it and play out the conversation the way you anticipate it, which might also have something to do with what's happened, you don't tend to say all you feel and think, without being aware that you're not saying those things. I guess then my answer is, yes. (chuckles) My hunch—I don't know, I obviously wasn't there—is that you do tend to avoid saying things that you feel about being hurt, being angry, and being critical. I suspect because you, if you want to avoid conflict, those would actually ratchet it up, whereas you kind of bring it up but you don't really put out there your angry and more critical thoughts and feelings about it. It's less conflict. That would be my hunch. [00:34:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that I want to bring up here that he doesn't make an effort to hang out with people in general. Aside from people that he may be talking to, he doesn't make an effort. So is that his social life? The conversations over the Internet? Like in texting? Besides when we go out with friends or do stuff with his crew operators and some friends every now and then, he really doesn't make an effort to . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: See people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. If that is the case that he just prefers to have his one-on-one interactions not in person, why are so many of them with girls, first question. His answer in the past has been, "I don't know. I just always have had girls as my friends. They're easier to talk to than guys." Then secondly, it would be healthy for you to have interpersonal relationships as opposed to virtual. What's going on there? Of course, now I'm therapizing him. I would feel like that almost. [00:36:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're sort of describing another perspective on this and then criticizing him from it. The first spot is, "Well, geez, I think, maybe I'm wrong about this, but you're saying maybe what he's doing makes more sense and isn't so bad if I think about this as kind of a social life more so than some sort of flirtation that he's looking for on the side. But if that's so, then he's conducting his social life in an unhealthy fashion. [00:37:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Correct! It is. It's weird. (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not being judgmental.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm agreeing with myself for the second time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fair enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been saying to him recently how I wanted him to make more of an effort to hang out with his friends and how I've really been enjoying hanging out with my friends. He kind of just is like, "I will. I will." That's what's so weird. This whole thing is weird. [00:37:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's so weird? It doesn't seem as weird to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's weird for somebody who claims they're like so happy in love with their girlfriend and doing their hobby—may not love his job but okay, fine. He's working on other stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he has these sort of flirtations on the side?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Or whatever they are. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Many people do that. I don't think it's okay. I'm not trying to condone it, but I guess it doesn't seem that unusual to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm looking at it that way because it's my boyfriend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like my friend, who does that all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:38:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who is not in a relationship.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I guess I'm wondering as you put it like that—again, the sort of denial or minimizing piece—how much you haven't wanted to think about it in this way. I guess my concern is that you're saying, "It's weird." I feel like some people do that, say things are weird or hard to believe or just kind of strange, as a way of backing off how "not okay" they are. Do you know what I mean? And maybe you're doing it and maybe you're not, but I guess that's my concern; that it changes from something that's hurtful and makes you angry and also anxious to something that's quite the curiosity. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what I mean? Like, "How Interesting." I mean I'm caricaturing it, but I think you see what I mean. [00:39:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I suppose I just have to figure out a way to be, as you said, true to my gut feelings about it and not act out, even if it is frustrating. I think that in the past, what happens is I start on a gentle "how do I ease in to this?" and then he'll get defensive and I'll kind of ramp it up to like, "Well, it's inappropriate. It makes me uncomfortable. What are you doing? Who does that? Why are you doing that?" Then he goes to the other extreme of, "I'm just going to not talk to anybody. I can't have any friends that are girls. Forget it. Anybody that I know and used to be friends with—forget it, because it's just going to make you uncomfortable. [00:40:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Because in the end all I'll end up saying is, "Well that's not the point. That's not what I'm saying. I don't want you to do that. Fine. Forget it. I'm just saying.

<p>THERAPIST: I see. We have to stop for now, but we're on for next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Twelve-thirty. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. You, too. Hope the wedding goes well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. I'm sure I'll tell you all about it.</p>

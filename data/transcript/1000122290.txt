<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just to open up today when I left here on Thursday it was so ironic. Every Thursday either before or after the session there's a Mexican restaurant on the corner and they always have tortilla soup and fish tacos. Yeah, so when I open up my fortune I don't even remember the exact words but it said something about - about my social life. That it's going to - the fact that I have the ability to enjoy my social life.</p>

<p>I meant to bring in the little fortune. Maybe if I remember I'll bring it in next week. But that kind of like confirmed my belief that there's more to life than the negative things that we - all of the negative that I seem to be experiencing towards so many people in my life. And then I checked my machine at home on my way home and my friend, Torrence the one that I've known for a very long time, was trying to get in touch with me. And when that happened I put his phone number on my cell phone and corrected.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I wouldn't - every time I try to reach him there's a wrong number. So when I - he left a number this time. So I called the number and we were talking. And he said to me - he was a (inaudible) not too long ago - so he said when are we going to get together? You know just when are you going to invite me to your house so we can get together and just have a good time. Listen to records and so and so. And I said you know what next weekend. And that really made me feel good because this is what I want. This is what I want out of life. I mean not all of the time because I'm not unrealistic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it did. It felt very, very good that you know it does happen. And it took me back to a point where you asked me one time how many positive people are there in your life? And me saying well I can't think of any right now but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There can be. You know? So my friend Tim to acquaintances. Also a friend of mine had called a couple of days later and invited me - she says we're all getting together to go to Chrissie's on 52nd Street. It's a woman's bar. So you know once you show up. So that was kind of nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to interrupt you because you made me promise you last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. (laughs) I know not to get off the subject.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. [2:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the last time I came I - that was what I really wanted to talk about. For you know you had made that statement. I'm really sorry that something that horrible could have happen to you. I never really thought of it that way. I was extremely depressed. I remember going home that night. And when I got upstairs don't know why but I went back to the moment where I was walking towards the building. And I saw myself with my head down not even being aware of what my surroundings were but very engulfed in that pain that I was feeling. Don't ask me why I went - I went to that particular point. And then from that day on very teary eyed and dark pain.</p>

<p>And then Wednesday I got up and I was fine. It's almost as if I said either consciously enough, get a grip or for some reason it just disappeared that I don't understand. But with all of those things it was really bad for me. Hearing you say sorry you know that that happened ... that was very difficult. But it's weird to even know or feel that on Wednesday morning the day before I was coming here that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you make of that? [4:31]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure. Like I said maybe I got tired of just feeling depressed and since I'm so good at taking my feeling and shoving them below ground level, maybe that's what happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like it was really very painful - what you were feeling.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really was. I don't really remember feeling ... that bad in a conversation - on events, yes. Like when my brother turned the kids into foster care that was really painful. But that had a particular event behind it. This was a common type of (inaudible) or an observation of. She had a feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. About an event?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hum. But it was an event that I never realized - I never saw it as horrible. And in an essence it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been so many years that - so many years ago that it happened and you know up until now you never really thought of it that way. And so I want - how does it feel now to talk about it that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Feels a little ... uncomfortable. Because it's - it was an - a good event in my life which is uncomfortable to talk about it but through the years I've managed through either work experience or through my education to understand why it happened - why it took place. Through here I took - through this particular psychotherapy I come to the conclusion that the reason it happened so many times is because I was so submissive to adults or I wanted - not submissive - I wanted to keep peace with the adults in my life. I wanted to not make any kind of waves or ... I never really spoke up about my true feelings. So that's what I've come to understand why over and over you know such a young person would allow this to happen. [7:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would allow it to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some kids would say no or tell their parents. But I never did. I allowed it to happen. And I often wondered why. But through here I come - like I said I come to the realization that it's because I never even stood up to my own parents. And I was always doing everything in my power not to make them angry and to please them so I wouldn't be treated like my sisters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know what? The way you're describing the things now it sounds like you're saying that you know you let it happen and if only you had stood up for yourself it might have been - things might have been different. But there are other things when you said you feel like it happened because your mother wasn't watching out for you. And when we spoke about the time when you were at - when your family was over at the neighbor's house and the adults are like in the kitchen or wherever playing cards. And you were in the living room and had been watching TV and this man came in. And he started asking if you would - just the fact that no one commented or anything on that. And there was like an atmosphere of people just not talking about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it was something - something else going on there that you were responding to. My point is that it seems like you know that there's the two feelings - the feeling of you know this is something that it was up to me to prevent. And the feeling that this is something that was up to my parents to prevent. Why didn't they? [9:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Exactly. I think it's all combined. My mom should have really kept a close eye on my whereabouts. She should have I mean at that young age. And the fact that I just didn't say no. I didn't say no. And I think it's - it's a combination. Maybe sensing that people wouldn't even talk about those things you know at that young age and not understanding exactly what was going on as far as it's better not to talk about it. And then actually you know doing the same thing - not talk about it. And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When it gets that - the thing that's sticking out - that's standing out for me is that there's the feeling - there's acknowledging that you know you were - you were young. And it's appropriate for your parents to have been watching out for you and to protect you. And there's the part of you that acknowledges that that you were too young. And then at the same time you're saying but I should have said no like you weren't so young - like you were responsible in some way or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I did (inaudible). And that's the - I think that's the hardest part of it all. That I didn't. Because I was at a - I was at an age I think it was either 12 or 13. I can't pin point it and I really I think I refused at the time to concentrate on when it exactly happened. But it must have been 12 or 13.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't like to like really think about it. What age. What house. But I know it was during the time when I was ... not - I don't even think it was 13. Because physically I wasn't developed yet. I remember it stopped because by the time I was developing breasts and pubic hairs that's when I moved - we moved to the Lincoln Park.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [11:48]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that - it never happened again. Ironically when we moved to the Lincoln Park which I thought about also, we lived in the housing development - tall building. We lived on the sixth floor. And the building in front must have been a radius of about a block away. It wasn't real close. It was a block away. And I remember as a young adult I use to walk around in my underwear and my T-shirt. My father use to walk around in his underwear. It was no big deal. And about a year later - not even - I think about - no, about six months later, I remember I use to not go out a lot when I moved to the Lincoln Park. And I use to sit and look out the window watch everybody play. And there was a man on the other side who was waving at me. And I would look at him and look at him like who is this man? And about a couple of weeks later he ended up following me. And one time he approached me. And I can tell that he had - his intentions weren't honorable. And I just told him to go back off it and that I was willing to speak to my father. And I think he tried maybe once or twice after that. And I remember getting angry. I said if you come - you approach me one more time I'm going to speak to my father. And then he stopped.</p>

<p>And at that time I put a stop to it but when we spoke last - two weeks ago, that kind of like brought to my mind what - what is it about me that attracts this kind of behavior and now as an adult where do I find these people as I say in a comical sense. You know? What is it about me ... that attracts this kind of - a negativeness? [14:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ... you know I get the impulse to connect the things you know like what happened then and what your life is like now in terms of the people who you meet. But I feel like it's important to separate them too. Because as a child - well here's what - what I'm feeling that you're talking about this. Because you're talking about on the one hand feeling like your parents ought to have looked out for you because you were really young. And on the other hand that you were responsible enough in some way to put a stop to it and why didn't you? It's like it was all you.</p>

<p>And all I can keep thinking I can understand the you know the part of where you say you know why didn't I just say no to it. But I'm tuning into the fact that you were a child. And children's relationships with adults particularly if they're like what you were describing where you felt like you would like to keep harmonious relationships with adults, they're just not even. They're not equal. It's not fair to expect a child to say no to an adult.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So as a child I wasn't equipped to experience or the ability to say no. But why was it happening? Not once, not twice but you know six - seven times just six - seven just different people. Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the idea that you have a theory about it or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My theory was that. That it happened because I didn't - I was a child and I didn't say no. They took advantage of me. The same theory that I came up with before is what my theory is but. [16:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it happened to you just because you didn't say no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's confusing to me. It happened to me because these were adults that ... weren't nice adults. They took advantage of someone who was powerless - who didn't have the ability to fight or defend themselves because of being so young. Selfish people who didn't care about what they were doing to someone so young. What the effects would be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you feeling right now as you talk about this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Confusion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Total confusion. And you're telling me - I feel as if I understand your comment as what could you have done, you were only a child.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's essentially what I mean. I mean that's what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's what you want me to process - what could I have done. I could have said no. I can't understand that. Being a child is ... maybe that's what my problem is. I can't understand that being a child is being helpless. Some children know how to say no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to be helpless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think it's probably - particularly hard for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do. Yes. But I know it's true. I have no patience, compassion or understanding of someone who's not strong enough for themselves. We both know that. And lately I get rid of people who aren't strong enough. Who knows? [18:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another thing that ... that's happening is that you are describing things about some of these - some of these people and you use phrases that sort of hit my ear as like this clanging understatement. Like this guy who was following you in the building across the way. His intentions weren't honorable. And I'm thinking he's a slim ball. And you're talking about these men who molested you and saying they were not nice adults. And I'm thinking not nice? They were monstrous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like well I can't bring myself to see them as monsters. I just want ... again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you angry about that or at them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not really. I don't feel anger. No. But then I think it's my way of not coming to terms with my feelings. All I can think was it wasn't nice what they did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I would feel angry at them for what they did. [20:43]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not me. Which I can't understand because I have a sister who - the one who's in jail - when she was young ... it's funny how I don't feel angry because these people who actually molested me but I could remember you know how sometimes you kind of foresee things in your own mind that might happen to someone using them? And then sometimes I would - because it's my younger - because my sister was into drugs and she would expose the kids to really bad situations. Like where they lived and they kind of like (inaudible) because she was in drugs. How could she protect her children? And I remember feeling that if anyone ever did some like that to my sister, I remember feeling angry. If (inaudible), if anyone ever did that. At that time I felt anger. But with my situation, no. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I imagine that ... feeling angry about - feeling angry about it would sort of underline feeling helpless to do anything about it or having been helpless at the time. You know if it wasn't so bad what they did - what happened - then it makes it you know not such a bad thing to have been helpless in that situation. If what they did was terrible and you were furious at them, it makes it that much worse to have been helpless in that situation. [23:12]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm sitting here and almost amazed on how I'm so out of tune with what I'm supposed to be feeling. Or if I do have true feelings about this whole thing ... obviously I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you supposed to be feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anger. And I'm supposed to see it for what it's - what it's worth - what - the weight it carries. You know you don't do that to a young person as an adult. You don't because it does screw them up. It you know it does. And yet I still have that you know that problem coming to terms with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you know what? I'm thinking about what you said how after we talked about it two weeks ago and you left here and you felt so miserable for most of the - most of the week after that. (clears throat) That you were able to do that on your own, that's the key point of the things that you said to me was that you don't want to cry in front of me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I wonder if it's just harder to feel in touch with ... with what's deep inside with you know someone there to witness it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I do most of my crying alone. Lately no, not even that. Lately I won't even - and it's funny because last - the week that we met that we discussed - you pointed out that that was a horrible thing, I felt as if my crying would have helped me a lot but I never got to that point. And that's usually when I do my out letting. You know my pain. Alone and I cry. But I couldn't even do that. I felt like I really wanted to but I wouldn't never get to the point where I would just like start you know bawling and crying and crying. It really felt like I wanted to but I didn't. And that's unusual because when I feel that kind of emotional pressure on me - on myself, I cry. I tend to cry. But I didn't. [26:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe the stakes were higher.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I am just imaging this picture that given how badly you were feeling that if you would have started crying it might have been hard to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could have been. I didn't think about it that way but it could be. It has some effect on me because you're the first person I ever - you're the only person in my life that knows that this you know - aside from the people involved - that ever knew that. Because I have many friends who talk to me about it and say - they share with me who they - who was involved and how it made them feel and - quite a few, but I've never shared it with them. Maybe because it's my way of not dealing with my feelings. Again I don't like people knowing those kinds of intimate things about me. You know because we discussed one time it's (inaudible) to talk about it. And what happens to other people who continue. That's something very personal and very private.</p>

<p>But it does have - it has something - it's done something to me internally because about two years I went to Montclare. I had - was doing my taxes. And this time I went alone. And I decided to visit my old neighborhood. And I remember the closer I got my heart started to pound. And I'm like wow where is this coming from? I wanted to see my old neighborhood. And all I could remember thinking was the closer I got was I wanted to see the house next to the building where I lived where this man first pursued - who molested me lived. And how I wish I can get - if he were there or if I can get in touch with him to tell him how fucked up he was. What an animal he was. [29:03]</p>

<p>And I made it to the block. It really changed. The house is gone. There's some sort of small housing development they built there. But that was the first time aside from now that I realized that that had some emotional significance that I never really realized. It was weird. Because I wanted to visit the old neighborhood but I didn't realize that that want was going to lead to an experience of my heart racing and me thinking about this person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you want to tell him. What would you want to tell him tomorrow? I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact I think I even looked in the phone book to see if I can see the - his name in it. But if I was like 12 and he was 30, he would be dead by now probably or a little old man. Well what I would have - I remember a couple of times thinking you know telling him he had no right to do that. You know? You're a grown person. And you need to know that I didn't like the way it made me feel. That you took advantage of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you said you also felt like telling him how fucked up he was. And that he was an animal. [31:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yep. And that that lasted a little while. And then I forgot about it until you know I started coming back here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like somewhere there is anger ... at this guy at least.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you don't really tell somebody that they think they're like an animal unless (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wonder you know if that particular point in my life is what lead me to be you know a lesbian or if that lead me to be who I am as far as feeling like a loving, wanting, giving person but also not sharing my feelings and my true feeling and not even worst of all realizing them. And realizing that you know if you're angry you know say it, feel it. You know it's even difficult for me to do that. Even worse it's difficult to express it. You know angry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know angry in every day instances where some people would get angry they would just tell you. I may have a problem with conveying that. So I'm wondering if that point of my life is what led to who I am today ... which is not good. It's not good for me because ... I've had several relationships you know which haven't gone right. It also makes me wonder whether my approach to life now is connecting in that sense. Because we talked about that last week. If I keep this up I'm going to end up being so alone. Because I keep turning everybody away. [34:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what were you thinking about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I've thought about it but then like I said last week my friend, Tanya called. My friend Sarah called. So it kind of like helps me balance things out. Yeah, you turning people away but you also you have others that are offering what you're looking for. But me turning - the people that I am turning away I really like - not the closest to me but the more connected like their family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess the - the thing that I see is that you know there are people like the friends who called you up last week to get together who are good people, enjoyable to spend time with and it's what you're looking for. And all of that's really great. It seems like the problems arise more around you're not really intimate with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is just really odd. I think that at some point that is natural because I see it. If you have an experience of being violated intimately to want to protect your intimate self. You know? And I - it makes sense to me that if something happened that was so awful on so many levels that you feel the feelings attached to it. You know you'd have to feel angry with the men who molested you. You'd have to feel angry with the parents for not protecting you. You'd have to feel helpless over what happened - helpless to change it. You'd have to feel angry with yourself for not being able to stop it. You're feeling your feelings meant feeling all of that stuff. It makes sense to me that a way to deal with the whole situation would be to just not feel your feelings. [37:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. And I understand. I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you. And I understand that that was a horrible thing to have had done to me at that young age. And it was an intimate thing but connected to (inaudible) very, very negative. It changed my life. But I don't see the connection in - in - it's hard for me to see the connection in becoming or letting someone become very intimate with me and not. I don't understand how that would relate to what happened to me when I was so young. Intimacy. I was violated at the age of 12. And I was you know on an intimate level. And I understand exactly what you're saying but it's hard for me to connect it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know how it's all connected. I'm just thinking that this thing happened to you for various reasons it felt like you couldn't tell anyone. And it was up to you to protect yourself - up to you to protect your inner most self - your - you know the core of who you are - your personal and private self. I don't know if it - I don't know exactly and my guess is I should ask this question. But I don't know how it feels when you're in a relationship with somebody as an adult who is wanting more intimacy from you than you're willing to give. Like I'm not sure what - why - why it's more than you are willing to give. I get the feeling that - excuse me - I get the feeling that you have a strong sense of self preservation like you're protecting yourself somehow. [40:39]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Try and think when your most important relationships (inaudible). You know how I was with them. Physically I was loving and but emotionally there was always a limit to how I - it felt like I was - had to be control of my emotions and not to let them go because I was always afraid of being disappointed from something going wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just thinking about how many risks you've taken here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How many risks?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the biggest one. It might even be the only one ... as far as my feelings are concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I think in a way it's been kind of taking one long risk all along sort of gambling on the fact that the person who you're talking to is someone who you can reveal yourself to safely. I don't think it's been easy. [42:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It hasn't. No, it hasn't - hasn't been easy. But intimacy is very hard for me because the (inaudible) here on relationships - and on family. I think it's because at a - from the way that I'm thinking about it now and from what we're saying - at such a young age my - all of my intimate relationships were - they all had negative outcomes. Being molested. My mother's relationship with my sisters being so aggressive, seeing pain behind that, seeing pain behind being molested, I think I learned at a young age that intimacy and relationships are just painful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did it feel when your father left for good?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of liked it. I was angry at my mom because she asked a 16 year old girl what she should do and since he was being physically abusive I said he should leave. And that was her choice. She shouldn't have asked me. But being that I was - I spent most of my life with her oh course. And I was just getting to know him. I knew him. Ironically as a father and a stranger at the same time since he was a (inaudible). You know he was only there four or five times a year pretty much my whole life until I was like 15 - 16. So oh course I'm going to make that answer but the little relationship we did have it was a close one - a close connection. So when he left and then she gave me the message you know he did this, he did that, she made me side. You know she made me side. And then I did. [46:00]</p>

<p>And then when I found out he was ill it was like - he died in 1991 and when I found out he was really ill, I told her I was going to go visit him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told her I was going to go visit him getting permission from her. That's what I was doing. And she made a comment you know that the family they'll probably tell you leave or throw you out. And I said well I think I need to let him know that I thought he was a good father, that he shouldn't leave this Earth thinking that he supported and he helped - he took his part in this family and he shouldn't leave this Earth that once you guys broke up that was the end of it. And I felt like I wanted to do that. But then when she said that I kind of still felt loyal towards her. And that was during the summer. And then the next thing I know a couple of months later in November he passed away. So I didn't get a chance to you know say that to him.</p>

<p>So my experiences with relationships - I think the bottom line is my experiences with relationships have always seemed to me like they control me. Like they were controlling. By being molested. My mom expecting loyalty from me when my father - her and my father broke up - you know to side. The relationship between my mom and my sisters. On an intimate level, yeah I see it now. When I'm intimate with a person who has nothing to do with what my life - how my life evolved - I feel if I'm not in control of it emotionally somehow it's just going to end up to be like (inaudible). Because I see relationships to be very painful. [49:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think that's the ironic thing too is that they're not easy to pick up on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. And in a sense give up in what sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you continue to have relationships. You want to have relationships with people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, (inaudible). But I don't want to be alone. It's funny today I went on a job interview for still nursing facility. I like - I like the elderly. I think they're very interesting people. But one of - as I'm walking through the facility - it was funny. I see all of these old people. And I said - and I said to the director is there much family involved here because I saw them as lonely. And I think that's sad for someone to have a lifetime and then get to an age now a days (inaudible) to be very active up until 70. But once you hit 70 you become an old person. And for many years I've seen old people in their 80s - 90s alone in situations like that. And that's sad to me - that very sad. And I don't want to end up that way. [51:12]</p>

<p>So yeah it's important you know that's why I'm here because I do. I want to find someone I can grow old with. It doesn't necessarily it's happen because that person can die two years after we meet. But that's the gamble that I want to get involved in. To be - to meet someone and grow old.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You cried.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not much but I did. Very uncomfortable. It's embarrassing, uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why embarrassing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it just is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Forgive me because to me seeing someone in this position is - I don't know I just - I assume that the other person is seeing you as a weak person. You know a broken person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you wonder what I'm thinking or how I'm seeing you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't wonder. I just ... I guess I'm thinking for you. I don't want you to see me as a weak person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like to know how I do see you? I see you as very strong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's not (inaudible) to be open or to be vulnerable. I think that takes a particular sort of strength. [53:34]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so. Especially if you're coming away from a lifetime of (inaudible) and possible for people even sometimes for yourself to know - to feel the vulnerable part.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I also feel like you know I not only do I see you as being strong and being able to be open and to cry and to let your feelings be there but just as human.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't make me feel better. I mean I can understand. I think maybe once I leave here today and I think about it you know it's - I'll be able to see it but it doesn't make me feel better. It still makes me feel - like crying I feel is humiliating and embarrassing. But I understand what you're saying. Yeah. For me to do what I'm doing now is like - I don't think I've ever done this. [55:32]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Well you're going to feel how you're going to feel. I just thought I'd offer some other perspective you know. I mean why - have to think or assume what I'm thinking when you could - so I offered.</p>

<p>Our time's up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm glad. (laughs) I was going to ask you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll bet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was going to ask you how much time do we have left but. Next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. See you then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

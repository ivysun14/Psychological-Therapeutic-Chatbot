<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Set up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I'm all set up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Heh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [clucks] well, I started a blog again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, I think it'll be good. I blogged — I had a blog of some kind, basically, from my start of college through...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No kidding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...To pretty recently, actually, um, like maybe eight months ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, various, different kind of formats and places (ph), things I was talking about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] I had stopped because of, like, "OK, I'm a grown-up now. I'm getting into the academics. I really can't have this much of a public Internet presence." So I stopped my personal blog, and I had had a — started a blog with a friend that was going to be kind of more anonymous but talking more about our work. Um, she was a woman I roomed with my second year. Her name's Candace. I've probably talked about her. One of my best friends. [00:01:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I don't know of her (ph), yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's a — uh, I guess I haven't talked about her much, but she's a — um, she teaches ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...At a private school, um, and so, basically, we — when we lived together, you know, she would come home and tell me about, like, you know, Archbishop Romero and social justice, and I would come home, and I would tell her about, like, laws about canal-digging in ancient Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that was something that was fun, and I thought we were kind of — like, we missed that and wanted to kind of get that up again. But it didn't really take off because we both developed really serious health crises at the same time. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was hospitalized for depression...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:01:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And she got something that's not rheumatoid arthritis but is pretty similar.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, like, woke up one day, and her legs were so swollen that she couldn't get out of bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, I was actually there the weekend that she first had to go to the hospital for abdominal (ph) pain, and it was, like, [slaps surface] — so, basically, we dropped that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, also, she's not — she's just not as into it as I am. I think she doesn't have the same — she doesn't have confidence in her own writing, so she's not — she never really feels like people will want to read what she writes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I kind of don't care. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm, like, "You don't have to read it." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so, I'm writing again, which is good. Um, it is going to be a private blog, so — because I want to be able to talk about what I really want to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, nominally, it is about the things that I knit, and so — so [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: {Sniffles]...There'll be a lot of that. [00:03:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it is kind of a — I don't know — way to get myself back out into the world and back out into the things I like to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'd imagine it is nice to feel like doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It has been a long time since I've really wanted to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Write again, and kind of been confident enough to write again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. And, I mean, still, like, there's a lot of days I feel like I just don't have anything to say. Um, so [trailing off] we'll see how this goes. [Pauses] Um, yeah. And I know I just don't keep a personal journal, but, for some reason, I like blogging much better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, it is easier for me to think when I type, when — instead of when I write things by hand at this point... [00:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which I never thought would happen, but it did, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I find it easier to write when I have an audience in mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like, I know. [Pauses] Yeah, it is a pretty self-indulgent thing, but nobody has to read it if they don't want to, so, you know, I'm OK with that. And, you know, James and Amanda and Candace really like reading my writing, so that's good enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I invited my mom to read it, which was a really big step because I did not tell her that I had a blog before...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Ever. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a big deal. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] I'm feeling very virtuous today. [Chuckles] [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Um, it was just funny because I was — I was so angry at myself all yesterday. Um, like I — I mean, I was just so angry at myself. Um, [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know how come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I think mostly the thing with Franco and Sascha, and that kind of spiraled.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 10 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and — and I — I didn't do very much yesterday. You know, I did end up applying for a job, eventually, but I — after my appointment with you yesterday, I basically went straight home and got back into my pajamas, and got into bed, and just... [chuckles] [00:06:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just like, "This is all I want to do right now." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Um, so, I — yeah. [Pauses for seven seconds] You know, it wasn't like a crying sort of day; it was more like a staring-into-space sort of day. Um, [pauses] but this morning's going pretty well so far. I've got my tea (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, do you have a sense of what it is — what we talked about contributed to your feeling bad? [00:06:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] [clucks] I think it is just the talking about them, and that I feel so helpless, and that I feel helpless but I feel as though I should not be helpless, that, you know, [shifts in seat] I just [pauses] — I can't not think that this is all my fault that my life is this way right now, that I feel this way right now, um, and that, you know, I've had to kind of completely reorder my life because I can't do the things that I want to, really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs] Mm-hmm. [00:07:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um — [exhales], [pauses for ten seconds] yeah, I mean, you know, we kind of talked through the whole situation yesterday, and that the reasonable conclusion was, "Yes, like, that wasn't my fault," [chuckles] and yet [chuckles], in my mind, it is always my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, at least, I should be able to fix it. Um, [pauses for five seconds] yeah, and then [sighs] having said, "OK, I'm not going to hurt myself anymore," um, then it was a real struggle because, eh, hurting myself helps me deal with being angry at myself, helps me get that out, and it doesn't — but [sighs] so it is kind of a test of will, sort of — you know, can I just deal with being this angry at myself, you know, kind of just there. [00:09:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I did, which is good. Um, but [pauses for five seconds] my roommate has a friend staying for the week - um, two of them I know from school, also. Um, and — and, frankly, with — but it has been this weird — sort of weird situation that, like, Kirsten just got out of the hospital...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Is still, I think, really worried about her health. Um, and I think, more than that, like, this was the first time that she has been hospitalized, and so it was really dealing with, like — I think she's having real trouble with kind of the loss of dignity that comes with hospitalization. [00:10:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, in some ways, I was, like, "Oh, God, I know exactly what you mean." You know, like, "The first thing you do when you go into a psych ward is you have to take all your clothes off; like, that's the first thing that happens." [Chuckles] Like, what — I didn't see that coming. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And so I was kind of like, I — I want to say, "Yeah, I understand that." But Kirsten's not close enough to me to be able to kind of let down that dignity in front of me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So I can't really be there for her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, and she's — she and I haven't really been talking much recently, and Casey, her friend, is really, really shy, and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...When I'm around shy people, I become really, really shy, and so the conversation is always kind of awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it is like we've been like two camps kind of avoiding each other... [00:11:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But being really nice to each other, but also kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Not acknowledging the fact that we're avoiding each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, avoiding — yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, yeah. And it is like a — I really want — I want to help Kirsten with what she's going through now, because I think she's really scared. Um, but, A, I'm not letting her help me with what I'm going through; B, I'm not up for putting myself out there much for people, um, and, you know — you know, I offer and just say, "Anything you need, I will do," and that's all I can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a little — a little relieved that she [speaks softly] hasn't taken me up on it. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:11:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, but so I kind of go home and hide in my room, and [sighs] [pauses] I don't know. [Sighs] But I — half the time, I think that all of these things that I'm doing to kind of — to make myself — that are things that are good for me — you know, I'm doing it [slaps surface]: keeping a reading group with some of the students in my department; and have to keep up with my language skills and also keep in touch with them over the summer, um, because, otherwise, I'm going to lose touch entirely...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and, you know, starting a blog and, like, learning how to sew, and these projects that, half the time, I think that they are actually going to be good for me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And about half the time, I think, "Well, I don't think any of this is going to help at all. I don't think any of it is helping at all. I don't think anything I'm doing is helping me at all, but I don't really know what to do other than pretend that I believe that this will help." Um, [slaps surface] So here I am. [00:13:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]</p>

<p>[Silence for 15 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did look up — I did [chuckles] look up suicide on Wikipedia and kind of scrolled through, and that was actually a good thing, um, because I came to the conclusion that any suicide method that I could be sure would work [shifts in seat] — I mean, reading some of the statistics, like, people have slit their wrists; that doesn't work! [Chuckles] They end up in the hospital; they don't end up dead. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, yeah. [00:13:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, the only thing that I could be sure that would work, and that wouldn't be too horrible for everybody else around me would require several days' preparation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can kind of take that off the table...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Clears throat] Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In that I — I — you know, I'm — it is like part of my commitment in being married to James is to be with him. Um, you know, I'm committed to that, um, so what has been scaring me is the — the thought that — you know, the specific mood I am in will precipitate something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you'll do something kind of impulsively?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but, now, I know that it seems like the things that people do impulsively don't actually work very well, so... [00:15:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That will help. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, I told James this. He also was reassured, eventually. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Eh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eventually. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for six seconds] but [pauses for five seconds] — so then a lot of time, I think, "Well, I guess this is my life now," [pauses] and that's hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:15:55]</p>

<p>[Silence for 20 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm easily distractible, for a while anyway. You know, good things happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just have to try to hold onto them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat] [00:16:30]</p>

<p>[Silence for 55 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When — when it is? When things are a bit more conversational here, you tend to be kind of less focused on the ways you're feeling bad. But, um, when you kind of — I don't know — just sort of talk a little more and have a little more time to settle into how you're feeling and what's been going on, uh, [pauses] some more of the bad things that you've been feeling kind of emerge? [00:18:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that seems like it. I try not to think about them when I'm not in a bad mood. Um, [pauses] but, you know, it seems counterproductive, um, to kind of seek out all the bad things in my life when they're not directly in front of me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] but, yeah, I mean, I really have just kind of been — kind of going from one thought to the next, and it really has been kind of [chuckles] going downhill. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [chuckles] so I don't know what to say about that. [Chuckles] [00:18:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Yeah, at least for now, I don't either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] [sniffles] That's a — strangely reassuring. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh.</p>

<p>[Silence for 37 seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, the drawback of having a private blog is that — that I know who's reading it. Um, I actually don't like that very much. [00:20:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 10 seconds] I guess I don't want [exhales] people to read what I write in order to indulge me. You know? The hope is that it is something that they like; if it is not, I'd rather them not read it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Yeah. Um, because, at the same time, it is there as much as for me; I mean, I'm writing something that I like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I don't — I'm pretty OK if — I mean, not that many people are into knitting; it is just a fact. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [chuckles] more than you would think, but not that many. [00:21:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, a lot of the people who are into it are, like, scary into it and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And a few kind of back out of that community.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 15 seconds] yeah, I don't know where I would go with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what else comes to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm thinking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] [pauses] What do you mean? You're thinking? Like, do you mean you're, like, going over what you might say, or do you mean you're thinking about what makes sense to talk about, or...? [00:22:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me is thinking, like, more like things to talk about. I mean, really, I — I'm trying to come up with a thought that is coherent enough to be a sentence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, huh, so...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...This is what occurs to you. Without that effort, thoughts that - don't seem coherent enough to be sentences?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, [contemplating] yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I feel pretty comfortable just saying, like, the what-comes-to-mind-thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Um, but I — I think I — [pauses] I don't know — maybe I shut things off before they get into sentence form, if I don't think they're going to be useful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um — uh, I drive James nuts, and he's driving me nuts... [00:23:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Because they way I have a conversation, is I figure out what I'm going to say as I'm saying it. Like, by talking, I am forming my argument.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The way James has a conversation is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Is he sits down and he's silent, and he forms what he's going to say, and then he comes out with it, meaning that I have had to learn to be patient with very long silences in conversation. But it is not easy for me. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and he has had to learn to be patient with me saying one thing and then saying, "Actually, no, I don't mean that at all." [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Ha-ha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The things that come out of my mouth — I realize, "No, that's not OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "That's not what I wanted to say."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of revising as I go. [Shifts in seat] Um, strangely enough, very similar to the way we write... [00:24:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In that I write more fluently and then revise more, and..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...By the time he writes a first draft, it is a pretty good first draft.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm a better writer than he is. [Speaks softly] It is just one of those things. But I, eh, [pauses] I mean, I'm also — have come to believe that the writing fluently and then revising is actually a more effective way to write for almost anybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I know a lot of people that don't agree with me because [won't my mom] (ph) write like that? [My God] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was a day when I realized that both Candace and Kirsten — this is — we were in our second year, and I learned that neither of them ever revises papers, or revised papers. And I was [emphasizes the word] furious with them, [chuckles] just saying, "What?! How do you live?" [Chuckles] Like, "You're in a master's program!" [Chuckles] Um, [exhales in exasperation] ah — so, of course, I tried to convince them that their lives would be much easier if they would revise their papers... [00:25:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And that their writing would be better. Because I'd been listening to both of them bitch about how they weren't good writers, for the last year...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] But — "Well, there are things you can do about this." [Chuckles] Um, [chuckles]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. "I keep tripping over my shoelaces wherever I go."</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "It is such a pain in the ass." But don't cry. [That's my leg] (ph)."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm like, "You could tie them!" [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] yeah, yeah. For Candace, at least, I think that it was she's so terrified that everything she's written is terrible, that when she's written it down, she can't — she cannot look at it again. [00:26:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that means she doesn't even proofread! Like, she proofreads each sentence as she goes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she has to proofread — Ah! [exasperated] I'm sorry. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] This is one of the more unreasonable things about me, [chuckles] I think. But, um, that's what I get for teaching English; I have [speaks softly] opinions about them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for 25 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:27:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, when Candace — when — I was there when Candace was first hospitalized, and there was, um, this — her gall bladder was inflamed, and I think she ended up having surgery to remove it, um, as part of this thing that is not rheumatoid arthritis but is the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...One of those weird things that just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But just your body shuts down for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I — I knitted her a gall bladder and sent it to her in the mail. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] It may be my favorite thing I've ever made. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It had a mustache on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did she get a kick out of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she did. She loved it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a little bigger than actual size, but, otherwise, pretty anatomically accurate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... [00:28:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And, clearly, better dressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. [Chuckles] Yeah [pauses for 12 seconds], my only problem is with liking to make things is that I think — you know, I like to make things for people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't have to give them gifts, but I don't want to give them something that they don't like. And it takes a long time to do, and so [pauses] yeah, I'm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Trying to work for other people's tastes as well as my own is hard. [Pauses] But, you know, that's — then I can give them something of myself, [so to speak] (ph). [00:29:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it helps keep me going a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've knitted a lot [chuckles] in the last year and a half.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 17 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that makes me think of things here, and [sighs] makes me wonder, like, uh, to an extent — this is — these are things you're trying to get a sense about me, like: what is it you want to talk about; what are you more responsive about; what is going to be more productive? Like, I mean, because we have a — and you said the other day about, um, our being involved in some sort of game, that it was unclear whether I was aware I was playing...[chuckles] [00:30:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...As well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's kind of a side note.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Um, yeah, I mean, I have — it is — I am kind of trying — yeah, trying to figure out what you think is more useful to talk about, um, as well as trying to bring up what I think is going to be more useful to talk about. Um, [pauses] yeah, I mean, you know, like I said, I like plans. I — eh — [chuckles] I find free association a difficult concept.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You were, like, I'm actually really onboard with it; it is just difficult for me, personally. [00:31:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so, you know, yeah, I did ask, trying to free-associate. [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for 10 second] yeah, I mean, [exhales] you know, I trust that you know what you're doing. Um, but I also recognize that a huge portion of knowing what you're doing is realizing that you don't actually know what you're doing. [Chuckles] So [chuckles], um, [pauses for 14 seconds] yeah, and there's always the kind of impulse for me to, like... [00:32:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Try to present a picture of myself that you will like. And, like, [slaps surface] that's the way I deal with people; like, I just really want people to like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really want people to like me. Um, [shifts in seat] and so that's something that is definitely also at play, that I'm very much aware of and very much, like, kind of trying to be real as it happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Was — was [drops arms] it a success? [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know to what extent I'm kind of curating what I say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In order to try to say things that will make you like me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [sighs] it — it is so engrained that I kind of can't tell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] but I also, I mean, have a habit of honesty, as well, with most people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...If I can't say anything that they will like to hear, I usually just keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah, I certainly have that sense about it, that, um, where you tend to be, I think, very focused on where other people are coming from and are [pretty clear] (ph) what they want from you, that you're, uh, pretty careful at the same time about, you know, um, what [raised it] (ph) for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because my first impulse is always to sell myself out and just be whoever the person wants me to be, um, and that hasn't worked well for me in the past... [00:34:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I don't want to be that person. So, yeah, I work on it. Um, [pauses] yeah. [Pauses] You know, like, when I'm — my first year in college when...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...[As bad as I] (ph) was willing to have a whole lot of friends, and it — and that happened, and I had a whole lot of friends, and I realized that I wasn't really being myself; I wasn't saying what I thought. I was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Responding to what they wanted me to be, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...As a result, I was becoming somebody that I didn't like very much. Um, you know, so I took [full credit] (ph) I was about to — shortly after I broke up with Bryan, because, you know, I modeled so much of who I was into what he was with OK with me being and what he wanted me to be. [00:35:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Coughs]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, we were together in the first place because we shared a lot of things that were really important to us, you know, because we both loved plays and literature, and art, um, and ideas, and we both loved conversations. Um, you know, eh, my high school — my — in my senior year, we were in an English class together, um, with probably the best teacher I had all during high school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and we walked in one day, and we were arguing, like, vociferously about something, and he just said, "Ah! Here come the Bickersons."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I took that as a huge compliment. [Chuckles] Um, but the fact was, like, I couldn't be [exhales] a lot of the things that I was because that was threatening to Bryan. Um, [pauses] and, in some ways, it wasn't until after I broke up with him that I realized that, "Oh, I can stretch out now." [00:36:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I said, "I'm not going to do that anymore."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I try not to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, at the same time, like, when I got my umbrella back from Franco the day before yesterday, I said, you know, "I'm OK. Don't worry about me. You know, it is OK," because he was clearly concerned about me, and I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...[Slaps surface] [shifts in seat] So my impulse was — you know, reassure him, "You don't need to worry about me. You know, take care of your own life; I'm fine."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is not true. [Chuckles] [becomes emotional] Um, [pauses] you know, it is true that I can do without [becomes emotional] him right now, but [pauses] that was a case where my impulse to — to be who we wanted me to be was much stronger than — or who I — what — to be what I thought he needed won over what I actually needed. [00:37:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Clears throat]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [clucks] I think this is why the — and my — my mother is the person for whom this is most difficult for me, in that I just cannot — I just can't unwire that — that impulse to kind of like reflect back the daughter that she wants.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, which isn't fair to anybody. I mean, it is not — it is not good for either of us in the long run. Um — well, I don't know whether it is good for her or not. [Sighs] You know, she keeps trying to have me tell her that I'm angry with her, and I keep saying, "That's not your — that's — you don't get to dictate that," you know. [Chuckles] "That's what you need; that's not what I need. And maybe it is what I need, but it is not what I'm ready for, and [pauses] you're still trying to coerce me in some ways." [00:38:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or at least - I feel like that, but maybe I'm just bitter. Um, [pauses for nine seconds] I don't even know what it is I'm doing yet until the conversation's over, and then it is like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I wake up and I go, "That's not who I am." [00:38:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [Pauses] Does it feel like we're getting away from how bad yesterday was in some important way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, not in a way that bothers me. Um, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I — I find you somebody very easy to be who I am with, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I find it easy to talk about what it is important for me to talk about at that moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean, we are getting away from it, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...In some sense, I — it is kind of I'm ready to let go of that right now...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Or [judge what is] (ph) more important to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>[Silence for 24 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:40:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I ended up calling James, and I was just — it was a huge mess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] So he told me about an article that he'd read yesterday, about whales having a unique sense organ that allows them to [door closes] the — like, the way that baleen whales feed is just crazy, and people are figuring it out. And then he told me something about whales. I'm reading <i>Moby Dick</i> [slaps surface] right now, so... [Chuckles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [Chuckles] Don't they, like, take in tons and tons of seawater and filter out plankton or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And I always thought that they just kind of wandered around with their mouths open, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...It is like only in the last couple, three years, they've figured out that they lunge forward... [00:41:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Their jaws open, like, 90 degrees; their lower jaw rotates in three dimensions so that they can take in, like, a huge amount of water...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa. Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ....And then they filter it out. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it is much less, like, haphazard, ongoing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that — the idea is, when they sense that they're in, like, plankton-rich water.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. And what is the sense organ for - detecting, uh, like plankton levels or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Exhales] No, I — I forget. I think it is for, like, when the water hits their mouths, that that allows them to kind of [slaps surface] open up their jaws.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is not like — more like a snake's jaw than a human jaw.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whales are awesome. Then we had a long conversation about whether it was acceptable to eat whales, whether it would be acceptable to eat dolphins, monkeys, humans. [Chuckles] He's a little strange. [Chuckles] [00:42:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] Um, yeah. [Pauses for 15 seconds] Yeah, that was nice. It — that was a conversation in which talking with James really, really helped me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Which doesn't happen very often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [shifts in seat] it is not often that talking with people will — can get me out of where I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I was able to go to sleep after that, so that's good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Great.</p>

<p>[Silence for 26 seconds]</p>

<p>[00:43:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm still borrowing hope, but here I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>[Silence for eight seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why don't we stop for now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [And discover more] (ph) - oh, did we schedule next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I need to add it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think we scheduled for Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that sounds right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, Friday at 4:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, that's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, so I will then see you on Wednesday [next week] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks.</p>

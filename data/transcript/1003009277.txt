<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So before that.  All right.  Where is the wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The wedding is in Indiana.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Indiana.  Whose wedding?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My cousins.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Cousins and then what else are you doing?  There was something else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's a Bonnaroo concert I'm going to, so that's kind of the Woodstock of in Tennessee.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Have you been there before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, my sister and all, a bunch of my friends that she's friends with, all of, uh, have gone there, but, uh, I always get something that's going on that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is the concert called?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Bonnaroo.  B O N N A R O O.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what kind of bands are playing there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, from Bruce Springsteen to Phish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And stand up comedy and, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just a lot of groups and stuff, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sounds great!</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, and, uh, tonight we're going to see Dane Cook too at the [DEIDENTIFIED], so it's cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That will be nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's good to go to some shows, you know, we get out to [DEIDENTIFIED] too when it's nice weather.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's nice, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, they do a pretty good job around here keeping the music coming through.  Um, all right, so our last appointment was in February.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I think at that point, you had been back on the Adderall, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I was staying on Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You stayed on Vyvanse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's what you're on now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, we changed, okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We were thinking about possibly changing at that point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're on Vyvanse and the dose of the Vyvanse is still 50?  Do you think that the 50 is sufficient, is it helping you with focus and the concentration?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've really not seen much of a difference honestly.  Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Meaning from Adderall to Vyvanse, or being on it or off of it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Being, being, well there's a difference, well Vyvanse essentially, there is something I don't like about it, um, once you get the hunger suppression, everything like that, and it's nice not to have that, um, really awkward wakeup when you first take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but it does make you drug like, and that was symptoms that I got from another medication is, I don't like the drug like symptoms.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, um, well, um, possibly that's a dose related phenomenon, you know, I mean you might find, uh, if you were to decrease that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'd see less of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I could do that or the other thing, I mean, it's not like I'm like uncomfortable with the feeling caffeine kind of wakeup with those -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's something that like, that I've dealt with just fine, so it wasn't that like I was feeling less in about a half hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, with Adderall, it's another idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of course, there's no problem we can certainly do that.  Um, let's see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Now is there also mood swing symptoms with Adderall and Vyvanse?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's both of them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Possibly, yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I see that once in a while, but I think that I usually catch it before anything happens, that's the way I just kind of deal with them right now.  It's not that bad though, that's something I like just catch my -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where does, when it happens, like what kind of symptoms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you're just, usually just like a frustration.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, for instance, um, like I just renewed my car insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I printed out the copy of the, wait, of the, um, information -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, my girlfriend wants me, got to go, got to go, get to work.  All right, give me a second and I'll like tear part of it to actually start cutting it out -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like paper, and I'm like, all right, I will do in the car, and sitting in the car, it creases it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And tear it, and tears it right in half, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Aw.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Son of bitch -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've got to do this now.  And then I start going like, well now I'll be late to the meeting, and I'm going to be late to my appointment -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be late to this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is frustrating at that point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I think it's something natural to be frustrated about, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I felt that I was over frustrated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, more, right, right.  Um, yeah, I mean it's something I guess we keep an eye on, if, it would require probably, uh, uh, another medicine in addition too, if you felt like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's something [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's something that at least I can catch as long as I know about it.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, keep me informed on it, um, because if it continues, you know, that, that's uncomfortable and it's, you know, unsettling to you but also the people around you have to deal with it, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still working at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, [DEIDENTIFIED] has been closed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, the whole thing's closed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, they've been closed since, uh, like [INAUDIBLE] closed, um, no, I'm at [DEIDENTIFIED], now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm at [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] next to, across the street from the new Target.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So every [DEIDENTIFIED] closed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All of them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], you know, bankrupt.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, that's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you got into [DEIDENTIFIED].  What are you doing with [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sell cell phones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And we're doing the merge to Verizon right now -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, I heard that was coming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's a, that's really pressuring them, just because the fact that, um, it's, they got rid of a bunch of [DEIDENTIFIED] stores -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And they were potentially put them next to Verizon as competition -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, Um-hum, were all good points, yeah, it's a good point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So they, uh, they kept 3 out of the 20 stores in the local, Northeast Ohio.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Man.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And ours is one of the three -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's just like everybody from other stores are like look we're going out, we need, you know, we don't want to get a job here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So now it's still with a competitive, without any clear, with at least I work at the place that's going to stay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's amazing!</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> How am I going to stay at this place [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm doing -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How many hours you putting in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, 40 every week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  Wow!</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is 40 I'm working, so it's a lot of time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you could, well, I don't know, I guess the management probably doesn't want to do what you're doing, you know, like, like some jobs are just not, you know what I'm saying, like there's certain levels of people working there that aren't going to want to, it would be taking a step backwards for someone who's worked at one of those stores for 10 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, but I mean, there's a lot of positions that Verizon has in those stores that we don't have now, so I mean there's a lot of people that I think go for other positions as -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well too.  So, [INAUDIBLE] yeah, the commission is fantastic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great!</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's why I'm living in there now, it's just like I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, as long as I got a job it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you like it better than the [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So much better pay, I get paid like four times more than I got -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Most definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, um, and then you're going to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> As a [DEIDENTIFIED], so you're going back to [DEIDENTIFIED], when summer, end of summer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, full time, yeah.  But, uh, it's going to at the beginning of fall and, uh, still kind of unknowing on what I want to do.  At first I was thinking of, uh, film, something along those lines-</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I just did a semester of that kind of , uh, those kinds of courses, and it wasn't something that I really, you know, pleased me over all, it wasn't something I could really have a career like that.  And, uh, I have a friend who was in one of my classes at a, I asked her what she was doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she actually told me that she was going into nursing.  I said what's, what's that like, and she said like it's nice because what she's doing now is something that's a, you can always change -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What kind of nurse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's like there's tons of different kinds of nurses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it's always something in, and she's like, all it takes to change your, what kind of nurse you are is, there's like a six week course.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then she's like that's it.  And I'm like well that really does sound like something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I would like and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean [DEIDENTIFIED] got a ton, if you're planning on staying in the area, man, there's ton of healthcare going on here with the clinic and [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] I mean.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And it's actually kind of funny because all my girlfriends, previously, all of their moms were nurses.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So is my girlfriend's now, her mom is a nurse, and my dad is dating a nurse, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hear all this stuff and it's just like well, it's actually kind of cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's, it is a, I mean I think it's, it's, it's a lot of fun, it's rewarding, and you know pays well, there's some definitely some job security.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, yeah, when I'm not here, I work in a hospital for the clinic too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, um, yeah, I mean the people that I work with on the nursing floor in the psychiatric, you know, department are, it's a completely different job, you know, experience than a nurse in the ER.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Versus the nurse in the intensive care unit, you know what I mean?  Like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there is some flexibility to move within.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And not everybody likes doing everything.  I mean a lot of people don't like doing psychiatric nursing, but the psychiatric nurses that are there absolutely love it and wouldn't want to be in an ER, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it's like, uh, yeah, so, well you certainly have enough people in your life to educate you on -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Different aspects of nursing, I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly, so I mean that's, I was thinking about just doing next semester, just trying to go into the, um, the beginning kind of stages of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of getting some like that and see if it really interests me, so I have to take a chemistry class.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean all that stuff is good stuff to have for whatever you're pursuing with this degree, so sort of like be, you know, math, and chemistry, and English, and all those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, the, uh, movie industry, I know just from talking to other people too, and there, there is some hype with that, you know and some discussions about, you know, creating more of a movie scene in [DEIDENTIFIED] which is kind of interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, I've heard a couple things -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And from one in the [DEIDENTIFIED] area -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That they're starting to, um, that's starting to come really popular in [DEIDENTIFIED] as it usually is, but it's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Starting to come bigger.  Um, film though, the, their Independent Film Festival is becoming -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very popular.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, that's right.  That was a couple months ago, right here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, um-hum.  And, uh, yeah, you know, ah, theaters have always been big in [DEIDENTIFIED], I think, the [DEIDENTIFIED] moved down to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED], so that's cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, those are all good ideas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Good, being it's, ah, there is the nursing the next semester so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Get to start it and see how I like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm going to be eventually moving soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still with, uh, your dad, or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, and, uh, hopefully it works out this summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, you guys getting along okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, it's stressful, I guess is the word I want to use, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You okay?  Is he working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What is he working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your dad, what does he do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He works, he's a manager at [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So is he, is it, do you see him a lot?  I mean, is he gone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I mean it will, I usually am funny enough that I'm usually at my girlfriend's house, like, I have my own couch and everything like that at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, [INAUDIBLE] try out, so they have the girl on a routine, you got to go through, our schedules are very, um, flowing with each others.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, going to [DEIDENTIFIED], I try to at least make a stop up there once or twice a week.  So, I mean I do see him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Along with my mom, but the stress that's just there, it's just like I can't, I don't want to take, and I know I've been doing that since I was, or I've been in that kind of scene since, you know, they started arguing four years ago and it's just something that I always used to get involved in.  [INAUDIBLE] you know what?  It's not my battle any more, I've just realized that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I try and stay out of it as much as possible, which is what really makes it possible to move, um, and, uh, transfer to a four year school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Most likely in a semester or two, so, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> More money though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum, yeah, more money, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it will, um, there's, there seems to be a, a lot of, um, potential access to, to grants and tax benefits for people who are -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Going to school now, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And my parents both help me and don't have to worry about money and stuff like that at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well this is the time, you've got to get that education in there and if you're having fun with it and it sounds like you're doing well in classes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Then you should pursue it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I would get a nursing degree in two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And go for my bachelors after -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nursing pays more than a lot of work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, my parents have been helping me for two years -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  That's my plan, I know at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds reasonable, it sounds like a good plan actually.  Um, so what do you think?  With the medicine, you want to play around with the Vyvanse or you just want to go back to the old faithful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, how long would it be till the next appointment?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's up to you, you know, and whenever -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean if like we made, [INAUDIBLE] we can go a certain, like possibly short period of time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Experimenting with the Vyvanse and then, you know, all I'd do is go on back to Adderall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's fine.  Um, let me see here, Vyvanse, so that, you don't like about it is the, this, this kind of side effect, a frown like -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's like I have like, I don't know what it is, it's like I have this, like the emotion that I want to express, like I can feel it, I just don't express it facially and my girlfriend's just kind of -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Picked up on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are you mad at yourself?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't feel that on the, uh, on the Adderall then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not at all, the Adderall, facially, it would be fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what was the downside to the Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, you suggested the Vyvanse, just in that it takes off the pick me up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a little bit smoother than Vyvanse generally, and it's a once a day pill.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean besides that, I mean, the Adderall is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Adderall, um, the Adderall, I guess you were taking Adderall once a day as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're very, you know, they're very similar, um, so 20, let's see what 40 of Vyvanse does, all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're still feeling that, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll switch you back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, wasn't I on 50 before?  Just to make sure that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I have in here, but do me, do make sure, because I don't want to get this wrong here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was just it, I think it was, because I remember I was on 25 of Adderall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let me try, I want to show you, let me show you, let me show you what it looks like.  You would swallow the pills, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Pink and yellow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] my girlfriend had actually suggested, U-2 is coming in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's diagnosed with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right, yeah, that's a, it's a, it's a condition that's not completely hopeless, I mean it is, it is treatable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But it is, um, you know, it, it takes some insight from the provider and the patient to make some progress with it, you know?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Apparently she's on Prozac for her depression, and she's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Diagnosed with a lot of stuff before that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's kind of funny too, she had my, uh, psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, that's right, no, he's a good man.  I was hoping this thing had pictures, but I guess it doesn't.  Um, well let's, if we backtrack down what we did with this, you took, the dose that you were on, that you took, you know, yesterday.  You said you did it yesterday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, actually this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it the same size pill that you've been on the whole time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's 50.  Sometimes they have little pictures of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a little white pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So we're going to go to 40.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Vyvanse 40 mg, number 30.  Um, let me give you two month's worth of this just so you have enough, and we'll try to get you back here in like a month, and you let me know at that point which direction you want to go with it.  All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.  Don't fill for 30 days, so this gives you the second month right here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And you, I'm sorry, just you dated the one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're both dated today, the way we do this nowadays, they're both dated today, but one will say don't fill for 30 days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So I could actually do them both.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You could turn them, you could turn them both in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All though sometimes they lose them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to keep them in my wallet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing I did though was I was a, I was just making sure, because one of them, well, the first one you said don't fill for 30 days, and it ended up being like 2 days after [INAUDIBLE] I'd go two days without it, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, ah, it's not a perfect system.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, naw, that's all right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've ran into some other problems with other patients as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It'd be nice to not run out of it, I mean that's the idea, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, that's fine, perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Cool.  So do you suggest that I finish the 50 or just -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know, how many do you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I still have like half a month's worth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I would, you know, I would switch over, see how it goes -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, and then I have some of these just in case I don't like it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right, so, oh, that's true.  Then you could go back to 50 -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you need to and then we'll go, yeah, all right.  That's the plan then, I'll see you next month -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then we'll decide if we like this or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, good luck with everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, you have fun on all of these things, although I'll probably see you before a lot of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Have a good one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yep, you too.</p>

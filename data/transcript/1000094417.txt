<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Collins, November 16, 2006. Therapist: Betty. Yeah, so I apologize for not being meet with you on last week, but (coughs) I was (coughs) under the weather.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all right. That, that does happen. I got sick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Changes (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Fighting. Myself. It's been an interesting couple of weeks though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what's, what's been interesting about it? (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it's not really interesting because like I've discovered that I don't dare go without my medication stuff because I turn into a real jerk.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now I get into one big blowout fight a couple weeks ago. [0:01:01.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (coughs) You and Kathleen? (coughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She said she's going to a divorce lawyer and I don't know what starts them, I don't know what, I, I just don't like to fight but it takes me a while to realize what's going on and stuff. We both kind of pick at each other and I don't know, we dig and we dig and we dig back and forth until bits (ph) fall to bits. Like an all out war.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what has happened over these last couple of weeks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the third of November was my birthday and things didn't happen until after that. [0:01:54.3] We've been trying to find a, a new bed and stuff has been running back and forth to Sears and to a number of places and I actually don't know what started where or why, but I just got to a point where I said enough is enough and we both started screaming and yelling at one another and she went in one room, I went in the other room. That's where we stayed for three days and it seemed like things settled back down and, but read something about Zoloft that keeps us, don't stop taking it, that you have to be taken off of it gradually or something. [0:02:57.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You [left that] (ph) taking yours?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well for two days I missed the whole thing, pills. [0:03:01.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What, what happened over this course of two days that  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just didn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: caused you to miss it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's where I really started spiraling downhill. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was there any particular reason why you didn't take them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why I missed them? Now the first day it was just we got up, went in for breakfast and stuff and I was supposed to take them when I got home and I didn't. And the next day I had to go down to the VA Hospital over here so I didn't get them then because I got up so early in a rush that. I haven't missed them since.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you ever missed them before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Pretty much the same results.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As far as anger and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Things seem to be, I won't to say they're back to normal because I don't really know what normal is, it's just an understanding of what you're accustomed to that things are better off right now. [0:04:07.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, how so?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're getting along. We're actually communicating and we're both nice with each other. It hums (ph). No shouting matches, no screaming, no attitude toward one another. It, one of the things that bothers me a little bit and she has this way of judging the future by my past actions. She says oh we're going to, we decided to go to the Karda's for Thanksgiving. [0:05:04.2] And she said, "Now I don't want you getting an attitude with this, that, and the other with the kids or anybody while we're there." And I said I don't really intend to, I would really like to go and have a good time and she said, "Well I'm just not going to tolerate any, anything." And I said why don't you just stop, right now, okay? I really didn't know what else to say at that point and she got upset with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (crosstalk) What, what were you thinking, what were you feeling? (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I told her I, that I thought she was picking at me. I said give me a chance to actually show myself instead of trying to set me up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or assume that this is how you're going to respond or react?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that you think she's setting you up for when you say? [0:06:23.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I really don't know if this setting up or just what, what it is but it's like she's expecting me to blow up. [I hate to just bother] (ph). I don't know what she (inaudible) I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's because of past actions and things that she automatically assumes that Thanksgiving when she really has no one [guiding her yet]? (ph) That the same things would happen as already may have happened before in previous (inaudible)? [0:07:28.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, if, it sometimes, I don't know, I, it's not that I dislike the kids coming over and doing things and stuff, but, I just kind of expect too much out of them I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those are your grandkids?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And you expect a lot out of them, what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if, if they get their toys out, I like for them to put them away, they leave them out. She says, oh they're just kids, let them be. Do it later. I'm just okay, and I'll live (ph). [0:08:15.7] Mike has these dances and stuff that he does and nobody really cares for them and his dad yells at him all the time for it, and I'll say to him, you know Mike if you didn't do that, your dad wouldn't, and right away Kathleen's telling me it's not your card (ph), just, just let him be, he's just a kid. So, I'm, I'm trying to separate that portion of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Don't be so controlling of them I guess. I don't let them do their thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do, do you view how you respond to them as being controlling? Or is this a way of someone else's just (inaudible)? [0:09:06.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it's control, it, it, maybe I expect more out of them. Maybe my expectations a little bit too much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mike is how old?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mike is ten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ten? And then the other (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Geanie is four.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is four? Okay. Have you given any consideration as to why you take this approach or Kathleen takes a different approach? Are there differences in values or, or are you all for totally different (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it was the way I was raised. Not only the way I was raised, but when I was in the service. [Now there were] (ph) certain things that were expected of you. Everything was expected to be neat and orderly and, and precise. [0:10:04.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there were reasons for that. I should be able to expect Mike to put things away and stuff, but I don't think anybody's ever showed him how to clean his room and things. And so his parents will go in there and just kind of bag everything up and, and throw it away. I don't do that, but I just think that they should pick up their toys when they're done playing and put them away. That was expected of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you were a kid?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what happened or, if you didn't put your toys away or didn't pick up behind yourself or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We got a pretty good wailing with a belt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was this dad or mom?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Both? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both. [0:11:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this is for things like toys not being put away or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not just toys but basically everything in general in your room. Make sure your laundry's put where it needs to be and make your bed, and pick up things. You know I see my parents as demanding so much in the past. My grandparents didn't do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What was the difference? It's, it seems like you're remembering some things or reflecting them? [0:11:52.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just sitting here and reflecting back, my parents better (ph) come in the room at 5 o'clock, just, "time to do the chores" and it was never harsh or rough. It was kind of mellow and my grandmother was a lot more so than, you know. But, but for some reason things were different between the two. Obviously my parents and grandparents, they just didn't expect me to, my grandmother would make the beds. And, I don't know. I think about it now maybe I am being, being a little bit harsh, with, with the kids in general. (crosstalk) [0:12:58.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you see yourself like your grandparents or do you see yourself as your parents and (inaudible)  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I see myself more like my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How so? </p>

<p>PATIENT: The strictness. And the placing demands on them and I think we'd be that, we, we'd have a better relationship if I just treated the kids with kindness and left the major responsibilities to their parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Major responsibilities?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I let them tell the kids what they need to be doing and stuff. Even though they don't, it's not really my place to say anything to the kids. Maybe I should say something to them. Or maybe it's not my place at all to say anything. Just let it be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, let me understand this, your grandparents you said that you did have chores, right? But your grandparents weren't as harsh or demanding? [0:13:57.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I had chores and stuff and worked out in the barn. I, I put the cat food out for the cats, I fed the cats, and scatted hay for the, for the cows, a lot of things I did. I got in the corn crib and actually shoveled the corn into the auger because it was easier for me to get through that little hole on top of the pen than it was for anybody else. It was just a lot of things to do on a farm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. But your grandparents they still, they held you, they had some expectations for you it sounds like, but they weren't as harsh about seeing what they got done or, as your parents?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, my grandfather seemed to be right there and he expected me to do things, but, how do I say it? He wasn't critical of it and if I didn't do things, well he had a way of saying you know, we got to get this done and (inaudible) thing. [0:15:02.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was your dad or your mom, they were?</p>

<p>PATIENT: They were more, this is what needs to be done - get it done or else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or else. Okay. So when you say that you see more of your parents in yourself and the way you treat Geanie and Mike, do you see yourself a person in, in that manner? Do this or else or do you see yourself like as your grandfather, we need to get this done type of approach?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I see if they get it done or else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you see how that negatively impacts how your relationship with them? You said that you, you, things were maybe better between you all if you weren't as demanding or critical or I think you said harsh? [0:16:08.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think your grandfather approached you in that manner, rather than the way your parents did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's, maybe he just realized that he really wasn't the parent - that he was the grandparent and he was going to do things in a more loving way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So grandparents should be more loving than parents? [0:17:01.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not, no, not more loving, but I think there's a different expectation between parents and grandparents. Parents are ones that have to deal with the everyday garbage and things, they're the ones that have to, to raise you and feed you and nurture you and stuff and then grandparents can just kind of spoil you and send you back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) at that, but if I recall you were with your grandparents for a whole summer, so  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I was with my parents, well my grandparents every summer from the age I was five up until I graduated high school.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like they had day-to-day they had to deal with the, day-to-day and  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just different with them for whatever reason. We'd get it together and we'd go to the grocery market once a month. It was a, a simpler life I guess. [0:18:14.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Slip, a simpler life in what sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We baked our own bread, we had our own garden that we worked in and so many different things that we did, but yet when I was at home and going to school and stuff, it just seemed to be kind of a rat race. And as society has changed, it seems that we rely more on technology these days than we do the simple things and we seem to forget to just take time to smell the roses, rather than hustle and bustle about. [0:19:10.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think your parents were doing a lot of the hustle and bustle and then not leading simple life or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I do. I think my parents enjoyed being out away from home and whether they were at home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what, I guess what we'll want them to (inaudible at 0:19:41.4) out of the home or in home (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it's just recently that my dad said that he didn't like kids. I kind of wonder if that was some of the reasons, he just didn't, didn't know how to deal with them or didn't want to deal with us, it just, what exactly was the problem. But I remember him telling me years ago that I had two aunts very close in age and when they 10 years-old my grandfather took them both in a room and told them to fight because that's what they did all the time is they fought. And the minute they stopped, he'd wail on them with a belt, he says I told you to fight and that's just not the way to raise kids. [0:20:42.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're, you're not, I, I can't expect anything, punishment for kids that didn't (ph), I don't believe in that physical. You know that's real close to physical abuse. That's not loving the child. It's done more out of anger than anything else and I've never struck any of the kids. It's one thing that I won't do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that separates you, or make you different from your father?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well remembering Tim, what, what ways are you like your father that you're not comfortable with? [0:21:46.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: The anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell me a little more about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just doesn't seem to take a whole lot at times to, to trigger things. It's like having a, almost, it's just the mine that is buried in the ground, the thing doesn't explode, but you're, you're treading lightly to try to avoid it but sooner or later you step on the thing and it just explodes. [0:22:46.0] And instead of realizing sooner that the pain and suffering it's going to cause is just not worth it. Because I saw quite a bit of that with my parents I guess. I remember my dad running out to the truck and throwing it in reverse and spinning the tires all the way out the driveway and stuff, but I just think to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking? [0:23:51.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: All the similarities and examples that I've had. You know I thought I'd changed through the years in some sense I did, in others I haven't. I want to live this great life, I'm a Christian and doing for others, whatnot, but if I don't treat people the way that I expect to be treated, I'm not doing it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. [0:24:49.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then why does it have to be such a difficult thing to control?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes it so difficult for you? Is it hard to put into words or (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, I don't know if it's some sort of systematic chemical imbalance or if it's just, things build up and you get this adrenaline rush and you become aggressive? I honestly don't know. [0:25:50.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you think about your dad and your relationship, the difference between your rearing from your parents and grandpar, grandparents, I remember you shared some things last time about the way that your dad treated you. Do you think that maybe on some levels you might be still angry about those things and angry toward dad or toward mom or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hadn't really thought so, but maybe on a subconscious level? I just don't like the way that I was brought up. [0:26:46.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because sometimes Tim when things happen to us as kids, where it sounds like your dad was a big, tough guy and maybe intimidating or you were a little guy or whatever the case is, I'm sure, you talk about the way he used to discipline you, you would fall and become dead weight and just kind of disassociate from the whole situation. It doesn't mean that you don't feel the hurt or you don't feel the anger and you don't feel the feelings that go along with that, but for whatever reason I'm wondering what would have happened if you would have expressed that. Because you feel safe enough to express when you were angry at your dad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that would have made it twice as bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So where does all that go? That's the question. When people don't express their feelings and don't, and they're hurting, where, where does it go? [0:27:50.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You either have to get rid of it somehow or, I'm going to take the example of a tissue box, pull all the tissues out and then try putting them all back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you s - </p>

<p>PATIENT: You just can't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: stuck in it right? Do you think you got rid of this stuff or do you think you're more like a tissue box that's been stuffed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I am carrying a lot of it around with me. There's only so much that you can put back in the box.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because if you were to look at your life Joe, look at your relationships, look at your marriage, look at your relationship with your children, relationship with your grandparents, I mean with your grandchildren, how can you see that maybe there's, that you're carrying some anger from your past in the present now? [0:28:49.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd see some of the anger versus, but against my parents. I see some of the anger for my ex-wife in the divorce and what she did and I see some of the anger towards my employer, you know what I had gone, go through with workman's comp and I'm still fighting Social Security on a number of things. Sometimes there's just too much to handle at some poink (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like that would be overwhelming for you to carry that load, to carry that much with you and not have an outlet to release, or an appropriate outlet. It sounds like sometimes you have released it but it hasn't been in the best way. [0:30:00.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just a lot of times I wonder if I've actually released it or if I just pack it down. You think you've got it under your control and you've suppressed it, but eventually it's going to spring back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. We talk about that walking that tread and, this, this, just out of your control and it kind of explodes and goes off. (inaudible) yeah, that's how it works. It's like a sponge, or even like a Crock-pot, I use those metaphors. A sponge can only soak up so much before it starts dripping again, or you have a bucket under a leaky roof. The bucket can only hold so much of that water before it starts spilling out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Spilling over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know a Crock-pot can only hold so much, spoon, or a tea kettle can hold only so much steam before it comes out in some kind of a way. So we think we're packing in, we're trying to deal, deal with it later, we'll deal with it later or we won't deal with it at all, but it's getting packed and packed and packed and it comes out some kind of way and it's better that you find ways where you can control how much of it comes out when it comes out and how it comes out, but when we pack it down it has a mind of its own. Right? It comes out all types of ways and that's when anger tends to ruin our relationships or ruin our jobs or our lives. [0:31:29.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Last summer I spent, well not last summer, but summer before last - 2005. I had a chair that I had out in the woods. And I'd just go out there and sit down, I'd count the cars go by on the freeway. Or I'd just sit there and watch the birds, the squirrels and I, I seemed so relaxed and stuff. And I [can't even] (ph) stand is my getaway. And then this year I've been, I just, it seems like I've been so busy but I'm not sure what I've been busy doing. We're always on the run going someplace doing something. [0:32:34.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it doesn't sound as if you have enough outlets where you can get, where you can relax yourself or release or.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I haven't been seeing any of my, my buddies or friends, whatnot. Guys I worked with at the base, they're over in Alton, I'm in Champaign and I really don't enjoy driving that distance and stuff. I did go up last week, saw my buddy over in Berkeley, I did drive there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was good. They were both, him and his wife were both ecstatic. Hadn't seen me in a long time. But we talked on the phone off and on through the, through the couple years and stuff and then. Had a good visit. [0:33:38.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It seems like it, I just now, I mean just noticing you today Tim, you seemed a lot lighter than you have in previous sessions for whatever reason. In previous sessions you seemed like you were burdened, heavy, and today for whatever reason you seem like you're a little lighter than you have in the past. I'm not sure if you've, if you notice a difference in  - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I do notice a change. It was really nice to get over there and to see them and do something different than what we've been doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And did Kathleen go with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. She didn't want to. But tonight they have a men's gathering at the church that I'm involved in. Spend some time with the other guys and a little bit of fellowship, getting to know some few more (ph) people, but. [0:34:46.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just try different things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's good that, that you're having those things in mind because that is a healthy way to connect to people. Healthier way to stress relief, you know to find stress relief or to get to know other people and they open up other avenues for you to interact with people so you're not, especially as you say you and your wife are always together at home and it's easy to be frustrated with your own situation, and both of you guys I think (ph) around each other kind of, you get on each other's nerves in a sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You get that friction working back and forth and all of a sudden a, there's a little bit of a flame there between the two of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that your dad would have sought out men's fellowship groups or things like that to help him, to help himself? [0:35:46.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He did later after he retired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. But as a kid and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He moved to Eureka in, in '84 and it wasn't until the late '80s, early '90s when he joined the Knights of Columbus with the church and stuff. And all of, I'm going to say pretty much 90 percent of his communication is with his brothers and sisters or in-laws and whatnot, the other 10 percent might be the rest of the family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm just, was curious because you mentioned that in a lot of ways you see yourself like your father but over the years it seems like you've done some changing and I was just wondering if there was a difference in the way that you're seeking out help, if that was different from the way your dad did things. [0:36:58.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: My dad would have never gone to seek out any type of help for anything. You know he's the man and that's just, I don't know, it seems like society has changed quite a bit, that there has been a different focus on men than women. Men aren't afraid to go out and, to talk to people to find out what their problem might be. I've gone out for a little bit of therapy before and my dad would have never done anything like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Why not do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, he was the man. It was just, men didn't do that sort of thing. If they did, they were sissies. [0:37:55.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that what he instilled in you to a certain degree? That you had to be the man and not a sissy or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some ways, yes, but I don't know, it's just a different expectation years ago and what there is now. Kathleen's dad was a policeman, worked down in Elmwood Park. They lived down on 75th Street and then she went to school at Bishop First (ph) school and we talked back and forth. [0:38:48.4 ] Her dad was very different from my dad and, but we're, we're about the same age and I think there was just different family values with people. And sometimes today I think that we've gotten away from what those family values  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We as in you and Kathleen or we as in society?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm going to say more as a society. If we take a look at our cost of living, and everybody thinks that we've inflated over the years and now it takes a man to make money, as well as the woman to make money. Both parents work to raise their families and to have a roof over their heads based on costs and stuff. [0:39:49.6 ] And you can see a lot of the differences that have come about. And maybe that's not necessarily the case with all the people, but in some cases it's, it's quite a bit of the people the way kids are raised and stuff. I, you can take a look at society and the, look at the crime and stuff that's taking place. What has allowed that to happen? People, I stopped at Myers in Champaign after a couple hit the Flint store and the Wickson store and then the Brighton store. [0:40:50.9 ] 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Why is that? Just so many different values have changed in the years. Sometimes it can be a very wicked world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how does that affect you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that's why I expect so much out of those around me. [0:41:46.9 ] With my grandkids, with my own kids. You can only protect them up to a certain point then we have to allow them to take control of their own actions because you, you're no longer with them all the time. And ultimately you raised them the best that you could. We've talked off and on with my parents about changes in the world and she says I'm glad we had kids when we did and she says, I wouldn't want any part of it, the world today raising the family and stuff because it's just so different. [0:42:43.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is your mom talking? Okay. I wonder if you've ever considered talking to your mom about what life and the world was like for you as a kid when you were being raised. If you guys ever to talk about how things are now and whether, wonder what that discussion might look like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's an interesting thought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What part what makes interesting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I know my dad did have a lot of responsibility. There were times when shots (ph) were tough and they look at the car and just renow (ph) being in trouble. They've been in trouble throughout the years. [0:43:37.6] I think it was in 1970 when my dad got laid off. The only thing that we knew is he come home with boxes of groceries. We didn't what he came from. We didn't know about the part where Social Services and stuff like that. But when I went through that myself, I found out how belittling it was for the man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially if you're a man's man right? A man who doesn't need help and all sorts of things be put in a situation where you aren't long-ago (ph) men. I can't provide, I can't take care of your families, have to seek out help. That can be crushing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tim, we have to go ahead and stop now. Are you still wanting to do two weeks? [0:44:43.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well let me know whenever, if you ever want to resume back to once a week then. Definitely let me know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Have you been able to set up anything with a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I put in an evaluation request and so I'm just waiting to hear back. I know it was like a waiting list. I have to find out where you are on that list, but I did submit once I think we lost one psychiatrist and so the one that's left has been trying to clear their caseload. So the request is in and so as soon as I hear something, then I'll let you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm kind of questioning in my mind the, I've been on Zoloft and I've been on Lexaprone now for probably six weeks and they don't know if it's normal for anybody to be on medication for as long as I have been. Because it, it seems like the Zoloft has been two years, is what it is. [0:45:56.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so you kind of want to, you want to look at, reevaluate it and (inaudible) you still should be on it? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know if there's anything different [0:46:11.5]</p>

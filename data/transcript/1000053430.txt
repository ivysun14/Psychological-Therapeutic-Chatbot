<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>Let's look at council.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you tell me about something I would, what brings you here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok, I think initially the thing that brought both my wife and myself in was, and still is..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your wife's seeing someone here too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Wait a minute. Let me catch my breath.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok, sure. Relax. I see you've discovered the coffee machine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think what brought us in initially is a marital problem that we've had for four years. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's something we've kinda denied, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we acknowledge it verbally but it's not something we ever really worked out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you mean you both recognize it but it's not dealt with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not effectively, let's put it that way. We..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Paid lip service to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well. We would, well when we got married I was in the army.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, and we moved. My wife and I are both in Cleveland, Ohio And I was stationed in California when we got married. So when I'd come home at night I'd say, "Well you know, I'm tired." And we would go to bed together and we wouldn't have sexual relationships.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we have them infrequently. Very infrequently really for people our age.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And we'd always find a reason. I was tired. Or she was upset. There was some you know acceptable rationale.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like there was some acceptable reason that wasn't the reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And so this persisted. And we kept saying, "Well it will change. We'll do something to make it change." And we kept going on and on like this. Well, when I got out of the service we came back. And so we just kept finding new reasons. The strain of my coming back to graduate school. 0:02:15.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd be gone from seven to seven. My wife opened a business. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The strain of that and on and on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that pushed us really. We started fighting a lot you know because we generalized this problem. It was seeping out into our whole marriage. Generally we kept our finger on what it was we were fighting about. We knew that was really a big source of trouble for us. But we, you know, continued to rationalize and everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's at a point now where, we sat down again and we talked about it. We kinda agreed that if we didn't do something effective to deal with it then that was probably going to be either the end of our marriage or the end of our marriage as it is. With myself and most likely both of us going out of the marriage for sexual companionship but living together as a couple otherwise. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see. In other words what you're saying is at issue was that if you don't feel like you can somehow effectively deal with this then something drastic will happen to the marriage.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Either it won't be, or it will be but sex will be other places than with each other. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. So at that time we said, and we had talked earlier. We've talked ever since we were married. Once we felt this was a problem, we talked about doing something but I'm a teacher. And when I was in the army I was on the staff of the army's post. And I knew every other mental health professional there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:04:01.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when I was in graduate school I was afraid that somehow this would seep into graduate school and I'd be pulled out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I would, you know I think that we're both uncomfortable enough with the problem and unhappy enough with it that we just can't go on, you know, the way we have been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And you really want it to change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then I guess I don't really understand what the problem is. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, (inaudible at 0:04:31.70) is simply a symptom. For my wife, I'm not really sure what the symptom means. She has her feelings about sex and other feelings. And we don't talk about it too much because I don't want to get, you know, get into the role of being her therapist.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For myself, I'm not really sure. Oh God, I've thought about it a lot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have a lot of different feelings about what it is. And maybe I should say really different theories. Because intellectualization for me has replaced a lot of feeling. Which is something I'm kinda unhappy with. I want to get back to feeling. I think that's something that again, helped me come in. The feeling got too close, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the feeling got too close and grasped at the theories. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well, I started to feel uncomfortable, you know. The theories were no longer enough to deal with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They collided (ph) Yeah. There were still there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They were still there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I find myself now for example more and more inclined and ready at least to act out. You know, to go out and pick up a girl or hunt for something. A relationship. And that's when I, I start to feel really uncomfortable because I feel like I'm losing control. My own control over myself, you know. 0:05:58.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean is it the kind of thing where you see yourself doing the kinds of things that in a sense you feel driven to do but you really, part of you really just doesn't want to do them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well I don't feel it's, it is not the kind of relationship I entered into with my wife, nor do I want. You know I feel that it's unfair. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's unfair to her because I certainly don't feel like I could approve of her going out with other men.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I don't want to employ a double standard in our marriage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it, you know either way she's going to suffer. If she stays home as the faithful wife while I'm out, she's still suffering. Whether she knows it or not, she's still suffering.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because you know she's certainly being deprived of a relationship too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So anyway, for my wife it's, she has her own reasons for the problem. And then for myself I'm not really sure. Prior to marriage when I was an undergraduate and then when I was in the army and you know all the periods in between I had always been, I don't know, kind of a letch in a way. You know I sought after girls..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel embarrassed saying that? Because you, I kinda detect... (overlapping)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I can't find a good word. I couldn't find a really good word. There was a period that you know lasted several years, four or five years, when I dated girls, often dated girls simply to have sexual relations with. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this in the last four or five years while you were married?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this is prior to marriage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Prior to marriage. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I would take out girls with at least an, you know, the feeling that I would score. 0:08:07.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was important to me. It really enhanced my own self image. I'm not sure if it, I guess it made me feel more adequate. I don't know. God. Shit. I get into, now I'm asking myself, see did, did for example if I had intercourse with a girl was intercourse really an aggressive hostile act? I, you know, was it an act to make me feel more adequate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It sounds like you're asking a lot of questions about what your motivations were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I want to know what it was then because maybe then I could understand why I no longer have the motivation you know, with my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Prior to marriage we had sexual relations. To me they were satisfactory. To my wife I don't know. Well she, you know, she was very ambivalent. According to her and I believe it because she had no, I don't feel she ever had any reason to bring it up. She had never had relations before me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know this was a big thing to her. And I think she felt very guilty. I'm sure she did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think the only reason she really had relations with me was out of the fear of losing me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I wanted some kind of gratification and she felt she had to give it to me or I'd go somewhere else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oddly enough, or I shouldn't say oddly enough, interestingly enough I think that's one of the things in a way kind of put me into marriage. And I use that word because I don't know a better word at this time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which word? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok my wife, when I was in the army I had no desire to get married. I was right out of school. 0:10:05.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was enjoying you know, my freedom. I had a girlfriend in California. My wife proposed a number of times and I said no, no. I'd put her off. And she used to come and visit me every two or three months. And one time her mother accused her of having relations with me. Either that or asked her. But anyway my wife said yes. Well of course that was a real blow to my mother in law, big blow. And I felt guilty about it, you know when my wife told me. Because my in laws were also under the impression that I wasn't going to marry her because they knew I was giving her a hard time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And suddenly I felt guilty. I think I felt that "If I don't marry her and then she has to go back and live with them, they're going to hold this over her head. And she's really going to be sad."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So you like really felt like now you had weighing on you some type of responsibility.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was the same kind of thing as if I had gotten her pregnant for example. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. It had the same kind of functional significance in terms of how you felt about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it did. I think it did. There were, you know the factors that finally induced me to propose were you know, they included a lot of other things. I began to feel I really missed her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And when she was leaving California one time I just said, "When do you want to get married?" And a couple of days later I called her back and said, "We're not getting married." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that went on and on for a little bit. I think sometimes, you know this may have played some part, that in a way I was punishing her by depriving her of a relationship that had gotten me into this thing to begin with. 0:12:04.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say that last thing again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That had gotten me into this thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which by that I mean marriage.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I felt in a way that I had been forced into a marriage earlier than I wanted to get married, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was there, I mean I'm not sure. I mean was there any kind of resentment at all? I mean I guess the way you say this you did feel some kind of resentment. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. You know. Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You certainly felt unsure about it. And torn. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I feel ambivalent too. Unfortunately, and I say that, unfortunately for myself, when I got married I made the decision. I'd say about seventy-five percent of my decision making process was an intellectual one. The other twenty-five was emotional. If that much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. See I think this is why, this is, we're getting into the real problem. Why all the intellectualization. And I think I know. And you know what I can do about that. And I think the intellectualization has been kind of an evolutionary process by which I learned to handle people. And of course my feelings about people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What they did to me in terms of the response they evoked from me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and why the feelings maybe were so uncomfortable that I you know, learned how to handle them this way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It kinda sounds like, you know something that you really kind of sense in yourself, a tenancy to have your, what you call intellectualizing, legislate and in fact it inhibits your feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Because I, you know the feelings aren't, I don't feel the feelings. They don't come through as feelings. 0:14:02.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in other words like, in much of your experience then is really devoid of feelings. Or any strong, really meaningful type of feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really strong feelings. Because I don't trust my feelings for one reason. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And because I think often I'm afraid of my feelings. Not necessarily of feeling them as much so as acting upon them. Which goes back to not trusting them again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I just can't help some how get the sense as you talked about (inaudible at 0:14:40.0) relationship in a sense between your mind and your feelings that in a way is very analytical and intellectual. Even the way you talk about it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. It is. I think that's primarily because that's what I'm coming to you with. That's what I am at this point. The feelings kinda, you know like today I don't feel uncomfortable. During the weekend I felt very uncomfortable at some point. And I'm trying to remember what day it was. Saturday I felt extremely uncomfortable with my feelings. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There's so many, I don't know, there's so much involved at this point. It's like there are times when I say, "I'm unhappy with our relationship. I want to fix it up. I want to do something about it to improve our relationship." And then there are other times when I say, "No, the relationship itself is based on a false premise. And therefore instead of going in and changing yourself to meet the needs and the responsibilities of the relationship, that maybe it's better just to dissolve the relationship and go and do what you want to do." 0:16:15.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The big problem is I'm not sure what I want to go out and do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which you know makes me feel even more ambivalent. And perhaps this is acted out you know, in our sexual relationship too. I think I've always been that ambivalent but the ambivalence was repressed for other reasons. For example even though I primarily have always supported my wife, because like when I was in graduate school I had a big stipend and everything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I felt like I never could have made it without her. You know it was my own dependency needs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I kinda sense, I kinda sense something that really you probably somewhat feel very torn. But you call it ambivalence. I mean I imagine that sometimes there must be a real tearing kind of aspect inside of you in a sense feeling at times like what you do feel like you can get from your wife. Almost like you got from her in graduate school I guess is of that. And yet in a way is the relationship really not right to begin with. And I'm just not satisfied with that relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. Yeah see I keep, well, I don't know. God. There are just so many different facets. First of all I, you know I have to sometimes say to myself, "Ok, was it right for you to enter into a marriage that you had to make an intellectual response to, rather than a feeling response?"0:18:02.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I say right for myself. The fact that I entered into it with so little feeling. I guess I kinda expected the feeling to come. That once the decision was made and once I got into the process of living with her there would be more feeling and less of a need to intellectualize. But that's not always the cases. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said, you kinda beforehand you had hoped, well it's intellect now but the feeling will grow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Now I think you know, there is definitely more depth to my feeling and more..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With respect to your wife.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, respect and love. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I said with respect to your wife. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I had the feeling you had been talking about intellectualizing feeling in a much more general way before. I mean when you said that that was a problem. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. That is a problem, right. But I'm talking here in terms of my wife.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that, ok now I, when the feelings I do have of, when they kinda start to push out, you know, this defense I've built up, the feelings are really anger and hostility toward my wife.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See and that gets into a whole new thing. Sometimes I don't know if it's simply because of a bad relationship. Sometimes its a feeling of resentment at how we ended up getting married, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Ok. I want to take a step back. Because as soon as you started to say angry and resentment, you started to go to the causes of it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I was more interested in what that experience, when you feel that kind of anger and resentment, feels like inside you. 0:19:58.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean because I had the feeling that it was a very powerful kind of feeling that when you said that it really can get past those defenses.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. Yeah, yeah it's very, very powerful. I don't know, I get kinda, I don't know. Well, ok, if my wife is there and I'm feeling this anger, because this occurred during the weekend. I really started to yell at her, in a way, with little provocation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just didn't want to control it. I wanted to let it out and hurt her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really felt that strong thing rising up in you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. We were fighting about the fact that my brother and I and a girl he was dating had been out all day together and we came back. And I invited them up. And, but before I left that day I told my wife, see she was cleaning to have some company over. And I said, "If I think you're still cleaning, I won't bring them up." And I thought she was done because we came home later than I had anticipated. So I assumed that she was done cleaning. And when I walked in I could see she wasn't. And she knew I was bringing them, she was very angry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But instead of accepting her anger, I told her that, "If you throw a tantrum, just lock yourself in the God damned bathroom and stay there." Which of course fed into her anger and made her more angry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Sounds like kinda that anger was real intent on hurting her too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah well later on, after my brother and this girl sensed the hostility and they left, you know I started swearing at my wife. And I told her to get screwed. And I told her if she didn't like the way things were going to get out. 0:22:10.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And generally in the past, when my wife and I have had arguments, it was something where we worked out. We talked about why we're angry you know and why the other party is injured, which is the most satisfactory thing in the long run but doesn't necessarily ventilate my anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So after we had the fight, then we, you know after we really yelled and let each other have it. Then we talked about why we were so mad and all that. But it's really a hostility. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know see, I don't know if it's really at my wife directly. I've always, not always, but I've had a great amount of hostility for a long time which I think primarily I owe to my mother, you know. I think it's directed at my mother. But I don't feel I can take it out on her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Primarily because she's pre-psychotic. And second because I think I'm afraid of my anger. The depth of my anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And there are times when my wife reminds me of my mother so I imagine I think about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is your fear about your anger, is like if you really let it out and really you know, how strong it can come out that you will lose control?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I know I would. But it's not a fear you know. Because it's more vague than that. It's an anxiety about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At times I, when I was a senior in high school for example and I was really angry, there was a time I was angry at my mother. I broke up the house. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I threw an ashtray, shoved my fist through a glass door, things like that. It wasn't generally, it wasn't greatly destructive but I wanted to display something. Maybe to demonstrate to my parents how angry I was.0:24:15.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More than anything else. But there are times within the past couple of years, like we, when my wife first opened her business and we were having a real hassle. And we opened the business the very same time I started graduate school. So I had no money. I was borrowed up to my ass. And it looked like we were going to be wiped out of our business before ever opening our front door. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the man who at that time we felt was going to be responsible for that was a doctor. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whose office we were going to take and he wouldn't vacate. So I swore I'd kill him. And I meant it at the time. Well, you know it's, I can swear I'll kill people and that's ok. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying is that you might even see yourself doing it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. And I doubt if, I guess I felt that rage because I felt impotent to do anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I swore I would do the most destructive thing I could do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think a lot of times that's something that makes me angry. Because I do feel impotent to change things, to do things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Powerless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you want to, powerless and I guess there's a sense of frustration in there too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess as you're talking about like the things you said to your wife, that came out there too I heard. You know in some of the things you said to her. I mean they were kind of expressive of the frustration in the relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which things that I said to her? 0:25:57.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you told her, what did you say? Screw off? I don't remember the specifics of what you said, I remember about go lock yourself in the bathroom. But what you said to her when you started yelling at her. I just had the feeling that it sounded like you were getting back at her. The sense of frustration was not there in the moment. It was frustration at her generally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ok. Let me, let me describe what had worked up to the, prior to even coming home. We had been out with my brother you know, and this girl. And she's not really his girlfriend. It's somebody that he's been dating just recently. And we went to the peace rally in New York. And my wife is, my wife is kind of a rigid compulsive person. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm somewhat rigid and compulsive but a lot less so than she. And a lot less so than I was say eight or nine years ago. In some aspects I've kinda freed up in a lot of ways. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think that, you know a lot of times or often, I should say often, I feel cheated. Not only in the fact that you know, as I described how we got married, but in what I got out of marriage. What I had anticipated when thinking about marriage prior to ever having known my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah so it's like you had this concept of marriage. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And of who I married.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and of who you'd marry and it was kind of like a, probably a very, it was like if you had to paint a picture of you it would probably look like a very lovely, heavenly picture. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that's putting it too strong. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was warm, nice warm colors. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was an idealized kind of relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just probably feel, I would imagine just feel terribly resentful kinda when you think about what you have and what you don't have. Or how it's a pain that's very different that you..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right I feel frustrated which turns out into resentment.0:28:15.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So anyway, we went to the demonstration. And first of all the girl my brother was with was a girl that I had seen the night before but not with my brother there. You know I had seen out in public. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the only word I can really think of is I cofected. You know I really hit on her as being real cool.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Solely based on what I saw. Nothing else but you know, I projected a lot of things into her. And so she turned out to be the girl that my brother had dated. And when he first met her she picked him up and took him out in her Volkswagen bus and laid him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then every time they go out, that's what they do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she wants to leave her job. And she has a, she's divorced and has a kid and she wants to leave her job and just take off with what money she's got and go. Which is what I often feel like doing too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've got, that appeals to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So here I am with a girl that appeals to me in so many, many ways and of course it's too threatening to me. You know it's really threatening to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because if she would say, "Do you want to go with me?" I just might say, "Yeah, I'll go with you." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's, you know when we talked about feeling, the feelings I had that afternoon were really intent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Intent, what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I really felt them. You know I just couldn't deny them any longer. I couldn't intellectualize them away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that kind of feeling like right then it just really seemed clear to you how drawn you were to this person? Was it a drawing kind of thing? 0:30:04.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: You mean to this one girl?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To this girl with the lifestyle or is that what you're talking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To the lifestyle, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Not to the girl herself. Because it could have been any of the girls I saw that afternoon. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But my frustration just grew and grew. And I of course I became more and more angry with my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, let's, yeah. But going back to this feeling of when you said like you couldn't deny it was really a feeling. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that what, what kind of feeling was it? Potentiality for being liberated in a way or freed or things that were denied to you that you would have liked to have had? Kind of a release? See I can't get my finger on ..</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a combination of both. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because there are things I feel that I have been cheated of. And that's the best word I can use. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: There are things that..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, as you talk I'm really, you know, more and more I do get the sense from what you're saying that the very, you know, very deeply what you're saying is that you really do have the sense of, "You know I really have been denied. There are things that I really do God damn very well, very much want."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. Right. And I feel, it's my feeling, and one of the few that I may have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's my feeling that I have one life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And God damn it, I want to get what I want out of it. The problem is I'm not sure what I want. Which you know, leads to a lot of frustration too. It would be one thing if I said, "I know I'm going to be happy by leaving my life, for example, and changing my lifestyle." I'm not sure I'd be happy. And I'm dependent enough that I stay with my wife and our way of life because I'm unsure. I'm unwilling to take the chance. And I get mad about that too, you know. 0:32:10.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because what? You see yourself, to take the chance I mean, I guess that kind of seems like that's pretty frightening and risky and scary. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean just to close one door and open up another door and not know where the hell it goes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But yet you kinda get mad at yourself for not doing that and staying in the room that you're in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. See, and at the same time, and of course this makes, yeah I guess it makes me mad in some ways. My wife and I..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean when you say that, "It makes me mad in some ways" you smile. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Smile. I knew you'd say that because I caught myself smiling and thinking about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that, I mean? </p>

<p>PATIENT: See because, for example, my wife is extremely middle class oriented. And I guess her whole life, her parent's life, was centered around things. Get things, work for things, have things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's not the way I am. That's not the way my family is. And I never really cared much about things. And so when we got married we were given a lot of things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now my wife just keeps buying more things. And I smile because I like having things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I want to draw a limit to it. Because you know the more things I have the less free I feel to split. Or the less free I feel to make sacrifices because that will mean giving up things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I feel anger about it because I feel that if I hadn't married my wife then I wouldn't be thing oriented, you know. I wouldn't even get that way. 0:34:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It's like what you're saying is that your marriage is in a way, you feel there's some, maybe this is too strong an image but it's like a prison but the bars which are many have to do with dissatisfaction in the marriage but they also have to do with the whole lifestyle of the marriage too in a way. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things appeal to you about it on the one hand but yet you feel that they're, that you're trapped in it. You're trapped in some of the appeal of it too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right, yeah. Yeah it's not that I'm an unwilling prisoner. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I helped make it that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think that, well of course this goes into my wife. My wife's very passive aggressive. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's her way of dealing with me and with people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. You smile when you say that too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah because I can think of so damn many ways she's passive aggressive that just piss me off, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Little things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I kinda sense it when you talk about angry things you smile and that seems like a disjunction to me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think maybe that's my way of handling it a lot of times you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You mentioned earlier that I sound very analytical and I think maybe a lot of times I diffuse my anger by breaking the problem or the source of anger down into little pieces. Like you diffuse a bomb and make it inoperant because if I understand why I'm angry or why somebody has pissed me off, if I understand it then I don't have to feel mad. 0:36:02.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I guess it is a way of handling my anger. I just do it that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Circuitous kind of way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a circuitous way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. But it doesn't always work, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It comes up at times. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know where we are now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Where did we leave off at? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure. Where do you think we left? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you had been talking about things and about how that made you angry too. And then you've been talking about anger and your analytical way of handling that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm still, getting back to the sexual problem, I'm still unclear for you what the problem is other than you're not satisfied. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you did say once that you feel desirous.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I what? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you wanted your wife. I wasn't even sure if, I thought you said that you know like you didn't want to sleep with her. But then you also act like that that didn't lead you to think you were undesirous because you said you were thinking about going out with other women. 0:37:56.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I guess there are times when, well ok. I assume that I have normal sexual desires and appetites, we'll say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know within that, whatever that spectrum would be. But almost since my wife and I got married, in a sense I often lack desire. And that's hard, I don't know. Like we'll go to bed and we may be lying next to each other and I'll get an erection. But I have no real desire to do anything about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or no real desire perhaps to make love with her. But then maybe I'll masturbate. Or she'll masturbate me, you know. I have a sexual desire. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Now whether that desire is for her necessarily is vague. Because I'm not sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It certainly sounds like it's not at times. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See, well yeah, we've talked about it. I guess for a long time I felt my wife kinda put me off. And I'm not really sure how because there was nothing definite you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you had the sense of it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well unconsciously maybe because there's nothing I could ever put my finger on to even say I got the sense because of this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Well put it this way, you felt put off. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I called myself not enjoying relationships with her in the way I once had, we'll say prior to marriage. Which goes back to you know, the earlier thing about why, you know what the sexual relationships really meant to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's for example there's no spirit of like I'm getting something. You know I'm taking something. Maybe since that's gone, or I feel that's gone, then there's no fun in the game. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I get the feeling that there's somehow you know having intercourse there's something some empty feeling about that. Like there's not much feeling there about having it. 0:40:10.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean you know like I kinda was trying to get the sense from what you said. You do have sexual desires but they don't, but they're not like in the direction of, you don't really want to sleep with your wife. I mean it's not like that's the thrust of expressing your feelings. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that if I understand you correctly, that might be true. That for example when I think about fulfilling, sexually fulfilling sexual relationships I think I would think of other women. Not my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It's like you just really can't see. It's like when you look at your wife you just don't get the feeling that that's where sexual fulfillment lies for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think so. Now see I'm not sure if that comes, you know I'm not sure about the source of that is. If that is something that originates within me or if that's something that originates from our relationship and my wife's problem. Whatever that is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: For example when we first decided to come here she said, "Well I don't think you have to come. I'm just going to go because I know I've got a problem." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I don't agree. That's not true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because whatever her problem is has become my problem anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I had my own reasons for coming anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 0:42:00.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think for example I had noticed I, you know when you're single for example I think masturbation is a very common sexual outlet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I assumed that when I got married masturbation would be a very infrequent form of outlet. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm,</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it hasn't been. It's been just a frequent as prior to marriage. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I realize now, when I you know when I've thought about it, that masturbation for me was kind of a, you know an anxiety reducing outlet. That's how I was using it in reality. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet it kinda feeds into a cycle. If for some reason I will masturbate during the course of a day that lessens my sexual drive at night when I go to bed with my wife. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so if I consciously don't masturbate, I you know I say, "Don't do it because then you're never going to rectify the problem. You're not going to have any desire when you go to bed." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nevertheless I probably won't have relationship with her anyway. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. How do you feel when you do have relationships with her? </p>

<p>PATIENT: It depends. Now the last time we had a relationship it was very good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that was a couple of weeks ago. That was very good. I think because she really let herself go. And because it was something she completely didn't expect. It wasn't anything she psychologically prepared for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Generally when we have a sexual relationship it's when we've gone to bed and you know to start love play and then go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this time it was in the middle of the afternoon. And that excited her. You know it was something like, well it was exciting because it broke the mold. It was kind of like being single. And she relaxed and enjoyed it. And I enjoyed it much more than general. 0:44:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because generally it anymore it's kind of like you know a pattern. She does this and you do that. And you count on that. You know what you're going to do and it's not that fulfilling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. It sounds like there's just no excitement. It's almost like it's going through motions. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but it's been that way since we got married. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See? Which is bad. I mean, you know to me. It would be different if we had been married four years and it gradually became a pattern. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But it's always been..</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's been, it's almost always been kind of a pattern, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how do you feel about being stuck in that pattern? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm unhappy about it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean unhappy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm unfulfilled. I resent it because I want sexual fulfillment and I get mad at my wife if I can't get it from her, you know. And then I feel cheated because if I can't get it from her I feel like I should get it somewhere but I don't feel it's right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah I get the sense from what you're saying that just you know like, that you're unfullfillness and sexual you know sexually like a really dominant feeling is there. A dominant feeling which is, I'm trying to get my hand on this. It's not just being cheated. It's like, I guess it's a very complicated feeling. I mean it's a lot of the feelings you've mentioned. It's like that, "Here's one God damned important part of my life that just isn't."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just really isn't. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's more important than I thought it would, well no I shouldn't say that. Maybe in some ways it's become less important than I thought it would be. But that's not really true. Because you know it spills over. 0:46:12.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It's like it sounds like it might be less important kind of out of exclusion. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the exclusion is very important I guess. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of the feeling there is, it's a sense of frustration from living, I kinda get this picture of a life that might look like this and there's just this big cavity there. Something completely devoid of really sexual excitement and satisfaction between you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the feeling in you is also kind of a feeling of emptiness and frustration is kinda filled up with anger and resentment and frustration. What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm kinda probing around to take it somewhere from there. Which is interesting because you asked me what I was feeling and I told you what I was thinking. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure if I'm really having a feeling or not. 0:48:06.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because see, because like I get the feeling like, well let me put it this way. I get the sense of as you talked about your feelings and you're talking about them but I can't get the sense that they're present and real for you. Do you understand what I'm saying? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but do you mean at this point or ever? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know about ever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean but I mean I guess it's like that you know that they're present, that there's some sense of the feelings that you're talking about are present as we talk about them, I don't get the sense that that's so. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's a well entrenched defense mechanism. Really. You know I was amazed when I finally began to realize how well entrenched it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having said that, how does it make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing. I can remember how I felt when I learned it though, you know. And I say learned it because it was pointed out to me by my field work instructor. And it finally hit home. At one point it just hit me. A real feeling that I was really doing it. I felt it and not just thought about it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. See, I mean I asked you that question because I, going back when I asked you how do you feel and you said nothing. And then you said well it's a well entrenched defense mechanism. I mean I asked you well how do you feel having said that because I had this feeling that there it was in a way. Explain that. 0:50:00.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Umm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have this feeling again that you are putting a label on it or something that encapsulated it but..</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm. That kinda explains it away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and that's the kind of feeling that I'm getting. Do you understand that? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does my saying that hit you? Does it make you feel uncomfortable and bad? </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I hate that I accept that, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok about that generally I just, I must, like I would think like I'm just trying to imagine myself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Life must seem pretty empty and meaningless when this kind of a dearth of meaningful feelings which were there with strength and intensity. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that's true. Well yes and no. It's hard for me to explain. Because I imagine it depends on how you feel about life, you know. The best, the thing that hit me when you said that was for a while I gave up reading Drew Pearson's column. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I used to become so outraged every night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So angry that I used to go to bed and plot, plot very intricate ways that I could go out and kill Strom Thurman and Mendel Rivers and people. You know how easy it would be to do. And how one of these days I may just become angry enough at what's going on to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I quit reading it because I felt like I was losing a certain sense of control. A certain balance because I was being I felt overpowered in a sense by my feelings. Not that I was afraid I would do it. 0:52:09.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They evoked in you is like you didn't know how to handle them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it was such anger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt uncomfortable. Was it like that you could feel things pounding in you and you really didn't know how to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I can tell you how I feel when I really get angered that way. I become very red and my heart starts pounding very rapidly. And it can happen, you know, quickly. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I get kind of lightheaded. Sometimes have felt like I might faint. I get dizzy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I can feel the adrenaline really going. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know like I said one time I broke an ashtray. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it scares you I guess. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it does, yeah. I think it scares me because I... It's not that I'm afraid that I'll do something so terrible. You know like my anger is so great that I'm going to kill somebody. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's simply I guess I'm afraid that my anger sometimes outweighs the situation. Because you know it's an anger that's being delivered onto one person for what's been generated by many. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And second because I think that sometimes when I get angry, like I may say things that are unfair to be said and may be like crippling. For example with my wife and I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Crippling to our future relationship. It may make me immediately better to say them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you sure as hell...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know I'm going to regret it. At the same time, I had another thing about... I guess yeah. I think maybe I'm afraid that when I really get angry my expression of the anger would be less mature than I feel is warranted in me. You know at my age. 0:54:20.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somehow like the anger is an emotion like the way you kinda express would be a way that you really would hate yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well not hate. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't fit in with the kind of person you want to be. </p>

<p>PATIENT: See and it's real funny. Like my father is a very passive guy who has always repressed anger and feeling. And my mother just is the kind of person who will really piss you off. Well, piss me off and my father too. But my father would never show it. And I would and I was really acting out for both he and myself. And I think then I got to a certain point, when I was a junior in high school, that the anger became so great that I had the option. I did have the option.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See my mother used to bring men home and everything. And one night I was going to kill them. I caught a man there. And I pulled out a chain with a big ball on the end of it. And I was going to kill them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I just kind of, I just checked my anger. And I threw them out. And I threw my mother out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess maybe from that point on I began to maybe fear my anger a little bit. I'm not sure. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda it was something that just, you'd better kinda keep a check on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And of course you know. It's become, my control over it has become greater. Not necessarily more effective in the sense that it, you know, handles it any better but the need for more control. Let's put it that way. The need for more control has gotten greater. 0:56:07.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At this point though, you know at this point in my life I'm not that happy with the structure I've created to check my anger. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel it's no longer serving not only the original purpose but it's no longer serving a really good purpose in my life. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it spreads out to cut out other feelings too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like yeah, that you know it's not just that it's not working, checking anger because even sometimes it comes out but it's like it's this kind of approach or style that you're taking that you can really see is choking off a hell of a lot of living in your world. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. Yeah it's checking off a lot more than that feeling.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Than anger. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's checking off other feelings too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Our time's just about up. I want to ask you. How often do you want to come in? It could either be once a week or twice a week. That's really up to you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know that this is time limited. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think my wife's coming in once a week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At least she is at this point. And she may start coming twice a month later on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Twice a month? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Once every other week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once every other week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think that I'll come in once a week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok now is this day and time good for you? </p>

<p>PATIENT: This is very good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's very good for me too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because my wife comes in right after me. And that way we can drive in together because otherwise it's hard for her to get up here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She comes in after you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she's here now. Her appointment is at 6:30. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh maybe her appointment could be moved up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it could or not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She might ask the person she's seeing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They're talking about it now. But this is good because we come in.... 0:57:53.2</p>

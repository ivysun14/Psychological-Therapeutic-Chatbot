<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Wednesday, March 3rd.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think lots of things happened to me last night because I was just thinking about that afterward. It was like a weird thing like, like some of the old hangups that I'm starting to get out of. I started to see those just a little bit because I realize now I could - I didn't even put my finger on it before, why I liked this older fellow in aerobics, Professor Blackwell and my instructor now whose about sixty, they're both about 60, and it didn't hit me that like what I was seeing in them was an older man. I just realized this coming which is so funny because I was thinking about, "Now why do you have such an attraction to him?" And like last night what happened is he almost didn't - he was talking to two of us, this other girl and myself, and we'd, my girlfriend and I had just had a discussion the day before about some people can attract fellows and have them fall all over them and some people can't. Well I can't, you know. So like I cried about that or... [inaudible at 0:01:01.6] ...but I cried because I thought it was so sad, because like I just don't have that, right? And it was like saying (ph) again like it was an inadequacy. And then afterwards I said, "Well look, I never had it so what's the big deal." Like I've always had boyfriends...but I haven't had like men or walk into a room and everybody, every guy goes, "Ah!" (making sharp inhaling noise) You know like with my girlfriend. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like that...how that men just kind of flock to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you can like get some of them like people and have them like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I mean even as far as a boyfriend goes, there is a certain amount of fellows that...are attracted to me, not all fellows, you know. Like my girlfriend just walks in the room and every fellow in the room is going, "Ooh!" (chuckling) You know, all over her. But it's like, so then it's that I had to realize that, like it's not going to help any because...I thought at first, I think it really was in the back of my mind, like when I was finished with therapy I'd walk out and all of the sudden everybody in the world would go, "Oh, here she is! New person, fantastic person, really want to get to know her." And then I got more down to earth about it and said, "Well you don't have - so what!" So I got two new friends and I'm really, really excited about running and I like my teacher and I'm really...wow! So I didn't care. I didn't care that everybody in the whole gym didn't go, "Oh, here she is!" You know, "She's here." So, but anyway, last night the instructor came up was talking, because we were out at a restaurant and he came in, this is dad (ph) instructor and he's the older man. And so he came up and I noticed that he was talking - well he was standing right by my head. So naturally when you're looking forward, you'd actually be looking more at the other person that was next to you. Then like the first thing I thought is, "Uh-oh, maybe she's got that appeal and I don't have it." (chuckling) You know and I just, "Gurr." And then like I was with her and her husband and like we always, we give back and forth just about equally, so it's like saying like, "I must have something in some way or like the fellow involved, not so much in liking me as a girlfriend but I mean like he relates to me. So what's the difference?" I had, I figured this out, like even if the instructor didn't like me as much as he like her as person or as a whatever, if he thought she was a sexier girl or whatever it was...it didn't make any difference because I could still learn from him and I could still feel about him the way I felt. And I realized it's simpler (ph) that just, "Hey, is that a great feeling." Like I don't care, you know? I really, I just didn't care that he, after a while, but...the first thing that came up, because he was like, he reminded me of my grandfather, being as old as he was and being like full of love and...of exuding it like all over the place. And I guess I felt that way because, not because...of him as a man, but I realized this it's like, my grandfather's attention was of his love and that was lots for me, you know. Because I ended up, ended at that night when we were talking about fellows, and...like my girlfriend saying that I really couldn't attract all fellows. I started crying because I wasn't that great...as far as the fellows go, and I ended up crying for my grandfather. You know so it was like what I'm looking for. And then I realized this afterward too, which was nice because my girlfriend said, "You might only have a couple of meaningful fellows in your life." And then I said to myself, "Well you know that might be true or maybe I'll just have one at a time. So what. So I only have one boyfriend and she's got six...hanging from the rafters all over the place, taking her to all these fancy places. Maybe I won't have a fellow to do that but so what!" Like I need an object in a way to give that love to that I had with my grandfather, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:04:21.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I don't need six people or eight people or ten people that all care about me at the same time. I only need one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm hearing like you want to find out something about what you need or what... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I realized that with my needs I don't, in fact, I don't like having three or four boyfriends. I had it at one time, four fellows going out...trying to keep one straight and make sure that your little sister doesn't open her big mouth and call somebody by the wrong name and all this bologna and I just, it's not worth it, because like maybe out of that four I like one or two. So why date all these fellows if you don't really care for them, just because they're taking you out and they like you, you know? So I said I would much rather have like a give and take, like I had with my grandfather, with one man at a time. Whether I stay with the same man for a long time or whether it's just...like one boyfriend after another boyfriend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be like that and so that came to this realization and then it didn't bother me anymore. Because...like why do you need everybody falling all over you if that's not your need? It's not my need you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although it still seems like it would be kind of cool or something just because... [overlapping voices at 0:05:24.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well...because I had... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you could still pretend to be the center of attention or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is the thing. That's hitting it right on the head because like I've noticed that, like I like that idea of when my girlfriend walks in like everybody's just... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...mills around her. And like when I'll go into some place, well people will talk to me...but it's not like, I might have two or three people even that will sit and talk to me all night and I'll talk to them all night, but it's not like the whole room practically gravitates towards me, you know. So like for a while this really bothered me but now, like I've gone to parties and I will try to get into the group in there and I just can't get into it because like nine-tenths of them I don't want to be with anyway. So then I'll actually, usually find somebody that I can gravitate towards and then we get along. But so what? So I get like what I would call the cream of my crop...that I can just sit with. And so maybe I don't have lots of people around but so what, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You find the people that you care about and that you respect... [inaudible at 0:06:19.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And it ends up that we usually...that we usually get attracted to each other or like there might be three or four of us...sitting there. And so this is the way I felt like last night finally, because it was like three or four people that all knew this couple that I just met. I mean they knew them already first of all, and so they were calling me like... [inaudible at 0:06:36.4] ...calling me the... [inaudible] "And whose the other girl?" "Oh, the other girl, who me?" (chuckling) You know, but it was funny. And then - oh something else that was funny too, because I was really proud of myself. I didn't make any airs (ph) about it. They go, "Oh, the intellectual group is here." And they said - and I guess he's the editor and I said - oh and the girl's a psychologist, she's in - what does she do? She works with ABC Mothers but she has a degree in psychology. She's not really a psychologist, I think she's got her doctorate. But anyway...it's so funny because they go, "Oh, she's a psychologist." And one going, "Oh, my God. And what do you do?" I said, "Oh, I'm the come along..." That...I come along. (chuckling) And so they just like to have me because... [inaudible at 0:07:15.9] For once I came out and said I didn't....try, I didn't go, "Uh-oh. Well I'm just a secretary." Or, "Uh-oh..." I just played a joke on them because like I didn't care. I wasn't going to say I was an intellectual... [inaudible at 0:07:25.1] So what. But it was really funny because like they just kind of looked at me funny. (chuckling) But we had, it was really so good that I can get like this now with people that I could never do before, and like a give and take, a perfect threesome... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:07:40.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...with no trying to get the fellow away from her, and the whole bologna is just gone...at least with these people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it won't be all the time. I mean I shouldn't say that all the time, I should say that it might be harder...in other instances. Maybe it's because like he's not really the sexiest guy in the world to me either, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you're... </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it wouldn't make any difference before, you know. Before maybe I couldn't stand the fellow but I would still go...good...fellow, fellow, male, and it was really pretty bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like you're feeling kind of settled and solid and comfortable in this new way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I often, I look at it and I think it just looks so funny because here I am, I'm a girl. If it was an extra fellow it's not quite so bad. But usually when you think of a married couple and then another girl, and I've thought about that but boy, and we get along so well. And like there's no problem in that area, you know? And I go, "Wow!" (chuckling) You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going so well it surprises you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I would never think, partly because of the way I was unconsciously, and partly because living with my sister. And my girlfriend and I talked this over and she said, "I really think better (ph) that you will see a time that you were almost trying to flirt with your brother-in-law...because you wanted a man to pay attention to you, things like this." Maybe not even in a sex way but just like in a way that could be taken as that way, you know? And so I realized I guess I had...I was looking for attention from the man. But like now it's funny, like now I can just objectively tear down with people as people...not like he's a man and because I like to work as a man. But like I'll say things like - James is a little bit more, he's a little bit more giving of himself or, and he's a little bit more concerned with people in general. Whereas this Cheryl girl is just a little bit more concerned with herself. I mean we're all concerned with people but in...just sitting down and I evaluate them as friends. So it's such, I might even say that he's nicer in certain ways because he's more giving. But then she's less, she's very interesting in her own ways and she shares in that way...like shares experiences and shares things like with us. And it's really nice because, like I can just sit down, I can evaluate them as people and as friends and as what they have to give, and then I try to see what I have to give to...back. But evidently I must have something because we're still going out...they always ask me. "Oh come on, you got to go out for coffee at least or something." And it's like... [0:10:08.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's sort of easy and free, instead of always being on the edge of your chair... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...waiting to see if someone likes you or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. And always wondering, not wondering so much like if you've got a reaction that was bad like or not bad but like in an affront of some kind or like you see that you're stepping on some...un-solid ground for that person, and that you can just, now I can kind of receive it a little bit. And then I can, when I see it I try to correct it. I try to think back, "Now what did I say?" And judging from what I know of their background, what could that have...and then maybe rephrase what I said so it wasn't taken... - So like lots of times I say things that I don't think in the way they're taken generally, maybe not just by this person but like generally speaking - it's taken the wrong way and you think, "Oh my God...you're so stupid, why did you say that?" And we were talking about that because I wrote this story for an amateur thing, contest, and I said that at least when you do it when you're talking - this is one of the reasons I don't write very often in letters to people that I care about. And it's like because I have a hard time putting down on paper my exact thoughts. And like you can't be there to read that letter with somebody and like if they read it and they come out with something, like a terrible reaction, you may never hear from them again (chuckling) because you said something in the letter that didn't go, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I always think that, that that's one of the reasons I have a problem with writing because I can't express my ideas, sometimes even talking, but you can change it when you're talking. You can't do that when you're...writing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess you're beginning to be really aware of other people and their reactions, instead of being caught up in yourself and worrying about what they're going to think of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well this, yeah, that was a big step for me because it was always the thing, I'm always worried that they're going to reject me and they're going to take their love back and they're going to do this and they're going to do that. But if you're worried more about them, I found this out too. Like last night I found myself just a little bit going back into this, like the playacting, like maybe if I act more interested he'll pay more attention to me. (chuckling) You know or some stupid thing like this and I said to myself, "You probably look like a complete ass because...like what's the big deal? So what?" And then I thought again, like I remember someone, a teacher, telling me this, "That once a teacher..." Because he was talking basically on Aikido and things like this. "And once a teacher has a person's attention and he knows it and he doesn't have to work for that person's attention, he's going to work for someone else's attention more. That doesn't mean that he doesn't care about that person that's listening, it just means that he's got to work to get the other person and keep the other person interested because the other person tends to wonder." You know, and then I think it might not have anything to do with liking or disliking, and even if it does what's the difference? You're still learning, he's still good, he's still got love and you can still love him, whether he...gives it back or not. So what, he's your teacher. And it was really funny because like I came to that conclusion and just, "Holy cow!" Because it's just like a whole new thing, that I don't, I might feel it starting to rise up but then I figure out why, and it is because I think of him like, because he's lots older, as this grandfather who had all this love that...he just exuded for me especially, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you'd really like to have that back? [0:13:22.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well that's very true because I realized that when I, the big thing, I didn't really care so much about not having all those fellows...like falling all over me, but it was a big thing, like then I was crying for my grandfather because I wanted that special kind of love that you can have only with like very, very few people, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so what's the difference? We have all these other peripheral friends, okay...or whatever you want to call them, acquaintances, that's fine. But why have oodles and oodles of people that just kind of like bug you after a while? Because my girlfriend says that after a while she just gets bugged, because like lots of fellows especially dig her. And she says, "I have no interest in them and I don't want to hurt them because they're nice people." So... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess you're thinking that's not the way life works or something. You really only do have a few people who mean something to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me, for my personal...benefit. And like it may be for her this is a need or maybe for her it just is something inborn in her that lots of people come to her, especially fellows, mostly fellows, you know. And so, all right that's her thing, she's got it. I don't have it. I have something else. That I have like something that I like to, when I get a relationship I like it to be pretty permanent. It's not like, like she said and I agree, that there are, like especially with fellows, like I'll go up levels and I'll just drop fellows, and I tend to do that a little bit with friends but not so much. This is probably why I usually end up with older people now as friends and people who are already established, because like I can't relate to young girls my age. They act like kids, 21-year-old, 20-year-olds. And I just, "Ooh." I have one friend at work whose 20, I think she's 24 or 25, and this is about it...like older girls. Younger girls just, I go, "Oh, my God...oh! I can't spend five minutes in the same room." But it's like I understand this and I understand like lots of people won't like me because I don't get along with everybody, and there's not like everybody I care to get along with, but then so what, you know. And so you just, it's just so great because I just come to these conclusions and like I don't care when I walk in some place now. And even if I think, like I thought this one fellow was really sharp looking last night but I think he was eyeing this other girl. I didn't care. You know one time it would've been like, "Boy, I think I'll go stand on my head for a while, maybe he'll look at me." (chuckling) I just didn't care. In fact I got mad at him because I had to work out with him and he wouldn't resist. He was supposed to resist and he just let me do it. "For gosh sakes, will you resist?" And he went, "Oh, okay." (chuckling) You know because it was like, I was saying, "Like we're here to help each other more or less...and it doesn't make any difference that I'm a girl, you've got to learn to work with weaker people too and you have to be able to help the weaker people." And more or less is what I was saying. It wasn't just like saying, like, "You know you got to do this because I want to do it!" You know? And so it was really good because then he kind of realized that, yeah, it's not going to help her any, it's not going to help anybody any. And a girl has to work out with a fellow to get stronger, you know. But it was so funny because like my girlfriend came up with the same too. She said, "He thinks he's so great." I said, "Yeah, I know. I know it stinks." First thing I thought was he was good looking. The second thing I though was, "Boy, he thinks he's something else." (chuckling) So it was so funny. But like again, at one time if I would've seen a good-looking fellow, especially a good-looking fellow, I'd be like, "Wow! Now if I can get him, this proves...that I'm a good-looking girl or this proves that I'm an attractive girl or this proves..." You know whatever it proved, it would prove it...like... [0:16:48.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm good enough, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're not trying to do that anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't care, you know. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you've gone through so many changes and they're just...whipping past you practically... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you're feeling really good and solid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think there's, I think they are solid. It's just like, I guess I can't realize it. Because like my girlfriend says, "You still have a hangup on men." I said, "Well yeah, I know I got to work that out a little bit." But I said, "It's just that..." It's so funny because like at one time I felt like, oh, I was practically ready to commit suicide and the whole bit, because...it was like I felt so unhappy. But I don't have that unhappiness anymore. I do get like affronted sometimes when like I don't feel like she's seeing the progress in me. Like the other night she said something about - now I don't know what she meant by this - but she said, "You have to leave people behind you...constantly, if you're growing faster than they are." And the first thing, again, that I thought, because see I'm still a little bit paranoid...the first thing I thought was, "Oh Jesus, she must have gone through some more changes quicker than I did and so now she doesn't care for me anymore. She likes Eliza better or she maybe doesn't like me at all." And then I'm wondering whether, well maybe she means that Eliza is improving faster than I am, because we were used to being about the same level. I don't know. I don't see her that often anymore. But like I've been asking her to go out for lunch. I would take her out to lunch. And I've been asking her and asking her. She's busy this day. She's busy that day. She didn't go to meditation for three or four weeks. I was supposed to meet her and take her out. And I thought, "Well this sounds like what she's doing is she's avoiding me. She doesn't really want to be...like I'm not that stupid. When you've asked somebody out like six times and they don't want to, they always have an excuse." They're busy or they...they can't make it that day or, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe she thinks you've gone through too many changes for her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so. I don't know, maybe. She's got a big hangup with her mother and it's evident that her mother's got her under her thumb. But like she, well she never really did have a hangup with men. She just had a hangup with being kind of hard and then she worked it out herself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the point is like...you sit and go round and round in your head forever unless you really check it out and find out... [overlapping voices at 0:18:47.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I, that's what I'm going to have to do, just come right out and say, "Hey, like what did you mean by that?" Because I know she doesn't just say something to say it...it either means like, it could have to do with me and Jim, too. It could be Jim...isn't changing fast enough and, but he's not going to be in for a couple of months so why bring it up now, bring it up right before he comes in? This is why I figured that this was not logically the reason and what it is? (chuckling) You know, like what's the big deal? What are you trying to say? Come out and say it so I won't be going around in circles. Because like I can get an insinuation but when it can be taken four different ways, you can take it any way of the four ways. You know, like how do you know exactly what the person means? So I'll just have to come out and say it because it really kind of bothers me, it keeps coming back. Like just what did she mean by that? You know? And yet she says things like, just last week she says, "Well like when you come down to South America with us to teach for a year..." So it's like...and then she says like, afterwards this friend said that he's done stuff for her, she's done stuff for him, and when she goes away he'll write to her and everything. They'll still be friends even though she's not in the city, which was insinuating - don't feel like because...I guess maybe because I'm getting new friends now, she feels like I'm trying to replace them because they're leaving...and it's not that. It's just that, well like...I do work two nights a week and then I go running two nights a week. So I'm home Monday and she goes to aerobics on Monday, so we don't see each other very much, you know. And it's like, to me it's nicer. I really do like it, because then you have like a discussion on Saturday and maybe another one on Sunday and that's fine, because then it's like two strangers that haven't seen each other for a while and you can sit down and you can talk for hours. But when you're with each other every night, you just, what can you say? You know, "I went to work today and I typed 80 words a minute today. Isn't that great?" (chuckling) You know, she does something. "Oh yes, one of the kids got snotty." You know, well...like what can you do? What can you say back and forth when almost everything of your relationship has been brought out? I mean sometimes you think it has gone and that's fine or you've gone some place with fantastic people, but I can sum that up in ten minutes. I don't have to sit and talk for two hours, you know. So I don't know. It's just a funny thing that I'm getting to that point where, as much as I care about her and Eliza, that I don't want to be that close to just two people all the time. You know and I hope that, I guess maybe I should explain that to her too, because maybe she thinks that, that we're being replaced girls, you know. (chuckling) But I never, as a matter of fact that just came up, I didn't think of that before. Yeah. Sometimes I let some things go passed...right over the head. (chuckling) Two months later I realize what I said or did and...how it was taken but I don't know. (chuckling) This is funny. I can't think of anything to say for a change. (chuckling) I usually sit and talk and talk and talk. I don't know. It just, I feel like, in fact you know what I was thinking of saying after I had left there was? Then the next time anyone says what I do I'll say, "I'm an explorer of life." (chuckling) You know, because that's the way I feel right now, like life is becoming a big exploration. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do but - it's so funny because like at one time I would've been so uptight because I didn't know what I was going to do. [0:22:00.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now I say, "Well...I'm at that stage where I am now, so what? Like I'm open to suggestions?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [overlapping voices at 0:22:07.3] ...really big world and kind of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...have lots of exciting things in it that you may do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And...we were talking about that too and talking about the world as a place. And this is why Jim got me so angry one day and I finally came out and told him. I realized when I'd come home I'd be very depressed because all he talked about was all the bad things that were in the world, everything that was bad. And it's like I know there's lots of rotten things. I mean...when you pick up a paper and we see how many things go on and how rotten people are to other people, but not everybody's like that, you know. And so it's like if you're going to temper it or if you're going to say something - this is always my big argument. People say you don't have to have a solution to criticize. But I say in order to criticize something you have to know of something better. Because if you don't know of anything better, how can you possible say - it would be like saying you can't have a two-party system. Okay. Well, all right, because maybe it's not really democratic and you go on and on and on. Well then what's the solution? Well of course to have a three-party system in order to get more people in. But...like if you just come out and criticize and criticize and don't say anything constructive to replace it, then I say well then why can't...like I say maybe that's your opinion, it's rotten. But first of all how do you really reach me? Because all you're doing is saying it's rotten, it's rotten, it's rotten. But if there's no way out of it, it's like saying - I can't really explain it. It's like saying I'm in a rut. I'm in a rut. I'm in a rut. Well why don't you take another job? Well I can't take another job. You know? You say well why? Well I just can't...or I don't want to or I don't want to look or some stupid...question or answer like that. And so...like I felt that way. So it was like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess you don't want to feel stopped by him. His thinking you're... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...if you're...just squashed and you want to be free.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I got a little too free though for a while. This was funny, like in the office, like I got to the point where I realized my ability and I realized my ability was not all that further down from my boss. It was little things like when I would get something right. I would kind of get angry because when he was wrong, this is one thing that I don't like about him and I don't think he's as manly as my other boss, because my other boss, if he made a mistake would just come out and say, "Look, I made a mistake. I'm sorry. You know we could do this over, we can..." Whatever, you know? This one will say like, "Well even God can make a mistake." And all these crazy, idiotic...type things. And so I got to the point where rather than being still in my position, which is only a secretary and I shouldn't overstep it, I would find fault as much as I could. And like if I was wrong, I just said, "Well." You know? I do the same thing more or less say, "Well, nobody's perfect." And then this would get him angered because I was trying to overstep my bounds and get on like an equal level with him and I'm not, as far as society goes, as far as the business structure goes. (chuckling) So it's so funny because I finally came to that conclusion, so I stopped doing this. This was, I started doing it, just like maybe a week ago it started getting worse, and then I like the other day I just stopped it. And then like everything was like 'sir'...and he went (chuckling) you know. [0:25:11.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "What happened to you?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. (both chuckling) "What's going on here?" He didn't know. Because he never knows what's happening. I'm going through so many changes...like for a while he was always pawing me, now he doesn't. He goes this to me, I go, "Watch it!" "Oh, okay." And like he never did it again. Like he went to go, he used to slap me on the rear-end and things like this and it used to kind of bug me, but I needed him at the same time, so like I didn't care. Now, (making noise). He took me out to dinner the other night because we were working late and I said, "Could I have a glass of wine?" "Yeah, sure." I got a glass of wine, the whole bit, (chuckling) a big dinner. And then he had to leave because he had to go to the train, so he went to touch my arm like this. I shook his hand and said, "Thank you very much for the dinner." And it's so funny because he used always try to kiss me and the whole bologna, you know. So I was just, "Thank you very much for the dinner and I hope you have, be careful going home." Like get lost I'm enjoying my wine, you know. (chuckling) It was so funny. Because it's just like that, I feel like that now. I can do that with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have to rely so much on him for anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. And like he used to give me this big bologna that he saved me from being fired and I know darn well he didn't save me. It was because I was a better secretary than the other one, who maybe had more seniority but she was a rotten secretary. So...he gave me that story and my girlfriend clued me in on this because lots of Jewish men play this trick if they want to get to somebody...they play these little games. So I don't care and it's so funny. (chuckling) And like with his clients, too. And this is one reason I kind of feel like I'm not really so unattractive, because like I would say the majority of his clients, they come in, always compliment him on me, and like one of them said that he wanted - I said, guess I said, "Do you want, does Mr. ..." - whatever his name was, Mr. Czarski - "...is he going to take anything with him or does he want to take any of this, anything with him?" And as I walked out of the room he said to my boss, "Yeah, her." (chuckling) So when I came back he said, he would, he was going, my boss was going to tell me. "You know what he said?" "No, Brian please don't. Don't, don't." So he told me later on that that's what he said. (chuckling) So it was like...like this was just sort of like, maybe it is a reassurance, but it's like I realize this now. Like people in the office in that lots of the fellows come up to me first and they want to talk and things like this. And so it's like I do attract like maybe almost, a good percentage of people. And if I, like most of the time I'm very happy with myself. Like most of the time now with the fellows, it's me turning them off, saying, "Oh, come on...I'll talk to you for a few minutes if I can talk to you, then that's it." You know like don't try pawing me like at a party or something where they have office people. "Don't try pawing me." Like that's, if you want to go out with a girl and you want to have an affair or whatever you want to do with her, you don't do it in front of everybody else she works with and she doesn't do it in front of everybody else she works with. And it's just like that's things that don't mix. (chuckling) But... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're able to say to them, [to all of them... ] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's the important thing. [0:28:05.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and it doesn't bother me and it used to. Even though at one time, like one fellow I used to talk to in the office, and I really thought he was a nice guy and there might be something there eventually...like we might start dating or something, one party and the first thing I said was, I was kidding with him and I said, "Are you, did you say you were a Leo?" And he said, "Yes." I said, "Hey, you know something? Leos and Geminis are supposed to get along." And I didn't say...like they're supposed to get married or they're supposed to get...involved. All I said was they're supposed to get a long, you know? And then I was going to follow-up by saying, "How come we never get along?" You know because it was like we were always, we were always disagreeing, not fight but we'd disagree on things. So he went into this, "Well baby we can get like..." And I said, "Oh, come on." (making noise) (chuckling) And I got up and I walked away from him and he just went (making noise), and he went over to one of the other little girls that would do...this bit with him, and so it was so great because I could see that. And that was the party I ended at four o'clock in the morning talking to two people in the kitchen (chuckling) and playing volleyball with balloons. We were really having fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckling) But it's like you're just not going to put up with stuff that you don't care about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right, and even if it means like for months I'll have to sit at home. My one girlfriend sat at home she said for about three months. Because there was nobody that she came into contact with she wanted to go out with. And so that's what I said, I said, "Ghee." You know I used to go out with all these jerks and I still, I just wrapped one about two weeks ago that I had gone out with and was just so ah, so much work just to keep...trying to make the other person happy. You know like I try to give now and like oh, it was just like by the end of the evening I was, "Ooh!" (chuckling) You know, completely exhausted and a nervous wreck at the same time. So, I decided like it's not worth it. You go out to have fun and if the other person is compatible with you, you'll both have fun. If not, then one person doesn't or both people don't and it's stupid to go out, and then you're...[not going with romantic] (ph) [0:29:55.2] thoughts, for that reason. But it's really nice that...like I can feel this now. That it's not like I constantly use other people as a comparison and other people's, completely relying on other people's reactions. Because when you do, then like sometimes even, this was even like three months ago or two or three months ago, in the aerobics... [inaudible at 0:30:20.8] ...aerobics gym, and like the two instructors were talking to me and we had a real nice conversation going back and forth. All of the sudden I realized and then there was like another fellow came in, all of the sudden I realized there were three fellows there and I was the only other person...the other, well maybe there was another girl but like they weren't talking to her, she was just coming in and she was ready to leave and like nobody was really including her. And I sat there with three fellows talking to me and I became conscious of it, you know. It was like as soon as I did I played a Jodie one. I found myself doing it. It was like I had to come out with smart little, cute remark and the whole bologna. And like when I do it, it comes out either looking ridiculous or sarcastic, one of the two, and I don't know which is worse, you know. (chuckling) But it's like, and I realized I was doing it afterwards but like I just, I really couldn't control it at the time, even then. I just...like I'd say it, like I'd panic. It was like another panic inside like, "Oh, my God." And like when I went to say, tell my other instructor that I was quitting aerobics, one of the other girls, Eliza was there at the time when I came in, and she said she asked Jodie if I was on drugs. Because I still get scared when something like this happens. It's like I'll do it! But she said my voice was up like about three octaves and I was just...like really nervous and you could tell it. You could feel like this air of being really uptight. And I just didn't know what else to do because I was trying to figure out which way to tell him and so that it wouldn't sound, it would sound the best way, like...that 'it wasn't your teaching' and the whole bit. I don't know if it was more for me, because I was scared of what he might say or react to or whatever...or a rejection a little bit...fear he'd say like, "Well good for you. Get out of here because you're ungrateful!" And all this bologna, and then I would feel...like rejected or what. I don't know what it was. But it was just like a fear, a real fear, like I haven't felt. I'm usually pretty confident with people. [0:32:10.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sounds like it was all of those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it was like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to reject him and you didn't want to take the chance of having him to reject you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Reject me and oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and that was really an uptight kind of situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I had like a whole speech practically memorized before I got - I mean that's how bad it was. It wasn't just a natural thing like, "Hi, I'm quitting aerobics." You know like, that's all I would have to say. "It has nothing to do with your teaching. It's just that...this is not my art and my back bothers me sometimes with a hard fall." That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you were really afraid that he wouldn't understand... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what you were saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's it too. I was afraid that it, when the time I needed it most my communication wouldn't work, because I know it's happened before...or I'll sneak, I'll crawl into somebody else and use them or use their personality when I'm not confident in my own. And I haven't done that lately...like trying to be. But like I said, last night I did that just a little bit. It was like not putting on somebody else but like putting on almost, I mean...like, lets see now, maybe my face will look more interested...that type of thing. (chuckling) Like really I'm very interested. Now come on, throw it over here a little more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you could really feel the difference there, between when you're being yourself and when you're wearing somebody else?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right, but see it was one time I couldn't control it even...I mean I could. I suppose if I would have faced it. But like I wouldn't face it before, even that I was doing it. It would be like, I want them to like me so I would unconsciously, it wouldn't be consciously copy somebody else, but I would unconsciously crawl into somebody else who is liked by these people, you know? This is one reason I knew I had to get away from aerobics, because I was still - I don't know - but I might have been able to break away from it but it would've been a lot harder, you know. Now it's not so hard. Like...Chrissie and I goof around lots of times and people think we're sisters in the doing this to everybody, because well we do look a little bit alike in face, our facial structure and our build...we're built like pears (ph), like this you know, like this. (chuckling) It's so funny because we both have the same problem being happy. But...it's really nice and yet it kind of scared me just a little bit, but it didn't completely. Because James said, "You know you two are kind of like sisters. You copy off each other." But in that case it's not bad I don't think. If it's like, because I sat down with myself and I said, "Look, you do a certain amount of copying of another person, a little bit, you know?" I mean in order to crawl, if you crawl inside of somebody else and do everything the way they do, do everything they do and try to react to everybody the way they react, you're going to really get...messed up. But if it's a little bit, if it's like an idiosyncrasy that you might have picked up from somebody because they do it so predominantly...and you just unconsciously pick it up. I said it's almost like a little child learning how to talk or learning how to whatever, they pick up things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is how you learn.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We all share a learning inducing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Learn how to do a new thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A new thing, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [0:34:59.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like sometimes I will do that and she, but the thing is it goes back and forth. Like I write - I don't know what. - I've got some kind of a crazy expression and sometimes I can see we do, not exactly the same thing but like something of the same order. And I'll do the same thing with, I guess, something of hers. I don't realize exactly what it is now, until James brought it to our attention. But I have an idea we probably did do something...like interchange. But still it's like, it is still like a growth and it's not like I want to be Chrissie or Chrissie wants to be me. And for a long time, I know, I really wanted to be like Jodie, completely, you know. I wanted to have everything she had. I wanted to do everything she'd done. Because partly I think, because she was happy more than anything, and because people came to her. And I thought - see this is the misconception - I thought that this is the way it was supposed to be. If you were a really great person that everybody would like you. And this took me a long time, until we had a discussion too and then I thought about it. Well sure, it has nothing to do with your personality being bad or good. I mean if nobody likes you, if there's a point where like, people want to talk to you for five minutes and then they never come back, then there's got to be something wrong with you that you have to correct or something that you're lacking that you have to correct. But if you can get a certain amount of people that you can have as friends and that you can...like really relate to, and you can't relate to everybody, well so what, you know. Then it's just that you can't relate to everybody and that's it or everybody doesn't, isn't attracted to you, but so what, and you're not attracted to everybody else. You know? But I couldn't differentiate between being un-hung-up and free and...being happy and the whole bit and not having lots of people because this is what, for her, was the big thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it took me, yeah, it took me a long time to sit down with myself and realize that like...that's the way life is. You are what you are or you don't, you shouldn't even want to change it, except to improve what you have...not try to take on somebody else's...be a second-rate somebody, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like really to grow instead of just take on somebody else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And see this is probably why, I think, for a time I stunted my own growth because of that. Like I grew in a certain way but I didn't grow, I don't think, healthfully. Because it was constantly, and partly it was constantly, a constant frustration because I always knew that I could never be as good. And like I even told...Chrissie and James, I said like, "I live with a girl whose almost perfect." And I said, "And at times it bothers me." Even now it's a little bit frustrating. Because like she, everything you say you've done, she's done. And I write this short story and she's got a speech, I mean an award from the city of New York for the best speech in something, back in high school or something. You go, well, (chuckling) better in this area. And she's taken voice lessons, so her voice is better than mine when I go sing and I love to sing, you know. And things like, it seems like every area I go into she's better at already, you know? It's like you think to yourself - well this is one reason too, I wanted to switch from aerobics, because she was very good in aerobics and like again, I was comparing myself with her. And I said, "I don't need this." You know? So... [0:38:08.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You have to make your own time in your own way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's right. And plus which, actually it wasn't just her, it was apparently aerobics itself. Like it was getting too rough. It was getting too competitive. And I was finding myself competing with the person I was working with which is wrong. You know, at least...the basic philosophy says you don't, you compete against yourself. But now in running I find myself doing that. I find myself competing against me. Not against somebody else, not against what they did and if their performance is better than mine or whatever else, but against - did I do the best that I could do at this time? And then it's improving and it's polishing and then it's...remembering to put the key where it belongs, down here, not like...in the arms and try to be strong because that's not the way you do it. But it's like, it's like now I can say that I'm doing something that I am doing just competing with myself and not competing with either one of my girlfriends. You know like they're both in Yoga, they're both in aerobics, so that's their field...go ahead. I don't really have any particular interest in Yoga anymore as such. You know I mean the exercises I do and the meditation I do but on my own, not...not under somebody else and listening to what they say and everything, but just to sit down and meditate on your own and think about your own life and things. Like just get away for an hour or two by yourself. But, I don't know it's really funny, now that I've done that it's like saying I've broken into a whole new world and I never realized it was out there because I guess maybe I was a little bit scared to discover it for a long time. And it has gotten me to that point where now I'm starting to compete with me and nobody else. I know what my abilities are and like mentally I know approximately what my abilities are. I know I've got a good body physically for...working out and things like this, and that there's no...like there's no reason why I can't be the best person that...I was made to be, whatever that is. And it's just such a great realization to come to. "Look...I am different from you but then that's the beauty of it." You know like I am me and I don't want to change me anymore, which is - I mean I want to improve me but I don't want to change me...to be somebody else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, you really like what you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's all, when I came to that conclusion I just said, "Holy cow! You know here it's been all the time and like I never realized it was sitting there." And then all of the sudden you just come and like you say well...like so and so had this much - I used to make excuses for why I wasn't as good and things like this. Well so and so had more money or whatever. And I would say, "Well look, so and so went to college or whatever or went to nursing school or went to finishing school...whatever they did that I didn't." Well I did go through finishing school but say whatever they did that I didn't do. And I'd always blame it on, like they had money and things like this. And like now they are so much ahead of me only because of whatever. But I'd say, "I didn't just exist during that time. I learned too while they were learning. I was learning in a different area. I was learning about people." And now it seems it's so funny because like here I am 21 and I can use this if I want to compare again with other people my own age. I don't know too many 21-year-olds, even in college or even whatever, even if they were smart and they got out of college at 21...like I'm going to be 22, so...my age, that can talk and can relate to people that I can. And like I've never been through formal education. And I mean okay, so they don't use, if they had somebody there that, like my girlfriend, she said, "If I had someone there that majored in psychology I could use psychological terms." But she said, "I can break it down and put it in laymen's terms and get the same idea across...to somebody who hasn't been. And that doesn't mean that they are any less bright than I am or anything else, it's just that I know a technical thing." She said, "You can learn it too. All you do is get it and memorize it, that's all. Remember what the 'ises' are and all this thing...you take your Greek and your Roman endings and everything." She says, "You learn and you know what this is." But...I never realized that for a long time, that mostly people come out of college and things like this as that. They'll come out with, they know the technical terminology but not a heck of a lot of them can apply it. [0:42:24.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words you feel... [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I learned it backwards. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you have kind of an underlying ability or skill or understanding of what it's all about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Whereas they don't seem, lots of people don't get down to the basic. They can spout and they can spout what somebody else has or somebody else has done but they don't get to the basic of exactly what that meaning was of what that person did or why they did it. You know and it's like my teacher in reading, she was all excited the other week because she said, "You got it! You got the basic of the story. I had doctors in here and nobody's, mostly men but some of the women too, they couldn't get this thing." They couldn't get the basic of the story. And she said, "I was so happy because you got it. You hit it right on the head, exactly what the guy was trying to say." After we had started talking...because then like the questions, I had to answer questions afterwards, and the questions sort of build on one another so that, like if I wouldn't have done this I probably wouldn't have gotten that out of the reading...but like with the questions you have to think about it. And once you think, if you can think at all, you'll come out with the answer or at least an answer...like some kind of a deep thought behind it. Like lots of people would just, they'd tell the story...and she said, "That's not what I want. I don't want you to tell the story. The story is down in black and white. I want you to tell me like what's in it, what's the basic of it." So it was really cute that she was just, "Oh! You got it!" She got all excited. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And like it's real exciting to you to be able to see what this basic thing is and then to understand that you got it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right. And that, but I think it's so funny because like I'm doing it backwards. Most people - I can't say most people, there are some people who really do learn to think in college. I'm not...downgrading it. But I'm saying like kids start sometimes at 18 and that they're out at 21 or 22 and they've got all the technical knowledge, and like maybe five years later they realize that what they learned back here has really got an application, you know. And like I learned the application or learned to apply things in my own life now, and so I think it will be like a lot easier when I do go to college, because once I learn it I'll be able to apply it to what I already know. And that's something that I really think now that I can say that this is something I've done. So it's not, I'm not really stupid or anything else or I'm not really ignorant because - I'm ignorant in the technical way in the...formal educational way but I'm not ignorant to the fact that, like if somebody tells me something it's not just something to be stored in the memory bank and thrown out the next time you're...with somebody, it's something to be digested and to figure out what they were exactly trying to say by that and what they meant by that and...things like this. And...like lots of people... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like you make it part of you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and then you really have that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And it's not, it's in my own way and in my own terms now. I mean it's not like...again, it's not like memorizing what somebody else says. 'So and so says this and that and the other thing, because of this and that and the other thing, so this and that and the other thing.' You know? And it's really kind of great because I realize that I have this ability, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like almost the same thing with people. Like you're the center of it. You're what's important. It gets taken in... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...you're not taking it on...you're... [overlapping voices at 0:45:38.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Right, right, right. And these are other things that are for me outside that are...coming in. Yeah, that's true. It's like, I think one of the things that really stuck with me and I can't really bring it verbatim, but like it's now growing in me more. And it was when, the time he told me it didn't make a lot of meaning or sense but it just stuck somehow in the back of my mind, and this was one of the Gurus that I had gone to [in fact] (ph) for meditations. And he said that there was an old philosopher and he was like a meditator, he was very deep and...with people. And he also went out and he worked with people...the poor and the things like this and then he went back and he meditated on life. And he had two sons - an ignorant old man, can't even write his name, ignorant old man - so they went out and they got, they learned like every language there was to learn at the time...in their, wherever they went to school, and they learned all about mathematics and they learned all about this and all about that. And they came back and all they did was that they handed him all these diplomas and said, "Look, I can do this and I am the best in this and I'm number one in my class in that and I did that. See how great I am?" And he looked up and he said, "So what does that make you?" Or something in that order. And...I thought to myself, they were doing what I do lots of times. I'll do something and I'll really do it as well as I can and then I'll go, "Am I okay now?" You know, like did I get it? Did I do something? And by asking somebody else's approval what you're saying is you don't really believe you have it at all. Here they are going to try and prove that they're the best in mathematics or the best in - so what. You know he just sits there. So he had reached, the guy catches this meanwhile...he knew what he was. He knew that he was...like something higher than just...like just a bookerds (ph), just whatever you want to call it, like a rock, he was higher, he was something that like, he was like a shadow of the God, you know. And it's like he had reached this, he was happy. Here they were coming back and they were going to show him up because they had all this formal education. And it was again, it was like saying but am I really something great because look what I did? You know and underlying that's what they were saying, so they didn't really believe it. And I thought, at the time I didn't understand the story really, and then all of the sudden it hit me. "Well you dummy, of course! You know that's exactly what they meant." And I thought well how much more important to be and like - I tried to explain this to my friend and he just, my friend Jim, "Get yourself to college." I said, "I'm going to college." "Well you should go full time. Forget that IQ and forget that other bologna. Take out a...loan. Get on campus and all." And I said, "Okay, okay, okay, yeah, all of it. All of it." And it's like I try and explain it to him and yet he'll turn around and say, "Ah, the educational system is so bad and so irrelevant and everything." I'm wondering, "Now wait a minute, hold it." (both chuckling) So now he admits, now he says I'm too old for it. I said, "Oh, okay. Now you're changing your mind because I hit you with something...like this." So it's like he says defensively, "Oh, no. I meant that when you were 19 or so." And I said, "Two years ago, all the sudden I'm an old lady?" (chuckling) He was... (mocking stuttering). (both chuckling) Oh but it's so funny to try to reach that guy. But...he could only do it because he really has got a lot of nice things in him, he really has. He's just so unhappy with him...but like you can't be that way with your parents or you can't feel that way like your brothers. Like you blame it completely on your parents and you blame this on your parents and you blame this on society, you blame everything and then you can say, "Now this is why I'm unhappy because society does this." It's like...but it's not society, it's what's inside you. And if you're happy, and if lots of people were happy, we wouldn't have such a rotten society, you know. Like they always say 'clean up your own backyard'...and like I don't think he ever realizes that...like it's him that's unhappy, not everybody else around him or at least like they don't make him unhappy. I should say, it's him that makes him unhappy. [0:49:33.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's really important.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There really are two parts to it but it's the way you think about yourself that makes the difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I kind of feel like that because we were discussing black people and why we - we really...like I used to always be saying, "Well it's because they were slaves." Like and this is why black people today are very [over there] (ph), but they're starting to get, like the younger people are starting to you know. But like some of the other ones wouldn't work for ten years, they'd walk off a job because they were very irresponsible. And we always traced this back because it was like, well oh, I didn't think I should have brought that argument up, I never thought of it. That they have like a matriarchal society and we have a patriarchal society. You know like the man is always the head and they have the woman as being the one they trace back and everything, she's always been the dominant one. I think that has a little bit to do with it, to the man being so irresponsible in that. I never, I didn't think to bring it in because we were talking about this and...like people who were, just talking about people in general, people who were being...pushed out. Like the Chinese too, they were like practically like slaves and yet look how they've gone. They don't think of themselves as being second rate or they're very courageous in certain areas and things like this. And they're not afraid and they move into business, you know. And why was it that with the black people, generally, that it was so hard, except for maybe just lately, there's like lots of leaders. And I never thought of it but I think it has a lot to do with that. That the man was never really the head of the household because of the slavery that they were...pushed apart, they were like mated, and this just went down and the man just became irresponsible. I didn't think of bringing that aspect into it but now it hits me, you know. But I don't know, anyway with Jim, he's really got a problem that I've got to try to solve or to help him solve. I can't solve it. He can only solve it. And I realize too, like I think - oh another thing she was telling me about too, I think. I have a friend, a black friend named Tanya, and she's going through all sorts of changes. She is very religious or at least I should say spiritual, not so much religious but spiritual, and this is what attracts me to her. But she's got lots of problems with like emotional things...like with her husband and this and that, and I realize she's really got an emotional problem. And, we were talking the other night and what, something that Jodie said made me think of her and my relationship with her exactly, like it was up until the last time I talked to her. It was like I'd call her and for two hours she'd be talking about...like her boyfriend and how she's going to get rid of him. Every time I talk to her and this is like every week and this is going on for a couple of months, she's going to break up with him. "I'm going to see him tonight. I'm going to tell him this is it. That's it." And I said, "Okay." (chuckling) You know. "Well I tried to but you know how he is and he talked me out of it." And all of this, come on, you know. And I finally came right out and told her, I said, "Look, if you really wanted to get rid of him you'd tell him, 'That's it and I don't care.' Don't give me the excuse you're afraid that he's going to be hurt...because you can do it in such a way that it's nice and he won't be hurt. Or he might be hurt but so what? You'd get hurt a lot more if your husband ever found out about it." You know I went on and on and on [and hinter] (ph) but I don't, I'm not qualified. And my girlfriend was talking about, like this one girl who used to listen to drug addicts and all this, who would call her up for hours and hours and hours and she thought she was sharing. We were talking about sharing. And she said that wasn't really sharing because like it was a need that was filling. She was being fulfilled for herself. You know like someone would be calling and telling her the problems and then she could feel like she was really needed, I mean she was really doing something. And she wasn't qualified to do anything...she was not trained in that area. How can you possibly help a drug addict when you don't know what you're doing, you know? So she realized that afterwards. And I realized that I was sort of like that with Nell. I would call her or she would call me and it was like she'd be telling me her problems, she'd be telling me her problems. I could tell her. And now she still says she's going to call him after I talked to her, like...and she keeps saying like, "I haven't seen him but he want's to meet me for lunch." And then she's like, "Oh, he can't make it for lunch, he'll make it for dinner." So last night I guess she went out to dinner with him. And you just, you go, "Oh, come on! If you wanted to break this thing off you'd up and break it off!" [0:53:36.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "You don't want to break it off. But at least admit it to yourself that you don't want to break the thing off. Because if you can say that then you can logically say, 'Look, either I, I know I either have to give him up or I have to go through that separation'." That she was thinking about... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because she is not getting along with Jack anyway, and get on out...do something, but make it positive. Don't be saying...like, 'I'll do it. I'll do it.' And then don't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's all I could tell her... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because that's as much as I know. I'm not trained. I just said...that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what's been really important for you, to face up to what it is and then do something about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And so she said, "Well yeah, I guess you're right you know." So then she said, "I was thinking about what you said." I don't know, like I said, I'm not trained. The only thing I can tell her is do that...face, be honest with yourself in other words. You know like I, because I know how hard it is for me to be honest with myself. You know like I said before, like I would get panicky being myself and I'd always try to pick on somebody else's - but I wouldn't say that or I wouldn't even admit to myself that I was doing it...it was just like, I would just have that feeling like, "Oh, maybe they're not going to like me. He's not going to like me. If I don't do something really fantastic they're not even going to bother with me. And look it, there's three men here, what am I going to do?" You know and I would get like panic stricken. And now I don't...like I don't care if there's two men or there's six girls and one man or...like what it is and I'm talking to somebody, it doesn't make any difference, you know? And it's just a great feeling to be able to do that now and I could never do that before. And like I guess now it's because, like when you learn something like that, and again, because it's like a new step for me. And it's just something that all of the sudden is there and you're going, "Oh! Dhu-uh!" (chuckling) It's like, it sounds like when you walk into one of these, like a casino down in, we went to Atlantic City, and I think I had that sort of the same feeling when I walked into the biggest casino there - I can't remember the name. But like this thing was just, you walked in and when you walk through these great big doors you see the whole thing because you're up a few steps, and it's just like, it's like you want to go like this, it's like overpowering. And this is just the way I feel about...like life opening up. It's just like, you know what I mean, like a little kid looking around, "Ooh, look at all the lights." You know? (both chuckling) And it's... [0:55:47.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thousands of slot machines.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (both chuckling) Oh, yeah. None of them pay though. (both chuckling) But it's just such a beautiful thing. But then when you've got it or that when you're getting it, you're starting...you're like, I still do this. I still expect other people to come along with me, and like see, Jim hasn't been through anything like this here. He'll do the same thing. "Well I don't know if there's any therapy down there and I don't know if there's this and I don't know if, I won't have time and I don't have the money and I don't..." You know, like a million and one excuses and what it comes right down to is he's scared probably, because he knows. If you make that many excuses I think you kind of know that there's something wrong, and that it might be nice to be happy...once in a while with yourself, (chuckling) and I think he kind of knows that. That he's very, he never really feels happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But I guess you want people to go through the same thing that you've been going through because it's been good for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this is the thing. See this is one of the reasons I kind of was afraid of therapy when I first started, because it was another thing that Jodie had gone through see. And like I said, "Well because she went through it doesn't mean that I'm going to get anything out of it." But like I think - I don't know - maybe I'm wrong. Like we're a little bit different and her mother also went and like...and I know people who are going into psychology are supposed to go through a certain amount of hours too and things like this. And like I say it's like all this is, is just like finding out a little bit what you are and...like try to figure out where your hangups that you have came from so that you can at least...like relate it to them. Like it was so funny because that was the first time that I would be thinking about one thing, like with the boys, the fellows, like they didn't all care for me and then go into, like it was really my grandfather. Like what I really wanted was a love I had with my grandfather that I didn't have anymore and that this is what I was looking for. It was like a special type of affection that's like I probably never will find again, you know. And so it's kind of silly to look for it but at least I know that this is what I was doing. And like a while ago I wouldn't know, I'd just be going, I would just feel like, I feel miserable but why I don't know, you know? And that's the worse thing in the world. It's like that's why I always feel sorry for like when people do something really rotten, like get a dog drunk or something, because the dog just does not know it's wrong. He knows he's feeling ridiculous and like he's falling all over and he gets scared. Like if he went to walk down the stairs or something he'd probably fall and break his neck...and it's like, it's the same way or like a little child just doesn't know. They don't know why they don't feel well...but they just don't because...like they've got a tummy ache or something...and it's the same difference. And I think to myself, it's so awful not to know. And then once you know it's still awful because like then you know you've had a loss...and you still...you understand it like. [0:58:37.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's better some how to have that... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and to see that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to know it. To, yeah, right, to know that there's something there. Like I don't really think that my big problem - like I always thought it was with my father because I was always that, "There was something there. I know there's something here with my father." I don't think so, so much, because like I think mostly it was like I didn't care about him because like he was never there. He never really was a father to miss. I was close to my mother, because like I can feel it now coming back. It seems like the last time went I was so happy because when I went to say goodbye to her I could feel myself wanting to cry, and like I never felt like that for like a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it wasn't like an emotional thing. Like my mother would sometimes cry when I left but like I couldn't. It was just like a very hard, "Okay, now I went to see her. Now I don't have to come back for a month, a year or so, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It feels to me like you're kind of summing up or something. Like trying to get ready to leave or trying to just outline in your mind all of these things that have happened to you or something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've thought about that. You know I've been thinking like, I thought maybe I'd have to go a lot longer you know? But like now, I've been thinking like just for the last couple of weeks, like I could keep going but, I'm growing right now so much and maybe there possibly is something else that has to come out yet. That I need help with getting out, you know? But like I find myself now thinking a lot on my own. I get by myself, and I'm by myself like an hour or two hours a day, and sometimes like when I'm filing in there I'm thinking about things and I'm - and like lots of times things will come to me then, just like they're coming to me now. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'll realize, I'll go, "Oh! That's why!" You know? And like I just feel like I don't...I almost feel like it's not necessary anymore. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but like this is the way I feel. Like I really feel like I'm getting to the point where now I can do most of it on my own, you know. And like it's not, I mean there's still things like you don't know. Like you do things wrong. Like I've done things wrong with protocol in the office and things like this but, just because I didn't know, that's ignorance. But like to me that's not going to come out anyway, it's not going to help anyway because I'm still going to be ignorant, you know. (chuckling) You don't learn anything, you just learn about yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you feel you can get this same kind of awareness on your own mostly, although it still feels a little shaky to you? [1:01:16.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's still a little shaky but like I say, I get, I feel a little more strongly about it like every week. That...like I feel like now, well no matter what my girlfriend says...like I'm still supposed to go through all these traumas and everything, but like I just don't feel like I'm going to because like I feel so much better. Like I don't, I haven't been stuffing myself for the last - I don't know - a few weeks I haven't felt like that. I mean I still have a good meal. Let's face it, I've always liked to eat. But it's not like I feel like I have to eat. I mean like when I said that, I think I said that about two or three weeks ago that when I leave here I eat. But I don't, I eat a full meal but not one so that I'm so stuffed I can't see straight. You know it's like I'm hungry (chuckling) because I'm running, I'm walking from...train stations and things like this and lots of times I don't eat breakfast. But, it's like and also the type of thing sometimes when I make a breakthrough and like I really feel a good breakthrough, not like, well about my grandfather. I was just so...I was so broken up, like that was it. Like...I didn't feel like eating. I didn't feel like doing anything. I mean I was going to bed because I was exhausted. But like sometimes I would come back and it would be almost like a celebration because like I found out something (both chuckling) that I didn't know before...and that or like I came to a conclusion that I really should have come to a long time ago but it just didn't come out...somehow it came out when I was talking out loud or something. I don't know what it is. That just sometimes in therapy things will come out that don't come out when I'm on my own. And, but now it's come to the point where, like I said when I came in, like there were things I was thinking about on the 'L' and I was putting things together and wondering why this person is so important and why I don't see it. Like I never saw what my girlfriend saw and should. She said, "Ah, he's such a great man. He just exudes qualities, and this and that, and he's so confident." And I went, "He's a nice guy." (chuckling) You know but like to me, this wasn't one of those people that really just went (making noise)...like that and yet the professor was and so was my instructor. And it's partly the age because he was an older, mellow, partly it was he was mellow. A mellow, deep, like a calm love you know. And it's like this is how my grandfather was. And so this is...this is the type of...thing that I look for because it's the type of love that I'm used to...that I learned when I was little. And like I think I'm sure my mother and I had something. I think my mother gave me lots of love when I was a baby because it sustained me through and I can come back to it now. The other thing is...I do have one problem, maybe it's just because I don't understand the word. But my girlfriend is trying to like, "Sometimes you don't understand what giving is." And...I'm going, "I try." You know like I'm always getting little presents and things but she says, "That's not complete giving." You know like this, that's a form I guess of a way of giving but it's not really giving. So...you try. You think like, "Well when you're in a depressed mood sometimes I try to cheer you up and things like that. To me that's giving." And doing little things like making sure the dishes are done and things like this when she's tired or sick or whatever or she's not home, and I think to me that's giving, that's sharing, that's being...but like she seems to want more. And like part of it I think she said something about, like sometimes you're tired and you shouldn't be, you should still be really willing to give and things like this. And like I don't know whether she means she thinks I should give up running and I should be home because she feels like talking at that time or it doesn't make any difference when she goes out four or five nights of the week, you know? [1:04:46.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [overlapping voices]... Well I see on my jacket (ph) it's time, so I have to fill out the thing but... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. But I just can't understand that. Maybe it's just because I don't understand the word 'giving'. Maybe I don't know how to give...really give, and that really just is one thing that really bugs me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe you don't do that right or maybe you don't know how or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm not really sure. I mean she did say one time that I didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sound unsure of what it is kind of. That... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what makes up giving?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well she said like, well lately and like with the cleaning, and then one day I told this fellow I couldn't go out until lots later because I had to clean. I didn't feel, I even came out and told her. She said, "Well that was the first time you ever thought of somebody like me. Not the first time but one of the first times you really thought of me first." And I said, "Look, I know you're going out tonight and you're going to bring people over. If you..." If she wasn't bringing people over I couldn't see the sense of cleaning and then going out because you've got all day Sunday that you can do it...if nobody was coming over. But of course when somebody comes over you don't want the house to look a mess for somebody else and you care about them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and so of course I said this, I said, "Of course I thought of that. I mean that's stupid not to think of that." But there are new things, like with my stepmother. You know when I went to see my real mother, I was out to see my stepmother and she lives...close to the hospital so. She said, she woke me up and she said, "Do you want to go to the hospital to see your mother?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "You're coming too, aren't you?" And I realized it's like, it really hit me because like now I don't think twice. It's just like, "Of course this is my mother and I want to share my mother with my other mother because...like I, in fact I especially I wouldn't want you guys to sit at home here...by your self because dad's got to take me and Judah wants to go along. Naturally, I definitely want you to come." But it's like at one time I wouldn't have asked, and if she had went along it would have been just because she was going along. You know and it was like, because I always wanted people to come to me...rather than taking the initiative sometimes and going to them. And I realized this, "Holy cow!" You know like it's something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It could have been big.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That I had never, I think I had learned it...because it's easy to come back now when I really want to. You know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like they say, if you couldn't give when you were little you can never probably ever give. But...I was trying to explain this to her, like this is a new thing for me, it's going to take a while to constantly be thinking about what the other person needs and everything, because it's hard to do. It's a lot of hard work... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...to be thinking about another person's needs all the time before yourself. So I said, "Well, okay." First I'm getting rid of my hangups and then, now I've got to get at the point where I'm...so it's hard... (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but it's coming I think. I hope. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Same time, same station. (chuckling) [1:07:50.0]</p>

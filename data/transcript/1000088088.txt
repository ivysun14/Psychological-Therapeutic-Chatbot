<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: 326-104 Number 7, 1970. Howdy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:34). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not too much. I am sorry I am late. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm going to get back to work. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Your thinking (inaudible at 0:54). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:55) today maybe two dollars - it's five dollars (inaudible at 1:02) six. (Inaudible at 1:07) dollars and (inaudible at 1:10). I haven't even got billed yet. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess you could (inaudible at 1:19) you shouldn't. You can ask downstairs. Did you move or something? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All right. Did you leave your forwarding address? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I gave the address to them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 1:33) bill the end of the month. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm sure they'll catch that. They have the worst magazines downstairs. I was reading Better Home & Garden. (Inaudible at 1:52) lots of recipes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Flower arranging and stuff like that. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I don't read that, just the recipes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you cook? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I haven't in a while. So (inaudible at 2:06) place that had a kitchen. It's easier to cook when you have a kitchen. [2:13 ]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I would think so. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't like to cook - cook... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You shaved your sideburns off. (Inaudible at 2:35). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I shaved those off too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 2:39). 

</p><p>PATIENT: But it came back. You know, I shaved it on Thursday. It was too grubby for the summer. It took (inaudible at 2:54). I (inaudible at 2:57) it go like that - much longer than that. I don't even know the best way to do it. I need to sit and - but that's weird (inaudible at 3:08) that long. (Inaudible at 3:11). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And cut (3:13). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess the easiest thing is to (inaudible 3:15). You know, (inaudible at 3:18) that you see in the...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of like... 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, no, no. There is three reasons. (Inaudible at 3:28) see the (inaudible at 3:30). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (Inaudible at 3:32). Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feel a little scared. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, one of those things where you (inaudible at 3:38). Well, you know how they work, where they clog up with hair right away. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you use some water and rinse it out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But it doesn't work because - I mean it works, you know, on this. Or on your legs or whatever, but it doesn't work on a beard that long because it's just completely clogged up with hair. So with a straight razor (inaudible at 4:02)? Right? [4:05]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: There would be no place for it to be clogged. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. So that's why (inaudible at 4:07) because the scissors is very (inaudible at 4:13). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hair clippers. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Hair clippers, yeah. I don't (inaudible at 4:16) that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because either that or probably a straight razor I don't have a problem with. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were sort of touchy needles, but straight razors don't bother you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I've thought about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You cut yourself. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was shelling oysters and mussels. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were what? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Shelling shellfish. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you that? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Open them up. You've never opened up a raw oyster (inaudible at 4:50)? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I - we don't - I think I did see what you open it up with. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just a knife. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's a real long knife. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sort of, yeah. That doesn't work right. I mean some of them are really hard because some of them are just really have strong muscles or whatever they have that keeps them really tight. So I do it wrong, I'm sure, because I sort of stand there like this. And if I miss, it goes (inaudible at 5:18). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 5:19). 

</p><p>PATIENT: That doesn't make (inaudible at 5:21) when blood came gushing out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: If you didn't even know the (inaudible at 5:29). 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I didn't even think. It wasn't that. It was just - I was really amazed, it kept flowing out. It was just doing it like this over the kitchen. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What (inaudible at 5:40) finger pains you had splattering. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Really it was crazy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You tell about...

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 5:46) something else. I mean just watching. I can't even watch it on TV, when they show the doctor (inaudible at 5:57) some kids. Yeah. Well, I do. I turn away. I just can't take it. My stomach just goes (inaudible at 6:04). Yeah, right. (Inaudible at 6:09). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'd have been queasy watching myself gush (inaudible at 6:15) too though. Even (inaudible at 6:17). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess I felt a little bit at one point where it just kept coming out. I started thinking, "Wow. This might be bad or something." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just a little like (inaudible at 6:30) might be good. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I started making me feel a little light-headed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A lot of blood's coming out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know about the blood process. That's just a matter of it was a deep cut. And I really couldn't tell exactly how deep it was. And as I began to see how deep it was, then it started to hurt. I put a band-aid on it and it stops hurting. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: One of the fancy kinds of band-aids? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No. It was really terrible. All there was in the house were these little teeny ones. You know, the real small ones that are always on the side that are stuck in the thing, because some of these (inaudible at 7:05) you know their (inaudible at 7:06) and I had three of them. It worked. Well, I stopped bleeding pretty quickly (inaudible at 7:14), anyways. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you ate the shellfish? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you shaved your sideburns - cut your sideburns. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I shaved it too. Well see, at first I started shaving it and a little bit came off and I (inaudible at 7:35) my whisker's thing is clogged up. And that I figured, well I'll cut it and then I'll shave it. Shave it and cut it, and shave it and cut it. It took about an hour or so. I figured (inaudible at 7:41) because (inaudible at 7:45). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have any other choice it sounds like. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 7:51) But anyway, I'm going to cut my hair too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How short are you going to cut it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not very short. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 7:58). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what to do. It's really crazy hair. I mean it's totally unmanageable - there is nothing - I don't know what to do with it. (Inaudible at 8:07) says I ought to do it - have a professional do it and get it shaved or something (inaudible at 8:12). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's it feel like? 

</p><p>PATIENT: It just feels like something that I sort of make - it just feels strange the idea of me going to get my hair cut at a fancy place. It just feels (inaudible at 8:34) and sort of (inaudible at 8:38) - not very natural. I mean that's the kind of thing that people waste lot money on, I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't really fit with how you feel about yourself. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like how I want it (inaudible at 8:57). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're saying you don't want to be one of those creepy guys that go swishing along. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Spend their dollars getting a hair cut. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And if it's done in one of these fancy beauty parlors or something, you get all fussed up or shaved or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Spend all of your money that way and then sneak out. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's not going to help much anyways, unless I do it regularly. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so you really can't just do a one shot thing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not sure (inaudible at 9:35). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you had to be prepared to keep going back. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure, but that's really what's going on (inaudible 9:49). Anyway, we'll see. I kind of think I cut it off before I go home. [9:59] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're going home? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometime. Probably, I don't know. I think I'll go some time in the fall (inaudible at 10:08). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How (inaudible at 10:14) were your parents there? 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 10:16). They haven't seen me since Easter. They don't even know where I'm living now. I really ought to tell them. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like from your last (inaudible at 10:28) you like it that way. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's just - yeah, that's (inaudible at 10:31). That doesn't really matter because they can get a hold of me (inaudible at 10:35) they want to. There's something (inaudible at 10:42). Well, it's nice (inaudible at 10:44) where nobody else knows where you are. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really private. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's really just independent (inaudible at 10:52). You know, (inaudible at 10:54). It's really weird. I get home, and I stay for seven days, and they never really say anything to me. We never say anything to each other. And then I leave and they'll say, "Leaving so soon?" 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You just really know what they'll be like? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You really know what it will be like...what it will feel like. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, just nothing goes on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like rituals or something? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, small rituals. It's easy enough. I don't feel uncomfortable. If my mother's around I'll talk to her. My father (inaudible at 11:42) introducing my father to what I'm doing. But it's hard because he (inaudible at 11:48) freaks out at the mention of drugs, and being a bum. He's happy sort of looking into (inaudible at 12:02) that (inaudible at 12:06) unwilling to just accept me for whatever I (inaudible at 12:10). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Accept whom? (Inaudible at 12:14) not paying that much attention to what you're doing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean I can pay attention, but just be (inaudible at 12:21) credit is (inaudible at 12:23). I've been trying the last few times, but (inaudible at 12:28) talk with him. Break it down (inaudible at 12:34). It's not very much love there anymore. Well, at least I don't feel loved. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like they're relatives, but you don't feel real warm towards him, and close. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't feel close at all. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And like you're choosing - if you had the choice, like your parents. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I guess not even my mother will accept me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that's an extra (inaudible at 13:14) or something? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I mean I was - it's hard to say what it would be like if it wasn't for my mother. It might be just as distant, but probably (inaudible at13:26). It's just sort of like an obligation rather than something you really want to do. You know, and it's comfortable. It's easy, but it's not (inaudible at 13:45). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 13:49). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I get a lot of reading done when I'm home, so that's okay. It's good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it's the being with them that's dulled and... [13:59] 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't even spend that much time with them there. We run out of things to say to each other. My mother is just worried about the other relatives and (inaudible at 14:12). And when are you going to get married? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're lucky if you're not a girl, she would be worried you were pregnant. 

</p><p>PATIENT: My sister. Yeah well, when are you going to get married? If you (inaudible at 14:31) a nice Catholic girl. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 14:36)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: That's right. My father is a bit deeper though. He's so intellectual. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But he really doesn't understand you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe he does, but he - communicating is (inaudible at 15:02). I mean I (inaudible at 15:06) myself. It must be hard to start not holding back after 30 (ph) years. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And it might not even be safe to say "I love you." 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I have a feeling it might not be that hard to say. I mean it might hurt him for a while. But his mind operates pretty well, I think, except for all the blocks he (inaudible at 15:36). Well, I (inaudible at 15:39). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you doing here what you want to do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Boy. Yeah, I think so. Except what I - what I - I don't really have any clear idea of what I want to do except in terms of goals. It's just kind of happening. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess I was thinking of, you know, you were telling me about trying to talk to your dad. And how there are so many things you really couldn't talk about with him. And (inaudible at 16:16) sort of hint around and getting to it a little bit and stuff. And that was what that made me think - and then I thought...

</p><p>PATIENT: One of those things I wouldn't talk about with you? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Or are you talking about what you (inaudible at 16:29)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm talking about what I want to talk about now. [16:33]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I can't think of anything I wouldn't want to talk about in the same way as I wouldn't want to with him. Because I know like with him it's just a matter of he has a very sort of strict moral code which if I introduce something - there are certain things that just...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Some thing or some person? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, thing that I do with my life that he just wouldn't approve, period. Because that isn't the kind of thing that a person who respects (inaudible at 17:01), and that's that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you have a different feeling about me (inaudible at 17:07)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I wouldn't hesitate (inaudible at 17:10). I mean I might not just bring up and tell you everything, but there - it just doesn't work the same way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't. You know, I'm just checking (inaudible at 17:25). 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, you're quite a bit more hip. You're more hip than he is. He's just bound by these strict things he says. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Caged. 

</p><p>PATIENT: And people should (inaudible at 17:44). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't give you enough room. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, in a sense he gives me room. In a sense he lets me do what I want (inaudible at 17:53). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I mean his thoughts and way of life, just crowd you - it would crowd if you took them on for yourself. [18:03]

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. But I never did it. But he doesn't seem too understanding. "I don't understand," he says, "why people do that. I just can't understand why people smoke marijuana." And that's that. That's the end of it. He doesn't want to. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And he's not saying, "Please, I'm trying to understand." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "Trying, tell me," (inaudible at 18:32). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, eventually he says, "Why?" We talk about the why. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But are you (inaudible at 18:37) when you say it like why - it's why, but in a not in a not listening sense. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not, "Hey. I want to know. Could you try and tell me again." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's more, "Why do they do that? Why? I know they don't do that for any sensible reasons." 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "And I'm not going to listen to the..."

</p><p>PATIENT: Why do they do it? It's frustrating (inaudible at 18:58). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's wrong with them that they do it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I think he could be broken down given (inaudible at 19:07). I mean what is actually breaking down some walls. So it's (inaudible at 19:20). He wants me to get married too. They all want me to get married, it's very important. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They can say their son's married. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Too bad I don't (inaudible at 19:36). Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And they (inaudible at 19:39). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 19:40) but a Ph.D., then I'll be married, and that's success. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ph.D. from New York, and look at he's married. And we're all waiting, you know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Soon enough - another ego trip - another baby for the family. [20:02]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not much (inaudible at 20:15). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Not right now. Boy it sure isn't. I don't think (inaudible at 20:23). Well, you know, I have. I just don't feel good about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it's just so out of touch with where you're at. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I think about marriage (inaudible at 20:37). I'm just not ready. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not to please your father. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I certainly wouldn't do it to do that. That's totally absurd. I mean that does - I would never do that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's good. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I didn't even do that - act that much to please them when I lived at home. Now I'm far away. I don't feel any guilt feelings about that. I don't think, maybe I do. Maybe deep down in there and I have that sort of feeling but...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you ought to be a straight doctor who is married, huh? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I - sometimes I (inaudible at 21:28), and it's just guilt feelings. There isn't really.... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that's all their crap. And it doesn't fit too well with you. And doesn't worry you to much (inaudible at 21:42) attract (inaudible at 21:44). So where are you stuck? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm stuck about doing things with the rest of my life, I'm stuck at. And I find myself doing this and not really liking it. And I don't - I'm...[22:00]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It might be scary. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't particularly know what to do. But occasionally it's scary, most of the time I just wipe out the scariness by just being numb about it, which doesn't do any good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess when I said it must be scary, is I can imagine if I was putting myself in your place. And if I were almost to a Ph.D. in an area and I didn't like doing it, oh god, I'd feel really uptight and scared. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't feel that scared. But that's maybe because I don't let myself feel that (inaudible at 22:38) rather than... 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you like to do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: What would I like to do? Boy, I don't know. I'm just not sure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're probably good (inaudible at 22:53) you could change your mind about, you know, back and forth. And you do lots of different things. If you had four months, let's say, what would you choose to do them? If you were free and didn't have to worry about money or whatever else. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How you were going to eat, and sleep, and screw, and stuff, what would you do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd go down South first, and I'd try to get a place near the ocean with a kitchen I could use. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would it be on the water, on a bluff, or...? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, close to the water anyway. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Could you see it from your house? 

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't much matter. It would be nice if I could, but that just doesn't matter that much. I could during the day - I could just to there and (inaudible at 22:45). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you could go sometimes to the beach? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh, all the time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All the time to the beach? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I really miss the beach because when I grew up I spent all my summers in the mountains. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: What did I do? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you do? [24:03]

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know what would I do. Well, I'd just start by going down to the beach and then just coming home. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would you do down at the beach? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd ride waves. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you'd be in the water, and...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd be in the water. And I'd be in the sand, lying there. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd be lying in the sand? It would be sunny? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was lying in the sand and in the water if it was sunny. If it wasn't sunny, I'd - I don't know. I guess I'd spend a few days at the ocean just walking around. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, how do you ride the waves? You jump over them at (inaudible at 24:36)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: You never ride the waves? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what you mean by riding. I don't know. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Surfing - body surfing sitting on a surfboard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then I guess I haven't. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's really good. What you do - well, you've seen pictures of people surfing. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But on a surfboard and they wait. And then the waves come, and then they ride it in. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Okay. They ride it in standing on the board. Okay, when he (inaudible at 25:00) right in line (inaudible at 25:02). You can just imagine that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, yeah. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Imagine (inaudible at 25:06). That's much easier. But you can also do it without the board. You don't need the board. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now...

</p><p>PATIENT: So essentially what you do is the wave - you go in the water and you get sort of how the wave starts to break, you're behind it, and you sort of swing along with it. So that when it breaks, you're right on top of it. Your shoulder sort of come riding down the crest of the wave, and you're sort of inside the wave and you're kicking just to keep your balance and keeping it straight. And it just carries you all the way in. It's an amazing feeling. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does it carry you all the way to the shore? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sure. If it's a good wave, depending on, you know, some waves peter out and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Splashy white stuff coming over you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're behind it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: You're not really behind it, you're sort of through it. You're sort of on top of it and your head is out in front of it the whole time. So you're moving at the same speed that the wave is. It is a little bit different from surfing. Surfing they ride underneath it and they don't actually ride on the crest. The crest sort of is up here. As it is splashing, they are riding in this trough down here, and you riding along with that. So when you ride - when you body surf - well, first of all, you couldn't do those waves, they're too big. You'd get killed. I think, maybe you could but I doubt it. But these waves sort of have a - you're just sort of in the actual foam, and you can see all around it. And you can (inaudible at 26:27) peeking out. It really, really feels good. [26:31] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if (inaudible at 26:34) I did would be in Lake Huron, sort of ducking down and when a wave came, hopping over it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Lake Huron is not (inaudible at 26:44). It's nothing like the ocean. It's so great. I usually get seasick. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: While body surfing or when (inaudible at 25:54)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, in a boat. It really was annoying because I was thinking it was in my head. And I just love the water so much too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Otherwise you could kind of enjoy being on a boat and being really close to (inaudible at 27:15). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 27:16). I went up North last month. And I am - I guess the first time I saw the ocean was something (inaudible at 27:25) in Seattle, which is like 400 miles south of Vancouver. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Of what? 

</p><p>PATIENT: South of Vancouver. It's on the coast. And it's a little fishing town. And (inaudible at 27:39) going down to the dock and smelling. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Fishy smelling. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. It smells (inaudible at 27:46). For 6 months, I don't know. I mean I - because 6 months is a long time to know what I'd do. It would be a challenge. It really would be. I wouldn't - I couldn't plan out 6 months (inaudible at 28:02). I would sort of have to go there and see what happens. [26:06]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I really meant what kinds of things would you like to do. (Inaudible at 28:09) You said one thing clear is being on an ocean - the Pacific Ocean. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, right now. I grew up on the Atlantic and I'd like to do that too. But I think right now I'd rather go down South. Anyway, for 6 months I'm not sure if I would have enough to do (inaudible at 28:29), because I don't read that much. (inaudible at 28:42). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you like to read some? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I might. When I do I enjoy it. I'd have to bring out the record player. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would it be a portable one? One that you could take to the ocean with you? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Just for the house. I don't need (inaudible at 29:06). I'd just watch the waves. I went body surfing last summer for the first (inaudible at 29:17). It was a cold day, and the water was cold. (Inaudible at 29:27) just like a little kid. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Listen to their loving the water regardless of the temperature, whether the water's (inaudible at 29:40). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I just love the beach. I mean (inaudible at 29:45). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Splashing. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 29:50). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 29:55). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I've got a pimple on my knee or something there. It hurts. [30:01]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought that you said people, and I thought, "Well, maybe you can (inaudible at 30:09)?" 

</p><p>PATIENT: Everybody's talking about that too (inaudible at 30:14). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Really? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think it (inaudible at 30:21) needles. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm not too interested. There is a piercing place up on the east side on Greenwich (ph) pass it on the way to the Mexican restaurant. I don't think I'd do it. It's really a - it's a pretty big commitment. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and have that god damn thing on you for a hell of a long time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You can put it on your **** or something where you wouldn't have to see it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's stupid. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think I'm going to do it. Well, I haven't really considered it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's just that I'm the surrogate, that's all. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 31:11). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I haven't taken a bath or a shower. I live in two different places and stuff, and no shower (inaudible at 31:25) bathroom to myself. So I promise my body (inaudible at 31:32). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How are we doing? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I was just wondering on how we were doing time wise. 

</p><p>PATIENT: We're doing all right. Probably do as (inaudible at 32:05) think of something to do that, I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sound like you can think of a few things for, you know, a very short period of time. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it's also very unrealistic (inaudible at 32:22). Well, maybe I don't have to make much. But I have to do something. Also I think I'd get bored not having (inaudible at 32:33) anything to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You (inaudible at 32:38) maybe need to try doing different things that you might like to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I definitely do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd get a sense of how much you'd like to do it and what else you'd like. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I might want to teach high school and (inaudible at 32:55) some place or other for a while. I mean not in the sense of going into the ghetto, which is really working with the kids (inaudible at 33:03) I could work with. Maybe, I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like something you'd try (inaudible at 33:12)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'd like writing a whole lot more too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Writing and maybe teaching some kids. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd like to be able to do more with my hands (inaudible at 33:34). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Building something? Models or...? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 33:40), like I've always - you know, I've always admired people who could put together things. Like I never did and my father never could or did, so never anything like that around the house like that for me to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it wasn't something that you were just brought up with. But, you (inaudible at 34:00) just be intrigued and feel like you'd like to be able to fix things, and create the little things, and be able to work. [34:10]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it certainly feels good watching other people do it. So I'm sure it would feel good to me too. But I (inaudible at 34:20) see what I'm doing (inaudible at 34:21). This guy I know is going to build himself a motorcycle out in Kansas (inaudible at 34:35) go up there (inaudible at 34:36) and help with that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You might get a sense then of what that felt like, wouldn't you? If you like it and that kind of stuff. Or whether you'd like...

</p><p>PATIENT: Just to learn things just to do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like how the hell do you put in a fuel injector? Or how do you (inaudible at 34:55). 

</p><p>PATIENT: How to do anything. You probably (inaudible at 35:00). So there is so many blanks when I think about what I want to do. I know whatever it comes down to is I'd like sort of a comfortable apartment some place or another, or a house. I'd like a house. But I don't really want to live in a condominium. And I'm sick of the city. I'm really sick of the city, but I really don't want to just go live in the woods either. I mean I'm just not ready for that at all - my whole personality. My whole body is very much in tune to city life. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you'd kind of like a house near the ocean if you could have it with a really decent kitchen. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it's just nice. A fireplace I guess (inaudible at 35:50). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A fireplace, a dishwasher, and (inaudible at 35:53). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess - yeah, I guess I would, with a decent kitchen. (Inaudible at 35:58) that much near a city so like north of Los Angeles. (Inaudible at 36:10). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a work room too, with tools in it? [36:15]

</p><p>PATIENT: Not me, I don't do anything. I got to be really (inaudible at 36:19) right now. (Inaudible at 36:22). I can't do anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so it would be like saying, I am a worker. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what to do with the goddamn stuff probably. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, I could never do that. I don't (inaudible at 36:37). It takes a while to learn how to do things. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Sure. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I know (inaudible at 36:48). Something I don't have any idea how to do anymore, just the idea that it's going to take so much time to learn how to do something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It may not take so much time to learn how to do a specific thing, but as you do them there is probably a lot of things you need to learn how to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's really more sort of a fear - mild fear and fear of being frustrated. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I am going to be able to do it (inaudible at 37:23). 

</p><p>PATIENT: And being in a state of being half-competent or semi-competent instead of doing your - you're spending your time doing it, but no one else is going to like what you've done. And you won't even like what you've done because it's so half-****. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's going to come out crummy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're going to be clumsy and...

</p><p>PATIENT: And then I'll have to - and then (inaudible at 37:45) I'll feel like I'm (inaudible at 37:47) in a way (inaudible at 37:48). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Something like wood cutter, you mean. [37:57]

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 37:58). So I never try it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it might be a good idea to go up and work on his bike. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think it would. Maybe I'll do it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How are you feeling? 

</p><p>PATIENT: How am I feeling? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, kind of waving your arm back and forth. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I mean I don't know what's that mean. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's a little bit scary the prospect of sitting at my house (inaudible at 38:40), because I don't really know what I want to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel like you have to know firmer what you want to do? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to teach school, or do you want to do something else, or move in to (inaudible at 39:01)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I can feel conflict too - conflict between wanting to be sort of free and not being tied down. And at the same time feeling I do need some direction - some security and firm commitments in order to keep me going. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You would be flopping around and bored or something. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then if you didn't have some kind of structure. But then on the other hand an everyday kind of structure (inaudible at 39:34) until then, and then that. And then the next thing seems cloudy (ph). 

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't feel guilty. (Inaudible at 39:41) I en joy not having - have to be somebody else's problem (inaudible at 39:48). Again, what I end up doing is blanking out and staying in New York. I don't like it. [40:13]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd stay here probably, and you don't like it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't mind it that much. But I think it's bad. I think it's harmful for me. But those are easy words to say. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you think of going  to Kansas, what's it feel like to be going up there for a weekend to have some fun and to maybe help build a little bit on the bike? 

</p><p>PATIENT: A little apprehensive. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Apprehensive? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I'm not sure how much fun it will be. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Suppose that you could leave if you didn't want to stay. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Up there you mean? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just real confused. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Feeling confused? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I'm not sure if I want to be up there with those people. I mean they're not real good friends. And I don't feel secure enough to just go up - to be alone with (inaudible at 41:14). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You need to be friendly and sociable (inaudible at 41:21)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if I have to be friendly and sociable. I just don't know if I - if I was liking the (inaudible at 41:27). I don't know, if I was alone (inaudible at 41:32). I would rather be back here at (inaudible at 41:43). Confused. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you (inaudible at 42:00)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: How? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you do? [42:05]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, by doing nothing I mean like he'd be working, I guess, on the weekend. So I can just do (inaudible at 42:12) or nothing, just sitting around. That's not really nothing (inaudible at 42:17). I shouldn't make it sound like that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you go fishing? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Hmm? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you go fishing from the pier or something? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't like to fish particularly. I don't mind sitting there doing nothing (inaudible at 42:42). I'm very - I'm very confused right now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know what is it? What's it like? Are you sitting around doing nothing now or are you doing something now? Like what do you call sitting and doing nothing? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Doing nothing is doing nothing, just not really accomplishing anything. I'm just passing time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you think about when you pass time? 

</p><p>PATIENT: What do I think about? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I (inaudible at 43:12) some times I don't think at all. Sometimes I'm being (inaudible at 43:14). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you do daydream about? 

</p><p>PATIENT: All kinds of things. (Inaudible at 43:19) people, things in the past, things in the future, things I want to do, teacher, (inaudible at 43:26). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 43:27)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Famous songs. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you're not doing nothing. You're sitting, and thinking, daydreaming, (inaudible at 43:41) how things are or would be. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Doing (inaudible at 43:46). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 43:50) what to do. Maybe you didn't call it doing nothing. That's doing something. [44:02]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean in a sense everything is doing something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then why (inaudible at 44:10) enjoying it? (Inaudible at 44:14) something that's fun. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I do enjoy it sometimes. I guess what I (inaudible at 44:29) myself (inaudible at 44:32). Or not about it, but just start feeling bad just about anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying...

</p><p>PATIENT: And also when I get done and nothing's been accomplished. I really haven't changed myself (inaudible at 44:46) unhappy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It was just a dream. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 44:55). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 45:00) I was going to ask you to pick one of the things you were unhappy about and want to talk about it or talk about one of the things you'd (inaudible at 45:09). 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 45:09) talk about anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, but the way you've got it defined is so huge that it's hard to do much with that I guess, or it's staggering the way you've got it, like you don't know what to do with your life. Well, like screaming, "Oh my god. I don't know what to do with my life." It's hard to do anything. But when you treat yourself nice and ask yourself what you like to do, then go ahead and do that, or whatever else seems reasonable. Then you can do something to chop away at the problem. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess what I feel like a totally separate (inaudible at 46:09). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 46:16). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Whenever I do anything I want (inaudible at 24:22). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 46:23). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Just felt really strange (inaudible at 46:27). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 46:31)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. No. I didn't feel tired. I feel a bit exhausted. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Exhausted, numb, and big. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Big, yeah. But I'm not tired. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 46:51). 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't (inaudible at 46:53) a lot. So I don't feel too good. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You feel pretty crummy? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 47:07) sort of crummy. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Real crummy. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible at 47:12) realizing that I just don't know what to do about (inaudible at 47:18) or anything, I'm going to do (inaudible at 47:20). I don't know. I don't know what to do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were saying...

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 47:31). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You were saying you'd like to work with your hands. What kinds of things would you feel like? I don't know if it's doing something with knives, like carving or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Building things. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: With wood, or clay, or...

</p><p>PATIENT: Wood. Yeah, wood. I mean building things not just pieces of art. I mean not building a statue, but building a desk. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You like to build (inaudible at 48:02)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'd like to be able to. I'd like to be able to do things like that. [48:06]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How would you build this? 

</p><p>PATIENT: How would I build it? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know how to build it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You know, I mean like there's a lot to do...

</p><p>PATIENT: Pick up some wood and...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you go to let's say one of those lumber yards and get a rejected door and use that, or...? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. I'd get lumber. Well, I'd have to think about how I'd want it to look. (Inaudible at 48:31) put it together. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How would you design it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Don't want to? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's fun to build things. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Maybe. I just would have to do things on my own (inaudible at 48:52) first. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 48:55)? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I would be embarrassed. I certainly would be right now (inaudible at 48:59) I have nothing in my mind at all. I don't feel very artistic. I never did get the right (inaudible at 49:13). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that artistic? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Is that artistic? That's a loaded question. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 49:29). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How did I load it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm supposed to say, well...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're supposed to only be honest. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it really doesn't mean anything to me, the question. I can't answer to be honest with you. I wouldn't call it artistic or un-artistic. I just don't feel very confident about my own ability to plan something out. And I'd be very worried about how other people would value it. [50:00] 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would I think? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. But if I didn't think it was any good, it wouldn't much matter what you said. Because if you said it was good, I wouldn't believe you. And if you said it was bad, I'd feel lousy. Either way (inaudible at 50:17). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You lose either way. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So again, I just have zero confidence in myself about (inaudible at 50:26) do anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it stops you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 50:30). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then I guess you'd have to hear what you were talking about. It's like you can think that, well, you (inaudible at 50:40) build a desk. But as soon as I say, "Hey, you got a piece of paper and pencil. How would you do it?" Even you can say it's a crummy idea, and throw it out, and not do anything. (Inaudible at 50:54) still feel so touchy about it, that you wouldn't really want to (inaudible at 50:59) start fighting, and then you cut yourself off. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, that's what happens. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 51:23) stop. What time did you have (inaudible at 51:57) coming in on Wednesday? 

</p><p>PATIENT: 4. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: 4? 

</p><p>PATIENT: I'll see you later.

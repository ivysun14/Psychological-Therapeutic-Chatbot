<p><b>Carlson: Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>The approach that I use is Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). REBT is the pioneering cognitive approach first presented to the psychological and general communities in the early 1950's, created by my husband Albert Ellis PhD. It heralded in the cognitive revolution in psychology, therapy and counseling. It is a most holistic approach, recognizing the interplay between our thoughts, emotions and behaviors. In addition to its highly active-directive and pragmatic nature, methods and techniques - it is recognized as the most philosophic of the cognitive approaches that followed it, which include Cognitive Therapy (CT), Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Positive Psychology and others. It asserts that it is not our circumstances which create our emotions, but our perceptions-of/beliefs-about those events which create the emotional responses. When we think in healthy rational ways we create appropriate healthy emotions in response to adverse and other circumstances; when we think in self-defeating irrational ways � we create unhealthy negative emotions. REBT teaches the differences between healthy and unhealthy thinking, and distinguishes between healthy negative emotions and unhealthy negative emotions. It reminds us that with awareness, and thinking about our thinking, we can learn to catch the irrational thoughts, rapidly and vigorously dispute them, and create effective new beliefs to replace them. The precision, strength and focus which REBT encourages us to exercise during the disputing phase also sets it apart from other cognitive approaches. REBT tells us that with awareness we have choice, and can live a life of minimizing suffering and maximizing joy, by creating healthy emotions, accepting any adverse circumstances we cannot change, and changing those we can. REBT emphasizes, more than any other approach in the field, the importance of adopting attitudes of unconditional acceptance � specifically U.S.A. - unconditional self acceptance; U.O.A. � unconditional other acceptance; and U.L.A. � unconditional life acceptance. REBT offers a variety of cognitive, behavioral and emotive techniques which facilitate healthy change, and an important part of REBT in the context of therapy or self-help is the doing of homework. REBT reminds us that the maintaining of beneficial change and healthy new habits requires ongoing effort and practice. More information about the REBT approach can be found in the book <b>Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy</b> (2011) by Albert Ellis and Debbie Joffe Ellis, which is one of the "Theories of Psychotherapy Series" Edited by Jon Calrson and Matt Englar-Carlson, published by APA. � and, furthermore, more information can be found in the 85 published books ( and over 1800 articles) by Albert Ellis PhD!</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: �Will you provide a brief description of your training and background?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>I am a licensed psychologist (Australia) and licensed mental health counselor (New York). I studied psychology at Melbourne University, and during that time Albert Ellis visited Australia to give lectures and workshops � I attended every one of them! I had already studied REBT (known as RET at that time � it became known as REBT in 1993) as part of my psychology course, loved it as it was compatible with my values and inclinations, and I knew from early on that it would be a significant part of my life � professionally and personally. I had no idea however that I would end up adoring and marrying its creator and founder!!! After my studies and licensure were completed I worked in private practice and also taught at the Australian College of Natural Medicine�using and teaching REBT in both. After I moved to New York, I worked with my husband in every aspect of his work � including research, writing, giving professional trainings, and giving presentations for professionals and members of the general public. My life now is dedicated to continue to present, teach, write about and use REBT with my clients. And to live it � incorporating its philosophy into my daily life.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>The client is a bright and energetic 35 year-old woman, a school counselor, who had undergone some years of psychoanalytic therapy. She had read about REBT in her studies, and was willing to try it to reduce the anxiety she experienced in her life. As a result of her anxiety, she would often have strong physical symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness and she wanted to put an end to such panic attacks. Prior to our sessions she held a number of misconceptions about the REBT approach, none of which she continued to believe following her REBT therapeutic experience.</i></p>

<p><i>These misconceptions included the notions that: (1) REBT is against looking at anything to do with one's childhood experience; (2) that REBT avoids the client having an emotional experience during therapy and discourages it; (3) that an REBT therapist can tend to be quite detached and does not necessarily show empathy; and (4) that REBT is about lessening emotional experience.</i></p>

<p><i>She came to see that these ideas were false, and people reading the transcripts will notice that: (1) we did take time to look at the way she had taken on some of the irrational beliefs she heard during her early years, in addition to behaviors modeled by family at that time, and we examined the ways she perpetuated them in her present and how they were affecting her current life; (2) that she was not discouraged from having experiences of emotions in sessions, and we at times explored the beliefs which contributed to her creation of those emotions; (3) that the therapeutic relationship and rapport between us was one which indubitably included sincere empathy; and (4) that REBT is not about <u>lessening</u> an emotional experience but about teaching and encouraging the client to <u>change</u> unhealthy debilitating emotional experiences into healthy, appropriate and life-enhancing ones.</i></p>

<p><i>We had 14 sessions over a period of approximately 14 weeks. During the whole of that period she was suffering from excruciating nerve pain in her neck, back and shoulder, was seeing doctors and physical therapists regularly, and continuing to work full-time. Three days after our final session she had neck surgery, and at the time of my writing this (which is one week following the surgery) is recovering very well, and she reports that her use of REBT is helping her calm herself and maintain a positive attitude.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: What was your goal or hope for the sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>The initial goal was to help her learn how to remove and prevent debilitating anxiety, and the panic attacks which sometimes were experienced. In the course of our sessions other aspects of her behavior and unhelpful tendencies were revealed, and we worked on changing and preventing them also. They included her perfectionistic tendencies, her "need" for certainty and for approval from others, her tendencies to catastrophize and awfulize, low frustration tolerance, and her tendency to lose focus and be distracted easily. An additional and most helpful part of what became apparent through the weeks of therapy was her recognition of her tendency to be self-critical and hard on herself, and to deprive herself of compassion and unconditional self-acceptance.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Elllis:</b> <i>I believe that one knows therapy is successful by observing the results. The therapy is successful when the client experiences progress and at least some positive change in moving from unhelpful to helpful thinking and behavior, when they understand the tools for doing so and demonstrate willingness to continue to apply them, when they no longer feel victims of debilitating emotions and know that just as they created them � they can un-create them, when they continue to make effort to create healthy emotions by changing their thoughts and actions, when they accept that it is not uncommon to experience some relapse � and know what they can do if that occurs. They accept that they can maintain therapeutic gains by making ongoing effort following the course of therapy and throughout their lives. For a motivated client who is willing to do their homework, 12 � 15 sessions may be sufficient. Some require even fewer sessions. Clients know that if they relapse and want help getting back on track or want refresher sessions they are most welcome to do so.</i></p>

<p><i>I felt delighted about the sessions with this client, and witnessed incredible and significant changes in her within the short period of time working together. Her motivation was authentic and strong, she made effort � at times in a most courageous way during her suffering from strong physical pain, and even when her effort was light � at least she made some effort. She is willing to keep working on herself, and she is deeply grateful to see the significant changes in herself and in her perceptions and experiences of her circumstances. She recognizes that the recent challenges she has experienced would have been handled by her in a less helpful way if she had not had the therapy and applied it.</i></p>

<p><i>I feel thrilled that she is improving her life immensely, and that she works in a field in which she is, and in all probability may continue to, plant marvelous seeds of helpful attitudes in the children she works with. These children may otherwise not have learned the principles of unconditional acceptance and healthy thinking at this time in their lives. So I feel extra satisfaction when I think that others will benefit from the effective work she did and is doing, and which I believe she will continue to do in her life.</i></p>

<p><i>At times some of the sessions were challenging for me � she often spoke very quickly, and at times she started by answering an initial question and then would go off in other directions. So I did my best to be alert and focused, to catch her when she strayed, and to patiently bring her back to the point we had started talking about. Then I would make effort to return to some of the paths she started going down � for they were worthwhile to explore � but the important thing in these instances was for us to stick to one issue at a time. At times doing so required more of my focus and concentration than usual (and I usually do concentrate substantially and well!). But that was a good thing for me � good exercise for my brain!</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>Tremendous successes and breakthroughs! She is experiencing less anxiety and fewer panic attacks. When she does feel anxiety � she quickly catches her thinking, changes it, and notices the anxiety lessens. She no longer puts herself down as she used to, and continues to work on increasing her USA, UOA and ULA. She is more calm, easy-going and relaxed, less perfectionistic and less needy of approval from others. Easing up on her need for certainty too. Given the physical pain, the dilemmas of deciding "do I or don't I have surgery" and other challenges over the weeks I worked with her � her willingness and ability to apply REBT principles was strongly tested! And more often than not � she passed the tests, catching herself and changing unhelpful thoughts and emotions when she became aware that she was creating them. She is not catastrophizing as much. Her friends and family have noticed the immense changes in her. She uses many of the REBT principles in her work with children, with inspiring results. She no longer feels ruled by patterns developed in response to some of her childhood experiences. She has reported feeling truly empowered in a way she has not experienced before, and that she intends to continue to apply the REBT in her life.</p>

As for bumps in the road � at times, largely due to her being very busy in her life and due to her daily experience often being dominated by the issues of her intense nerve pain, she did not do some of the assigned homework following some of the sessions, or did it lightly, or made some last minute effort in order to please me (the therapist). We discussed these matters in a productive way. Also, for a time she was not clear about the distinctions between two aspects of the ABCDE technique (namely between the (D) 'disputing' and (E) 'effective new philosophy creation' steps). This was probably due to her not having/making time to more thoroughly read material I had given her about them or to question me more fully about them in earlier sessions. By the final session, she seemed to grasp the differences with more confidence. She intends to continue to read about them and REBT in general, and to continue her ongoing practice.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>She lives in close proximity to my work place, we had spoken a few times when we passed one another in the corridor or lobby area, and she learned of the work I do. She was willing to try it for help with the issues as described above.</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: Is there anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</b></p>

<p><b>Jo<i>ffe Ellis:</i></b><i> I do my best to practice REBT in my daily life � not only to use it as a therapeutic approach to share with others in sessions and teach in workshops, seminars and the like. Doing so enriches my life, and fuels my knowledge and conviction that for those who apply it � it brings tremendous and beneficial results. When I practice it in sessions, it reinforces the principles that I attempt to live by, and by incorporating those principles in my daily life I am at times an effective model for others, including my clients, who strive to apply it. </i></p>

<p><i>In presentations and therapy sessions I may include self-disclosure � never to be indulgent, but with the goal of contributing to the listeners. I believe that this can assist some to feel more hopeful about areas they may have felt were "too hard" to deal with � such as grief.</i></p>

<p><i>Appropriate self-disclosure can also increase rapport, and contribute to some clients feeling that I am more "human", and easier to relate to.</i></p>

<p><i>I may include in sessions one, or some, non-"strictly REBT theory" exercises, when I consider that they might be helpful to the client. For example I may share methods for relaxation and meditation.</i></p>

<p><i>(Readers of the transcripts with the client published here will notice my attempts to do so in one of the sessions � however she got the giggles, and could not get into the meditating at that moment. So, with smiles, we moved on!).</i></p>

<p><b>Carlson: What do you want to make sure readers notice about the interview?</b></p>

<p><b>Joffe Ellis:</b> <i>I want readers to recognize that REBT is an elegant, compassionate, do-able and remarkably effective approach, theory, therapy and philosophy. Hopefully they will also notice that I am authentic, that I care value and cherish life, and my goal in both my work and everyday life is to contribute to others in a positive and helpful way. I hope that in this interview readers notice that with the practice of REBT one has the potential to make a beneficial contribution to the lives of others, in addition to enhancing their own lives. I hope that they notice that REBT has unique emphases which are not so much pushed in other cognitive approaches, and in my view these particular emphases (including those on increasing unconditional acceptance, and on utilizing most <u>precise, intense and vigorous</u> disputing of harmful ideas) are immeasurably beneficial and life-enhancing. I hope that readers will recognize the powerful potential of using this approach with clients, family, friends, and on themselves, and experience deep fulfillment and satisfaction from doing so.</i></p>

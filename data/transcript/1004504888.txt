<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(silence until 00:00:09)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, thank you!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Well I've got some good news.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did pass that test.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. So a lot of the stresses of that test miraculously went away because I was anxious about it the last couple of days. Because I knew, I knew Monday the test was coming and the results were coming yesterday. So they came in the middle of class yesterday. And then I found out that I passed, so that was really exciting. That was a big burden taken off me. And that was good. [00:00:59]</p>

<p>So I'm excited now that I know I'm going to graduate as long as I get my work done and don't have any setbacks. I'm really excited about that!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very cool!</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, with that being said, everything is going a positive way in my life right now. There's still a couple of other things that I did realize that I have been working on them but I still could do a lot more work on them, like my anger issue. We took a trip last weekend down to Maryland for my girlfriend's grandmother's birthday. She just turned 90 so we brought her handicap mother. And going down to the airport and everything was fine. It was no big deal, but coming home was really difficult because the airport back there, there just really wasn't a lot of support for her mother. Her mother is handicap. She has Lupus. So it's starting to actually really take a toll on her body. She can't physically do a lot of things anymore. And it's frustrating because her brother now has a new baby and his wife particularly doesn't care for them a lot which is fine but it's not fine because the lady does have a disease. And it's hard trying to get her brother's wife to understand that. [00:02:28]</p>

<p>[If nothing] (ph) we do need his help once in a while with her mom and just being there for a support system. And it kind of irritated me because on our way to the airport we got a rental car because of her mom. We also got a ride. My girlfriend, her brother, and her mom got a ride from her aunt to the airport so me and his wife were taking our rental car back to the rental place and she started talking to me a little bit about the mother situation and how us as outsiders looking at it. And something really, that she said, really irritated me was that she said she finally got her husband, which is Lucy's brother, to finally realize that he needs to put his mother off more and not be so supportive when she needs him. And she said, "I know with that happening it's going to put a lot more stress on Lucy and myself." [00:03:30]</p>

<p>And I kind of bit my tongue a little bit because I was kind of irritated with the fact that she would actually say this. Knowing the condition that her mother's in, knowing that no matter where we travel it's myself and my girlfriend who's always taking the brunt of the mother. And it's just really frustrating for me to...I was trying to be like, "Well, you know, she does have a disease. She is sick. The more help we get the better." And it just really kind of wasn't registering and I don't know if it's because she just had the baby and she's got other stuff going on but it's very irritating because what she's basically saying is, "Thanks for taking the big child while I watch the little child." And I'm just like, "Well, you've to understand." [00:04:27]</p>

<p>Lucy, my girlfriend, gets stressed out an awful lot because she has to do for her mother and do for her brother too because her brother's not there. And they keep...she keeps telling me how much more and more and more it just weighs on her and it comes to the point where I don't get irritate as much anymore but it's where I tell...I told her, "Well, you need to have a conversation."</p>

<p>I do feel bad because this was the first trip I actually really traveled with her mother and witnessed what she needs. She needs hands on care where you need to do everything for her, which is fine. I do not have a problem doing that. But, going to the airlines again, when we were making our seat reservations, she asked for the handicap thing and they said, "Well, you've got to tell the teller." And people were just running us around, running amok. And my girlfriend was getting an attitude and I was like, "Alright, I'll take care of this." So I went and when we got to the terminal and we got to the gate I asked, "Can we switch any seats because we have a handicap person?" This guy put her off to this lady and this lady was copping an attitude but the lady was saying, "Can we switch your seat to accommodate a passenger?" Not accommodate a disabled passenger, just a passenger. Where in the fact if you accommodate a disabled passenger then people will actually understand it and maybe will be willing to do it, because the lady that ultimately wouldn't give up her seat was on the aisle which is what we were looking for, didn't want to move her seat because it was just for a regular passenger. [00:06:22]</p>

<p>And I kind of...I went up there and I wasn't really giving attitude but the lady was kind of giving me attitude where she didn't want to be involved and do all this stuff. And then I finally was going to go up there and offer my seat because everybody was sitting together but me and I was willing to offer my seat and the both of them snapped at me and then I just kind of lost my cool. And I said some things that I shouldn't have said and I told them, "This is the last time I'm travelling with your mother." Kind of just a quick shot of anger and I just went and walked away and just cooled off and was just talking to myself.</p>

<p>(sigh) It really bothered me. I was trying to keep it calm and do all this stuff and then for me feeling like I was going to help, really didn't help. Because I guess they're used to this treatment or this stuff going on where I'm going to push back. I'm a little bit more aggressive. I'm a little bit more blunt. Like, "What's going on here?" [00:07:35]</p>

<p>It kind of pissed me off a little bit that they were like, "Well you're going to make a scene. They're not going to let you on the flight." I mean, listen "I don't really care they're not going to let me on the flight but we have a handicap person here that they're not making accommodations for." I go, "We called them. They said you have to do it at the airport. The airport's telling us when we book our reservations we have to tell them in advance." We're getting cross stories. This person's saying "Can you switch your seat to accommodate a passenger?" Not mentioning the fact that the lady is sitting in a wheelchair right next to you who's right there. Couldn't you say, "Oh, would you mind exchanging your seat for this passenger right here?" Then maybe people...because I was going to say something to the lady. I'm going to be like, "That's really rude you didn't move your seat for a handicap person." And they're like, "No you can't say that." And I was like, "Why?" I was like, "God forbid someday they're in that situation. How are you going to act?" [00:08:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you were saying that they didn't realize it was a handicap person they were switching their seat for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They didn't. They didn't, but I wanted to go tell them when they called her over and they were like, "No, stay out of it. They'll handle it." But I wanted to make sure that the people that they were calling knew that this was a handicap person that they were doing it and I wanted to thank them for their appreciation. Maybe guilt them a little bit into giving up their seats because they could move functionally like I could.</p>

<p>And it really got irritating when my girlfriend and I had our little thing and then when I was still in the process of cooling down I grabbed her and I said, "Look. Not for nothing, I understand your mother's condition's very bad. But you've got to understand this. If your brother's not going to help us out with this, you, your brother, and your mother need to have this conversation that she cannot travel anymore, because it's just too difficult." It's difficult in the fact where we keep getting the runaround. The poor lady, she can't physically move so we have to pick her up. We have to put her on...we have to wheel her in the wheelchair. It's just too much of a burden for her. [00:09:48]</p>

<p>If her brother's not going to help out with it, I don't want my girlfriend taking on all the stress on her to feel like she has to be the one looking out for her mother and doing all this stuff. And I do understand that he does have a baby and all that stuff but you know what? That's easily... (chuckle) You know? I can carry your bags. Your wife can handle the child. You've got to help your mom. And it's starting to get to the point where he's starting to distance himself from his mother a little bit. And it's starting to wear on my girlfriend more and more and it's to the point where she just vents to me and at times I just zone out because I can't handle it anymore. Because they need to talk about it, I make a suggestion, and then there's no action on it. And I think it's to the point where it's starting to really piss me off is they keep complaining and complaining and then we suggest something, ask them to take action, nobody does. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>And I am just... (sigh) I can only bite my tongue for so long. And it's to the point where I don't want to piss her off because it's not my mother but I will be there to support her. It's getting to the point where I don't want to say anything to my girlfriend anymore. I want to say something to his wife - her brother's wife - and to him. And say, "I understand you have a child now but you also understand you do have a handicap mother and you can't just throw her into our lap because that's not how it works."</p>

<p>So it is very difficult. Because I never fully understood what it was like to have a disabled person until now. And just the way that we were treated at the airport really irritated me, because I was boiling. I was trying to be very calm because even before we got into the gate, my girlfriend was really pissed off at what was going on. And I was just like, "Okay, relax." And she was getting mad at me because I was telling her to relax. I was like, "It's no big deal, we'll just move on." You know, trying to settle the situation down. And then me trying to be in control felt like I could take it upon myself to help out the situation and then that's when my fuse was lit and blew up. And I... (pause) I don't know. It was very frustrating. [00:12:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you blew up at your girlfriend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I don't know why. I mean, maybe because she was there but I was literally ready to just...I mean, I was calm. I wasn't yelling. I didn't raise my voice. And they were the ones saying, "Stop. You're going to embarrass us. Don't make a scene." And I'm like, "I'm not making a scene! I'm just trying to get her what she needs. I'm just trying to get the accommodations needed for this flight." You know? And I kind of felt stepped on a little bit because I was trying to help. And every time I was trying to help I was being rejected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you were trying to help and you ended up feeling very helpless and that no one was listening to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. No one was listening to me because I had never done it before. And I kind of didn't know what to do. Again, when I get into uncomfortable situations I don't know what to do and then that's when the anger just kicks in because that's what I'm prone to do. That's what I know. That's a defense mechanism that I've grown up with and seen. It's just, "Okay, if something's gone wrong and you can't do it, just get angry." And that's kind of what I did but it's what I don't want to do anymore. [00:14:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds very frustrating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because I felt like I was only trying to help. And the more and more I tried to help the more and more damage I was doing I guess. Or just nothing right I was doing (chuckle). And it really frustrated me. It really did frustrate me. And when I get frustrated, I get angry and I get pissed off and then I just do stuff. And that's exactly what happened in this situation, where I was getting frustrated because all I was trying to do was help. And when I didn't (pause) help, I got pissed off because I wanted to help and I wanted to make things easier and it just didn't work. [00:14:50]</p>

<p>And that's when I exploded and (sigh) happier times have been had since but it's really frustrating. And then when after that situation calmed down, even this week, after last week and this week, I finally told my girlfriend how I felt about her job. How she keeps looking for a new job but she's not really doing anything. And I told her how we talked and how I felt betrayed by the fact that she still works there. And then she started crying and getting really emotional and said, "Well, what do you want me to do?" I said, "I don't know. I don't know what you can do. I don't know what you should do. But I'm just telling you after you knowing what I went through – you lived what I went through every day for three years, two and a half/three years – you lived it. And for you to stay and take their side over mine, it really did hurt me." And she goes, "You're just pissed off because of what went down and you don't want them to succeed and all that." I go, "That's part of it too. But part of it's the fact that you keep telling me you're going to look for a new job. You hate this job. And yet, there's no action." And when I question it, "What are you doing today? What could you have done today?" You keep telling me you don't have any time for anything but you have time to go shopping and do all this other stuff and the other day you told me you didn't feel like working so you were at work but you weren't very productive. What were you doing?" [00:16:37]</p>

<p>And then that's when the argument came in where she's like, "Don't tell me what to do!" Blah, blah, blah and I just get really frustrated and it's too the point where I'm like, "Ok, whatever." I can't keep my tongue shut. I have to say stuff to her and it's starting to irritate her but I think it's for her best interest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if she's just miserable in her job and basically she just wants to complain?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's fine too! That's fine! But then again I called her out on it and I said, "Stop talking about getting a new job and telling people you're looking for a new job when you're not actively looking." That's what pisses me off. [00:17:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That she's sort of misrepresenting what she's doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's mix-representing what she said and she constantly complains about it. But then again, she has good days and bad days. I go, "Everybody has good days and bad days. But whenever you're talking about people you haven't seen or who you've seen and they ask you if you're looking for a job and you say 'yes' and I know you're not, it pisses me off!" It pisses me off because she's doing that. And she's like, "Well, I don't have confidence in myself to get a new job and I'm scared to get a new job." And I'm like, "That's bologna." It pisses me off. I go, "You don't know that you don't have the qualifications or the confidence to get a new job because you've never gone on an interview." [00:18:15]</p>

<p>And it just frustrates me and I frustrate her because I know she's very qualified. She can get a different job if she looks. And she's not looking. And I'm just at a standstill and then she'll come home and she'll try to talk work with me and I zone out because I don't want to deal with it. I even told her the other day, I said, "Even if you did leave your job, I still don't know – the anger that I have towards that company – if I could still forgive that company." Everywhere I'd go I'd want that company to decline. I'd want it to fail. I'd want the people that worked with me to fail. I'd want them all to go down the tubes. I told her the other day all those people that were mean to me, if I saw them on the street and they were homeless, I wouldn't even give them my leftovers or a dollar. I'd walk right past them. (pause) [00:19:18]</p>

<p>That's it. And I guess that's the problem I still have with my anger is that people do, if they screw me over and they break that trust, you're dead to me. You're dead to me! I mean, the other day I picked her up from work, we had lunch, and my old boss came out. I didn't even look at him. I drove right by, drove right by him. I don't care what he does. I'm sure he could care less either, but that's how I feel. If I saw him, if they put him and me in a room, I'd get up and walk out. If I couldn't get out I still wouldn't talk to him. He could try and make conversation with me and I'd have nothing to say to him. (pause) I'd have nothing to say to him. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>That's where I get frustrated. My anger does get the best of me where I can't move on. And (pause) she keeps telling me to move on from this job and I don't know how to move on. I don't know how to get this anger that I have for them out of my system. It's just, I was treated so bad and so disrespected that I don't know what I can do to forgive. I really don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I don't think it's just about the job. I think it's about all the years that you felt betrayed and anger that's getting stimulated by the job situation but it's not the origin of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know. Because when we were at work, we never fought till this new manager came in. And then all of a sudden I was fighting with her constantly too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The new manager? [00:21:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when I was still working at the same company. And I was trying to actively leave for over a year and just wasn't getting any job opportunities, which pissed me off too. And then finally I said, "You know what? Forget it. I'm going back to school. I'm going to do what I want." (pause) Excuse me. And it was very difficult to just get up and leave. And that's what I tried to explain to her. I'm like, "Well do you want to extend your education and do this? Do you want to do this? Do you want to do that?" and she gets pissed off at me. I don't know what I want to do but I'll do it.</p>

<p>And I'm kind of getting irritated in the sense that I do understand she wants to be married. I do understand she wants a family. I do understand that she wants to be financially stable. But I don't understand what's holding her back from doing what she wants to do. How does she not know what she wants to do? How does she not know what type of job or field really interests her by now? I do understand, in a way, that nobody really does, but I don't understand how she's saying all these different things – doesn't know what she wants to be – but she's not actively pursuing any different opportunities. And to me that's very frustrating. [00:22:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her being so stuck is frustrating to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because I do feel like she's got weights on her ankles and every time she tries to climb and get up she can't do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like her handicap mom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, yep. You make a good point right there, like her handicap mom. Because she wants to move on from a lot of things but doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about people's helplessness - whether it be an actually sort of physical illness or maybe sort of an emotional block - that really upsets you. People are helpless. [00:23:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it is. Because that does piss me off because I get pissed off at bullies that pick on weak kids. That really irritates me. And I don't (chuckle) know why. But I had an incident at school where someone reported bullying and I wanted to find these kids and I wanted to do whatever they did to this child back to them. I guess I don't tolerate it. My dad told me a story about how when he was younger there was this poor kid on the train getting picked on. And my dad stepped in, he got beat up, but he stuck up for the little kid. And the little kid was thankful that he did that. And I guess, for me, that stuck in where I don't want to see anybody who can't stick up for themselves be picked on, be put down, be attacked all the time, and tell themselves that they're not worth this, they're not worth that. [00:24:38]</p>

<p>That really pisses me off and that's where the anger issue comes in I guess, is when people pick on me and I know I can't defend myself physically but I can defend myself verbally or by doing the right thing, again I feel helpless. And I guess maybe that's where the anger comes in. Because at my old job I did what I thought was right. I was helpless, I was stuck. I knew he was doing illegal things. I reported it. I thought I was doing the right thing, sticking up for the big kid, the company. And in essence it ended up backfiring on me and getting me where I am today, which I'm fully happy with. [00:25:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why wasn't the company appreciative of your efforts to point something out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, because when the man came in I guess he had a reputation of it and I think they didn't want to believe it. They didn't want to believe that they made a mistake that what they had they really didn't do their research on. And I don't know, because nobody knew about it until I told them, that I reported it, and then all this stuff. Then after I reported him, that's when everything started turning against me. They wanted to know who was I to get management fired. Who was I to do this? Well, it's not right! Because I was frustrated and helpless when he wanted me putting in 80 hours a week and wasn't willing to compensate me. But yet here's a man working 25 to 30 who says, "That's what I work," and then he's going out to dinner on Friday night with groups of friends and not paying for it. The company is. [00:26:40]</p>

<p>To me, that's frustrating. Don't say that you want something done and do something totally different. That's not how I was growing up. I was growing up to be an honest person but you screw me, I'm screwing you. And he screwed me. That trust was gone the first day. I gave him every opportunity to do what he needed and he chose to just use his authority as a way to...so you know what? I stopped doing stuff for him. That was my way of stop doing this for him. He had a huge project that he asked me and some kid to do. The other kid did it. I didn't do his part. And then he was like, "Well you're not doing your work." I go, "It's not my work. It's yours. And not for nothing you missed your deadline because you were so..." I didn't care! I was like, "You want to fire me? Fire me. I don't care." Because I know how hard it is to fire someone. So as soon as you give me that first warning I was going to leave. I had school already as a backup plan. [00:27:45]</p>

<p>But I still...everything that happened with him I constantly messed things up for him. I constantly made him miss deadlines. I constantly did a lot of stuff for him. Who knows what he told them, said it was my fault, but he was the one that was still responsible to produce the products, and he never did because they weren't done. Because I knew he wasn't doing them. I mean, whether the other kid did them or not, I have no idea.</p>

<p>But that's how I am with people. And that's how I am with her. People are constantly messing up that she's taking the fall for. She's getting yelled at almost every other day for people in her company that are making mistakes that will not own up to the mistakes. She's the one that has to correct the mistakes. She's the one who gets yelled at and comes home crying to me saying that she got yelled at for somebody else's mistake. I think that's where the anger drives me because I know she's helpless, in the fact that she can't control what other people do, but yet she's the one that has to answer for other people. Why is that? [00:28:52]</p>

<p>And that's why I push and I push and I push to get her out of that position, because there is no accountability. There is no "Oh, I messed up. I'll take ownership on it." It's all pointing fingers. And she, in a sense, is just the one who will take it on. And I'm like, "Sometimes you've got to say 'That's not my problem. That's theirs. If you've got an issue, here, call this person. Deal with it.'" And that's what I've tried to tell her. I go, "Start passing the buck on other people then. They do it to you because they know you'll take care of it." And in a way I kind of see that with her mom, is her brother is passing the buck on her because he knows she'll do it. And that's frustrating to me. [00:29:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it remind you of your dad at all?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In what way?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you feel like your dad gets walked over easily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He does. I think he does. (pause) I think he really does, yeah. And I kind of can see that too where he just doesn't stand up for himself or for what he believes in. (pause) That is funny, yeah. (sigh) I do see that in a way because he really doesn't stand up. He does get walked on over. He got used by his brother for money and never told my mom. My mom was really upset about that. And then he got used by my aunt too because he took care of my grandmother all the time and everything he did was for my grandmother but nobody was ever there for her. And just other people I know that just have screwed my dad. In a way, my dad is smart but he's also very stupid and gullible. And in fact, he'll do anything to help you out but if you screw him, he won't do anything, where I am the total opposite. If you screw me, I'm coming after you. But I'm not like coming after you like that, I'm just, "Don't ask for me or any favor again. You're dead to me. You've lost all resources that I have." And then if I know you're trying to get something and I have pull in it, I'm going to make sure you don't get it. [00:31:33]</p>

<p>It's kind of like, I don't know, I've got a lot of anger just built up over situations like that and it always comes out in the wrong times. And I feel like I can't control it but now that you mention it there are a lot of situations where I feel like I've just exploded, even with my little brother. He got busted for drugs in college and I'll never forget about it. I was at work and he calls me and goes, "I've got a problem." I said, "What's the problem?" He said, "Well I kind of got busted with marijuana." And I said, "What do you mean you got busted?" "Well we were all smoking in the room and the cops came and I was being the nice guy and I said it was mine," and I lost my mind. I go, "How many other people were with you?" He goes, "Eight, and one kid was hiding in the bathroom." And I go, "And you took the rap?" He goes, "Yep. I thought I was being a good friend." I go, "You never do that. What is wrong...?" And I started getting really angry at him and pissed off because the cops got involved. They had to tell my parents. They were going to try and fall (ph) him out of school and I got really pissed off in the fact where I was just like, "Are you kidding me?" I was trying to leave work and drive up there and I was ready to grab each and every one of his friends up there that were in the room and say, "You're coming with me and you're telling the cops that that was yours too. It's not just his." Especially that little rat bastard that hid in the closet, I would have grabbed him and said, "You know what? He was the one that purchased the weed. He's the one that's selling the weed." And I was going to rat him out. [00:33:32]</p>

<p>You know? I mean, when people just don't think for themselves and just pride, think that they're doing the right thing, they're really not. And in a way, it's kind of like my dad in my situation too. He thought he was helping people out by him taking the blame. And then again all of his friends just walked all over him and said, "Whew! Thank God we had an idiot to take the blow for us." That really pissed me off. I'm still not over that because he still hangs out with some of those kids. And I'm just like, "How can you be friends with them? I would never be friends with those kids ever. That showed me where their true colors were, that they weren't loyal to you." And I understand that four of them were his roommates, but you know what? "Pack your shit and get out! I can't live with you." [00:34:31]</p>

<p>Like that, I don't know. (sigh) I just, I have a lot of anger built up and half of the anger is part of me, and half of it's other people's problems. And I will say I'm getting better at it but I do have a soft heart for weak people where I want to be able to help them in a way where (pause) I guess it's because I feel like I'm inferior to them too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I know that if I do something to help somebody out and that they really appreciate it they may either one, live in fear of me or two, be really, really thankful and can't thank me enough. And I don't know what that is because I've never had someone where I've defended screw me. (pause) And I don't know if it's because of the fear that I put in them or because of the fact that they really do appreciate what I did for them. And to me, it bothers me because I don't want to be that person who's "Oh, they like me because they're scared of me." I don't want that. I want them to like me because I did a good thing. [00:36:03]</p>

<p>And to me, it's really difficult with the balancing act with my personalities because they don't know. Because sometimes I can be the nicest kindhearted guy and then in an instant (snap) bang! I'm raging and I don't know what the hell is going on. And it's very difficult because I don't know if I can feel them coming on but it just happens. I don't even know. It just happens and I'm like, "Oh shit, it's too late." And then after I have time to cool off, catch my breath, control my breathing and do everything to settle down, then I go back to square one where I am before where "Oh shit, what did I do? How am I going to fix this?" And to me that is very frustrating, when I want to say stuff, I want to be supportive, but in a way I can't because I don't want to get myself worked up and I don't want to piss off the people that I care about. And that's very frustrating to me. [00:37:26]</p>

<p>And that's, again, my frustration leads to anger and I just don't know how to balance the frustration into something other than anger. It's difficult. It's very difficult and I'm just working on it but there's just times where it's explosive and I don't know what to do. (pause) So, I'm worried that...I don't know. Again, there is a soft heart in my body for weak individuals. I don't know what it is but if you can't take care of yourself I feel like I'm going to take care of you. And then this goes back to how I feel about my parents, where they feel that I'm weak and they need to take care of me because of the situation that I'm in. And for me, it's kind of hard to break away from that because I fall into the category as "Well, I can't thank them enough for what they do for me." And I can't just say that and move on. [00:38:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel indebted to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (pause) And that's kind of how I feel with other people. I feel so indebted to my parents that there's nothing I can do to show them how much I appreciate what they have done for me and how I appreciate the opportunities that they opened up for me. And to me, that's frustrating as well because I wanted...I talk about being independent. I want to do things on my own. I want to start a family. I want to get married. I want to own a house. But to me, (pause) I just can't break away from my parents just because like we just talked about, I do feel indebted to them, and I don't know why. I do say and I am scared that everything that my parents provided for me, I feel that, from the cliché that all parents want to give their kids what they never got, well my parents gave me a lot. I'm just scared I can't...I want to be able to give my kids half of what my parents gave me and to me that scares me a lot because I don't know how I can do it or if I can do it. And then again in the back of my head is I don't want my kids to turn out like me where they are forever indebted to me, where I take care of them every time. If they get themselves in a jam, I'll take care of it. I want that, but I don't want it. Because I never got in a jam like my little brother but my dad took care of it. [00:40:48]</p>

<p>So, you see where I'm going with this? Where my dad took care of it was to the point of where, "I messed up. Let me get out of it." You know? And these fears do run through my head all the time. Being a parent is a huge responsibility. Being an adult is a huge responsibility. Being financially stable is a huge responsibility. But then again, there has to be guidelines. There has to be cutoffs. There has to be rules that you have to enforce and to me, I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can mentally do it. I mean, my little cousins, if I have money I give them dollars. I can't do that because it's what I grew up with. "Oh, you need something? Here, here you go." (chuckle) [00:41:43]</p>

<p>You know? It's just the way of life that I'm used to and it scares me because (sigh) in a way I want to do things my way but - and my girlfriend's all for this – is she's about cutoffs. "They can't have this. They can't have this." And I'm now, "Well why not? I had it. Why can't they have it?" And she's the more voice of reason than me and I'm just scared that I'll do stuff behind her back. Because we already have that trust issue and then all of a sudden my kid will come home with a 300 dollar game system. "We said he couldn't have that, or she couldn't' have that. Why did you do it?" And then again, the reactionary thing that I get. I have to talk my way out of it. [00:42:38]</p>

<p>And it's, to me, I'm very tossed and turning between that because that is a huge responsibility that I have, that I have to make the decision of my own. But (chuckle) I don't know even where to make that decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well with your parents, it's not something that they give you things but they sound like they actively discourage you from being out on your own.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They do in a part. But more recently when I did move out they were more and more and more accepting of it. With my parents, and personally with me, is I can't be all talk. I have to do something. Like, "I said I'm going to move out. I move out. You've just got to deal with that. Like, I'm gone." They adjusted to that fine. Now it's too the point where I want to take the next step. I want to get engaged. I want to get married. I want to do that. It's a point of me stop talking and doing it. If I do it, it'll be different but my problem is taking the steps to do it. There's something that holds me back from it, that's not allowing me to make the full leap. And to me, that's frustrating because I do feel like I'm just running in circles. I do feel that way. I do feel like I'm running in circles. [00:44:11]</p>

<p>And everybody who I try to talk to, they go, "When are you getting married?" And I have excuses for everything. In my heart do I know I'm ready? Almost, but I'm not quite there yet. I just want to get school off my plate. I want to get a job, and then I can start thinking about it. But then again, I get the pressure from other people, "Well we're not getting any younger." And then in the back of my head, my parents are both 65 and my mother had this conversation with me the other day. She kept asking me how everything was going and then she said, looked me in the eye, and said, "Will I have a grandchild by the time I'm 70?" I mean... (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a lot of pressure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a lot of pressure, and it's to the point where I'm the only one in my family that has a steady girlfriend. My brothers don't, my sister does not have a boyfriend. But, my dad and my mom really want a grandchild.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it. You know "C", I don't mean to cut you off but we're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's alright, okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I will see you next week!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, sounds good!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have you worked on different times for Thursday? Because I start work in like a month, and 3:30 doesn't really work. If I could push it to the morning or later that afternoon, because I work in a restaurant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you were looking for either early or late?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm either looking for early morning or later on at night?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On Thursdays particularly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thursday or Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, Friday will be a better bet because I don't have any morning appointments right now for Thursday but Friday I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Or, like Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday I could do later on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could actually have that too. Why don't we touch base about that? Actually let's e-mail, why don't you e-mail me an let me know different times because my times are starting to get a little bit tighter but obviously I'm going to make the time to see you. Okay, so just let me know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that works! Thank you very much Dr. Feldman!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, very good, see you next week!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep! [00:46:21]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so have you been up the mountains?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well not, not since our time share which was the first 2 weeks of December.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get some skiing in?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I skied 10 days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow, how was it, good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] skied 8.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Now those are short days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I take it easy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's smart.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we had a great time.  The snow was very thin the first day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They were slow getting snow.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, it was late this year.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we went up the 1st, Saturday the first, skied Sunday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we skied what 4 days, 5 days in a row but anyway, Sunday it was very thin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was good, it was good but if you, as you skied around, you'd see a little strip of dirt.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yknow, where the plows had scraped a little bit deeper than maybe they wanted or the train, you know, anyway, but we still enjoyed it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then we had snow that night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And we had no problem from then on.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And it was beautiful.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And as I've told you before, well you may, you may know this but there's nobody there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We, we skied, do you know Vale?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I've never skied Vale.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah okay, well the one part you take where you get on the [INAUDIBLE] over at [INAUDIBLE], that's the east, the western part of the town.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And you go up to the top, [INAUDIBLE] is the top and we skied down there and it's a beautiful run, the one we take.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Cruising wide, not very steep, generally groomed pretty well and we stop, rest a little bit and look around and a lot of the time you didn't see another soul.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's amazing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been that way the early part of the December, we've skied there for 20, 30, 25 years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I guess people just don't get up there till Christmas, huh?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well they um, Friday is different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They come up in preparation for the weekend.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And Saturday is less, fewer skiers usually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Then Friday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In the particular area we ski.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway, we had a marvelous time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh good, good, and how have your spirits been overall?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think generally pretty darn good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not the way I'd like to be but it's a lot different and I don't, I don't know, I assume it's the medicine but maybe it isn't, geez I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It probably is, it probably is.  Are you sleeping well at night [PATIENT NAME]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And do you feel like your energy level is pretty good during the day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been, I'm fairly content.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> My, my mind is, I don't know whether it's Parkinson's or whether it's Alzheimer's or what, you know, I just don't think, my mind is not like it used to be.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME] that may just be age too.  I mean none of us are the way we were in our 20's or 30's or.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well my brother is 3 years, 2 years and 10 months older than I am.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's older. And he's in the hospital right now with a staph infection.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think that's, I'm not sure, he's back near Rochester.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And his son and his daughter in law live near him, somewhat near him and I talked with her, the daughter in law, yesterday and she said he's, he's not, he's a little better but he's got a couple of blood clots.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh boy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And uh, and he's quite confused apparently and his memory is not good at all and mine is getting worse.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, you just said it, I know that's got to be, part, partly of age but God I hate to think it's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Things like, [NAME OTHER] has some of the problem, everybody that I know, my age or whatever, they're having trouble with memory.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I'll walk, I laid down a hammer yesterday evening, doing a modest little chore.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And 5 minutes later I couldn't remember where in the hell I put it.  I mean it happens regularly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, and like you said it's very common for, as we get older we just don't remember things as well as we used to but I know that's why a lot of people write things down to remember them or find different ways to keep track.  [PATIENT NAME] have you been eating well, appetite good?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is good, it seems that it's better.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't want to gain anymore weight but I, the other day I got a beautiful great big cheeseburger, you know [INAUDIBLE], with the french fries and whatever and I thought oh geez, I'm enjoying this too much.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you look like you're in great shape still so you don't have to worry about it, it looks like.  Are you worrying about things much or not too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well probably more than I would like to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not sure, what kind of, when you ask that, is there some specific, what, function or something like that, what shouldn't I, what shouldn't I worry about?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well everybody worries some, it's just that some people find if they start worrying, they can't shut off the worries.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It bothers them because they're just worrying a lot of the time about all kinds of things and that can be frustrating or irritating to people when that happens.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't think I, I would say I don't worry a lot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I do some, certainly, but not as much as some people I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, are you feeling anxious at all when you get up in the morning these days or not?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well it hasn't been quite as bad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't, I guess it's because when I wake up, I've, I've had things to do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, yeah, it sounds like you've been staying active and busy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're enjoying it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It may not be very important but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's not a lot in life that isn't important [PATIENT NAME] when you look at it that way, you know, it's all relative and it sounds like you're enjoying yourself though when you're skiing or doing things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I certainly am.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] and I both, 2 weeks up there is marvelous.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good, when will you be going back, do you know?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, probably sometime this month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But only, I doubt that we'll be going up for any length of time.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just for a day or 2.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably for a day maybe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which we've done in the past quite a little, although right, [NAME OTHER] I think may be not quite as interested as she used to be.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I think we'll be going up and another thing that'll effect how much we ski, I ski and my eyes water.  In the past, we've gone to Steamboat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A lot because we have a daughter there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> With a family.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And anyway, they have 3 children.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The oldest has a degree from Calvin College in Grand Rapids </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He's up in Oregon at one of the schools there getting a masters. He's the oldest.  The, he's a boy, the second, the second is a girl, she is, I think she's a senior at Calvin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The youngest one is a freshman in Scotland.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Those 3 children, you know, they're all going to school.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean [NAME OTHER] thinks well they own, they're very well to do and her husband is a wizard, a good man, hell of a good man and he just knows how to make money.  And he's, he's been in, what do I want to say, recreation condominium property management.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And he's managing property in Steamboat, Galveston, Texas all over and he's just starting, well no, he's probably, he's got a good start building his third business building.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In Steamboat.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway, they own a home in Tucson</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I think, it sounds like [NAME OTHER] is down there and I think [NAME OTHER] her husband is going to be.  In other words, I think they're not going to be there for a week of it.  I think they would probably let us go up and stay in their house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I was - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I see, yeah.  So you may not be doing as much skiing at Steamboat this year, okay.  [PATIENT NAME] are you aware of any problems with your medications?  Any side effects?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good, so you're taking the 90 mg of Cymbalta.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And the Klonopin, are you using it much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't had Klonopin for I don't know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Weeks or months?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Probably a month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, that's a good sign that you're doing well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's still there if you need it but if you don't need it, you don't have to take it.  Okay, so the Cymbalta seems to be helping?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so, something is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and how's your Parkinson's, you look like you don't have much tremor.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, by in large, I don't know, I think my symptoms are minimal.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Yeah, it seems like you've done real well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I told you I was taking that patch.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you still using it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It seems like it's been a good one for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I wonder if it or the Sinemet is responsible for the improvement with the Parkinson's.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm not sure but whichever it is, I'm glad that he found a good one for you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know this but I wonder, I cut down a little on the Sinemet for my own amazement.  The person, the medical person that I get the most support from, the way it's turned out is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is, um, this is </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway, when I started the patch, she mentioned that I might consider reducing my Sinemet and just to see.  Anyway, I did, I started reducing it after I'd been on the patch, you know, a month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I started to feel like maybe I shouldn't do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A very subtle feeling.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so I'm back on my normal dosage which is 2 of those, whatever size they are, 3 times a day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which is what I started out with, well, no it was increased.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking, well, Synthroid, I've been taking that for 15 years.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] checks that periodically, your thyroid.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And makes sure it's where it needs to be.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> As a matter of fact, we reduced it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was up to, is it 0.175 or 1.75?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 0.175.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I got up that high and because of the way my blood work and all was doing, he said let's drop it down, so right now I'm taking 0.137, 0.135, no, 0.137 -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A lower dose at least.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a good sign, so you're actually taking less medicine overall than you used to and you're feeling better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think, yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you've found the right ones.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking the Sinemet, Synthroid, and Cymbalta in the morning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And the doses, I think you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And then in the evening, at bedtime, I take 2 Sinemets, 1 Cymbalta, and Zocor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was taking, what is it Florinef, the one for raising your blood pressure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But uh, yeah, it was getting up too darn high.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So I haven't had any for about 3 or 4 days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you just don't need it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And my blood pressure is [INAUDIBLE], I don't know if I ever told you but you knew I volunteered for a long time at the pharmacy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAIDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well right, practically right next door is pediatrics and I'm not sure what got me started but without any appointment, without any, what notice.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When I walked by the pediatric office, quite often as I did yesterday, I walked in and I've been in there quite regularly to the point of where the nurses and whoever, the techs, I'm a familiar face.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they know I stopped in there to have my blood pressure taken, like yesterday.  The gals out in the hall saw me, she said - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's the regular guy.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I should be right in this chair, here's a chair, sit down, blah, blah, you know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And so I get in there, it's amazing how damn congenial they are.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well anyway they took my blood pressure.  Oh, no she says, it's pretty good, 140, I think it was 141/85 or something.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which for me that's not bad at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's pretty good.  So that's without the Florinef.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah, it sounds like you don't need it then, at least right now.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have to keep track of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so you check it regularly at home?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got a cuff but geez I don't like it. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, okay, well it sounds like you're doing fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can get somebody else, I can go to regularly, well I go to the Safeway.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know how good that machine is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well it's good enough, it's not perfect but it gives you pretty close.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean if it's, if you're numbers are way outside the limits then you know you need to get it checked somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if it's close you're fine.  Well it sounds like you're doing really well [PATIEN T NAME].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Probably about as well as anytime since I've known you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I think that's true.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.  I'm really happy for you that things are going so well. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I felt this way once, it was around 6 to 8 months ago, I came in here and I was so enthused because I felt so good and heck it wasn't the next day it was completely different.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well let's keep our fingers crossed that this time things continue to go well and it may be that we've finally found a Cymbalta dose that works for you because it's a good one for depression and anxiety and it seems like you're doing real well with it, so I'm hoping that'll keep working.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well so am I, so do I.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it should, it should keep working.  You've got enough to last for months still so we're okay there.  Why don't we just keep doing exactly what you're doing with the medicine if that's all right with you and then maybe check back in, I don't know, how long has it been this time?  It's been about 6 weeks, we can go 6 to 8 weeks again.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you can call if you need anything sooner, does that sound all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think that's - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The way I feel now, I don't, you know, I'd like to think that I won't slip back.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I would hope not.  I think the key [PATIENT NAME] is to keep taking the medicine.  One of the traps in the past has been when people feel good they have a tendency to want to stop the medicine because they feel so much better but with this kind of medicine, if you were to stop it, you'd probably not feel so good again so you want to try to hang in here with it.  If you have questions or problems with it, just call me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, good.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Does that sound all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Let's see, today's the 11th, so 1, 2, 3, 4. Do you know if you're going to be up skiing any certain dates yet?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, 6 weeks would be around the 18th, the 25th, somewhere in that range of February, does that sound like a good time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay and do you like mornings like this or afternoons better?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I enjoy, I enjoy mornings.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  How about something like, we could do Tuesday the 19th of February at 9 o'clock.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well let me give you a card and you can check your calendar at home, if there's a problem you can let me know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Good.  Have you done any traveling?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, we went back and saw my in laws back in [INAUDIBLE] Wisconsin and [INAUDIBLE] at Christmas.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I knew you were going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That was the only trips we've taken recently.  Haven't been up skiing yet, want to get the kids up but we haven't been up yet, it's been busy.  My older son's playing basketball, he's got 2 or 3 games a week so - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That keeps us here most of the time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> He was -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's over at the high school, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's the latest with this new high school?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know, I keep hearing different things, I'm not sure, it keeps changing.  I think they're supposed to open it next fall but I've heard they might, they don't know if they have the money to run it so - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's it, that's what I heard.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So I'm not sure what's going to happen, you know, I'm curious to find out myself because my two younger ones are supposed to go there if they can get it opened.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh they are.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but I really wonder if they're going to be able to get it opened or not.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah that's what I - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's been kind of a mess hasn't it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Lot of problems</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right, so here's the card for the 19th at 9.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And like I said, if you need anything before then, just give me a call, all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Ah. Something crossed my mind a minute ago but it's gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well if you think of it you can always call me, all right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, take good care of yourself.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I'm trying and I appreciate your help.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You bet.  Be safe up there on the slopes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh something I wanted to, what crossed my mind was - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are you, what do you know about medicine and progress with taking care of Parkinson's?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not a lot [PATIENT NAME] because it's not really my area.  I know that they are constantly coming out with new medications that help.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That do help?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That do help, yeah, they're getting more and more medications that help but I don't really keep up with the latest on that because that's not really my area of expertise.  I bet [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] would know more about that in his office.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because he's the one that probably treats more of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well if, can they, can they really diagnose it?  [INAUDIBLE] At what point would I have to be at  or get to, to where they give you the medicine for it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well they can do different kinds of testing to see how you're doing memory wise,</p>
<p><b>PT:</b>  They can?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are different tests they can do and if they feel like there's signs that you're having problems, they can start you on medication, yknow, right away, so if you have concerns about that, next time you go into his office you might just ask him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I will.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okie dokie.</p>

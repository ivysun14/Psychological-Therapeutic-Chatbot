<p>ANALYST:   Uhm, th—, next Monday is not a holiday here.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Actually, that's part of what was on my mind uhm, (Sniff) I mean, I'm still thinking about it, was when I was waiting I just suddenly realized that you had said you weren't going to be here Friday, and I'd completely forgotten.  Uhm, now su, superficially anyway, I'd forgotten since I left here yesterday.  And I, the way I remembered it, and then I recalled you then told me about Monday.</p>

<p>Uhm, was, I think I was thinking about first, the way FSO was today, and particularly this afternoon.  I left her crying and uhm, and she had wanted to play.  And I think she wanted to have a game of my dressing her, which she's done a lot.  And usually, if I'm feeling in a good mood, and we have to go do something, I try to do it in a game form, which she likes to do now.  And so she'll keep on resisting being dressed, or maybe she's just in that kind of a obstinate mood a lot lately.  I don't know which it is, but in any case I try to, to treat it like a game, except sometimes when I'm really feeling tired, I just can't.  But then I try to warn her that I just don't want to play that kind of a game.</p>

<p>And today I did and said that, there are a couple of things we could do outside if she wanted to go out.  But that she'd have to get dressed right away, and I didn't want to play getting her dressed.  And uhm, if she didn't want to get dressed right away, then we wouldn't go out.  And so she chose not to get dressed, you know, putting on her shoes, things like that.  And then about 5 minutes before it was time for me to come here, she said she was ready to go out.  And I said, well it's too late now, that Mrs LDJ could take her out if she wanted to go out.  But I couldn't.  She was very unhappy about that, and cried a lot.  And then uhm, fi—, and she talked about how she didn't want me to come h—, you know, go away, she doesn't kn, know where I go.  But uhm, and how she wanted only to go out with me, and so forth and so on.</p>

<p>So and finally, I was, and I kept (Sigh) uhm, you know, first I answered that, saying, I know, and I sometimes wish I didn't have to, too.  But I did.  Uhm, anyway, it eventually got t—, down to just simply she wanted to go out.  And I said, Well, I could only take her out if she would understand that she was going to meet Mrs LDJ and stay with her.  And eventually she accepted that.  But then when we did meet Mrs LDJ, she started to cry.  And she accepted it, but she was crying.</p>

<p>And so I w—, so I was thinking about just how uhm, I could have avoided that.  Although I felt in a way FSO had to learn something, because uhm, there are a lot of people that it annoys when she, you know, resists being dressed and uhm, some of her behavior, I've learned to work around it.  But maybe she should just not do it at all, because of the number of people involved.  And, and it often annoys me too, and then I'll suddenly lose my temper with her.  Uhm, (Sniff, Clears throat) So it seemed like it was time for me to stop that kind of thing.</p>

<p>But I was just also thinking about how I really did feel I just couldn't stand the resistance.  I just felt I had to leave if she started resisting.  And uhm, just say, "OK, you can be by yourself.  I'm not going to struggle with you.  We won't go out."  Which is essentially what I was saying.  I didn't put it quite that way.</p>

<p>And then I thought how this morning during the work period, uhm, cause I, I'm still concentrating on establishing certain ways of approaching use of materials and ways of thinking about what they're doing with them, and uhm, and you know, the procedures they follow when they're finished, and that kind of a thing, which is pretty tiresome in itself, because you have to really keep on top of the kids uhm, and it can be done nicely, or not.  And today I felt that I wasn't really able to handle it, so I was doing it nicely, and I felt like a nag, and I felt exasperated, and tired, and worn out by the end of the work period.  As if I'd really been fighting with them.  Not exactly fighting in that w—, there'd been battle of will, necessarily.  In one case there was, but it wasn't a difficult thing to handle.  But I don't know, just uh, and the work period probably went better than many days.  But just somehow today, it uh, wore me out.</p>

<p>And uhm, u—, and then thinking about these 2 different things, and how I'd been feeling.  And also thinking about, I guess, the fact that I'd like u—, u—, you know, I almost have the feeling that I want just to settle who's going to be with me permanently.  I don't, I'm getting so I don't care who it is.  I mean I still, I think, care to some extent, but uhm, I don't think I feel I care the way I did at first, because I'm just so tired of it being so indefinite.  And I was thinking particularly of the fact that I'd called the woman who knows the girl, the woman who called me originally about the CHN girl.  And uh, she hadn't called me last night, and I assumed that meant she wasn't, didn't think it would work out.  But then, I thought, well I better call today, because I was going to place some ads in the newspaper.</p>

<p>And it turned out, she just had been unable to call me, and she was even more interested than she had sounded, on Friday, or whenever it was I spoke to her.  Uhm, and it's been left.  I have to place my ads, but I won't place them until f— f—, during next week.  I was going to place one for Thursday, decided not to.  But still I have this feeling, and I said please have, if the girl really is interested, she should cable back, because I just can't wait and wait.  I've been waiting for so many people to decide, and then (Sniff) when they fell through, uh, there I was without having really done anything, and uhm, which she understood.  But still, I don't know, I just had the feeling the CHN girl sounds great if it would work out, but I just have the feeling it probably won't.</p>

<p>And I don't know, I just uh, (Sniff, Sigh) well, the same kind of feeling I've had about all these other things, really.  And then I thought of the fact you cancelled Friday, and uhm, and I was also thinking of the fact that last night, MSCZ wanted to really uhm, well I don't know if he really wanted to have intercourse or not, and felt that he could already sense a certain resistance on me, or if he really wanted me to uh, masturbate him by putting his penis in my mouth.  I don't know which he really wanted to do most, but he said he wanted me to masturbate him.  And uhm, and he also said he wanted to masturbate me uhm, which I just didn't want him to do at all.</p>

<p>But I found it very hard t, to masturbate him, which is sometimes something I don't find hard, especially if he'll sort of leave me alone.  And I fou—, and I found it hard to have this kind of a thing where I wanted to be left alone, and then was doing what he wanted, and (Sniff) uhm, (Sniffs, Pause) I was just trying to remember some of the things I was thinking last night.  Because (Sigh) there were some things that I was thinking that you know, I'm uh, I know I was, but I can't, I can't recall beyond some of the usual things that I've thought.  Like, it's going to take so much effort, and here I finally got into bed.</p>

<p>And very often in the evenings, I, I really don't have a chance to relax until I get to bed, because I'm doing something until I go to bed.  And then I'll try to get to bed early enough so that I can relax and read for a few minutes, or uhm, on very rare occasions, I probably have in mind that I'd like to make love, too.  But usually it's to read.  It's just something I wan—, purely want to do.  But last night, I think I had this feeling, I don't want to make an effort about anything, or be involved.  And it was the fact that he was asking me to be involved, in uhm, I mean, I don't think that was, that's what I lit upon thinking about.  I don't know if that's the fact.  I keep coming back to, then I think of you—, your cancelling.  And uhm, (Sniff) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   All right.  What do you think of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, often I've thou—, I mean I, It's sort of like doing it a negative way.  I've often thought that when you cancelled, oh good, now I can do something, you know, some thing that's been on my mind, how am I going to get it done.  Uhm, and I, I, I just don't have that feeling this time.  I'm not even pretending to think, ok that's fine, because then I can go do something else.  And I, I just feel sort of a void, a feeling of well, I was planning to come on Friday, and uhm, (Sniff) and I don't at all have the feeling that sometimes I feel I am coming here, of, wouldn't it be nice not to have to come every day?  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that, I guess I'm wondering, because it seems to me I was sort of thinking this way yesterday.  Uhm, when you were saying that you were cancelling, I, I'm just not positive about it, but I'm, I'm not thinking it now, more than just thinking I think I thought it and then wondering if this isn't part of it.  That uhm, just when I was trying to think about my fantasies about you, and do something that I was finding hard to do, that I, that I think I was thinking yesterday, involves having a certain trust in you, to be able to tell you them, and think them in your presence, uhm, and then you cancel, as if then you betray my trust in a different way than you would if you acted according to my fantasies.  But uhm, (Sigh) well I'm not sure, I don't know if this is exactly, well, I guess in a way I probably think of it is betraying my trust, or just simply you, I get to a certain point of uhm, oh, I could even I think, be thinking of it as intimacy, and then uhm, you say, "Well I won't be here," you know, kind of cut me off.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well that may be, but you weren't expressing that yesterday.  You were trying very hard not to.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I'm not sure I uhm, what you just said makes me think that maybe you've misunderstood me.  Because I don't think I thought what I just said until you told me you were cancelling, which was at the end of the hour.  So, it wasn't something I was thinking until after I left here really, or you know, directly when you were telling me and time was up.  Unless you mean that I wasn't thinking about the fantasies yesterday, which I know is true.  But I think I had the feeling I was beginning to near the end.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Under relentless pressure?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, (Laughs) well, well, because then the other thing that, your saying what you just have uhm, I don't know, I, I'm beginning to feel confused.  Because now what I'm feeling is simply that, well here I am making a big thing out of something, and playing a martyr in a way, you know, sort of poor, pathetic me.  Look what happened just when I was, well, you could put it, doing what you wanted me to do, or uhm, saying things that were hard, and uhm, whatever.  In any case, sort of your not being here Friday then is a kind of rejection.  I mean, that's the way I'm thinking of it.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, I, I'm, and then I start thinking I'm really not thinking of it that way, and I'm just playing an act.  And uhm, (Sigh) except before you said what you did which made me think that way, I did not feel I was playing an act, or you know, putting on a pathetic role, or something like that.  And I co—, I suppose that's what makes me feel confused.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Uhm, well I f, for the most part, I'm not sure if it's what I immediately started thinking when I was quiet, or what.  But I've been thinking about the conversation I had with the woman today over the CHN girl.  And (Sniff) uhm, just wondering again, if I really want — her description of the girl made it sound it, but then on the other hand, depends on how proficient the girl is with BRD.  And I don't know, just so many things, that it is hard to judge when you haven't met a person, and I don't know this woman, either.  So it's hard to judge her judgment.  And uhm, so I was just, I guess, mainly thinking about that.  And wondering again, exactly why the girl's coming over.  Uhm, I know it's because she wants to become good with BRD, but she also wants to learn secretarial skills, and well, in any case, I was just thinking about all the various things, questions that come up about her.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And keep me in the bank.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Or, wh, wherever you keep your money.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  You know, at first I didn't understand it, but then I realized that's what you were referring to.  And (Sigh, Silence) I, I don't know, I'm having a hard time thinking anything about that, except feeling (Sniff) uhm, you know, sort of wishing I could feel but, which is sort of uhm, doing nothing position.  But wishing that I could feel the way I had last week, when I at first was considering spending the money, and how freed I felt.  And then uhm, I don't know whether it was Friday, or what day, but anyway, when I began to think well, it doesn't look as if I'm going to spend the money.  Especially if MSCZ really is feeling strongly that we shouldn't.  And he uh, uh, you know, especially for anything for us together.</p>

<p>And uh, (Sniff) So then I've got to work out something else, so I feel as if I'm treating it as money, rather than as a special thing, a special thing like being a penis.  And uhm, you know, anyway, giving me special feelings.  And I just uh, I don't know, I, I, I just sort of think, how did I lose feeling that way.  And I wish I could feel that way again, but uhm, I don't, and I don't know whether I'm being resistant in a way I can't recognize, or what.  But —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you didn't want to respond to MSCZ last night.  Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Uh, ah, you know, the thing I think of as why not, I know isn't the real reason why not.  And, but it's what I use, and I was particularly using it last night.  I don't think I've used it so much lately as I did last night.  But I, it was a real struggle to get around it.  And it was, you know, that here I'd been working hard the night before, after we got in so late I had to stay up late working.  And then last night I was trying to finish up what I hadn't been able to do on Sunday.  And I was quite tired.  And uhm, I don't know, just sort of, you know, that state of, look at all that I've done, and now I'm going to have some free time.  And now he's asking me to make love.  Whatever it is he's asking me to do, he's asking me to do something so I can't relax and just do what I want to do.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Right, but you see, you're talking about it as a burden and a duty that you have to go through.  And the question is, why?  Why is that?  Why is it a duty and a burden?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Sigh, Pause) Well, I think of it 2 ways.  And one is simply, you know, that again, I can't feel toward him what I can fantasize toward you, or must have been fantasizing about my father.  And that I, that I, the other side of it is I don't feel I can say no.  That I have to please him, you know that old thing of pleasing him again gets in there.</p>

<p>And uhm, you know, I mean, the basic thing is why I want to even say no.  But then, it just makes it worse that I feel I can't say no.  (Sniff)  And why, I mean, know, I know what we've talked about, of how you can come between us, but, or do.  But just in terms of last night, I, I don't directly, I can't uhm, think it, think of it in those terms myself.  All I can think of is I want to be left alone and be by myself.  Well you know, so like i—, so I can be with my fantasies, I suppose, that he was interrupting them.  I mean, not that I was actively having them, but just he was asking me to uhm, respond, and taking up my thoughts.  And so it was giving up my fantasies for awhile to respond to him and, and do anything, whatever he wanted to do in making love.</p>

<p>In fact, sometimes he's talked about that way, I hadn't thought of it quite like this before, uhm, you know, he's said, part of my trouble is that I don't just sort of give myself into it, and let m—, let it absorb my thoughts, or I don't remember s—, his exact words, but he means, let it take up my whole attention.  And I know I fight that.  And I try not to let it do that.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well I can only think that I must feel I'm giving something up, if I do, rather than thinking I'm gaining something.  I mean when I have actually done it, I know I gain a feeling of closeness with MSCZ, and it's, if, if I really let myself become involved, i, it's never been an unpleasant thing.  But yet letting myself do that, I have to overcome a feeling of giving something up.  And then I can think only that it would be giving up fantasies that I don't want to give up.  (2-Minutes)</p>

<p>Uh, 2 things that were on my mind, one is, somehow it makes me remember y—, the fantasy I had yesterday coming here, and how that then got me on to thinking about the fantasies that I wouldn't recognize I had about you.  And it was that I was thinking about uhm, in a mystery that I'm reading, where sh—, uhm, you're given, actually, the scene of a murder early in the book.  And then, you don't even know if it really occurred until later, and then  you, you know, wonder who did it, and so forth.</p>

<p>Uhm, and i—, the scene was of somebody backing up against a window, and somebody in front of this person with a knife upraised, and because of various things that people were wearing to, to be seen, it was hard to tell who they were and whether they were male or female, and so forth.  Then, but I mainly just think I was thinking about the knife, uhm, and my guess is it was a woman who was killed, and so uhm, I think I must have been also just wondering what it would be like to have a, to be stabbed.</p>

<p>And, (Pause) and also, when I think about it too, today I had an uncomfortable feeling about, well this time there was somebody behind me, and I wasn't imagining actually being attacked and stabbed.  But uh,  I felt very uncomfortable, and there really probably wasn't any reason to be.  The man had been shouting things on the train, and then he blew a whistle as he got off the train.  And I don't know, I think he was going through some thing about being at a swimming place, and maybe being some kind of a swimming instructor, or something.  But anyway, uhm, he probably was perfectly harmless.  But then I could uhm, I felt uneasy that he was behind me, and he wasn't really that close.  But it was a similar feeling to yesterday.  And — (Sigh, Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Here I am behind you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah well I know you s—, pointed that out yesterday, and I guess I, I didn't really think of that part of it, or uhm, (Pause) I guess I, I guess it would be I'm wishing you would do something from your position behind me, whether it's to come out around in front of me, or whatever.  And I, well I don't know, if there's something more to the way I keep thinking of these situations where somebody might be behind me, as you are.  (2-minute silence, Sniff)</p>

<p>Uhm, the other thing that came on my mind just a minute ago, uhm, I don't know, I was just thinking about it again, is that uhm, it seems as if it wasn't until last night and then today that I felt as if I'm coming down with something again.  And maybe I really am on the border, because there've been people sick at school, and FSO's been having something.  But on the other hand, I somehow have this feeling that if I were in the frame of mind to really resist it, probably I would.  And it's almost as if today I've been ambivalent about how much I'm going to resist it or not, how much I want to be sort of sick and pathetic, and therefore, MSCZ won't approach me, and (Sniff, Stomach Growls, 2-minute silence, Sigh)</p>

<p>Mm, and then I was just thinking about the boy from, who just came over from PPI that, there's been some question if we'd keep, who, first 3 days, he came last week for 3 days, was uhm, totally unable to get involved in anything in the room, and just went through all sorts of behavior that would indicate a lot of problems, but was ok on the roof.  And Mrs BBF clearly wants to accept him, so whatever I say I don't think will have any weight, because she's c—, she's counteracted every argument.  And I was just thinking, today he adjusted better, but I cannot imagine having him follow through in any directed activity the way the rest of the class can.  And so I was just now wondering what will happen the first time we have any directed activity, you know, where it means using paper, and so forth.  He just doesn't enjoy any games, or things like that.  But uhm, and I suppose the question of whether or not I'll even try to make him, or if I can.  And uhm, (Pause)</p>

<p>I guess that kind of touches on the way I was feeling today, because it, somehow you know in thinking about him, that, the way I was feeling about everything, of i, in a way I know I really have this very strong feeling I want to make everything be exactly the way I want it, and make people do what I want, make the children behave the way I want, and FSO be obedient the way I want, and so forth.  But, then on the other hand, really questioning whether I can, and feeling too tired, but not being able to give up the feeling that I want to be able to do it.</p>

<p>And uhm, I don't know, then I think back to your cancelling, and I just don't know whether I'm sort of making it all dramatic, or whether uhm, I mean, it seems like it's just an old pattern, that, because I did feel at some point that I was, you know, playing a role, that it's a pattern I really don't believe in anymore.  But uhm, just now when I was thinking about it, it seemed very real to me again, and you know, sort of, things can't be the way I want them to be, but I still want them to be that way.</p>

<p>And FSO, I was just thinking of something sh—, well, at one point she said, "I want to be a man like Daddy."  Just out of the blue.  And uhm, (Stomach growls) I, I said why, or something like that, and she didn't s—, she wouldn't say, so I dropped it.  But I don't know, just today I had this feeling too, that she was trying to make things be the way she wanted them to be, and she couldn't, I mean, even to making me stay at home, and she couldn't.  And uhm — (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>Now, mm, I'm thinking about the CHN girl again, and uhm, I, I think I was first thinking about how I can, whether or not I made things clear, precisely clear to the woman who will be writing to the girl, or uhm, you know, whether I should write.  And then, you know, just sort of imagining the fact that she does come, and how, I would make things clear to her in person.  (Pause, Stomach growls)</p>

<p>I don't know, but then I think of, of uhm, the things I've been saying about my reaction to your canceling on Friday, and I just have this feeling, I guess, that I'm doing something I'm not recognizing, or at least admitting.  And just now I was thinking, well maybe it's the way I'm resisting thinking about anything that would lead anywhere, I mean, thinking about this CHN girl's not going to help me at all in anything that I'm here for.  And uhm, maybe that's some way to get back at you for cancelling, or, or saying, I don't like what you've done.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   You mean, every hour here is so precious.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, in a way, uhm, the other th—, part of it is, if anybody cancels, I still have that other feeling of wanting it to be me, not you.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Coughs) Well, our time's up.

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, my Vitamin C count is down or something and so they put me on, you know, they had me start taking a bunch of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?  Who did that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, my family doctor, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your Vitamin C level is down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was down really low.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What, uh, uh, they checked a CBC or something, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't know, he, uh, they just took, did some blood work on me and [INAUDIBLE].  They said sometimes it's a lack of sunlight or not drinking enough milk or something like that.  They said it was pretty low.  So he had me, they, they started with the, you know, prescription strength, and then after that they just told me to start taking, um, the over the counter ones, uh, twice a day, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  You weren't anemic though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Huh—uh.  No, huh—uh.  [INAUDIBLE] that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And it's just Vitamin C, ascorbic acid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, you aren't having troubles with your gums or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, huh—uh, I mean, like I said, I, I thought I felt fine, but, uh, that's what the tests said, so I guess I better take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's interesting.  I mean, yeah, that's, uh, I mean, the disease associated with it would be scurvy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Like I say, I don't know if you've [INAUDIBLE] the sailors used to get because they had no fresh, uh, fresh, uh, citric fruit, you know, where you get, uh, um, well, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So health, it was okay otherwise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, health seems to be going good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the [INAUDIBLE] 50, 1 a day and, uh, Wellbutrin is the 300.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And Xanax very often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't, I don't want to even take them anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Nah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the sleep, how we doing there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Doing good sleep, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No trouble falling asleep, staying asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean, it's been pretty good.  I, you know, always, you know, seem tired, you know, by about 10:00 when I try to go to sleep, and getting up is a pain in the butt.  But, uh, no, I'm sleeping fine.  You know, I'm not having even to have to take any of the advan, or what is it —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ambien.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Ambien, in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, um, what time do you get up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I get up about 7:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so you get about 8 or 9 hours.  That's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] off that stuff because I just, I do not like to get up in the morning.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Optimally, you'd be up at what time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, I, ideally, 11:00, but more than likely, 1:00 or 2:00, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  What time would you go to bed on that kind of schedule?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, you know, honestly, I'd go to bed at, you know, let's say a weekend, I'd go to bed at midnight and I'd still sleep until 1:30, it's really weird, but you know —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you'd feel rested?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's be the first time I'd wake up, is then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?  You'd feel rested though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh man, feel good.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And now you don't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not, [LAUGHING], you know, during the week, but like during the weekends I catch up on sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's when you get your 12, 13 hours?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [LAUGHING].  Make up a little lost, lost time I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  What, so what are you doing the, after, uh, get off from work, between time you go to bed, what do you —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it depends day to day.  Um, you know, here lately I've been kind of helping my mom with my uncle.  He's, uh, [INAUDIBLE].  He's been having a lot of problems, you know, alcoholism and stuff, and, you know, been visiting with him trying to help out some.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He was in, I thought he went to rehab?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He did, but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Didn't stay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he stayed, it's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Couldn't do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Just went right back at it again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just, I don't know.  He just can't seem to pull it together.  It's real sad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hate to see that, you know, I've went and ate with him last night and God, he's just, man —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is he working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know, don't know how much longer if he keeps this up.  You know, he showed up at the court room without his suit on yesterday, and he just doesn't look good.  He's just kind of let himself go, you know.  I don't know, he's just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Someone's going to put, somebody's got to do something about that.  They don't, uh, judges don't —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Put up with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, and yeah, I kind of felt bad, because I think that would cause more trouble with his wife, but, uh, I had her, uh, give me a suit to take to him, and I kind of had to explain why, but you know, I'm just trying to help, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That he forgot it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, he didn't even remember he had a case.  You know, he, somebody called him last minute and, you know, he's [INAUDIBLE] thrown out of the house.  He's staying at our condo downtown right now.  I don't know man, he's just, he's in bad shape.  But, we're trying and he's got an appointment with, uh, another doctor that you all, you all referred us to by like [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh, I don't know.  We'll see what happens with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, where'd he go for his rehab?  It was somewhere in state?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think he said [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, he needs to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They've got a place over there for professionals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, I'll let your mom know about it.  That's where we send doctors and lawyers usually.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know by the time I heard about it he was already inpatient someplace here in state.  I knew that, uh, your mom mentioned.  He'd been in rehab even before that though wasn't he?  Some other place?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, I, I had never known about it until we got talking last night, and he kind of opened up to me, and he was telling me that was here recently when he got out of rehab, that was his third trip.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I never knew.  You know, I never knew he had problems in the past.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The, um, the place over in [DEIDENTIFIED], like I say, tell your mom there's a place we send professionals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they have a pretty good success rate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In reality, attorneys and professionals in general have pretty good, you know, if they get treatment, their response rate is actually very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, uh, number 1 is because they've got so much to lose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, uh, I mean, yesterday could do it, for, that could do it for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, I'm worried about [INAUDIBLE] his career.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can get disbarred for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let her know, before something else happens, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, definitely, definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because that, uh, we, I can help with that, you know, we can get him in over there.  It's a good program.  Like I said, it's just for professionals.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right, that would be good.  Definitely be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm glad you're better though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am.  I'd say I'm, I'm feeling good.  It's kind of a weird feeling.  [LAUGHING].  But, uh, no I've been feeling real good here lately.  I'm kind of surprised.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's interesting because even before you had, you were feeling this way, you've told me 6 months ago, kind of the same thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm feeling okay —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Feeling pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it's kind of been a long progress [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, you know, even though things happen, they just kind off roll of me, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  You're not —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] differently.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Taking it —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not taking it to heart and —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Let it eat me up, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That when we take everything personal, you know, it's like everybody's on our case.  Nobody understands.  Everybody is just driving us crazy, and that's depression, that's not —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, that will be a good warning for you in the future that if you start feeling like, man, you know, everybody's bugging me about everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I can't do anything right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That it's not them, it's us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  When we, when we get like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Excellent.  So, you're taking the medicine daily?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  When you, have you, have you missed it and then feel bad or sick, or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I [INAUDIBLE] never miss it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's good.  You take them both in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Very good.  You doing okay with the drinking now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, yeah, I'd say so.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I guess your uncle, he's a pretty good, uh, deterrent, isn't he?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's a pretty good deterrent, but, you know, I didn't drink as much as I used to even bef, you know, long before that.  I mean, you know, during the weekend, you know [INAUDIBLE] —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It may be one day a week, but [INAUDIBLE], here lately, it hasn't even been to get drunk.  Just go out and have a few close drinks and call it a night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, back in, here, last, back in December you talked a lot about yourself confidence and your self esteem being not so great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, you know, that's still kind of a, kind of an issue.  I mean, I still don't have a whole lot of self confidence.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I know that and it's something I definitely could work on, but I just can't seem to do anything about it.  I don't know</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it looks like, uh, the, uh, you know, I mentioned before, I think that, you know, success, personal success is going to lead to more self confidence and self esteem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You starting to think about some chances you might take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no.  [LAUGHING] I can't, I can't say that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because, I know you're not going to stay where you're at forever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, huh—uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you won't be able to.  He's, uh, he's not going to live as long as you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, and with the economy the way it is, I don't know, I may be stuck there for a little while longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, it's stable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is definitely stable, I just —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It kind of gives you a base and go from there —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you know, you're in a good position, you could, you could cut your hours back and do something else, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably so.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You doing more things there than you had been?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You mentioned you're helping, you're helping your mom out, is that one of the things you're doing, taking over some of her stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, I, I do what I can to help her, but, you know, she, she's got that whole office stored in her memory, and she's not a very good teacher.  You know, it's like, she's just like, "Well, you just know to do this."  Really?  [LAUGHING].  How do you just know that?  "You just do."  Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's because I've been —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I've been, I've been doing it for like ever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I mean, I don't know, so she takes, she's got a lot on her that she just does herself and you know, I wouldn't mind helping her, but she just, she'd rather do it herself.  Lord knows if something ever happens to her, that's the end of the office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  She needs to learn to delegate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Part of that is because her husband holds her accountable for everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure that's part of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is your mom?  I haven't seen her in a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's doing good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's her health?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, you know, it's, you know, she's, she's feeling okay.  She still in horrible pain with the back, but you know, what else do you expect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's no worse, no better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, not, there's really nothing, you know, she started taking, uh, kind of, what do you call that, rehab almost, something like that —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Where she, I don't know, she works it out and stuff, and it doesn't seem to be really helping too much, [INAUDIBLE].  And other than that, uh, you know, she seems to be, you know, managing better with it, I'll put it that way I guess.  I mean, she's handling everything better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I hate to ask about your stepdad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  You know, he's really been good lately.  That shocked me.  Uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Especially with the economy.  I figured that'd be flipping him out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I did too, you know he has his moments every now and again, but the last time he's really just been horrible with everybody, it's been a while.  You know, he's, [INAUDIBLE] me and him were going to the basketball games —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Really, me and him really got along real good and we still, you know, hang out, and chit chat and stuff.  But, uh, he, he's really turned a corner, I think, to an extent, you know, like [INAUDIBLE] had some serious [INAUDIBLE].  Uh, when he gets mad now, you know, she kind of says something to him, you know, "Well, you promised this."  He'll storm off, but then he'll come back and start being peachy sweet.  So that's been different because usually he'd carry it on for 3 or 4 weeks, you know, no matter what.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That sounds like that's different for your mother too though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For her to stand up for herself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's true too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice to hear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he's been really good to [NAME OTHER], and he's been really good to me.  I mean, he's really, kind of good lately.  So, Lord knows what's going to happen.  [LAUGHING], but —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We need to reinforce it.  Way to go, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks for being nice to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think he likes it because, you know, she's being nicer to him too.  So, [LAUGHING], everybody seems to be happier with that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think you, I think you're right about enjoying to do things with you as a son, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's hard to see yourself as that role?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, not, actually [INAUDIBLE], I think of him as more as my dad than my real dad.  So, you know, that's fine.  I heard him talking the other day and he referred to me as his son.  I was like, whoa.  Okay.  [LAUGHING], sorry.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That was a while coming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  I, I didn't see that one coming.  But I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You still hearing from your bio dad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, every now and again.  You know how it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's go hunting and make you feel uncomfortable, or whatever?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  Uh, he hasn't pulled that on me in a while, but, uh, he'll come in town and have me meet him over at my granddad's and we'll cooks something, or, you know, just socialize —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a few, but, um, yeah, nothing too major change there.  You know, however he hasn't called in a while or anything, but who knows, it's just usually, that's our mutual ground we meet at.  And it's usually, it seem here lately it's been like once a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You go see your granddad much on your own?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], not by choice, but yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not by choice, huh?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, now, next week I'll see him, by George, we're going to go see, go to the Master's, so I'm pretty excited about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You got tickets?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he [INAUDIBLE], but, uh, I don't know, you know, his, his, wife, my grandmother, passed away probably about a year ago now [INAUDIBLE], so I've spend more time with him and, [INAUDIBLE], you know.  [LAUGHING], but, you know, he, I feel like he calls me with random stuff to do or questions just so he can have somebody to talk to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like, we got him a laptop, and like some time ago, and he calls me 2, 3 times a week with questions about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, how do I turn this thing on?  How do I do this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, why did they get that for him?  [LAUGHING].  But, uh, so that, and then he had, and I went over and helped him, uh, you know, cut some trees and stuff like that.  He told me it was bushes.  [INAUDIBLE] okay, I'll come over and help you with the bushes, and it turned out to be trees on a steep hill, and I had to use this rod from like the 50's that you pull the string, and it wasn't quite cutting bushes.  [LAUGHING].  But, uh, we got that done.  Yeah, I'd say I've been seeing him a good bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You doing anything different with friends, or all about the same, or —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah about, well, you know somewhat the same, um, you now, we go out every now and again, but, you know, I've been doing a lot more family oriented stuff I guess —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, married friends and, you know, little kids and things like that.  You know, it's nice to go out and eat at 5:00 every now and again, I guess, but, uh, you know, uh, uh, it, just hanging out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't have too many friends coming around eating all your food anymore?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I, I still got a couple.  [LAUGHING].  One in particular, but he's, he's good though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what happens when you have good food.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess so, man.  I put a candy bowl out and that thing, I have to refill it every week.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's probably just like putting cat food out the front door.  The next thing you know —</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sister doing all right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, she's doing real good.  She's doing good in school, and man, I don't know, she has really been doing good lately.  Really been on a roll.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] maybe even hang out with some friends, and, you know, doing [INAUDIBLE], you know, there for a while she was over at my house every day —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, and I probably see her maybe once a week, maybe twice, you know, depending, but [INAUDIBLE] she seems real happy.  So —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Dose she?  So she goes to school regularly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, goes to school, making good grades.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And last term, she did good grades?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yes, they're very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm very proud of her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's come a long way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Don't feel any need to join her, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], no I still don't think school is my forte.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you want to learn something; it's just not in that format I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you could get it on the Discovery Channel, you'd be all set.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There you go.  I'm more, I'm better learning as I do something —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I can't sit in class and read about it.  That's something I never, if you show me what to do I can do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You need to be an apprentice, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, there we go.  [LAUGHING].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The problem is, you know, you've got to have a ticket to get into some of those things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know that there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you looking forward to much besides the Master's?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE], uh, I don't really know really what's coming up, other than the spring games, Carolina football.  I think that's the day after though, but I guess that's really it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who are you going to the Master's with, your grandfather, anybody else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, just, just the two of us.  He used to take my grandmother, but I inherited those tickets, I guess.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's nice.  Not your dad, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, no, no.  Well, my dad doesn't care about sports except for hockey —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He couldn't tell you two NFL things, so, you know, it's not his thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I hope Tiger's got something left in him to impress everybody like he did last week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Whew, I'll tell you, that was good TV to watch right there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um—hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was glued to the TV on Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Flipping, flipping channels between that and the basketball, like the rest of us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, the basketball games turned out to be not all so great.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, hopefully they'll be better this Saturday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you going to get, uh, your stepdad off to the ballpark watching baseball this year?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], well —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little slow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We, we got the season tickets and, uh —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We went to the first game because we really wanted to see the stadium there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, I think that was the last time we went.  [LAUGHING].  Yeah, we pretty much divvied out the tickets.  I, I did take a couple friends who wanted to go and I'm just not much into baseball, but, you know, I went for just something to do —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Just a little slow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we just pretty much decided it's like watching paint dry.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he don't want to miss his golf days, so —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, is that it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he said [INAUDIBLE] a Friday night.</p>

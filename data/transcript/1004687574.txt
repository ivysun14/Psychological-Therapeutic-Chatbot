<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's big drama.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's from my blog but mostly it's a word-for-word transcript of the entire conversation I've been having with my priest about her horrible, horrible e-mail to me about Mother's Day and the miscarriage and my response to that and her response. I was really frustrated and angry and also a little bit worried that I've been behaving out of line as well as her, so I don't know if you want to read that now we can talk about it now or if you want to read that later and we can talk about it tomorrow. Either way is fine with me. Whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you rather?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd rather talk about it now. I realize it's nine pages, but it's nine pages with 5-inch margins. (both laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll do whatever you want. I can sit here and read it. I can read it piece by piece and we can talk about it as I go. How would you rather I do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's actually in reverse chronological order, unfortunately, because I just did a print-off from my blog where I've been discussing it with a group of friends and, of course, they're all taking my side because they're my friends. 00:01:17</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's see. Right. I can see . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: There should be a small picture or something at the top of each entry. There are three entries.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Here is an entry from May 10th and then going backwards here's one from August 8th, here's another one. I'm confused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No that's okay. Is May 10th the first one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll start there anyway and, honestly, the easiest way for me often to do these kind of things — and I can do it differently if you'd like — is I'm so used to listening things. Do you want to read them out loud? 00:02:24</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, that will be good, too, in that you'll be more in it — kind of what's what.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So here is where this started. I think I've already told you a little bit about Mother's Day at my church and how gross it is with the gender-normative crap. So anyway, it started with a newsletter announcement that really made me angry and here's the newsletter:</p>

<p>"It's coming up on our annual day of service to the women of our parish. We are speaking, of course, of Mother's Day when we do our traditional affair at the 10:30 AM church service and coffee hour in our formal garb. Therefore, you are requested to bring appropriate finger food and to come prepared to serve the same to the ladies. May 13th is the big day. For those of you new to the church, the men of the parish have traditionally treated our women to a gourmet feast of hot hors d'oeuvres and other treats while serving in formal attire at the coffee hour. This is truly clearly a much looked forward to event. Formal attire will be the male dress code of the day. We will make this easy for you. Simply shop now at the market in the Square, and in the international aisle for easy-to-prepare finger food items. Bring them hot. These items must be ready to serve as-is, since we have no ovens. We want to ensure 100 percent male participation this year and an all-hands-on-deck experienced, so we will thank you in advance. Our rector and many other mothers are counting on you ." 00:03:57</p>

<p>And then I footnoted it with fourteen footnotes where I did a close reading, elucidating everything that made me angry about that. I don't really think we need to go through those. I think I've discussed this particular bit with you before. And then there was the e-mail I received from our senior priest, who I've had conflict with for years now over program and being on the church board, etc. You know, when all of this started between me and Julia — Julia is the name of our priest — I tried to separate it out. It didn't start out as oh-my-gosh-I-hate-you conflict, it started out as disagreements because I was on the board and she's the rector and we had disagreements. I confided in her a lot about stuff with my parents, about infertility, about the miscarriage. I shared with her some pretty intimate stuff before our relationship soured, so there was a kind of tapering-off of trust at the same time that there is a ramping up of her bad behavior so far as conflict. So anyway, I got this e-mail from her that says, "Hi [Constance]. (sp?) You are on my mind and heart."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember some of the things that you were critical of that pissed you off about that announcement. I guess I assume those were pretty germane, so I wonder if they are worth going through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. Let's see. I made a snarky comment about men only serving women one day of the year, like the assumption that this pronouncement made. Because, you know, men actually do plenty of service throughout the year. Our nursery there, for example, 75 percent of our volunteers are men. Serving the ladies on Mother's Day, thereby implying that the deciding feature of being a lady is motherhood, so all those of us who don't have children are just pre-mothers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember being kind of amazed. 00:06:17</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let's see, I had a beef with "formal garb" because you know what they really mean is wear a western-style suit, and there are lots of men in my congregation - like we're a third immigrant family and yet I've never seen someone show up in the formal garb of their home country. Formal garb always means western suit, so that pissed me off. Another thing that pissed me off is the assumption that everyone can afford a suit. In past years I've seen some of the wealthier ladies scold poorer men for not wearing a suit, which is gross. I point out that not everyone looks forward to it. I know a dozen people who skip on Mother's Day every year either because they've lost a parent or lost a child or their parents and can't cope with the gendering senseless bullshit, or their mothers were abusive and they don't like Mother's Day. Then there's the assumption that everyone can afford pre-packaged cutsy hors d'oeuvres that I complained about. The assumption that men can't cook and they have to buy frozen food. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even be told where to go to get it. 00:07:31</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So a third of our parish is immigrants and a third, a different third, there's over half but not a complete overlap, or on public assistance so like go to the f**king market? No one on public assistance can afford the market? What the f**king f**k?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Couldn't they have stopped on the way to get their suit dry cleaned?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So then I copied out Julia's e-mail to me. Hi, Constance (sp?), you're on my mind and heart. I'm so aware that we're doing our usual Mother's Day coffee hour this coming Sunday at church and I worry that for you and several other women it can feel like torture. I just wanted to touch that tender and painful place and let you know that I know how hard it is to deal with all the carrying on. Thank God at least we all have moms we can celebrate. Plus I know you are "mothering" a husband on the anti-oppression team, among others, too, so it's not like you don't belong in the company of those being honored.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So in logistical, you made a bunch of footnotes to the announcement about things that made you angry. That's what you sent to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. This is what I posted to my blog under password protection so only my friends see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what precipitated her e-mailing you? 00:08:54</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the next piece of this. (laughs) Her first e-mail was just . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Hey, I've been thinking of you." So she initiated it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She initiated it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it. Right. And you're going to respond? No doubt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I posted a draft of this to my blog and was like, "I am just so angry I'm just not even sure this is appropriate." And I didn't print out comments to any of these. This particular entry got 17 comments saying, "No, you are totally right to be angry. Send it as it is. Don't make any changes." So I copied this out by hand and mailed it to her USPS and it happened that the day I mailed it, a couple of hours after I dropped it in the mailbox and walked away, an e-mail went out to the whole parish saying that Julia's father, who had been very, very ill for several years, had taken a sudden turn for the worse and was actively dying. I hate that phrase. I think it's stupid, but that's the phrase that's used for elderly people in our parish. Whatever. So he took a turn for the worse and he actually died four days later and it was terrible and horrible for Julia. By that point I had left town and I had meant to send her a condolence card but I didn't so this was waiting for her when she got back. So I wrote, "Dear Julia: I received the e-mail you sent me about Mother's Day. While I appreciate the concern you had in sending it, it actually landed quite a bit differently than you had intended. After sitting with it and thinking about it for a while, I decided that telling you how I felt reading your letter might produce more light than heat." I don't know if you're familiar with that phrase, "produce more light than heat." 00:10:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like insight rather than fury.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's one that's used very commonly in the Christian sphere so it's kind of an insider cultural language. "I was rather hurt by the statement that at least we all have mothers we can celebrate. You can't possibly know all of the entire history with my mother and her mother, but I believe I've mentioned in pastoral settings that my mother and I have never been on good terms. In fact, though I don't like to discuss it much, my mother was and continues to be abusive to myself and my sisters, as her mother was to her, my sisters and myself. For this reason, Mother's Day has always been like sandpaper on my skin long before I lost my child. I was still reeling from the above when I read the next line. The concept of mothering Dave feels really oedipal and weird to me. We've always striven to avoid gender-role stereotypes in our relationship and are both keenly aware of the ways in which infantilizing husbands have been used by society to perpetuate sexism and keep women away from full participation in the workforce and public sphere. [00:11:57] And then there is the anti-aggression committee. If you'll pardon the crude imagery, I feel as maternal towards this work as I do towards plunging a clogged toilet. While I understand that caring for small children is hard and dirty at times, unlike a child who would be the outcome of mine and my commitment, the anti-aggression team is a response to sin and evil in our community. It's too late for this year, but I commend to you the idea of having a Saturday evening service before future Mother's Days. This would give those who find the big Mother's Day hullabaloo painful, either because they lost a parent or lost a child or lived with an abusive mother or find the highly gender and gender-essentialist nature of the event hurtful, a chance to feel loved and cared for on a day when it feels like a wider culture is launching an all-out war on us. Peace and blessings, Constance" 00:12:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll read through to the end and then we'll . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you think would be best?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you had said at the beginning that - I want to be clear about what sort of a response you want from me. You had kind of wondered if you were being appropriate or out of line and you said that your friends were telling you that you were being appropriate. You're wanting to hear if I think you're being appropriate or out of line.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Most of my friends said this was totally appropriate. Dave and another close friend of mine who has also had gobs of conflict with Julia and left our church because of it, whose name is also David, but Dave and David both said, "Why did you even bother? You knew this wasn't going to get a good response because this is just Julia. You should have known that this would lead nowhere good." And in fact, Julia's response was nothing good. (laughs) So I don't know if this was out of line or unintentionally cruel. I mean, certainly the timing was unfortunate, although I had no control over that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. Well what did she write? 00:14:34</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she wrote me a letter and then she brought a third person into it. So I will read you both the letter she sent me and the e-mail that the third person sent me. "Dear Constance: My apologies for my slow response to your painstaking and painful letter. It happened to be waiting for me when I returned from the death of my father, and as much as I take the letter and the effort you put into it seriously, I simply didn't have the emotional margin to respond responsibly. I didn't want to write to you in the reactive mode threatened by my emotional exhaustion. I do take your feelings and my role in simulating them very seriously, as I take my own learning curve on matters of oppression seriously. Your letter has been accompanying me, literally, physically, and also mentally, everywhere. I have been in touch with Erica and she has expressed a willingness to facilitate a conversation between the two of us so that we can learn optimally about the gap between our intent and impact. I believe it is important to have facilitation, also to see this conversation, even though it "off-line" to the anti-oppression team as part of our anti-oppression work. Are you willing to meet with Erica and me for a conversation about my e-mail and its impact on you, as well as your letter and its impact on me? Are you willing for me to forward your letter to Erica to prepare her for the conversation? I wanted to write to you by hand to honor the effort and care you put into writing me. I'm happy to receive your response to my invitation and the sharing of the letter by e-mail to facilitate setting up a time with Erica. Yours in Christ (I hope and pray), Julia" 00:16:10</p>

<p>This is what Jessica sent me. Jessica is an older woman in our congregation. She was involved in two previous anti-racism efforts in the late '80s and mid-'90s in our church and was thoroughly burned out on service to our church. She stepped down from church leadership and essentially made herself just a face in the pews. Julia twisted her arm into being the chairperson of our anti-oppression task force, which Jessica very reluctantly agreed to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she a person of color? The reason I ask is because I would imagine she would be on the receiving end of more stuff and that would be part of what kept her out if she was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She is black-Indian. She is a doctor. She has experienced — the things she's told me in confidence — all kinds of crap being a black woman doctor. Right now her primary research interests are chronic diseases in Africa and in the African-American community in the US, so taking the focus away from oh my God you [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:26) and trying to direct some research attention at all the other things that make people sick. (laughs) She went through a lot of crap and I respect her enormously. She is a take-no-nonsense, grab-the-bull-by-the-horns type. So she sent me this e-mail. "Hi, Constance. Julia mentioned to me that you sent her a heartfelt letter. She did not tell me the content. I am aware that you have had some conflict with Julia, so I am guessing that could be part of the story. I am wondering if Erica could be helpful in arbitrating a conversation between the two of you, which would help not only you but our anti-oppression team. The team is problematic with two team members. The lay-chaplain and the rector have issues. For instance, I am really glad that you volunteered to go to the market event and I have learned also that Julia was planning to go anyway because the diocese is involved in the event. Erica said she would like to be helpful to you, and you know she is most of the time on the west coast. She will be here Monday, July 15th, if you have any time then and maybe the day before or the day after. You can communicate with her directly by an e-mail, and gives Erica's e-mail address. I feel bad, Constance, if you're not feeling completely comfortable in our group and I hope this is helpful. Hoping you are having a good summer, too. I'm off now for about ten days for a much-needed vacation. Jessica" 00:18:40</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she wound up in this because Julia talked to her about it although she didn't talk to her about the content of what you read.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I wrote back to Jessica and I won't read you the whole thing, but I basically said that I really appreciate it that you're willing to help out with this. The letter I wrote Julia was about her response to my miscarriage and a "well-intentioned but incredibly tone-deaf and hurtful message about Mother's Day" is how I described it. My letter to her was in response to that. I detailed some of the things that I said. I'm kind of shocked that she brought another person into this conversation, even if she didn't mention details to you. And then a long paragraph about how being in lay-leadership is really hard because you're pretty pressed to serve a number of roles so you're boss, and you're priest and you're pastor and a colleague and it's really hard. I try to keep in mind that Julia is wearing multiple hats and she's better at some of them than others. This isn't going to prevent me from being able to work with her. So, yeah. 00:19:57</p>

<p>And Jessica wrote back saying, "Dear Constance: Thank you for feeling safe enough with me to share the contents and context of your interaction with Julia. I really want to be clear that Julia did not reveal anything other than that there was a letter and some aspect of conflict. Julia brought it to me in the context that it might affect your work together on the anti-oppression team, so I totally assumed with no knowledge that the content had something to do with racism or other 'isms'. So that is why I suggested mediation with Erica." Yeah. Erica, by the way, is a professional anti-racism and anti-oppression consultant. She has been doing professional anti-racism work for 30 years with corporations and parishes and community-service groups and my church has hired her to facilitate our anti-racism team.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she any good at it? This may be irrelevant, but I've certainly heard of somebody who worked in a company like that once and they were like, "Yeah, companies bring us in and they're kind of CYA-ing around the lawsuits." But that doesn't mean there aren't people who are very sensitive or very good at it. So it's probably kind of irrelevant because that's not really in essence what's going on between you and Julia anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think Erica's organization — she founded it — does good stuff and it's not just the CYA, feel-good, backpedaling thing, but I advocated strongly for hiring a different organization before we made this decision because I don't think they go far enough or push white people far enough out of their comfort zone. They are very much attuned to not upsetting the white people too, too much, which doesn't mean it's useless. There has been some good stuff we've done being facilitated by Erica. (laughs) It should be no surprise to you I would prefer a more aggressive approach.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That is not a surprise. My goodness. 00:21:58</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. Was I out of line? Was I so far out of line to require professional mediation?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. This is my best, probably real straight answer about the letter that you wrote. You sounded mostly just mad or angry to me about what she'd said. I remember thinking that you to be attacking her, per se. In other words it didn't get - I don't know what the right phrase is - there wasn't a personal attack. You were talking about what made you mad about what she had written and how it had been very hurtful and giving her some context for that. It sounded to me like it was a heartfelt response to how much she had hurt and angered you with what she had written and what you had been upset about. That said, I have no idea what's usual or socially acceptable in the relationship that you guys have. I'm outside of that. I don't hear you attacking her or saying things that are clearly intentionally hurtful rather than descriptive of your feelings and responses. It doesn't sound wild. It's very cogent. I don't know if there is a way that I can take a position on what you wrote or have an opinion about it, but without having a sense of the ways that people interact it's hard for me to say much about whether it's appropriate. Do people express this level of anger? Is this something that somebody like her would expect? I mean, you sound very angry. I don't know. It's not that I don't want to say, it's that I don't really have a context about that. 00:25:43</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what made it sound angry? I was definitely striving for a matter-of-fact tone. I tried to keep feeling talk out of it as much as I could given the content, which is hard. I think I need remedial help in understanding human emotions. (laughs) I think it's on page 5 or page 4, something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (reads) In the second paragraph where you're saying stories about your grandmother, it's very clearly very upsetting stuff for you. You're clear, in an obviously correct way, that she's in the wrong in her statement about celebrating all mothers and that, in fact, this is a very painful topic for you and you're very upset about it. It conveys how hurt you've been and I think it conveys the anger. It's hard to separate out some of the tone with which you read it from the actual words.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not denying that I was incredibly . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. You were trying to be restrained in how you put it to her. I think partly it's also hard to gather tone and emotion from written stuff like this, but maybe it was something about the intensity with which you make your point in writing, which is absolutely justified by what your point is. For my part, I'm not sure what's the matter with being angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I think there's anything wrong with being angry, sometimes it's hard for me to tell what conveys different emotion in words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The implication here, I think, in a lot of this is that she's incredibly insensitive around terribly painful issues and one can't help but impute anger into that. It's kind of an automatic inference, I guess, that someone is angered or how anger is conveyed. Like if my dog was walking across the street and you were accelerating down the street and I can see it looks like you are going 40-45 miles an hour and it's going to go right through my dog, it's a very objective account, but it clearly conveys feeling. Kind of like that. I mean I think all of it reads somewhat that way, like the idea of mothering your husband feeling oedipal and weird.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that's just a gross thing to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean what in the ever loving f**k. What century are we in? 00:30:59</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is that. What strikes me in a kind of off-the-cuff way is probably very revealing about ways that different people see the anti-oppression team, and this is sort of my hunch. It's like for you it's kind of a shame to have to be on a team like that because this is a horrible problem to have to deal with anywhere, let alone in a big community. I don't mean that in reality this would be any less there than anywhere else, but the idea that it infiltrates such things makes it all the more horrible. Whereas it's as though she sees it as a good thing that the church is taking this on in a responsible way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to drag her kicking and screaming into forming this team. There are so many years of me and a couple of allies fighting her, fighting hard to get this going. This is my project - my pet project, so to speak, if you want to use metaphorical language. I can see how someone might say this is your project that you've fought for and you've been watching over it from its inception, so there's kind of a parent-child relationship there. I can see how that metaphor would come to mind, but then comparing it to an actual flesh and blood child who died? That's just so far out of line I can't even talk about it without crying, even now. So, yeah, I was angry about that. I was trying very hard to keep it under wraps and not be like, "You are a horrible person." 00:33:30</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To have her be so insensitive to so much that's happened to you that's been so painful, including things with your mother, including the miscarriage, including I'm sure any number of instances of racism and sexism and other isms. I just imagine you're so hurt, in addition to so furious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first draft of it that I wrote for myself and then threw away because I knew it wasn't helpful I just tore into her like, "This was such an insensitive letter. I can't believe you thought this could possibly be a good idea. Did you learn nothing about pastoral care in seminary? It was a whole page of "what the f**k is wrong with you?" basically. I think I succeeded in reining that in, at least a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, absolutely. Like I said, you're not going after her here. You're angry but you're not, I don't know what the right Latin is, but it does not sound like an ad hominem kind of a thing. (both laugh)</p>

<p>You're sticking to what happened, to the matter. 00:35:21</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was just baffled that she wants to bring in a professional anti-racism consultant to mediate between us and discuss how my letter impacted her. I certainly didn't intend to go on the attack on her in this letter. I was hoping to make her realized that she was insensitive and maybe illicit an apology. Clearly she felt attacked. She was like, "I want to discuss the impact your letter had on me with a professional mediator." Good God, she's a pastor. I know that the seminary program she went to had three semesters of counseling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. It's not nothing to be a professional counselor . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean to be in defense of my profession. I'm just saying that it doesn't surprise me when people walk out of that . . . that's probably irrelevant anyway. She has a responsibility to handle these kinds of things maturely and professionally and confidently. 00:36:44</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And regardless of ability on the part of the pastor there is also an assumption in my denomination that's pretty universal across different parishes, different states, that your priest is able to handle parishoners with harder emotions to deal with. There is an assumption that priests have the tool set to handle a hurt or angry or grieving parishioner in a sensitive and caring manner. And certainly many of them are not actually skilled at that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. I understand that whether they're skilled at it or not, it's as much a part of the role as being able to give a sermon or know how to talk with somebody in the hospital who is very sick or something or teach a religious school class, or things like that. I think what you wrote would inevitably in some sense put her on the defensive, but that's a completely separate issue from how she handles being put there which, as you were saying, is part of her job to deal with. So I'm not trying to in any way to excuse her responsive behavior, but I do want to make clear that the things you've said here certainly do have mostly implicit accusations of her insensitivity. I'm not sure whether it seems that way to you, but it does read that way to me. You're letting her know that she was insensitive as all hell in ways that should have been really f**king obvious. There is a kind of accusation or accusations here, I think. But that's a totally separate thing from how she responded to it. 00:39:35</p>

<p>CLIENT: I got her letter at the beginning of July and I've been sitting on it for five weeks trying to come up with a response and it makes me angry every time I read it. I can't even think past she wants me to have a meeting and conversation about how my letter made her feel? Well, f**k. I don't know how to respond to her and I know I told Jessica that I think I can still work with her, but every time I reread that f**king letter that statement becomes a little less true. 00:40:34</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want out of this? I don't mean out of talking to me, I mean out of what follows with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I want isn't going to happen. What I want is for her just to acknowledge, "Yes, that was horribly insensitive of me. I'm sorry," but that's not going to happen. I guess if I were to make a list of demands I want at minimum for there to be a contemplative, quiet Saturday night service before future Mother's Days for me and people like me that can't stand Mother's Day. Off the top of my head I can think of a dozen people who can't stand the crap for a variety of reasons, so I want that to happen. I want Julia to stop reenacting privileged dynamics every time we have a conversation and making my life miserable. That's not going to happen. I want her to step off with the anti-racism team, not meaning leave the team but, explaining the meaning of the phrase. I want her to stop dominating conversations. Stop acting like she knows thing one about privilege and oppression. She pulls this card every single f**king time we talk about anti-racism in the parish. Because she worked in a parish that was next to an Indian reservation and gave food and clothes and money to a native American woman who was beaten by her husband, that means she knows all about privilege and power and racism. I want her to stop. I want her to sit down, shut up and listen to the poor people, the queer people, and the people of color talking about classism and homophobia and racism and stop acting like she knows anything.

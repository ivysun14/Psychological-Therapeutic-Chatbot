<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p><b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking about yesterday, how we ended the session and we kind of come into the realization that I feel more disappointed when I talk to my parents. But it's talking about things is something I'm trying to work on. And then I was kind of thinking like, well I've been frustrated with them, but for a long time I feel most of my deep frustration has come probably like within the last year which is when I've really been trying to work on like if something bothers me to speak up and say it or like talk about it with someone versus not saying anything and have it come out in like a passive-aggressive type way. [00:03:02]</p>

<p><note ref="1"><b>"A" begins by referring to yesterday's session. Patients who are in therapy multiple times per week will often pick up where they left of the day or a few days before. One of the reasons psychodynamic therapy involves multiple sessions per week is that patients remain engaged in the work throughout the week, even when not in session. It's the difference between practicing a language every day versus once a week. For this patient as for many, the frequency increases the patients' productiveness and the treatment's efficacy.</b></note>
 
And then I always feel like that's why I'm frustrated and–really before like I thought it was me because I felt like this is something like I kind of need to work on. But now that I've been working on it and could practice these techniques I was hoping that me making that change to learn how to speak when something was wrong with it, they'd be more open to it and I guess now I'm feeling like it's less me and more them. And then that's–</p>

<p>Like it's tough to come to the realization that you're more like, frustrated. But I never really, I don't know, when you brought it up it's just like I never thought of that because like with Jamie, when something is like (inaudible) [00:03:51] them constantly trying to like if something is wrong, speak up. And then with work or anything and then I'm in this situation with them and it's, I feel like in that case it really may just be better to not say anything. So it's like confusing to be like practicing in one sense and then like going either back to that behavior or–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that behavior didn't develop in a vacuum. <note ref="2"><b>I'm unsure of my choice of intervention. A realizes that her difficulty speaking is not simply her problem--"it's less me and more them." She then moves away from this realization, remarking that she can't seem to speak up anywhere. I think I was trying to bring her back to her understanding that her behavior is not "all her".</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a reason that that behavior matched what your parents were like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then like Jamie and I were talking about it last night and he was just like kind of joking but he said "You can't use it as an excuse." I'm like "I'm not using it as an excuse but it's something that like I really have to be aware of." I either find myself in a situation with him or like I find myself like upset about something and not saying anything and then I'm like "Hey, (inaudible) [00:04:51] talk about it because you and him could talk about these types of things, or I'm with my parents. Now I'm trying to talk about things and it's just like banging my head against a wall. [00:05:02]</p>

<p>So, I'm like how do I get that balance and then I think it really shed light on me being like why do I feel like it's me and then it kind of dawned on me 'cause like if I could, not to go with myself but like for me that was like a personal thing that I wanted to develop and (inaudible) [00:05:30] when I, I don't know. I guess I didn't think that it would really fix anything but I thought that it would help. And it just doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well help with what? <note ref="3"><b> I wanted to understand if "A" is speaking of her wish to get through to her parents, which she confirms.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: With them. In other aspects, yes. It doesn't help. So then he and I were talking about it late last night why, you know. He said, "Why are you so upset? Why do you even care, like you're not going to have like the relationship that you want with her anyway so...", which is true and I feel like after I get a chance to process it it's not as bad as it may seem. But I'm still really (inaudible) [00:06:11] like yesterday like offended and hurt like. And then he's kind of the same thing like we're talking, but it's just like, "You know, she always acts like that so did you expect any less?" And I'm like "No, I just think she's like stupid then. If she doesn't want to say something don't wear your ring around." <note ref="4"><b>In psychoanalytic theory, reported conversations as this one between "A" and her boyfriend are treated as the patient's inner dialogue.  Patients discuss particular interactions because these conversations reflect internal conflicts.  In this case, one part of "A" wishes that her parents were different, whereas another part of "A", the position taken by her boyfriend, attacks that wish, "why do you care?" This is why psychoanalytic therapists don't "take sides" when patients discuss conflicts with other people–psychoanalytic therapists view these interpersonal conflicts as reflecting internal conflicts. Taking sides would simply silence a particular set of thoughts and feelings.) But yeah, I just need to work on like processing the information like this. Because I'm yesterday, in fact, my whole day was crap. Like I was upset, I was not in a good mood and then I'm like I shouldn't be wasting I don't know, like my efforts and energy in being in a bad mood because of that. So, and then I get annoyed with myself because I'm letting it bother me so much. [00:07:01] (One of these inner voices is getting the upper hand, the one who belittles her wish to have a different kind of mother. Historically, psychoanalysts have called this inner critic the "superego."</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you got frustrated you didn't have control, like you're wasting your energies in being a bad mood as if you had chosen to be a bad mood and then executed that choice. <note ref="5"><b>I focus on her wish to want to control her feelings.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. But at the moment it doesn't feel like I'm choosing to be that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm not suggesting that–</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're saying "I wasted my time being" as if like "Oh, I should have been more productive." <note ref="6"><b>I highlight how she is being self-critical.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah. And I guess like part of it's like I just don't like being in uncomfortable situations. So I think that's, like I want to be in a bad mood because it makes me feel uncomfortable. But it always makes me feel like unproductive, like I just got out of my desk yesterday like annoyed and like frustrated. And that's not good either. And then I thought like what we sent, like what like, what coming to grips would mean. And then I feel like part of it's just–I know that I'm not having like the relationship that I want with them but then I feel like part of me accepting it is like, I don't know, excepting them in this horrible situation that I don't like and, but I hope that it'll change but I know that's not. But I feel like once like I accept it them, I don't know, I feel like I'm like giving up. But then I feel like I already feel like that so I don't know, why not just be a little more open to it? But, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you feel like you're giving up. What are you giving up on? <note ref="7"><b>I'm concerned about her throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If she's given up on getting through to her parents, has she given up on ever being able to express herself and have her feelings be taken seriously in any relationship?</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I think hope or I don't know like–like for me it feels like I'm almost like settling and then just their behaviors are reinforced because they feel like everything is fine. <note ref="8"><b>This is a dramatic statement: "A" is saying that if she comes to terms with her parents limitations, she is giving up on hope itself. When working with patients it's important to distinguish between acceptance and resignation. Resignation can lead to a kind of hopelessness.</b></note> And I guess like for me to accept it like I can just yeah, yeah, go on, like go on with it or whatever and it won't bother me. But I don't know. I just feel like I don't know. It kind of just feels like I've given up hope and then but I don't care anymore. (A starts crying.) And I guess I like want to care because I want something to change. But I don't, honestly don't think it will. So I feel like I don't like, like I've always been like I don't like things like in the middle, like I want to know like I want to know like are we (inaudible) [00:10:18] or not? Are you mad at me or not? Is this okay or is it not? And I feel like for me to like except how everything is almost like I don't know, just like the end of our relationship but not. It's like the end of me caring and deciding to not care what it feels like. Because at this point I feel like I, like a, like I'm not going to be good with, I don't know. I feel like I just don't, like I don't like the way that they treat me and I don't like, I don't know, the way they handle situations and it never makes me feel good. So I feel like I've just removed myself from it. The (inaudible) [00:11:08] I'm hoping that something's going to change. I know that it's not but (inaudible) like, just like slowly drifting away and not caring. But then I'm like, kind of reaching out like trying to make a change.  (crying more.) Yeah, so–<note ref="9"><b>Psychoanalytic theory views health as the ability to make peace with who people fundamentally are rather than trying to force them to be something they're not. "A" is deeply struggling with this.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel that they need to be different in order for you to be different? (In the next few paragraphs, "A"'s associations confirm this hypothesis. She talks about how her parents inability to change dooms her to repeat their lives.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like they're just not thoughtful. Or like if I get an idea situation like I can be able to be like you upset me by acting this way and they would be, (inaudible) [00:12:04] say I'm sorry, just like here was my reasoning behind it and then you could just have a conversation. Because I feel like, like with my mom like well I don't know this for sure but like I feel I know that one of the reasons is like it's probably hard for her and she's stressed out. But I feel like if she could tell me that then I could tell her that like and hope, maybe she'd listen but like I'm not upset that she's getting married. I'm upset at the way she acts and then maybe she could learn from that and then things would go better like the next time around in a different situation. And I always feel like anytime before that like I've been in a bad situation, I've just like removed myself from it and I don't feel that I can do that like with my parents. [00:12:55]</p>

<p>But yeah–I mean I'm not, I feel like every time I'm around, at least when I'm around them it's not bad. It's when situations rise, I just (inaudible) [00:13:19] feel like we can't talk about it. No one, I feel like everyone just cares about themselves. (inaudible) [00:13:30] me to care about myself and I feel like I'm always, I don't know. I'm just like I'm the thoughtful one that they're not. Maybe? I don't know. Maybe they don't see it that way but - . And I feel like they don't, they don't see it what way. Because we have like my dad getting upset and thinking we're selfish, horrible children because we won't do what he wants. And then my mom thinks we're upset about her divorce and not by her actions. So I feel like they do see me as selfish. And then you can't have a conversation to be like this is why I feel like this because then like they have this thought in their head and they're just thinking one thing. So I'm kind of happy that I came to my realization and now I feel like upset again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Upset? What is upsetting you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just have a feeling like hopeless with them and that I just don't know what to do. I feel like I don't even know what's going to make me happy with their situation because it's not going to change so I don't know. I feel like I'm unhappy like not speaking with them and then I'm happy when I do have interactions with them. And then I know like when we talk about me like being like scared but I don't want to end up being like my father or like what makes me think that it's not me? It's just that there are these patterns of behavior and maybe really it just all comes down to people being able to talk or not. But like my mom's family, my dad's family, it's just so, I know every family has problems but like just no one speaks. Like they are like these, they like see each other for holidays and then they don't see each other for like 10 or 15 years at a time. And then they see each other and it's like no one's close and it's just like for generations like are like every, like sibling, cousin like way down the line. And I just think it's strange but I guess I just don't want that to happen like to me. <note ref="10"><b>"A" is talking about the weight of a family legacy of discord and dysfunction. She then expresses fear that these patterns are inevitable and that she is destined to live a similar life</b></note>. And I feel like what is going on that people, like they lose touch for like years and years at a time and then they're back in touch. [00:16:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Happened to you with who? <note ref="11"><b>I was thinking too concretely. I should have commented on her fear that she will not break this pattern of family dysfunction.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Like with my family someday. Or like are my brother and I going to drift apart as, I don't know. But in my head I feel like it's this something that's causing all of this to happen. And I don't want it to happen to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean something? What's the thing you think is causing it? [00:16:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think part of it's like talking. Where people are like are upset with each other and don't like, I don't know if my mom's brother like he talked to her and then he didn't talk to her for years. And then he lived with us for a couple of years and then he just disappeared. And then it was like three years we'd talk, spend the holidays and then he'd disappear again and then we saw him at, he just kind of fell off of the face of the earth and then we saw him at like a wake and then he was like being very cold and like standoffish. And I don't know if, I don't know why I feel like just something happened that upset someone and no one says anything and then people just fester over it for years like, did someone forget to call on a birthday and, I don't know. But it's like my whole, it's like anyone that interacts with like my family like they're just, they're close and then they're not. And I don't know, like maybe some families are just like that but it's something that I have wondered about all the time like growing up like why. And then, I don't know if it just goes back to like my mom never says anything, my dad can't keep relationships, people find being too stressful. [00:18:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're wondering why they are the way they are? <note ref="12"><b>"A" is trying to make meaning of how her family developed the problems they did. A better intervention may have been to comment on "A"'s efforts to make sense of her family and her experience.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or why or I guess maybe everyone just sees what I see and they don't want to be around him. But I don't know, I just feel like it's very strange and I wonder yeah or like what went wrong. Like I wish I had some insight into knowing why no one is like close, or why they go from like close to not in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well when you say what went wrong it sounds like it's something outside of the people involved versus something about the person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd say I just don't know why. I say this is like a dysfunction in the family and like I want to know what it is so it doesn't happen to me or so I can work on it so it doesn't happen. <note ref="13"><b>"A" is elaborating why it's important for her to understand "what went wrong". She's concerned that she will inevitability become her parents.) But yeah, it's an issue for a later time (This is an interesting comment. Why is this an issue for a later time? In retrospect, it may have been useful for me to have asked about this.</b></note> but it's something that I just, I do and I feel like I've spent like you know like as a kid just being like three years in a row we were with them and then we don't see them for another five. So yeah. Maybe they've all just had enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ask about him when he was in his absence? <note ref="14"><b>I'm wondering if she remarked on his absence or whether she went along with her family's stance to ignore an important part of reality, in this case, the disappearance of her uncle. I was also curious to know how her family responded to her bringing attention to their denial.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. People just go like "Oh, we haven't heard from him." But then like they play into it, like they won't, well I guess it's just probably the situation but like they don't call either. So if they don't hear from someone they just start to let it fester and they don't call and they probably one of the situations where five years go by and then you don't know what happened. But I just think it's odd that you let that happen with your family. Maybe then (inaudible) [00:20:45] I'm that kind of person so hopefully I (inaudible) about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well then you were saying earlier, how did you put it, sort of like giving up hope, that maybe you worry that if you do that, that it will lead to this kind of estrangement that you're describing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that is part of like I don't, like I don't want to be in a situation like that and I feel like they are still my family but I feel like for me, I don't know if I felt there is some sort of like estrangement that either needs to happen or that will happen because I feel like that like closeness that I hope for but I just don't have with them. And I don't even necessarily, I guess I don't even want. If that, if this makes me sound horrible that I don't want the type of closeness that they have to offer because it's like with my dad it's like controlling and it's like you're really only close with him if you're helping him in his store and like doing errands for him and that's how he measures like a good relationship and it's not what I want to do and like my mom's a little different but I'm not as close with her anyways. But I do think there's like a sense of like me feeling like if I come to terms with what's happening then I'm like I've accepted their dysfunctions. I don't know (inaudible) [00:22:31] but that makes me a little bit uncomfortable I guess. But yeah, I do see that tie there. <note ref="15"><b>"A" continues to struggle between wanting to change her parents so that they can be the kind of parents she longs for and accepting them for who they are. She expresses the concern that accepting means accepting defeat.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uncomfortable in what way? <note ref="16"><b>I'm encouraging her to explore her feelings about this.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess like unhappy that, the way it turned out. I guess, I don't know. I think my parents were so judgmental when we were growing up about like other families and where people come from and now I kind of feel like well, I'm just into a family like that. And I don't know if it should matter but–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was something that they had talked about when you were growing up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So like if you came from like a divorced family or if you came from, I don't know, just some situation that was messed up or - . So if a part of me does feel like then it's already messed (inaudible) [00:23:39] so like accepting it isn't going to really change the situation and like in that respect make it unmessed up.</p>

<p>But yeah, I mean even my dad to this day, like he thinks he's like maybe (inaudible) [00:23:58] thinks like this but he think like he's like branded and like tarnished for life because he is divorced. And I feel like, like I'm trying to keep it as normal for him or everyone else. But it's not very normal. And it's not working. Yeah. But I think that, I don't know, (inaudible) thinking like I felt like resentful like, why are you so close-minded to preach those things and now they are, like they are like stuck in my head. And you don't think about them and then I do and I (inaudible) [00:24:49] want to like, suffer is a strong word but–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was your mother like that too, judgmental of other families? <note ref="17"><b>Ideally, I would have taken up her statement about wanting her parents to suffer. Patients especially need help exploring intense, negative affect, such the wish for others's to experience pain (suffering) or even the wish to inflict that pain. It's not clear which "A" is feeling. One of the most important functions of psychotherapy is to help people express and tolerate socially unacceptable feelings, such as rage, sadism, etc. psychoanalytic psychotherapy posits that we experience these feelings at times. My focusing on "reality", asking "A" what was her mother like, deflected from her affect.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes but not as bad as my dad. Like my dad was like (inaudible) [00:25:02] about it. Like so much to the point like a couple of times when I was a kid like if one of my parents had a divorced friend like he would think they had like a horrible home and if I wanted to have like a sleepover he'd question them. But I guess, I just, it's the way that things happened, but I hadn't really thought about them as much as I do now but then looking back, I don't know. It explains why I may process things the way I do but then I get, I just feel really frustrated and annoyed that I'm in this situation. I don't like to feel victimized, but I feel, I don't know, resentful. And I think I feel frustrated because I feel like I'm always like stuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe one of the questions is what to do with this resentment. <note ref="18"><b>How we manage our feelings is one of the central tasks of being an adult and is main signifiers of health or pathology. One of the goals of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is to help people better manage their emotions by helping them develop a capacity to tolerate a wider range of emotions. In dysfunction, for example in bulemia, people try to rid themselves of emotion by a specific action (purging). In OCD, people try to control their emotions through obsessive thinking. "A" tries to manage her emotions by altering the source of her distress. If she can change her parents, she won't feel resentment. One goal of our work is to help her manage the intense affect she has about her parents' character and limitations.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And one strategy you've thought about and have tried in the past is well if you change the situation you'll have less to be resentful about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then I've felt that I've tried to tell them not that I'm resentful but like I feel like I need to like rule out talking in my head because in my head I'm always like well if I, you know, get something off my chest most people feel better but I feel like that's just not an option with them. So I can't. What do I do? I'd remove myself but then I feel like bad about the situation or I feel like that is just upsetting, too. And I feel like the resentment doesn't truly go away. It just makes me feel like less stressed out about it. But now I, I don't know what to do. Yeah I feel like you know, just let it go. You don't want to be a miserable person over it and then easier said than done. I don't know how to let it go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it seems like somehow you feel like if you accept them, that you could become them. <note ref="19"><b>I identify this as an underlying fear which "A" confirms in the next few paragraphs. psychoanalytic psychotherapy pays close attention to underlying fears on the belief that fears often  prevent people from changing and growing.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess, yeah. Yeah I don't know if that just scares me because I don't really like the type of people they are. So I guess I find that, and I don't know why, like I know part of me feels like that, if I accept them I could become like them but I don't know why I think like that because I know that I'm very different. So I don't know why it's such a scary thought for me. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why I think that. Yeah and I just, like I feel like I just want them to know how I feel and I can't tell them and it's frustrating.</p>

<p>But right, so like when I'm feeling like this like what do I do with it because I can't talk to them about it, you know. (A starts crying again.) And then I feel like any, I feel like any solution that I ever have with them is just not very sustainable like, like I don't talk to them. It's probably not going to be, or it doesn't feel like a permanent thing for me or, I feel like I can only like maybe this should all just comes into like acceptance but I can only like ignore certain behaviors for so long until I figure out a breaking point.</p>

<p>And I don't know to not let it bother me.</p>

<p>So it's like that's something I really struggle with. I don't deal well with dealing with them. Like, I don't know. Like I don't know, (inaudible) [00:30:56] I end up like just thinking like over and over like why do you bother to care. It's like he finds this very upsetting and you're like you're not going to end up like them. But I still always end up upset, you know, disappointed. And it's like I feel like I know on many levels that like they're not going to change but yet I'm still hoping for something to be different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are those sort of incompatible thoughts kept separately? Your knowing things aren't going to change but you're hoping they'll be different. I mean those are, you know, on the surface at odds with each other but if they both exist how are they being kept separate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. But I feel like when I'm rationally thinking about it I'm like, now (inaudible) [00:32:10] previous behavior show. That's some like I know that's not changing but yet like my emotions feel otherwise. That's like when the irrational sense kicks in. Just like I know that, I know that, like I don't know but I don't think my mom's ever going to stop telling white lies and like start having like a difficult conversation that she knows that she'll just avoid and like but I don't think she'll ever have a tough conversation with someone. My dad, he's not changing. But I don't know how, yeah. I think she'll separate it from me. And I just have a feeling like, I hope he isn't feeling bad like, like I don't understand why I got so upset because I don't really enjoy the relationships that I have with them. But then I feel like I should because they are my parents. And like part of me thinks like an ideal situation, okay. So your mom would talk to you about things. But I don't find her particularly enjoyable to be around so I feel like why do you care. I know why I care but, I don't know. I just feel like, like Jamie would say like, "Even if your mom started talking it's not like you'd be at her house every day all kumbaya and hanging out like you don't [00:34:01] really care for her as a person", which was true. So I feel like, I don't know. It's like I, I'm longing for this something but I don't even really like it. Like I don't know if that makes any sense. But–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're longing for something much deeper than who she is as a person. (This intervention is too vague which is shown by A's response to it below–she is unable to make use of my comment. It may have helped for me to be specific, that what she is longing for is someone who listens to her, takes her needs seriously, someone whom she can feel close and connected to so that she can truly feel loved.</p>

<p>psychoanalytic psychotherapy focuses closely on what patient's "do" with interventions. Do they accept them, ignore them, reject them, etc. Psychoanalytic therapists believe that this close process attention reflects important information about the patient's struggles.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I just feel so annoyed with them, like their lack of awareness just drives me like up the wall like I just, and then I feel like I don't know, like obviously don't [00:34:52] don't be so involved with what they do and don't do but I–</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe one thing we can think about is what you're longing for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Like I don't even know. Responsible people who don't act like infants. I feel like someone, I don't know, like you can just talk to or hang out with. I feel like we don't have to be super close but the, like the interactions that we have should be somewhat meaningful. I don't know, like I, like I feel like a lot of times when they're like doing things for you, like it's just because and not because like they want to. So like even like with holidays they'll like invite us over and they're very nice and welcoming. But we don't really sit and talk or do anything. She's just like running around in the kitchen and my brother and I are sitting there like–and then she's like bossed around by her boyfriend's family which I don't really care for but - .</p>

<p>And then they get upset if we're not there and then my head, I [00:36:30] up thinking like why are you so upset if I didn't come because we really didn't like sit and spend that much time together. I was just here in another room like hanging out with John [00:36:44] just fine but like we weren't talking or catching up as far as spending time together. I don't know. It's things that like bother me because I'll let these things happen. Like my dad gets mad because we don't go and visit him but when we go and visit him he just sits there and he like cleans the house and goes up in his room and does paperwork and then you're left wondering like, well I made this big effort to come here for what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's easier to think about what you don't like versus what you long for. <note ref="20"><b>I see her reverting to complaining,  a place that "A" feels most comfortable. However, I felt that she was making progress in elaborating what she wants and needs so I wanted to encourage her to continue doing so.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just felt like, yeah. I think normal like, you can call them and talk about something or I don't know, we could have dinner with them and it'll be normal. I think they're pretty simple needs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would a normal dinner look like? <note ref="21"><b>I'm encouraging her to elaborate on her needs and wishes.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Talking and I don't know. There'd be some, I don't know. Like dinner with my dad just conversation, not just complaining about the divorce and how no one wants to talk to him or I don't know. I just feel like we never have anything to talk about. Maybe for me to have some more commonalities with my parents. Yeah. I don't really know. Just to feel more comfortable would be nice. Or just not feel, like in my dad's situation, like the anger and tension. But I'd just love for him, like I'd just love for him to be a happier person. It's like that would make everyone else happier. At least me and my brothers. [00:39:09]. So I guess part of the reason why I get upset is like I don't know what I want with them. <note ref="22"><b>"A" sees her emotions as inextricably liked to her father–if he's happier she can be happier. In other words, he has control to make her feel better. Why does she need to be reliance on him for her happiness? I would have been useful for me to comment on that.</b></note></p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's easier to sort of specify what you don't like than what you would want? <note ref="23"><b>Reiterating a previous comment. This time, "A" is more receptive to it as confirmed by her next comments.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. Yeah. I think that's something I need to think about. I feel, yeah. I feel like I just want a decent relationship of honesty. I feel like with my dad it's more, like he's more harder to deal with. But I think like with my mom, just really just honesty because I (inaudible) [00:41:02]. Like with her it's those things that like drives me away. Like I mean my dad is really just unhappy and miserable and that's, I think he's a little harder to figure out but I don't know. I just feel like with my mom, like the way that she deals with things like really tends to drive me away. And so if she, yeah like if we just had honest relationship it would be quite different. (inaudible) [00:41:41] what to do with that longing. (crying again) Yeah. So like in an ideal place you talk and I just don't feel comfortable talking to them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well in an ideal place you'd feel welcomed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And then I feel like, (inaudible) [00:42:43] focus, like I feel like embarrassed by their behavior. So it's like that drives me away and that's like I feel like my own fault. Because that's me being, I guess, judgmental and not accepting but I don't know. Like I just find the way that she acts really embarrassing, well both of them but and like I think with my mom's thing she, she's lying about her relationships all the time. And she lied like, she ended a friendship like with one of my, with my best friend growing up, she was really close with her mother and she like lied to her about all of these things as well and that ended their friendship and then she just does like weird things all the time. Like when her friend's sister got married. My mom wasn't going to the wedding and then she just called like the morning of and said that she had like the sniffles. And then when I asked her about it she kind of gave me the run-a-round, too, and then I feel like I'm associated to like, these like shitty [00:43:54] things that happen, but yet I'm not involved. And then I end up feeling not judged, but like, like I have to hear how like mom screwed over her friend's sister's wedding. And I'm like said I don't want to be involved in any of this and then I find it all embarrassing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it like guilt by association? <note ref="24"><b>Throughout the session, "A" is talking about how tied she feels to her family, especially how their dysfunction will inevitabilty be hers. She's now talking about how ashamed she is of them. She is struggling to see herself as separate and independent from them.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah I just, I think, I feel like I end up feeling like that a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the saying, guilty of the sins? I thought it was like a brother's, not parents. But there's a saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: uh, huh [00:44:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anyway, don't look it up now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean like with just her coworkers and I knew some of her coworkers' friends and I don't know. I feel like it's the way, I don't think that they mean to be, to make me feel bad, but I just end up feeling very embarrassed that I'm kind of in the situation even though it's her bed that she made. But I feel just guilty to be associated with it and embarrassed that I'm related to that. Or tied to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She made it, and you're not sure if you're sleeping in it–<note ref="25"><b>This is an interesting comment, and in retrospect has many layers of meaning. The expression "in bed together" means that two people are co-conspirators. There are also the oedipal overtones, being in bed with one's parent.

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - if she made it? "A" we're going to need to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I will see you next Tuesday and I hope you have holidays that are not–</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) [00:45:48]?</p>

<p>THERAPIST:  - too stressful. How is that? <note ref="26"><b>The convention of wishing someone happy holidays is complicated with patients whose holidays are stressful and potentially upsetting.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Alright. Have a good holiday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care. Thank you so much. <note ref="27"><b>I'm not sure why I thanked her.</b></note></p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

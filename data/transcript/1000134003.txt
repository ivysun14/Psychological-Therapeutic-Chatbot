<p>COUNSELOR: Session 6, August 31st.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know how productive all of this is going to be because I'm not especially tuned in to where, what we're about here. I've had a vigorous day and I haven't really given any thought and I didn't do that little research project that you requested simply because I didn't see anybody that I could get into that kind of conversation with them. So I don't know what we're ... what I don't know is you said -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We don't know what you want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. I don't see, maybe you have some ideas, something that might be worthwhile talking about. Any thoughts on any avenue?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I'll get thoughts as you talk, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know what to, what to talk about. One of the difficulties in this thing in the way that we're working here, of course, is that you have to work out the strings like him and one last week. So I don't know what it is that we can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you've got 48 years before that, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not going to get off on that one (inaudible - 0:01:23.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Knowing nothing comes to mind just now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you rather not be here now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm really not in the mood for it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's fine.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I suppose I will get myself in the mood if we go on here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feels like being in the mood is, does it feel like it has to be a real serious down trip or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just feels like I have to have something that I can talk about and probably I can't think of anything, I can think of number of trivial things but none that would be, that would really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to forgive some?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Somewhere of a trial line that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some trauma value (inaudible - 0:02:09.9).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. It's a trauma of value (inaudible - 0:02:15.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you can talk about good experiences too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Good experiences. Well, I had some good experiences at work today with all the managers (inaudible - 0:02:27.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had good experiences, you were the unsuccessful but (inaudible - 0:02:33.3) today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's great.
CLIENT: Yeah, that felt good. But I think it was interesting I was exposed to ... you're talking about vocational training ... I was exposed to a good deal of vocational anxiety when my firm hired a younger man to do basically looked to me like the same thing that I was employed to do, but that's working out now I think because the guy is so young, he's 22, and he really doesn't know anything at all. I was worried that I was going to lose my relationship with the, that I handled (inaudible - 0:03:08.8). But I think that's going to work out satisfactorily because I have deals that are on the line that if they ever do work out it wouldn't be crowded for another six months or so on the inside and it will bring in some large fees so that I can justify not only my being there but (inaudible - 0:03:30.2). A couple of those things came to fruition today. I think they came to fruition anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel a little more solid?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I feel a -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:03:43.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, this kind of a job like it's basically a salesman's job in many respects, well, you have to have a good deal of technical knowledge but I think that it's like a salesman's job because if you don't produce the business you're out the door, they give you a pink slip and you're gone. And one of the reasons why I felt so many values is my position previous to this I was not exposed to that, I didn't have to produce the business because I was basically doing nitty-gritty work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this other fellow kind of handed down to me and learning the business at the same time. Well, by them hiring a younger guy they pretty well announced that okay your apprenticeship is over and we're not going to tolerate  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:04:24.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Which caused me immediately to assume the fetal position in the office, oh I can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But in a way it's good because it's about time it happened and just making me a little uncomfortable because this guy is a potential threat, now that he may be a, six month time or a year, and so if I'm not able to produce something, it will be difficult for me. But it isn't all that difficult because I think I can go out somewhere else and get hired (inaudible - 0:04:56.1) too. I think, it's not a certainty at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's threatening on one level but  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, on another level  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - it could also be a liberating kind of a thing because if I do it successfully well as I did the breakthrough and I can move on. And the kinds of things I'm talking about are with the people, I'm hoping (inaudible - 0:05:16.1) work are pretty, are very substantial if they do come to pass why it will be a considerable feather in my cap (inaudible - 0:05:27.2) I hope. But, I really do feel that a lot of, the fact they hired this guy (inaudible - 0:05:35.4) from my (inaudible - 0:05:40.2) in the evening and that kind of work sometimes they got a little tired of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible - 0:05:44.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. They got a little tired maybe I said don't think that anyone of the same in 25 because it seemed that maybe need their dignity in a certain way to kind of, they never did really. I come in late or something or not come in at all it would be sort of sloughed over, but they noticed and so I think that this is one of the reasons why they got this guy they felt well why else (inaudible - 0:06:09.1) if we go out and hire some kid and train him for six, or nine or a year we might have somebody on line (inaudible - 0:06:20.3). And that in consideration and collide with consideration that you got to be put in a position where he can produce business or else probably is a key. So it's very interesting to watch this young guy though to work because he has been with us for about a week or two and he comes in with a lot of big dreams, about the big deal he's going to do and it is all going to be mega millions (inaudible - 0:06:47.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's this new guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah the new guy. I mean he has got the same kind of conception that I have as to start with too. It's amusing (inaudible - 0:06:56.7) to see him go through the same thought patterns that I did and he's going to be disabused of that notion shortly and recognize that a lot of simple work that he has to do and a lot of niggling details that he has to manage too to do the job effectively. I mean he's  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel a little bit  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - job possessive and seeing that there's  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of things that he doesn't know yet. And it's amusing too to see him talking about connections that he supposedly has is the same kind of thing that I did in order to put myself before would be (inaudible - 0:07:31.9) every possible chance that I was going to be a virtual (inaudible - 0:07:36.4) of business for them by virtue of my connections which doesn't happen. Because when you get right down to it (inaudible - 0:07:43.3) that connection you have through your parents or something where all his money is (inaudible - 0:07:51.9). So after watching I feel a lot less this guy may throw me out (inaudible - 0:08:02.1). So knowing is hell though I really don't like this guy personally and for one reason I think that I'm prejudice against him because he would be an Annapolis student graduate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would be a what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He applied and received a nomination to go to Annapolis, the Naval Academy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I went out with him one day and we had lunch and I found that with a lot of his little mannerisms and so would really gall me and I knew that it was a result partly of my feeling of rivalry with him, but I didn't want to show it to him obviously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being above that (inaudible - 0:08:42.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not dismissive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you feel that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Especially not to him. But it's funny because the first thing he said when he came in and talking about how he feels in that regard to me, the first thing he said when he came in the office was he came out of the president's office and something, something how are you and I said well do you want to sit here or the desk over near mine and he looked at me up and down and he said that will do for now. And then I was standing up talking to him he's kind of casing me with a little smile on his face as though we'll see how long. But that won't last if he does what he deserves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you feel like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, first I was, the first feeling was that the guy is a jerk, the second feeling was amusement because of his  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the third feeling  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: - the third feeling  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - was stark raving terror?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no it wasn't. I wasn't that frightened I thought that for anybody to be that obvious would have to spring from some insecurity on their part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible - 0:09:50.1), kind of casing the joint. And then I recognized that I felt that way when I first joined the company although I don't think I was that obvious I kind of looked to size up the guy (inaudible - 0:10:00.8). Well, it turns out we get into it, people (inaudible - 0:10:06.2). But anyway he's not my type of guy at all in many ways and chiefly as I say one of the signs of it is his application to the Naval Academy which I always take to be as a type of guy that's looking for a rule of life and will, that's especially when it's alien to me and will file it towards a little (inaudible - 0:10:28.2) fellow that will follow probably be someone and that was buttress when we went out. I know this is silly when I say that, as I mentioned earlier that would be. But as we were driving out and driving around talking together his, he was really laying it on pretty thick about who he is and what he is  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - and how everything is and tells you he's a great friendly man and great (inaudible - 0:10:54.3), he knows virtually everybody and is related to everybody else. And he seemed so enormously, somehow enormously proud of all that, but I thought the guy has got to be a goof. And then he told me, he listened to Franklin McCormick on the radio and he struck my ... that's all because I hate people that are like that is so imminently sensible that they wouldn't have a thought of rebellion or, not just rebellion, but wouldn't have a thought of another possibility of a value system, especially when it comes to ... And (inaudible - 0:11:31.4) gone through it all and be that way at the age that he is right now, and I especially think about in terms of my own anguish of how he is younger about a lot of this stuff, confusion about it, and feeling attracted to it, I'm talking about the Esquire 54 (inaudible - 0:11:49.5) by enormous amount of confusion and emotional confusion about identifying this guy who is so debonair about the entire matter and experience and say what he liked about Daly but he certainly, the whole list of cliques (inaudible - 0:12:06.0) of this type of person I shouldn't be this much. And personally he may turn out to be the person more (inaudible - 0:12:10.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. When you saw the look (inaudible - 0:12:18.8) what it had to do with was thinking what you're doing now seems so much similar to what you said before that you do and meeting somebody and feeling insecure with them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the feeling, okay, you meet somebody and it's kind of a pairing, I can't even think of it the technical word for it, well also sizing each other up and who gets this round, who gets this game.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Puts one up here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of putting him down in order to feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what I, what kind of sounds like here is maybe  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - well the feeling that you're anxiety, that you're covering up anxiety with really shooting him down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Well, yeah I might doing it. Of course, you have to recognize too that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look at wow the change of even in your voice we talk about that was just totally different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that might be but you have to recognize I think there's a business relationship that you have with someone at the office  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - client or something, it's quite a bit different then a relationship you have one-on-one with a person. Really alls I'm doing with this guy is just looking at him in terms of the function that he's going to fill.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well how are looking, how are you looking at yourself with your relationship with him (inaudible - 0:13:45.3)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm looking, I'm judging him unfairly because I'm looking at myself as a whole person in a certain way and looking at him as a function and then I'm drawing certain unattractive features of his personality out in order that I don't  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: - in order to compromise the functionality that makes him better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Cut him down to size and he'll be manageable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I really feel, and I think you're right about being (inaudible - 0:14:13.5), I really feel it, I dislike the guy because I can see that mental attitude, that mental stuff that he had, should make good success.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that annoys me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really hurts.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. Because the guy is in a certain way, my feeling about him, is that he is in a certain way closed off to a certain aspect of things that I've been very concerned with and probably inhibited my success and it caused me such not grief but difficulty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anxiety.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And anxiety right. Will really effect me close off, that will contribute to his success make me even sound right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's really a battle on a pretty large front.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really a battle on a pretty large front, on several fronts  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - in appearance of it's not only you against him in terms of are you going to be booted out  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - eventually  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - it's also the thing of my god he's going to make it in this damn world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. And he's a goof.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of the very things that I don't like  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and the very things that I'm hesitant to do is what makes him good  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - and that's a pretty large battle.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. You see that often too, I see that  -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see that often.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see that often, I see that often. I think anyone does but I certainly do. Hum?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I see that often in life because I see that in connection with one other fellow that I know that's a very large (inaudible - 0:15:44.5). And he's very much that way too, I mean just right to the country club kind of a thing and sits very well in a locker room at the country club with the boys and all that and deals with the same kind of cliques. In other words, it's like these people take their entire intelligence and focus it on achieving a certain and completely rule out that same intelligence, which is good and analytical and silent, but rule it out in dealing with the rest of the world. So they want to have a firm, a very firm area in which they live, it's not subject to doubt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What can, let's stop that right there. What can you say about that, that (inaudible - 0:16:30.6) about you? What do you feel? Do you do that? Do you  -</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me how you do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel an enormous sense of, I feel that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think there's something far better then that, that kind of life style that country club business.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And dealing with certain let alone people. And so I have a certain contempt for it and I don't want to make myself feel a part of it if I thought that some substance of myself at 50 was going to be at the country club with the boys (inaudible - 0:17:27.3) I wouldn't like it. And I see myself in a certain way superior to those other people who do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: (inaudible - 0:17:34.0) his career (inaudible - 0:17:35.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've kind of made it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just don't think that making a lot of money just like that is, well I don't know I shouldn't say that, maybe it is worth it. But I would rather not if I had my (inaudible - 0:17:49.5), program my life style. There's something it's enormously annoying to me and I guess it's really because I resent people that are able to do it, people are able to go right down the line, sixth grader, they get the B plus and they go onto, they don't necessarily have to do superbly well because when he does really well that takes him out of the (inaudible - 0:18:15.8) considering really a legal mind or something (inaudible - 0:18:20.8). But the kind of guy that can just go along, he's going to make his 50 grand a year, 55 or 65 or whatever it is, and he's so, he's such a, he seems to be in many ways such a prick because he's so, that he should be rewarded so enormously for really doing precisely what he's told.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That gets to do what he wants.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. (inaudible - 0:18:46.8) I had a roommate like that that I couldn't stand and he's doing the same thing, it's just that sense of, that I got from them was their smugness in going down the line, doing everything just right (inaudible - 0:19:05.3). Some of them take pleasure, this roommate that I'm speaking of who I categorize in the same way to the guy in the office, one time actually told me when he was telling a story at school. I went to school ...</p>

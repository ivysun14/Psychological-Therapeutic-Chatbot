<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: You've been more than understanding about the things related to me, so I certainly don't complain. Oh gosh. Very little happened mostly for me. I've mostly just been really just down and sort of...this is unlikely me in the summertime. In the summertime I'm usually...this is the time I'm really active. Like being out in sunlight really does energize me a lot. Like I'm very much sunlight driven. However, I've just been sort of unmotivated to be able to do much of anything. Part of it's health related. I was having a tremendous amount of problems with breathing last week because of asthma. But part of it is just, you know, not really wanting to do much, you know.</p>

<p>[1:09] </p>

<p>It isn't just a matter of not wanting to do much as much as not really wanting to talk much either about things. Or it's really just been—it's hard to explain it—it's been very much, you know, unwilling to take risks and do things that are, you know; it's complicated. I should probably tell you first of all, I don't own a television. I don't watch television.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I watched an entire season of a game show like in two days. Of like some sort of cooking...I don't even cook. I mean I cook, but I don't like "cook" cook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Remind me, why did we miss last week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You text messaged me saying that you had...you said that you had a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, that was...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh last week? Oh yeah. I was supposed to be out of town. I did not leave town.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. I think I was confused. I thought you left town, but the way you were talking about what happened...</p>

<p>[2:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was supposed to leave town, but I was not able to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: After talking with my family and a couple of other things, it was decided it would be for the best if we didn't drive there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Brooklyn was abnormally hot, like 100 degree hot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Their air conditioner was not working the way it should be amongst many other things like that, that just made it for a very very bad idea to drive there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>[02:33] </p>

<p>CLIENT: So usually the place that we try and stay was not available in theory. So things just came together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually, I like to try and see my family at least, because my dad's birthday is the 6th and mine's the 10th, just to go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it just seemed like it was going to lead to only bad things. Although they had offered to help pay for the cost of it, we were running pretty thin too, so it was going to be kind of tricky. So that was pretty much...yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have the week off, still, from work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. What I did was actually just rearrange my schedule so that I was done on Tuesday. We were supposed to drive down Tuesday night. And I just rearranged—I usually work Sunday, Monday, Tuesdays; I'm working Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So it's not really time off of work. It was a little bit nerve wrecking because of my husband; he didn't go back to work really. He took the time off and I thought well, you know, go back in to work, but it was very hard for him to get in to work really. I need to get in there a little bit thought. But I've been sort of like very, in general, just kind of—it really isn't about not making the trip, I don't believe. I mean yes it is true, but we've had things sort of called off at the last minute. Both of us are pretty flexible about that kind of thing. And just feeling just very very down. And so looking more for passive entertainment than, you know...</p>

<p>[04:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you usually are more active in the things that you do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a cooking game show? Really? Yeah. In fact like, you know, 18 episodes in two days. Really? Yeah. So that just kind of is unlike me. </p>

<p>I did make sure that we got some basic things done that I really didn't want to but I knew that if I didn't, it was going to become problematic. The big problem I have is I have to carry the burden for all of the other people in my husband's life who have given him guilt about stuff, and he can't seem to divorce my actions from anybody else's actions. So like if we didn't do much for my birthday, he's like—I'm just like, you know what, we'll do it next weekend. Just things just aren't coming together right now. I'm just not feeling so great. </p>

<p>For him it's like, you know, oh, but we need to be doing something, you know. It makes him feel bad. And there's like all these...I'm like at what point when I didn't get anything or do anything for my birthday, which is almost every year. I mean occasionally there would have to be things, but really not that much—when have I ever been really upset about this? I've never; I mean I make jokes about it like being my birthday week or my birthday month occasionally, but not...I mean I jokingly say that so we can buy a quart of ice cream; not because of like anything big. I've never been like that. And it just...it's exhausting.</p>

<p>[06:25]</p>

<p>You know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm a little confused. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So having to go and do things to make him feel better so that he believes that he's doing something for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. Okay, you're doing things on your birthday to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily on my birthday, but around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Around your birthday to take care of him so he feels better even if you're feeling crummy and not like celebrating or doing anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even celebration things entirely. It's like let's go out and shop for like fun food or you know, let's go out and do this. Nothing really big; just let's go out and pick some flowers, that kind of stuff. Nothing big. </p>

<p>I realized when I was coming over...what the hell did I do? I don't remember. I honestly don't have a clue. I remember going to Target and to Costco. I swear there had to be something else, but I can't remember. I mean these aren't big things. But it's, like I said, a bit frustrating. </p>

<p>[07:52]</p>

<p>So I sort of combined things that kind of needed to be done anyways that had been put off for a long time into your like, "Let's leave the house." "Let's go see historic [inaudible 08:02]." You know, let's go to Costco. That kind of thing. It's not like any of the stuff is really big anyway, but it's, you know. It's real exhausting. I mean it's not like I didn't want...I wanted to be left alone. I want to make sure that you understand that this isn't like a "Please leave me alone. I'm planning to spend the day in bed," and you know whatever kind of thing. I just wasn't really up for it at that point in time. There's a lot of stuff going on and just, and I don't know; just feeling very emotionally fragile lately a lot. </p>

<p>I wasn't really up for any super high risk taking let's go out and do this kind of stuff, you know. Like when you talked about going to see this one like show that is very audience participation oriented, which sounds—I mean I was like well, kind of like well let's not buy anything, but if for some reason 10 o'clock rolls around and we feel like we want to go do it, give it starts at 10 at night, like let's do it, but let's not like plan on it because that kind of stuff like leads to heart ache, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were working pretty hard to protect yourself from heart ache and disappointment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not so much as like wasting money on something that I just don't feel in to right then, you know. Like for me to go out at 10 o'clock and night until the middle of the night involves preparation. I love to sleep. I love other things, you know. I like guarding myself as much as, like, I know he kind of didn't really want to...it's something I wanted to do for a long time; I know he hasn't been especially thrilled about the concept of it, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it?</p>

<p>[10:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's a show called the Doggie Show. Due to the nature of it, he's been sort of reticent to want to go see it for lots of reasons, for which I don't know. He's not especially [inaudible 10:27] to some of these discothèque things, you know, that kind of stuff. I love that it's [inaudible 10:31] in general, so that any rendition of it would be lovely. But it is definitely a production and a little exhaustion and is not seated, you know what I mean. It's, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would have been a nice concept, but I'm not really sure whether or not I was physically up to it. So that's been sort of...it's just been sort of a very in between talking, you know, about various things when I'm with him, really, just retracted in to myself. Really not wanting to interact with people very much. Tell a few [inaudible 11:31] passive things to do, that kind of stuff. Which I mean, on occasion, that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling like this is the biggest over statement really. I mean it's not that bad, but for me, I feel like I'm drinking more than I normally do and not necessarily to get drunk, but it's unlike me to be drinking that much. So like a bottle of wine every few days. That's not like extreme in any way, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's reality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it kind of makes me feel a little bit less than thrilled about that. So I'm just sort of being a little bit more mindful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when was the last time you were this low?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been a while. I've had days when I've been this low; like any one day or three days or something like that...I haven't felt this low in a long time, like for this long period of time. Maybe, oh gosh, maybe like eight months or something like that. Usually I have something to do that forces me to get out of it, you know, with a little bit. But pretty much, yeah. </p>

<p>[13:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a little harder to talk here today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. Not because it's been so long, but because of the fact that I've been so...sort of internal, you know. I haven't really been talking about too many things. But a little bit. I am mostly just frustrated because like I said my life, right now, has been sort of moderately cruddy and a lot of them don't have solutions; not give you solutions at least. It's sort of like playing the waiting game to find out if they can be resolved. And that's just stupid for a lot of them. But it's so exhausting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What things do you have in mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? Like things that are just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which problems [inaudible 16:13] be resolved here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of my turtles has bitten the other turtle, that kind of thing, and therefore they have to be separated until one of them is completely healed because the other one will worry the...yeah, these are not; I mean it is distressing to see my pets fight and having to like keep them separated this long, but like these are not like big things. It's stressful because it's like yeah. I have one animal in my household that is wounded right now, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How bad is it?</p>

<p>[16:48] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's...it's equivalent of having gotten really really bad like for, like, for mammals getting a really really bad skinned knee, but they don't have the type of regeneration that we do, so it's like a...we have to wait for it to be completely healed so that Isis doesn't go after Athena anymore. And then I'm afraid that like...we've tried to reintroduce them when it was mostly healed and it got worse. Like one of them attacked the other one, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean the same one attacked the injured one again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why it happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apparently, this is not uncommon that when one of them has like an open wound, the other one will sort of bother it. It is partially due to the fact that they don't have a space, but it's mostly just [inaudible 17:44]. I don't really know to be honest. It is; there is a lot of theory as to what it is, but one of them is injured on his back leg and the other one bothered it. And so we have to wait for keeping them separated and wait for the full healing process. So it's been kind of a pain having to switch turtles out—who's in the tank; there's a lot of stuff going on like that. These are not like big things. Yes, it is really emotionally terrible to see one pet attack another one really, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think so.</p>

<p>[18:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but it's not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You love the turtles.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do love my turtles. I know it sounds cheesy, but I do love my turtles. But I think I probably have a stronger attachment to my turtles than I do to my dog. I would have, you know, but the...it has been stressful, but none of these things are really that...I mean they're a big deal, but they're not that big of a deal, you know. Fixing leaks in tanks, car making funny noises; I mean these are not the big...nothing wrong per se, but boy is it like; I mean you're already feeling pretty low. It seems somewhat insurmountable, you know. That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>[19:19]</p>

<p>Trying to balance in between like not having electric we cannot afford and keeping the house relatively cool, you know; balancing act. </p>

<p>There is, like I said, to me, some level of risk taking I guess, like I said, in terms of okay so like if I do this then it couldn't become worse. I have very valid reasons for thinking that, you know, if I'm going to do something to fix something or change something, you know, try and keep the status quo because if it isn't, it can become worse. We've had this happen before, you know. Or it becomes like, okay so then because I've done this, then this happens. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like deciding to go and find out why this very small leak in the tank is making a bigger leak, you know. And decide to remove all the silicon and making a bigger leak in the process. Or, which is actually a real thing that happened the past two weeks. Or like trying to figure...just little things like that. Trying to figure out what's making the speakers make this funny noise; tearing all the pieces apart and reconnecting all the components and realizing that like once you've done this, that it's become a whole lot more than you really bargained for. That kind of stuff, you know. It's frustrated.</p>

<p>[21:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you worry about any of that with talking about things here that it will make you feel worse about them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Only slightly. I can't think of any reasons of anything specific, but in general it's something that I...depending upon what it is, sometimes it makes me feel worse and it never makes me feel better, and I wanted you to talk about it. There are a few things like that. And some things, it is helpful. </p>

<p>Mostly things that can never be resolved are the things that talking about it really doesn't make me feel any better about. I have talked briefly in here and I've talked ad nauseam with my one aunt about my feelings about my other one that passed away. It's never going to go away, you know. And my feelings of, not so much inadequacy, but what the hell did I do to be like so much kind of thing; kind of...I don't think it's ever going to be resolved. Like I said, she can't answer me about this. Why in the world she likes being [inaudible 23:08] to her own children? Never will be able to resolve it, so talking about it really doesn't really put it to rest. Everyone kept giving me their thoughts on it. But you know, she left behind a whole lot of kids that are hurting and they feel like they never really knew their aunt, their mother...reminds you of...there's a big gap, you know. Her first born was—when I was 10 or 12. So I mean, probably more than that. So I mean it's a big gap and part of it's, you know, she started abusing drugs before that point. So things changed radically, but you know, it's a lot to bear. </p>

<p>[24:07]</p>

<p>So there are certain things no matter what I do and how much I talk about them, they're never going to really change. I'm not saying I shouldn't talk about them. It's not like it makes it worse per se. There are things that sometimes make it worse because I've...dwelling on it isn't something I can deal with, you know. But I find a lot of times, in general, rethinking things out, and so a lot of times if it's something—the problem is that I have many people in my life who want to find answers for me and not to sound conceited, but if there was a fix to the problem, I would have found it by now. </p>

<p>I mean there is the occasional like total fluke, but really, it's not like; it's pretty unusual. You know, I over think everything. So you know, if I wanted to talk about it, it's not because I need help with finding the answer for it, you know. It's because I'm trying to dump on somebody and most people are pretty good at that. And I'm not really sure how much you're saying something that I can't change really makes things any better, you know. It's...</p>

<p>I think that sometimes when I talk to, say my feelings, is things that especially when they are what I say about how I feel negatively about myself; I think it sometimes often hurts my spouse, which is, you know...</p>

<p>Some of the things I've said recently, because of the fact that I was feeling very old, have been more dramatic than they really needed to be about it. But the point that was is I don't think that he likes the fact that I sort of feel defeated in terms of my life, but specifically in terms of my body; that kind of thing. That really bothers him. I think it's because he thinks I blame him for this. </p>

<p>Like I am blaming him for the fact that I am 90 lbs. heavier than I am normally before I got on steroids. I got sick. This is totally his fault; completely. Where in the world; what leap of logic is this? You know. Now there are things that you can take some serious like, serious jumps to, you know. Like if there's been a lot of emotional stress; yes, the fact that I am having a lot of stomach cramps or this or that. I mean yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's vaguely related to that way.</p>

<p>[26:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be honest though, if he came home and said, "Guess what, we won the lottery and we're moving to Switzerland." I think probably the same like physical responses would be there, you know. It's not just negative things, it's positive things too. I mean like—not the, you know; it's like...and knowing that I am being stressed out by the fact that he's reacting to my stress is really hard, you know. He internalizes everything. It's his fault. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't leave you a whole lot of room. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is why I'm like, you know, I have been really blunt with him about certain things lately. I hate to do it because it seems so mean. But I'm like I need you to leave the house so I can clean. Not because of the fact that what will happen is that—first of all, if he just sits around the house watching me clean, it's really annoying—but then he started...after a while he feels guilty and he follows me around. I'm like, "Okay, so I don't need to supervise you doing this." It already makes me feel like crap that you waited until I started doing this to do this. So yeah; so why don't you just leave and let me get it done, and when you get home, I'll be like elves came in and cleaned up the house, you know. </p>

<p>[28:31]</p>

<p>It brings back unpleasant memories of periods of time where packing or anything else were...like I was physically completely unable to do this. There have been times, even more recently, where I've been sick and I have woken up and it was like the last thing I need to do is like been cripple or sick and waking up to a house that is filled with crap everywhere. And it's not like, you know...I don't think he's so—and I've been talking to him about this a lot—he's so, as much as I say I'm like wrapped up in myself right now, but he's been so internalizing everything that he doesn't see these things like, you know. I mean I really don't believe; I know he's got fantastic lab technique, so I know that leaving jelly on the counter is something that he would normally do or even normally would notice, but he's just so in his own world that it's like; it's not your usual sloppy husband behavior. </p>

<p>I have lots of friends who have sloppy husband behavior. This is not it. This is like literally, he doesn't see it because he doesn't like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not like this is a whole other preoccupation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost like he's dissociated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[29:46]</p>

<p>The funny stories I like to tell are around his dissertation time, because everybody has that kind of thing, where he threw out the wash, like around forget to wash the conditioner out of his hair and walked around all day like that, or the shirt backwards all day or something like that. Everybody knows people that... because you're so stressed out you're not paying attention to your surroundings. But to some extent, a little bit of that is happening in general and it is so hard because it's like I'm asking him to get out of the shell and to talk to me about these things, especially like—the problem is I try really hard to have a lot of patience. I have lots of patience with my customers. I have worlds of patience, really, when it's all said and done with my husband, like, as long as he tells me the truth the first time and as opposed to like these [inaudible 30:41] stories of "Oh, I acted out on Thursday night." "No, it really was Friday morning, but I said it was Thursday night because it sounded better." Like what the fuck? Like—please excuse my French, but where in the world does six hours matter. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[30:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And why does...I don't have the energy for that, you know. So I'm trying really hard to be patient with a lot of things, especially when he's like asking me "Are you mad at me?" I'm like, "No, I am making funny faces because my sinuses are bothering me," or something like that. That I even try to pre-like edit what I'm saying. Okay, so if I'm sounding pissed off, it's not that; it's just that I can't get my ears to pop because I've been having all these sinus problems or whatever problems. You know, but it's just...it's frustrating. It's really really frustrating, you know, and it's just...</p>

<p>There are so many people in my life, partially due to myself, but partially due to the fact that when he's around other people, he is fabulous. He would be best husband ever. In fact, in couple's therapy, you would have never known. Like he's [inaudible 32:01], he's normal; like his family...like actually having the gall to say that they didn't necessarily think that we weren't having sex because he had been so... he had been touching me and been so doting and all this like acting like this. I'm like, believe it or not, you can have somebody put their hand on your arm all the time and [inaudible 32:20] and still not actually affectionate in bed. I know this is hard for you to understand. But you know, and it's just...yeah, it's like...it's not that he doesn't want to; it's just that he isn't home and he just zones out. Completely zones out you know. </p>

<p>Maybe...I feel like I've been really accepting of things—like him needing to blow off steam. First it became Friday nights went out gaming. Now it's Friday and sometimes Saturday afternoons. And this is, by the way, this is the inch and the mile thing that I hate because if I ever really speak up about it, it's going to be bad. Then it became like this and on holiday weekends sometimes things go on like this, and sometimes Tuesday nights. It's slowly creeping itself in and he has no ability whatsoever to...and maybe I am the exact opposite on that. Like I am really good on rigidity on things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>[33:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is what, you know, if I have boundaries, this is exactly what those boundaries are going to be and I'm going to stop. Sometimes he doesn't have that ability to even, ahead of time, think about these boundaries. He goes out Friday night and I'm like, "I would really like to know when you're coming home." And he's like, "When the games end." I'm like, "Okay, all I want to know is before midnight, after midnight? And if it's after midnight, before 6 a.m.,"—not that he's ever come in at 6 a.m.—but like you know, I need generalizations. I'm not asking to be jerky; I'm just saying do I stay up or not?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and I'm not trying to necessarily haul things in, but I just want to know, you know. </p>

<p>He's gotten better about that part. I think he understands now that I just need to know like—I'm not asking big things, just sort of basic; like this. He likes to play video games and this and that, and I know he's super sensitive about this. He doesn't like people telling him that he shouldn't be doing things like this; that it's destructive. I don't think he necessarily—and I hate to say the word dissociative, but—I mean it really is that way. When he's...I definitely say that when he's going out and gaming with groups of people, it's not like that at all which is why I'm usually trying to encourage it, but I also don't like it to take over our lives.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[35:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when he's playing like Civilization and things like that, he's not the only person I know that does this. I know a great number of people...there are two, two Call of Duty teams in my store because we had too many people to play it once. So this is not...I've known many people have this thing take over their lives; not that many women that are getting close to 40 though, you know. He's very sensitive about that. And so occasionally, I do mention these things and I especially mention the fact that I really don't like it when he goes online to get these sheets and specifically like pirating things because not only does the place that offers this also have porn, but also—which is a problem—but also this is just opening yourself up to a lot—I know this world. I used to be in this world. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was white hat, but I knew a lot of very dark things and they are...it just; it opens a door to all kinds of scariness, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For now, but we'll meet tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meet tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will see you then. </p>

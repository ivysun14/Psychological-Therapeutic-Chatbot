<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 9. No, sorry. Interview 7. Interview 7. The building's air conditioned I think. They're just getting it on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd say it's about time. It is (overlapping voices) hot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) it seems like spring passed us again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the building...the school is supposed to be air conditioned too. But they haven't turned it on yet. And we sat there...you know, there's practically no windows in the building. So we just sat there and just died. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) windows (inaudible) broken?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, well, they...you know, they felt they didn't need many windows because of the fact that it was air conditioned. They have skylights and stuff like that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing (inaudible) Nothing a kid could look out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing. No, no, no. There's nothing that they can look out, no. There are two windows...you know, long windows. That's all (inaudible) If you don't sit either by one of those windows, you just don't look out. (laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's intentional device (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. But, at any rate it was hot as hell and the kids felt it too but I just, you know, like, the last two periods I had gym. The gym teacher took them one period and I took them other. They might as well stay outside. There's no sense in staying in there. They aren't going to learn anything, that's for sure. (inaudible) So what's new? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing much. It was an alright weekend, you know. Nothing really fantastic. I did see Tanya both Saturday...yeah, both Friday and Saturday night. It just kind of...it was, you know, it was nice and everything. Friday night I went by and we had dinner and went out in the back. We played badminton and then went to a show, but you know, and then I...you know, I did kiss her goodnight but she had to run in because she had to go to the gym so....that kind of blew that. 00:02:00</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, right. (inaudible) and then Saturday night, we thought we had it all set up, you know? Because this friend of ours is back from Viet Nam. He's stationed at Great Lakes. He got injured. So we had this other friend of ours go out and she lives near him. She was going... she picked him up which was great. Okay now we're going to have to drive him home...well, Tanya didn't have to drive him home but anyway, this one....this girl left early but Tanya ended up driving him home so that blew that. But otherwise, you know, it was okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like he really wants (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. But it just didn't work out that well at all. Didn't work out that well at all. And, you know, it's not like she lives around the block. It's like, you know, she lives in Madison and I live in McLean so really, you know, there isn't that much of an opportunity (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you live by yourself, don't you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she could come over?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, she does, you know, like this weekend she was there. That's where we were Saturday, was by my place so she was there. Yeah (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just the two of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two of you, yeah, right. Well, we were...we were...we had it all planned out and everything but, you know, like we were eventually going to be there alone after everybody had left but it just didn't work out that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) it just didn't happen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it just didn't happen that way. But, at any rate...and she going to be pissed...I was invited this.... you remember the girl I told you I went to a wedding with? Yeah, well, her sister calls and says would you go to a wedding with me and I said yes. Which I shouldn't have said but I said yes anyway. You know, but I....she...I don't know if Tanya will understand that...it just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why shouldn't you have said (overlapping voices) 00:04:00</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, she gets awfully jealous, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. (inaudible) said yes. It wasn't because you...you did want to go......</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I wanted, you know, like I just...I didn't want to see, you know, like I can't say no. You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So but you...but you thought you should have said no because Tanya would get jealous. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. I thought I should have said no, you know, and then that would have....but I couldn't say no. You know, I've known the girl for a whole lot...a long time, you know. She did a lot of things for me too. So you know, I just didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just didn't feel like it (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't think... yeah. Like I couldn't say no to her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like it was just an acquaintance or something, but you know, I've known her for a long time. So...and she was asking me for somebody to go with. You know, she just didn't want to go to the wedding alone, she said. And I said yes. Well, you know....00:04:49</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kind of learning about what's going to....</p>

<p>CLIENT: She won't...Tanya won't say anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She won't say anything but you know she (overlapping voices) side.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah and she...and the thing is that, you know, if she sees this person then she takes kind of a vindictive attitude towards them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Towards them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but she won't say anything to me about it. Which is really kind of strange. I don't know, you know...and I didn't...in fact, when I took Marge to the wedding, I didn't know about it until, you know, her sister said something to me, you know, that Tanya was upset that I said yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you...do you feel like you could talk to Tanya about her being upset about this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I could. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you intend to explain it to her (overlapping voices) ? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you know, it's just a (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought about that too. Yeah, I understand I have to say to her, you know, I just couldn't say no. That's all </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not that I don't want to be with you (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right, yeah. I'll just have to, you know, that's all I'll have to say. But you know, she'll be....I just, you know, if she's going to take out, take it out on me. Don't take it out on this girl. You know, I'm the one that said yes, I could have...I had a choice. I could have said yes or no. There's no reason to take it out.... 00:05:53</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She probably really kind of feels jealous inside. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess probably. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And may also be ashamed of saying it directly to you....I'm jealous. 00:06:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it kind of comes out (inaudible) in her attitude towards (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know, she...I think she kind of feels like, well, this girl knows that I'm going out with Tanya and she had no right to ask me to go to the wedding in the first place. You know? But this, I mean she...she also knows that this girl, you know, used to live across the street from me. You know? And if she can't ask a friend to do a favor then who can you ask? You know? That's the way I felt about it. It's not like, you know, it's any big deal. It's just a wedding. Like many others that anybody had been to. So, I don't know. Yeah, but I am going to say something to her about it. I'm, you know, I'll tell her. I'm going to say well, I'm sorry but that's the way it is. (long pause from 00:06:53 to 00:00:07:09) (inaudible) Tanya Friday, if she noticed any change in the (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel changed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did. I do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel changed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want to talk about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like Saturday night, you know, like what was it? We met Sara and Sara came back to the apartment and Sara said something like....I said something to her and Sara says, well, something like....well, aren't I your best girl or your girl, or something and I said no. I said no Tanya is, you know, and Sara says well, I'm really happy to hear you say that, you know. And that's how I feel changed. You know, like I can admit it now and I'm not ashamed, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not ashamed of it and it doesn't make you uncomfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. It doesn't make me uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're real comfortable with her and she's your girl. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I can come out and admit it openly, whereas before, you know, I couldn't say it because, you know, the hang ups were hanging over my head. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah the hang ups were hanging over your head because you could...felt like you couldn't say she's your girl when by god, you felt like that it would be great to have anyone sexually more (inaudible) 00:08:24</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And kind of if she's your girl, that kind of makes you think, well, she's my girl but I'm not doing all these things that I should be doing with her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's...really, yeah, that's what it felt like, you know, and this is...it's like...it felt like a change. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, some kind of more of a....just feeling more release and more comfortable with (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. It, you know, it feels much better. 00:08:51</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The hang ups, you know, aren't gone but they certainly aren't there as much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's the truth. That is the truth, you know. So you know.... And I just...you know, I just feel more comfortable about the whole thing, you know. 00:09:09</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of more comfortable with yourself (inaudible) relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. And not even (inaudible) like, you know, like....like being frustrated or anything else like that. You know, not even frustrated or anything....like it's a release just to be, you know...be able to say that and feel that way, you know. There isn't any...frustrations. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you feel there and you feel good towards her and you feel good with yourself in that. 00:09:40</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No great anxiety; no great dilemmas going on. </p>

<p>CLIENT: At least that was this weekend. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of, I guess...you're a little unsure of that....how much you can trust it or something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was able to trust myself though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know that's (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was. You know, I was able to trust myself, you know. And just, you know, like...there was...it was really a weird feeling, you know. It was really weird. 00:10:14</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How...how...can you say what you mean by (overlapping voices) ? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know it's hard to kind (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really is. Like...you know, this weekend, you know, like, Saturday and Sunday...well, I just went out to the beach and lied on the beach, you know. And like, you know, and I was saying to myself, you know, well, like I said thank god I haven't had any sexual release in a long time and I thought, well, you know, I thought wow any other time I'd be out, you know, seeking someone. Some other guy or something like this, you know, and I just didn't and I didn't want to. 00:10:59</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just didn't feel that desire to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. It was weird. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of time, you felt like you should feel frustrated (inaudible) but you know you just didn't want it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, right. It was really strange, you know. And it's not like I didn't, you know...I had time on my hands. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not like...yeah, I mean it's not like you could have done....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I could have if I wanted to, you know, but I just...and I said, you know, I don't really want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that's kind of good feeling, kind of to see yourself kind of not doing something that made you unhappy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It really was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like, you know, a battle won in struggle or something like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was really....it was weird. Because I know any other time, I would have. You know? But it's like I just didn't want to so, I didn't. 00:11:47</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) kind of felt different like the other week when you maybe went to the bar (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah. No, he called me up. 00:11:55 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you went.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I went anyway. Yeah. Whereas I think, you know, like....I don't...maybe I could...I don't know what would happen if he like were to call me this weekend. I don't know how I would...maybe I would have said yes; maybe I would have said no. I think I would have been more to say no then, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More than...yeah, that's....more than you would (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: More no, you know. Then I thought why? And I said to myself well, you knew it was...both times that I saw Tanya this weekend, there was no big hassles or anything, you know, and it was kind of a nice weekend. Just all over, you know. It was a very relaxed feeling all over between the two of us. Even though we didn't get together and make love or anything, it was just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right it was some kind of self control (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was kind of like close feeling. You know, this weekend. Yeah, right. And you know, it was really kind of nice and there wasn't anything that came up that arose or you know, (inaudible) argue about or anything. It was really nice. Maybe that was it. Come to think of it. It was...it was nice. 00:13:12 I don't know. Do you think I've changed? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel more at home and more like....just a more kind of resolved (inaudible) what you want and seeing it in sight. Not...I guess I...you know, when you first came you (inaudible) you know what I mean? And that's kind of like you don't feel hopeless anymore. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of feel more at home and things will work out. And you're not so worried about it all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you kind of...and (inaudible) you're kind of feeling like well, you feel you've changed but do I? Right? 00:14:01</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. That's it. I...well, I guess I'm...I should be the only one that should be concerned with it. You know, it's me. (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're the best one to know you've changed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, I....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can tell me how you feel changed inside but you're the one that feels it. (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I understand. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I can certainly sense it. But you know best. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. True. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I mean, you know, what I'm telling you is that I can sense what you say and you think (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I hope so. 00:14:40</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I mean it's kind of like a...I really kind of (inaudible) I just really do feel (inaudible) I can say Tanya's my girl (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) not feel the worries about what it means and what my sexuality means and (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Just to say it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a good feeling to say it. It's a good feeling to feel like you want to be with someone too. (inaudible) Not feel like you have to be alone because of the...you're hung up by your hang ups. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wish you'd tell me that the first time you came here (inaudible) be able to (inaudible) heterosexual life and get married eventually. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I could see that more too. (inaudible) 00:15: 36</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Famous...but you want to be able to (inaudible) closer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, closer than (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before there just seemed like these hang ups just prevent...presented this gigantic barrier that these ideas of (inaudible) my god, they seem just so distant and now I guess you can say that they sense that they feel a bit closer. 00:15:56</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. It would be much easier if they were there but, you know, it's better than...at least, you know, you can feel yourself getting there, you know, it's....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure it is. Kind of like you'd like to be there permanently....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. But just the fact that I'm getting there (overlapping) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) run some in the distance (inaudible) that much closer and that much further away from (inaudible) the hang ups. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I thought to myself, you know, it isn't...I mean, you know, like having these hang ups....I mean if you wanted to look at it positively. I thought to myself, you know, having these hang ups and you know, kind of knocking them down, you know, piece by piece...it kind of gives you...it's kind of a nice feeling. You know? It really.... 00:18:05</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of a nice feeling about yourself (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you can get through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But you never....you know, like I hadn't ever experienced it before, you know, and it's nice having nice feelings. It's rotten having hang ups but being able to kind of knock them down is kind of nice, too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like you feel all the more stronger when you've had a...you've struggled and gotten through. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like if you just feel good, it's like you don't appreciate it because it's kind of like you can't really feel up unless you've been down (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right, yes. Yes. Right. Right. Like even, you know, like it's just kind of carries over even at...you know, like at work and everything else. You know, you have a better feeling, you know, working and stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) just better feeling more positive outlook and better (inaudible) by what you're (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, everything. You know, you just, you know, you don't have any guilt about anything. You're just..... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can be where you are without worrying about what's bothering you (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or what happened before or...you know, stuff like that. Which is really...its' a nice feeling, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess it's kind of being able to live without being preoccupied about how this way or that way. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or, you know, having to answer tot yourself what you did. You know, and if you don't have to, it's really great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's gone. It's really nice. Really nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) saying kind of (inaudible) just feeling kind of good (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh, well. I even caught myself being nasty to a nun which I (inaudible) We went to this....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 00:19:07</p>

<p>CLIENT: I went to this...we went to this bizarre and Sara was working there, you know, and we met these...this one girl who had gone...well, I knew her slightly in high school and Tanya and Sara had gone to school with her too, you know. In fact, she recognized me; I didn't recognize her. And were all going back to my place like I said, you know, and these two nuns were standing there. I said come on along, you know, come on along. They said no (inaudible) oh, come on, you know, we're just going to...we're just going to sit around and talk. Come on let's go. They said no, no, no. This one was really....you know, she was really a perfect nun. She didn't...none of them...they weren't in their habits, you know, and she said well, I'm sorry I've just made other commitments or something like that, you know. And I says, well, you really know how to turn a guy down don't you? And she just, you know, turned herself and walked away. And I...I had no remorse or yield about saying it at all and I thought, well, serves her right. 00:20:02</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of felt liberating (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: If any...if anybody else would have said that to me, you know, I would have felt, you know, like wow. Who knows, she probably hates my guts. Yeah, right, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Cardinal sin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even, you know, like if I...if I even ask somebody to come up and they would have said, well, you know...in the tone that she said it, that she...you know, I've made other commitments. I would have felt, you know, she must really....take...I would have taken that at great offense. You know, like she probably doesn't like me or you know, stuff like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) personal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. But you know, I just didn't even care. You know, if she did or she didn't. And, you know, after I said it..... 00:20:47</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) took it for what it was instead of some great reflection (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, on myself, you know. And after I said what I said and I thought wow, that didn't come out of my mouth, did it? And, you know, then I said, yeah, it did. But I really, you know, (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of...(inaudible) feeling...feeling good? And she didn't have to take it as anything personal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you were your own source for work rather than being dependent. It felt good. You felt yourself worthy, you know, who cares what (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. That's the truth. I'm done being, on top of it, disrespectful. But, you know, (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of the opposite of adding insult to injury. I don't know what the opposite expression would be. Kind of a positive. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It was really...it was unbelievable and the girl was standing there, you know, this girl who we met and turning she said, I don't believe you said that and I said, well.... I said I did anyway. But she was the type of a person that really deserved...it had to be said to but, you know...it was kind of nice, in a way. (long pause from 00:22:12 to 00:22:37) I don't know what else to talk about. I was thinking, like before, and you know about...you know hang ups about sex and everything. I remember when I was younger and my brother and I, and we were, you know, younger and I remember my brother and I listening to my mother and father having sex in the bedroom. And then I thought to myself, you know, what if that's really abnormal? You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I wonder if that's really abnormal and my brother and I thought it was so terrible, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you...where (inaudible) what kinds of feelings did you have? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it was like, you know, we really thought it was, you know, we really thought it was bad. You know? Like something dirty. I remember that. Now I'm trying to think of how old we were, you know...how old we were and I, you know, I don't even remember if we were in grammar school or high school. You know, (inaudible) but I remember it. You know, both my brother and I...then I thought well, it couldn't be bad if normal people did it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) both abnormal. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just kind of interested in kind of like what you're feelings were. That you knew it was something dirty (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that...I remember my brother and I (overlapping voices) yeah....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) from behind closed door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know, like, those...yeah, you know, like they had the room next to ours. Yeah, it was but the door was down the hall (inaudible) and I remember, yeah, I remember us feeling it was kind of dirty. You know, we didn't understand it at all. Then...but, you know, and I also think I remember saying, like, something to my brother, well, you know, they're married. This is what married people do or something like that. I also remember doing....saying something like that to him too (inaudible) 00:24:27</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But somehow kind of saying....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ....kind of rationalizing it was okay but really feeling it was awful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it was awful. I remember...I was thinking about that the other day. I don't know why it came up, but I just, you know, it just came up from nowhere. It was really strange. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew that they were having sex but I guess you didn't know much about what it was. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, we didn't. no. no, we didn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, we never...we were never told about sex. In fact, we learned in a garage. I remember that. And I don't know how.....I must have been maybe...I think I was maybe 11 or something and my brother was 10 or 9 or something. And there was a guy who lived on the next block and he told up in this garage, you know, and he pulled out his penis and he says this is what you do it with, you know, and all this stuff. I remember that and...I remember he wasn't going to say anything. He was going to tell me and he was going to tell me....to tell the other kids who lived down the block. He wasn't going to tell my brother because he felt my brother was too young but my brother stayed anyway. I remember that. But I remember learning about that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how did you feel about....kind of....? 00:25:36</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really strange, you know. We didn't believe it. We didn't believe it. I remember that. We didn't.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) you talked about in the garage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. I remember...we didn't believe it either. I remember, you know, oh, come on now. We didn't believe it. I remember that. You know, it was really strange but I don't know, I guess we must have believed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of see there too, you know, (inaudible) sex as a normal thing of life, just, you know, parents didn't ell you about it. It was too dirt. Done behind doors with plenty noises....sounds ugly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) from a kid in a garage. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of (inaudible) sex is just (inaudible) bad (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember...I remember the first time I heard the word f*** and it came out of my brother's mouth and I remember we were out playing on the street and my sister was there too and she said, what did you say? And he said, well, f***. Don't' you ever say that word again. Do you know what it means? Oh, they said, do you know what it means? And he said, no, I don't know what it means. You know, and (inaudible) we didn't know what it meant, you know. Just don't you say that word ever again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was something, really. It was really something. It was really something. 00:26:59</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) sex was just something never to be spoken (overlapping voices) never to be talked about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That's it...we're....kind of ironic that we're teaching...I'm teaching...part me and this other....this other teacher and I are teaching sex education. And....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) you can really see the good in (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, god, yeah. But we gave them a list of terms. You know to match it up and you know, like, these kids have sex education last year also. You know, and they were 10 years old. And they still set there with blank sheets of paper and they didn't know, you know, like what these terms meant. In fact, I got two wrong myself, you know. I thought, wow. But you know, they still...they still didn't know what these terms meant. The words...what they were meaning. I thought, you know, I wouldn't either at that age. I wouldn't have the slightest idea at that age, you know. 00:27:55</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't even have heard of that word before. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (inaudible) to you the idea that sex would have been (inaudible) just wasn't (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. You just didn't learn about it, you know. And then you know, as far as the parents are concerned and I think it is the job of the parent that, you know, to tell their children and I always, you know, I always thought that my father should have told my brother and I. there was no reason why he shouldn't have. There are...he, again, they're embarrassed to talk about it. You know, they have...they're really embarrassed to talk about it. You know, they can't. And I remember we were in high school and my mother, giving us a book...I think it was by Anne Landers, you know. Oh, here you go. And I and we said, you know, mom it's a little bit too late or we were in high school and she'd say to my father, isn't it about time you took that boys aside and told them, you know, and my brother and I would just burst out laughing. You know, because it's a little late now. 00:29:04</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) and telling you about it (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but even then I thought about it and said, you know, it wouldn't have hurt even at that late of the day. Maybe we didn't...we didn't know something. You know, maybe he knew something more than we did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now did he...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he never did tell us. He never did, you know, he just....he felt alright, well if they know then why should I bother, maybe. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He probably just didn't want to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Want to...right. He probably just didn't want to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) I...my sister...my mother told my sisters and....I don't think she did. I don't think she did. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Strange because, you know, with girls they usually do after (inaudible) told (inaudible) normal (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On they're first period.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Period. Yeah. That's when...yeah. That's when she told, you know, she told. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know what that is. 00:29:53</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. Like I said we're all...well, at least...I don't know how early my...my older sister was always more...she developed early, you know, as compared to...I think, god, I remember when my youngest sister was...and they...it got to be a joke which was really kind of sad. You know? And she would never come out and...well, it came out a couple of times, you know, and she was in high school and you know, at high...in high school age they're very...I find...you know, they're adolescent and they don't want any part of their family and you know, the only thing that matters are their friends, you know, not just....they'll just say oh, don't worry about it. Just leave me alone or something like this and my mother would say god, if it doesn't come pretty soon I'm, going to die. Because she used to blame her rotten moods due to the fact that she hadn't had her first period yet, you know, and I just...you know, and she says oh, god, if it doesn't come soon I'm going to die. If she doesn't hurry up, you know, and all this stuff. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sister was saying this or your mother was saying this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mother was saying this, you know, about my sister. She was blaming her rotten moods on the fact that she was late, you know, in having her first period, I mean. I'm sure...I'm certain she was in high school. You know, I'm certain she was in high school. You know, god we have girls in fourth, fifth and sixth grade, you know, who've had their first periods, you know, but...she would...we were the...you know, like, if you've ever seen the charts, you know, children who arrive at puberty at certain....we were the ones way down at the bottom. So.....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of you were late too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right, you know, we were all...all of us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember you telling me that (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. We were all late. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) ashamed of (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were different?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We were all late. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sex was a dirty thing to begin with but she couldn't even (inaudible) because you were different. 00:31:53</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was different, right. I was different. What you...it's kind of strange what...I even...well, we...I was reading a book on heredity. We were supposed to teach that, you know, and I hadn't had it since college so I was kind of refreshing my mind and it was at an elementary level and I was able to understand it much better. And to think, you know, like as far as the pituitary gland is concerned, you know....pituitary gland is concerned....I thought to myself if it really...I didn't...you know, I really don't understand...I really didn't understand it, you know. I thought well, it might be hereditary also. You know? 00:32:33</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of...it's kind of (inaudible) slowness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Slowness, yeah, of development would maybe be kind of like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of inherited.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Inherited, yeah, right. Because that....I mean, you know, I don't know. I remember...well, seeing pictures of my father when he was very young, you know, he was very young. You know, he was...he looked like a boy too. You know, very, very, you know, small and skinny and you know, just looked very much like a boy at the age of 22 and 23. He (inaudible) pretty much like a boy. My mom is small too. Very small and petit, you know. I thought maybe it must be heredity or something like that since we all had that difficulty. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) your family really kind of a.....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but, I never saw...none of them...we never ever complained to one another about it, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you're too uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah or embarrassed about it, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of just like you wanted to hide and you had to go to school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) have to (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, of course, my brother is...looks much older than I do so I don't know. And he's...has a receding hairline and I like, I couldn't grow a beard or a mustache. It's impossible. Because, you know, like, it just doesn't...you know, like there isn't any beard. There's nothing there, you know. And with also has bothered me also. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It kind of makes you feel like you're not very manly. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, not very manly. You know? Not being able to grow a beard or a mustache. Especially when everybody around you was, you know, and not being able to do that. And my brother can, you know, he does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of feel like now...just right here and now (inaudible) still not manly (inaudible) 00:34:19</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, yeah. Right. Which is really kind of a sad feeling, you know. It's kind of really kind of (inaudible) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Comes with...kind of feel (inaudible) feel that feeling inside that (inaudible) kind of that sexually inferiority (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. Right. That, you know, like that...it has a lot...I mean I don't know if it does but psychologically it does to me, at any rate. You know? If you don't look like a man, you know, as far as feel like one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel like one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of feel like you just don't look like a man and don't feel like one. 00:35:00</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feel like one. Yeah. Which is, you know...and really, that's the way, you know.... like now since I've been coming here I don't that much at all. It doesn't really bother me anymore. But, it really...it did. You know, it was...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For quite a while?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For.... Oh, it was really...it was really quite a hang up, you know, as far as feeling that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I still look like I'm just a little kid...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kid, yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) developed....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like one...well, the girl (inaudible) she says, Christ you haven't changed a bit and I said...I said, oh, you know, thank you and I said well, you must have changed, I didn't recognize you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like...but you didn't take that in a bad way (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I didn't. I didn't take it in a bad way, you know. 00:35:48</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That felt good too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It did. Yeah, right. It really did and I said well, thanks. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just not to be so sensitive and, you know, it's kind of when you have a hang up or something and feeling like you don't look like a man, the slightest thing...if a person looks at you and make you feel (inaudible) and here she was...but you just felt (overlapping voices) didn't take it that way because you just didn't feel (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See that kind of thing can really become a kind of a cycle of pain because if you were to feel...feeling bad about and her to say that you feel worse and that would make you more sensitive. You see what I mean? (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of...the cycle can go the other way too. 00:36:29</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you feel better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someone says something and you don't feel bad about it; it makes it feel even better. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And then...I was thinking, you know, if I...if I did feel bad about it, you know, I just probably would have, you know, like said okay, go to hell and just took it as an offense and not saying anything to her at all. You know, again. But you know, afterwards, you know, to sit down and talk and reminisce and things like that. It was really nice. But, you know, there was no offense at all which was weird. 00:37:01</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's just like (inaudible) just not feeling this kind of vulnerably sensitive and worried about these things, you just (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. And even like getting carded now...it doesn't bother me. Well, I've been carded for so long, it shouldn't....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't take that as a (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not anymore, you know, it just...you know, it gets to the point where, okay, here it is. I... in fact, I...I'm always ready with them, you know, because they always ask, you know. I get to the point where, you know, I don't even bother, you know. But before, at first, it used to really kind of bother me, you know, everybody else would walk into the place and...you know, kids who are younger than you by about three years and then you walk into the place and the guys says, may I see your card...oh, Christ, you know. Especially, when you're...you know, like, if I was out...especially with, you know, a girl or girls, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's kind of (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. And they're younger than you and you're the one that gets carded, not them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like being...losing face (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right, yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like they're pointing to you...that's the kind of feeling would say, boy, how young you look.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. In fact, you wouldn't believe this but when I was coming out of....it was a....it was liquor in a food store and...yeah, Tanya and Sara were in the car and we were driving along...all of a sudden, we got pulled over by the side and we thought it was a friend of ours, you know, and we're waving out the window, hi, Justin. Hi, Justin...we knew this policeman that works in the area. The guy gets out and it turns out it wasn't him and he says may I see your driver's license and (inaudible) oh, Christ, what did I do now, you know. I thought here goes another ticket. And then he says get out of the car. You know, so I got out of the car and he looks at me and he says oh, you look awful young for coming out of a liquor store and we just cracked up. You know, it was really funny and, you know, Tanya and Sara sitting there with their smart mouths and I don't know...one of them says, "How do you know we didn't buy food?" and "Don't you have anything better to do?" But you know, like, it was really hysterical at that point and I thought this really takes the cake. 00:39:22</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you didn't get (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that was years ago. When we met it was a joke. I mean, what else could you do but laugh at something like that. You know, it was really funny. But at any rate...and it...even, well, I've noticed like since I do look so young I have to really....like, well, at school, you know, I can't like when you're first working with kids and stuff like that, I can't leave my guard down and you can't be nice and then they think oh, look at this young kid. I'm going to walk all over him. You know, he's so young and all this stuff. And that's the first thing, you know, they think of and you have to be very stern and very, you know, manly...you can call it manly too. Just say okay and...that's the first impression that they get also or even, you know, like strangers coming in the building, they stop and look twice to see me in the classroom. They think god, he's so young, you know. I just, you know, they all think I'm a prodigy child, that's all. 
Which doesn't bother me. Let them go on thinking that. I was...one time seriously I was thinking of going to the doc and asking him what the problem was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: was something (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Something really wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just physically wrong with you?</p>

<p> CLIENT: Yeah, right. You know, physically wrong. 00:41:03</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it just kind of like it bothers you so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you know, why am I different? Is it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Something wrong with me. Yeah. Because I thought something was really....something was wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had something wrong with (overlapping voices) hanging you up (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I guess, it kind of did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it did. It did. It really did. Which was sad. It was really sad. In fact, I think, you know, like that my parents should have, you know, after they had seen us and we weren't developing as fast and as rapidly as all the other kids (inaudible) even in the kids today. I see the same thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, it's kind of like...you know, like when you feel like more (inaudible) you can see well, you know, that's the way it was and you know, you kind of...but that doesn't undue the effects it has on you.</p>

<p>Client: No, it doesn't. Not at all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like sitting on the bench and (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Stuff like that. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those effects (ph) really have their effects. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they do. They really do. You know, I don't know, maybe they're (inaudible) something that (inaudible) I don't' know but you know, I thought...it would have been, you know, it would have been better for me, at any rate, you know, if there were something done. But at any rate, a little late now. Just have to keep in mind, you know, if any of my children are late developing. Plus I don't...I think....I think my mother did take my sister (inaudible) you know, when my mom found out she was so late in having her first period and the doctor said there was nothing wrong, she was just a late bloomer, you know, there was nothing else they could do about it. I...I recall something like this...she did. Or...no...I don't know. But then, of course....I know she had to go for a physical for school and my mom...I remember my mom saying something to my older sister about her asking about Debbie, but you know, she said she didn't ask while Debbie was there. And I thought, well, why not? She...you know, it's her body she knows what.... 00:43:23</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. You know, she knows what the score is. (inaudible) That's...you know, it's kind of lousy that they weren't more open up about sex, you know. Of course, now they are, you know, it's...but now that we're grown it's nothing to talk about, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, it's kind of like (overlapping voices) when it's </p>

<p>CLIENT: When it was needed it wasn't there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now kind of you really can look back and say it really might have made a difference. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. 00:44:01 Now it's, you know...it's nothing to say anything about it. In fact, the other...you know my mom was saying something about, you know, she had gone to the doctors and she thought she had a lump on her breast and I thought wow, you know, she's telling me about this and I, you know....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mentioning the word breast.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Breast, you know, and I thought oh, Christ, you know and she had mentioned this and I thought wow, you know...and then I thought well, why shouldn't she, you know? It was really....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She...there was no reason why she shouldn't but it's so different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was so different. It really was. There was...yeah, right. There's no reason why she shouldn't, but to hear her say it, you know. The word breast, you know...that she had gone to the doctor and she was (inaudible) breast (inaudible) and you know, well, maybe I....I don't remember...no she said she was going...she said she went to the doctor and I think I asked why or something...maybe that's what it was. But I remember, you know, her saying that and I thought wow, you know. But...I...I think she...they realize (inaudible) that the times have changed. Since we were children and a lot of the things are happening...we know our kids are much more aware...well, they're...they realize that kids are much more aware of it which came a little late as usual. 00:45:17 (quiet to 00:45:34) There's something....oh, I know...there... when...also I was thinking of when I was young and we were in...I was in grade school, late in grade school...I think it was seventh grade and there's a good friend who used to live down the block from me and he was a real good friend and...and he had...yeah, he had out in his back yard this...it was like a...it wasn't like...you know how they have playhouses in the back...but it wasn't like a playhouse it was like...his father built it, you know. It was like a regular house. It was like a small...it was like a miniature house, you know, and we used to stay out there...you know, on summer nights we used to go over there, you know, and they had....sleep in...I think there was a bed or a sleeping bag or something like this, you know, and I remember him....I remember saying, you know, well, we...it was hot or something and saying, you know, rubbing one another's back and then I remember rubbing one another you know and...remember playing with one another, you know, and but in seventh or eighth grade, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Playing (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, you know, the penis. And I remember, you know...I remember that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feel kind of ashamed (overlapping voices)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was...yeah, it was...I felt ashamed about that too, you know. But I don't...you know, like I don't remember what...like we...you know, like it was...we never...never ever saying anything about it, you know, like to one another. 00:47:09</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like (inaudible) I was kind of struck because I wasn't sure what you meant by (inaudible) feeling uncomfortable really saying it to me (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, saying well, rubbing each others you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. We were....I was embarrassed about it. But then I was trying to remember...we never said anything to one another about it, you know, like we just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kind of unspeak (ph) (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was unspeakable. Yeah, right. We never said anything to one another about it, you know. Then we went into high school and (inaudible) saw one another that often afterwards. I remember that too. You know, it's funny...it's really weird how all these things come up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They all...they kind of...it does seem like they're all part of the whole (overlapping voices) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in. (pause) </p>

<p><p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, thank you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Phew, I'm tired. I always think to walk here [is going to be] (ph) and it really does. Phew. I met my new nephew. He's so cute. We are kind of obsessed with him; he's that heavenly. Phew. Takes me a minute. What should we talk about? (whispers, inaudible) I never know where to start. (inaudible) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This weekend Chris and I were talking about his frustration – he's been really grouchy – and just about not getting a job and he kind of has an overlying grouch effect that exists at all times. And he sometimes gets mad for very little – it takes very little to make him angry and cause a fight. And I was explaining to him that – he's like, "Yeah, I know that I'm difficult to be around right now and I know that I'm not the most pleasant," and I just explained that I feel like I'm really reactive in those situations because it brings back a lot of these feelings of living with this person who you know is mad about something else but for some reason is going to – just watch what you do because you could tick him off and they're going to get mad at you. And I was just like, you know, I said, "I just ..." – because he gets mad when we get in a fight and then I stop talking. But there's just – a lot of times I just know that he's not mad at me; he's mad about something else. And for me, I resort back to these feelings of "Screw you. I'm not – this isn't about me, so leave me be." And instead of being rational and focused on those, trying to explain myself, I just stop talking and then he gets more and more mad and I end up smirking and kind of smiling and that is really frustrating for him. And I was just explaining to him that it's just – I mean – anyway. I don't think he understood but that's (inaudible at 0:02:58). (Sighs heavily)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So when you are smirking when you – what's going on for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just think he's being ridiculous. I just can't even help it either. It's just like I physically can't do anything but smile. For some reason, I just get the urge to smile. It's not even – it's not like I'm consciously thinking, "This is funny," but I just can't – I just stop smiling. I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's that I'm – I don't know what it is but I just start smiling. And I try not to but I just can't. It's not when we're having an argument; it's when he – and it happens when I'm in an argument with anybody. It's when the other person is so wound up and out of control and that I know that there's – it's when I'm not saying anything and the other person is so wound up that I just start smiling. I don't know. I think – I mean that's – my dad used to get really wound up like that. He'd just – sort of a spinning top. And for some reason, in the moments that it wasn't scary – because I found it funny or – I don't know. Or maybe I did think it was – I don't know. But I remember thinking, "You look like an idiot"; just as a kid thinking that. Like this person is so out of control and thinking, "Oh, my gosh," and kind of I think I took pleasure in seeing him lose his cool and not being able to get a grasp on it. And so I think I really enjoyed that. And so I think maybe that seeing other people now kind of lose their cool, I think like, (chuckling) "Oh, look at you." Maybe I get something – I don't know, some sort of pleasure out of seeing other people kind of lose it, for whatever reason. Yeah, I don't know. [0:05:20]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Because it does – it has this satisfying feeling to me. I remember – I'm thinking about just watching my dad in those moments where he would just kind of – it felt like maybe because I was trying to set him off and so finally it'd be like, "Aha!" or I don't know. I wish I could really think of a specific instance that I could remember but I just remember feeling really satisfied when he lost it. Certain times, obviously; not always.</p>

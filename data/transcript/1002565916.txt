<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you were saying, as we got started, that it sounds like the weekend, things were really rocky.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially around the time of your birthday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, let's see, um, the last couple of months like with, and I don't know whether it has anything to do with the birth control pill I'm on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but like around the third of the pill I'll feel like a little depressed, but nothing like I felt this past weekend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Friday night, let's see, I went out with some friends from work, and, um, I started to feel immediately really like, um, oh gosh, like, um, worthless and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you guys went out, where did you go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To a bar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Had you been drinking at that point?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was getting ready to have a couple of drinks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but you hadn't had any yet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it wasn't the alcohol kicking in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The atmosphere was kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Real affected me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, and then I had a couple of drinks and then I went home and, um, well I decided to drive by my ex boyfriend's house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I didn't stop or anything, I just drove by, and then I got home and I was hungry, so I ate.  And the next morning I got up, and I was doing fine and then I, I tried to, I wanted to get some stuff done, and I headed out to do some errands, and while I was out I started to really feel like, um, anxious.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I mean almost panicky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean I just, I felt like everybody was looking at me, and I just, I felt horrible.  I mean I just felt horrible, and I got back home, and I tried to get myself, I mean, oh, what did I do?  I took my medication like I normally do and then I took an anxiety pill—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To calm myself down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  You did the right thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and so I hung around the house a little bit and then I thought I got to go out.  I have to go to the grocery store.  I have to go to the food store or whatever.  I have to go out.  And so I managed to go out and I managed to, and I thought let me go to the video store and get, uh, a video, something funny or something, and, um, but by the time I got home, I mean I basically broke down in tears.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and then I went to the medicine cabinet and I looked at the ibuprofen, uh, bottle and I poured that on the bed, and then I thought well no, no, I can't, I can't, I can't commit suicide, I can't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This is serious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you should call the office and they can page me immediately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I thought of that, and then [NAME OTHER] told me, she said whenever you get to this point, call me and I thought about doing both and I thought, I thought no, I felt guilty about doing that.  I thought no and then I thought about this old friend I had who did commit suicide.  I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my Lord.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I thought no, I said I can't, you know, do what she did because she killed herself right around her birthday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I go no I can't do that either.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and then I just thought, you know, I feel guilty.  I can't do this.  I can't do that.  You know, I can't do this to my family, and then I tried to talk myself into mentally like trying to change my mood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I thought let me get something to eat.  Let me eat something and then, and then I, once I ate and I took my medicine and I felt better—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I watched the movie, got through that and then went to bed.  And Sunday, I got up and I was feeling fine Sunday, and then it all did it all over again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so, um, I got through Sunday, Sunday night and yesterday when I went to work, I immediately told myself okay, maybe I, you know, just, you know, eat, just make sure you eat.  No matter what it is, just try and eat as, you know, food whenever you think, you know, just try and keep yourself fed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I started kind of feeling depressed and panicky, so I took my anxiety pill yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So today's feeling a little bit better.  Well this morning I was like oh, and then, um, but this afternoon I've been, and plus now I have my period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, but it's just, um, I mean, you know, I'm thinking should I just stop taking the birth control because I was telling my doctor about it, and she goes well see what you say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I said well maybe I'm going through menopause.  She goes you're too young to go through menopause.  I'm like okay, but it's just, I mean I, I haven't felt like I did Saturday in a long time.  I mean I just, I know I should have called people, but I just, I didn't, I didn't want to bother anybody.  That was the thought I kept thinking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well we're here to help—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you start to feel that way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, and then I felt, and then I thought well if I do, if I do decide to, you know, end it, I just, I'll feel guilty for doing that.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you thought it through.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, it's not a crime to dump it out on your bed and think about wow, that's a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the process that went through my mind was my gosh, my friend did this to herself and you all felt terrible about it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was around her birthday.  That's a vulnerable time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's almost like you contracted for safety with yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like oh I can't bring myself to do this.  The important thing is you're letting me know.  You're letting [NAME OTHER] know, and we're looking at all the factors that could be going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, did you recently have a change in your birth control pill because I know you were looking at that and thinking about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um, I don't even have it on me.  It's the, um, it's different colors.  It's, uh, I want to say Tri Levlen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like a 7, 7, 7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe it's that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, I mean the first week I'm on it, I'm, I'm okay.  The second week, the second week I'm a little bit crampy, and the third week is when things get kind of oh.  So I'm like, I mean it could have been, you know, a combination of my birthday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the pill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my menstrual cycle, but I don't want to, I don't want to go through next month what I went through Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  We're going to head that off at the pass.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I mean I thought, I mean actually the, the last thing I was thinking about, I thought oh, I can always call the suicide hotline.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, which is there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And talk to somebody, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, but I mean and I, and I even, I even made myself go for like a mile, like walk for a mile at this, uh, park on Saturday thinking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would help, and I, as soon as I got done, I couldn't wait to get in the car and get home as fast as possible because I just felt so panicky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the panic's really kicking in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I've, I've, when I felt depressed, when I felt depressed in the past, I never felt panic before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's scary.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this I felt, I just felt, I mean I, I just wanted to like stay indoors.  I did not want to go outside and be around people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought that's the first time that's happened.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Now there are two things that in the last months we've changed with regard to your medications some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think we need to look very critically at that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One is, um, going to the generic amphetamine salts.  Now there had been, you had been on the XR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, I only did the, the salts I think once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I've been on the XR, the extended release—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the last several months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're back to that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's the 30 mg twice a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because I know we tried lowering it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Focus and concentration were more affected.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] was fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that part of the ADD—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's squared away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other thing I kept thinking of this weekend was maybe the venlafaxine is not working the way it should anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's quite possible.  Also the Abilify in the picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I did, it was at 6 mg—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I just upped it yesterday to 8.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I thought let me, I'll, you know, I thought I'm seeing you today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm upping it yesterday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought maybe that'll help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just wondering if the venlafaxine run, run its course and it's not useful anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be possible.  Let's talk again about Abilify versus Risperdal because you were on Risperdal for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, Risperdal I didn't have a problem.  The only thing with Risperdal was I didn't have a period.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, and now you're getting regular periods.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, which I like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And I hear that you're feeling more, a little bit more on the edge of panic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abilify can be kind of activating so to speak—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For some people.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hmm, because I was looking on the web site for like, uh, medication for depression, and there was, um, I don't want to do Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you ever tried Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I haven't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Zoloft is good for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've been thinking about that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is dysphoric?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's, um PMS.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Basically.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Um, it's cheap in generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, you could take it along with the venlafaxine.  Um, yeah, my question is going to be when we're really looking at the big picture, will Abilify do what you need it to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, another consideration is I think even since you started the Abilify, um, there's another form of the main medication that's in Risperdal, has come out in a time release, an extended release capsule actually that resembles the Adderall quite a bit.  Um, it's called Invega.  Um, you take it once in the morning.  It gives a gradual release throughout the day.  For some people, they have fewer side effects like, um, prolactin level and so forth.  It goes mostly through the kidney as opposed to the liver, so it's not interfering with your other medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So you don't want to take me off the venlafaxine?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think we need to feel confident that we've got a good alternative before we start to gradually lower because withdrawal from Effexor can be rough, and so when we take it down, it's going to be gradual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	By 37.5 a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, just to really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Give your body a chance to reach equilibrium.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be worth staying with the Abilify a little longer, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you're going to take me off the Abilify as well?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, no, I think we could still try.  Let's just do the one thing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We could use the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because the panic is ugly and Zoloft helps with that.  Premenstrual stuff is problematic.  It helps with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, it's not going to be ruled out with the Effexor in place.  It works fine along with the other things, including the Abilify.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I agree with going ahead and keeping that Abilify at 8 mg now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We may go to 10, that's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it all depends on each person' s individual metabolism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the other thing that's really like a switch went off or something, but how I was getting manicy with spend, spend, spend, spend, spend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's done like a 180 and I'm save, save, save, save, save.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's actually pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I think it has to do with what's going on in the news, the economy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It might.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like thinking, you know, next, and I thought with this paycheck, I'm being very, I'm being so careful in what I'm spending.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which I'm, I'm thankful and I'm like wow, how did that happen?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good because you were spending on the Risperdal, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  I've always spent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But now the Abilify is, is, you know, you're having maybe a little bit [INAUDIBLE] impulse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's just weird how it just all of a sudden did that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's interesting.  Maybe having the ADD also, uh, controlled, allows you to concentrate, plan ahead, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But my loneliness is even worse than it was before.  That's another thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and there the depression's kicking in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Birthdays tend to do that to people sometimes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For a while there too, as I recall, you had a very strong drive, like oh boy, I could really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could get together with somebody right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean I was like at the point where I was taking care of that so much on my own, and then, and then I got worn out from it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it was harder to, it was getting more and more difficult to take care, like satisfy myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so I, I pretty much backed off almost completely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And sometimes the medication can have a side effect as well, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, affecting—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean I was mentally—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Response.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mentally getting tired of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's been a lot going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, yeah.  I'm just like oh my gosh, what the heck happened because I mean I was doing so good and then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well these may just be fine tuning, you know, in terms of good instincts on raising the Abilify, you know, in terms of the mood swings.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I mean I don't mind little bumps, but this was like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A nose dive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean a huge nose dive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think you had really important insight that with your menstrual cycle, there are significant changes and it may not even be as much about the pill as about let's get something that's targeted to that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That also has benefit on depression and panic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that something is Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Generic sertraline.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it tends to sit pretty well in terms of metabolism with the other medicines too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's one of the ones that interferes the least, so that's a big plus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because what was, because I was, there's this girl I work with now who, um, she's, I mean I confided in her one day about like depression and she has panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we can relate on something, and she was telling me that she takes lorazepam.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said, oh, I said I take that at night, but she has, she has real bad panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She was, she was, she says it's gotten a lot better now, but she says I used to have them real bad.  She says for no, for no apparent reason.  I was like wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it just comes out of the blue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So she was saying there was one drug, one depression drug that she says it's good, but it, it increases your appetite.  That's not with Zoloft, is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Paxil especially has a reputation—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it has a pretty strong antihistamine piece to it which makes people sometimes a little bit sluggish—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, possibly more likely to hold on to weight.  Zoloft tends to be more or less weight neutral.  No more certainly than venlafaxine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I think you've tolerated that pretty well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, I mean the venlafaxine was, you know, when I first, when we first switched to it, haven't had any problem with it, and now all of a sudden I was like, I mean Saturday and Sunday got to a point where I was, I was, couldn't wait to the next dose, I was getting, I kept wanting to, I wanted to take it before it was due to get rid of the feeling thinking that's what that would fix it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has your generic changed by any chance?  Does it look different—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Since the last time you filled it at the pharmacy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I believe that very soon extended release will be generic.  Could that be a consideration with the venlafaxine?  Remember how it used to be Effexor XR.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then your insurance gave a hard time about that being brand name and encouraged you to go to the shorter acting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think the longer acting is going generic.  I'm not sure how soon—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It will be super affordable, but I could write separately—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well wait a minute, the Effexor, the generic is venlafaxine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're taking short acting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I am?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was the XR that is the longer acting, but what was the brand name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So it's interesting that you're saying you, you think it's wearing off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, but it was doing fine for a while there.  So what—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know what to think.  Unless the PMS is, is overtaking or.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're metabolizing it more quickly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well not anymore than, well actually I take these walks with a couple of women at lunch every day, and it's like a mile at least or more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  So I've been doing that for like a month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  That's actually a good thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would never say don't do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But would that, so would that, so the metabolism would be increasing, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not necessarily.  This is more like going through the liver—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The liver enzymes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, but your, um, your metabolism with food, that's great that you're doing that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I just can't seem to get on, the one thing that I, well it seems like it's been going on for like 3 months.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, but on the weekends, I get hungry, but I don't feel like fixing anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I get lazy.  I don't, I mean I'm not starving myself, but I just don't feel like eating anything or fixing, I pick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Low blood sugar might be aggravating you too.  Um, do you have healthy things around like nuts—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I, I buy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, granola.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I buy fruit and vegetables at the market.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can graze on those all you want.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't have any desire to eat them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Try to make yourself have at least a little something every couple hours whether it's just a few carrot sticks and some nuts even if you're not hungry, you know, being able to keep more, because you are, you've raised your body's metabolism for you know, food intake now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially at work, and then on the weekends when you may not be keeping to the same schedule, your body may be craving, you know, getting back to a fuel supply—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And even that exercise.  I think it's good you went out and walked this weekend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, and I tried doing it Sunday, but I just couldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just I didn't want to go outside.  I mean I, I thought about it, and then I thought, I thought well now, why bother because I came home and I was bursting into tears Saturday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And there's panic disorder with acrophobia too where someone's afraid to go outside.  The good news is Zoloft can help that as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something's not holding up its end like it used to though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, and I'm thinking it's the venlafaxine possibly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to write for extended release.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, generic preferred—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see if that helps get things back on track with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because, because this morning was eh, I mean because I actually thought to myself, because yesterday I was, I didn't want to come to work yesterday, but I had to because of this fund that I, that we process one day out of the month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then this morning I was like man I really, you know, I better take that anxiety and the alprazolam—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I take, I haven't taken a whole one in a long time, but I usually just take a half—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that does it, whereas the whole one, when I took that once, not, well it's been a while ago, it actually didn't relax me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I felt my heart was beating out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought that's different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But a half takes care of it.  Half—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Half I can, I'm like okay, I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be very careful with that.  That's good.  So we're just trying to find that delicate balance.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think Zoloft would be a piece of the puzzle here, and I'll write for extended release venlafaxine, make sure that you get that, and the ADD is under control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  The Adderall is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean because the salts.  Well now, they would, they would work great, but oh man, I could tell when they wore off.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was hungry just like that.  It was like oh, I need food really badly.  So I'm like no, I don't want to do the salts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, so I mean I know [NAME OTHER]'s going to be like why didn't you call me?  I'll be like would you believe I felt guilty because I thought no, I can't bother you.  I'm—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what we're here for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I actually did happen to check this weekend.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But for something like that I want you to call the paging service and I'll call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I got something from Blue Cross Blue Shield not too long about, because I thought it was Effexor.  Now I don't think it is because I reread last night.  It was Risperdal, it's a good thing I'm not on it anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the generic, or the Risperdal—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's going generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You won't be able to, or maybe it's Effexor.  I don't know, I'll let you know when I go to the pharmacy either tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, one of those two drugs, um, they're, you won't be available to do generic, and you won't be able to do copay.  You have, I would have to pay for the full price of the medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How weird.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is like a hundred and something dollars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It might be if you wanted to stay with brand now that generic's available.  That's why I'm wondering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, but I just remember reading it going—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I can't, uh, remember if it was Risperdal or Effexor, but I thought oh, I better, I better check with, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I thought, I thought I, I can't even imagine.  It was, I'm sure it was like a hundred and something dollars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we'll make sure—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought whoa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We find you something affordable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But both of those I know have generic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I actually, um, have had some, uh, prescription plans contacting me about prior authorization for Adderall too strangely enough.  Now I've been getting it, but you know, I just think sometimes they kind of say, oh we're just going to look at this, this category of medicines and make sure that the doctors, uh, reassure us why they're using it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean I have to be careful when I go to like the Rite Aid—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I remember—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In my area.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was so strange, and 60 mg is a perfectly reasonable dose, totally approved by the FDA.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I make sure I go when the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not a big deal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Manager is on because—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because this one girl who was there that night, she took a look at the, a look at the paper—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's not unusual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she goes, right, and she goes, she goes have you had prescriptions here before, and I'm like yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so she turned to the manager and she goes is this okay, and she's like oh yeah, and she goes hi [PATIENT NAME] how you doing and I was like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like hi, how you doing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I was like don't do this to me again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the absurd thing is that especially the extended release, it's very difficult to abuse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean back in the day when people got, you know, the immediate release, uh, you know, they could grind up the pills.  They could snort them.  They could shoot them.  They could do all kinds of things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which is what led to a big market for extended release.  Now the good news also is extended release gives you a more steady level through the day which you've experienced.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's so unlikely anybody's going to misuse that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're taking a prescription medication at an approved dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nobody should be hassling you about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had a, I had an interesting brief, uh, discussion with this guy Friday night.  Of course, I had like, I think I had a drink in me, and he was OCD.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said, I said so you're like compulsive, and he goes oh yeah, and he was like just, he was just like talking like, you know, really fast, and I said do you take medication, and he goes no.  I said—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, and I didn't, I didn't go too out of control on him, but I went, I just looked at him and said you, you people give us who take recommended, recommended medication for our problems—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Us a bad name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] was to my right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You didn't?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, and [NAME OTHER] was to my left—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they were just standing there kind of listening in, you know, and I, and all of a sudden I guess my brain just clicked and I looked at [NAME OTHER] and I said [NAME OTHER] how's your job going?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and he turned to [NAME OTHER] and all I heard him say was well I used to take medication, but, and I just tuned him out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I thought to myself oh, that was my chance to say those people who aren't on medication that should be, you give us a bad name because you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't, you know.  I'm going okay, well whatever, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well maybe his medicine disagreed with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he just got something bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he went off to talk to somebody else and I was like on to something else, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  We're not having a meeting of the minds here.  What would be a riot is if in a month or two, you're back at the same place.  He's perfectly, you know, conversing fine and he says thanks to you, I went back and I got something that worked.</p>

PT:	Right, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'm glad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The problem has been the old one gave me these side effects or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.  Oh, that is something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was just funny because [NAME OTHER] was just standing there just kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just standing there and [NAME OTHER] was just like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he just looked at me, and I was just like and later I thought, wow, like there was my chance to voice my concerns to somebody, didn't really intend to, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It came out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe in some strange way, he needed to hear it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	True, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good when people, you know, who are in the public eye go public too.  You know, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The show Deal or No Deal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Howie Mandel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know how he greets people like this, you know, it's sort of a handshake, you go like this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I never really saw him.  Oh, he does that, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well he's admitted he has OCD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And he, it totally freaks him out to think about shaking someone's hand.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So he invented this instead of the handshake.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you know, it's a reasonable way to give a greeting and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is he on medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's exactly why, he hasn't said—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, of course, you know, that's his right either way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.  That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's his own confidential, but at least he's admitted he has a thing about shaking hands.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have like 3 people at work who will not take even aspirin or pain medication if they have a headache.  They don't like taking drugs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm like looking at them and I'm going oh, do I really want to say something to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I will keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You never know.  I mean they may have had an allergic reaction before.  Maybe someone in their family did.  They're afraid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's interesting because they're like I don't want to put any chemicals in my body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And yet I bet some of them go out on smoke breaks, you know, it's ironic, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm like what do you think you're breathing in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I mean some all natural substances resemble pharmaceuticals so closely.  I mean Fox Glove, that's digitalis, you know, for, uh, monitoring heart rhythm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, a lot of the best medicines are derived from naturally grown.  People with chronic pain sometimes will use Marinol which is derived from marijuana.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh my God.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, but it's in a pill form, FDA approved.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've often said, well this one girl that was saying it, I said [NAME OTHER] I said if you had a heart condition, you wouldn't take anything for it?  She's like well no, that's different, and I'm thinking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's not different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why should you suffer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm like no, it's not different.  It's, you know, it's a matter here of life and death.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes people are very perky about that.  You know, Bill Maher, he's like a comedian and a political commentator.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's come out with this movie, Religulous, which should be really interesting to see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I heard him something about—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's an atheist, so that's what it's going to be about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I heard he had made a movie about religion, but I didn't know what it was exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's going to be very interesting, but I heard him on a talk show and he stated that he doesn't even believe in antibiotics, and I thought, you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're entitled to your opinion, but you're not doing anybody any good talking about this on national TV.  You know, it's like the anti vaccine folks and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That and the people who pray for their child to get better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a tough one.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not any blood fusions or whatever it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then they wonder, and then they wonder why they died.  It's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's so sad, you know, because if God gave them knowledge about these things, then maybe there's a reason for that, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's, you have, I think people have a right to consider every option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, and yes side effects can happen, reactions can happen.  Nobody knows for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was, I was telling, who was it, who I telling at work.  I said you know how you hear about the side effects.  I said okay, picture 500 people in a room.  I said okay, 2% gets a side effect, 18% gets a side effect, because [NAME OTHER] my therapist described it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because she said, because I was telling her about when I heard Adderall was like bad for heart conditions and I went immediately went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I said I got to get off this medication.  He goes and [NAME OTHER], and I told [NAME OTHER] the same thing, and [NAME OTHER] goes whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] goes I cringe when they make, when they say that stuff on TV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And she says you can have 1,000 people in a room and she says—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They take the percentages of how many people in that group have what side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said it doesn't mean every thousand person, you know, the entire 1,000 people had—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Heart palpitations.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It can mean half or a quarter or a third or whatever, and I said oh, okay, I understand that part now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they don't say that on TV.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know.  It's often so one sided, and even with [INAUDIBLE] and tooting about the economy, take it with a big grain of salt, you know.  Reporters have agendas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, look at all they're not talking about like the war in Iraq.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, while they concentrate on this, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] for change.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, here's hoping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is the lorazepam available twice a day enough?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Of the pill, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you felt like you were getting a really bad panic attack during the day—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could take that as a backup.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If, if you start to get a really bad panic attack during the day, you took half an alprazolam and it wasn't doing the job—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could take lorazepam as a backup.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  If you feel like the second—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Half of the alprazolam could make your heart racy or be physically uncomfortable—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lorazepam is not about alternative at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know, well 1 like at nighttime is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I take 2, I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You, you still have that option.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it could also be available for bailout during the day if need be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the alprazolam, that's okay the way it's been supplied, you break them in half.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually don't exceed the 1 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I could get a refill on this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll go ahead and write refills for everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah because these, see I don't use these.  I, when, when I, when I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] he was telling to use these, take a half every single day—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I got to a point where I was okay.  I mean I wasn't stressed out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or anything, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't take more than you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I just, I take these only when, and I took, the last few days I've taken them more than I have in the last 6 months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I can always, the good news is I can always call those in.  The only thing I can't call in is the Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, Cogentin I'll write for because you're using that, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's the, what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, the benztropine for side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Actually I don't think I even got that filled for some time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you don't need it with the Abilify, fantastic.  Do you need me to write for Abilify refill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you still away with the dose?  Would you like some more samples so that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, let's see I'm up to 8.  So I'm getting, I just started the 8 yesterday and today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I can write for 4 mg, I mean 2 mg four a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Write, yeah, yeah, I do need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll do that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do need that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can also give you some samples of the 5's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you need to drop back the dose at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and, uh, so you don't need the Cogentin, and I'm going to write for the sertraline, which is generic Zoloft on the prescription as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can you kind write down besides because, you know, parenthesis, so that I know what I'm handing in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You bet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, they know what, what I'm handing them, but I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Want to understand what I'm handing them, handling, handing them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Generic Effexor, the lorazepam you know, that's generic Ativan, but I'll write it down on here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Alprazolam is generic Xanax.  Okay, Abilify goes by name, so you're in good shape with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are 2 mg tabs, take 1 p.o.q.i.d.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's p.i.q.o.d.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh you know what, uh, p.o is by mouth.  It's Latin for oral.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Q.i.d. is 4 times a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that allows you to get the 8.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's just the one—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always wondered about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Type of tablet so it should be one copay.  And then sertraline, which is generic Zoloft, 25 mg.  Take 1 by mouth daily, usually in the morning, but if it really relaxes you, you could take it at nighttime.  Sometimes people get a little bit of upset stomach or diarrhea when they first start taking it.  It usually goes away after a couple of days, but if it's really bothering you, you can cut it in half.  Just take the half for the first few days, and work your way up to the 25.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What night was it that I, I decided not to take the lorazepam, and I had this horrific nightmare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it was, I mean I still remember it.  It was a split like 30 second dream.  I just remember I was sitting in a living room somewhere.  I turned, it was dark outside and these 2 men with just like suspenders and pants on slightly bald headed stood there and all I know is that evil was straight across their faces—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds horrifying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I knew exactly what they were going to do.  They were going to rape me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I screamed in the dream and I, actually I sat up and I had my mouthpiece in and I screamed and I woke up out of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it just, it just was a split, that's all it took.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean because I, in the dream I turned to run and I woke up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What a horrible—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like holy crap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Dream.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Bless your heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that was because I didn't take the lorazepam that night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's wild.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I mean, but I mean since, when I do take, I take it every night I'm fine.  I'm fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I just thought whoa.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What the heck was that for?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's remarkable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now some people with nightmares also report it's a little better with Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that might help across the board.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, I'm going to have you look these over and make sure I didn't miss anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to raid our sample cabinet for, um, Abilify.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you'll have some samples and some flexibility there, and then, um, we'll going ahead and figure out a followup appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And do you want to do, oh, you know what, while I'm doing that, I need to have us update your treatment plan and release of information.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With release of information, I would notify you before calling your primary doctor—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or trying to get copies of labs or whatever—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and then the treatment plan, I just wrote down some of the things that we've been talking about with regards to the ADD, the PMS, the depression, medication and therapy, our new trial with the sertraline.  So anything you want to modify, adjust, no problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then if you don't mind signing next to the X's, it would be great, and I'll be right back.  Do you need me to run a credit card through that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll go ahead and do that.  Well, I might as well and I'll get you a receipt for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All righty.  I'll be right back with some samples and the receipt and everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So just sign or whatever?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, feel free, look it over, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you can adjust anything, treatment plan.  Then I'll be right back.  I can't figure what the copay is, either $25 or $30.  It looks like $30.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Be right back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, I take the Adderall like I normally do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I take the, um, when do I take the Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, I would start off taking it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay, the same time I take my venlafaxine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you end up feeling like oh man, this just relaxes me so much, I'd rather take it at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's perfectly okay to switch to that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  So Zoloft is partly, um, a depression medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was originally developed for depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It also turned out to be helpful, it has the most indications I think of any of the serotonin agents.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	PTSD, panic disorder.  It's been studied in premenstrual syndrome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I take venlafaxine, I take 1 when I first get in the morning, up in the morning.  Then I take 1 at noon, and then I take 2 at dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perfect.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'll do the Zoloft the same way?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Perfect.  You could take it in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Morning, just once in the morning?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For the whole day?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you wanted to divide it and take, you know, some in the morning and some in the afternoon, you could too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we can always raise the dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't want to give you more than you need.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, you know, 25 is a good place to start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people take up to 200 a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if it looks like we're on the right track with that, we could try—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I see.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Inching that up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or if things are better, lower the Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's right, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, so we would start kind of what's called a cross taper.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the other hand, if you need both, that's nothing to worry about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I thought because I probably telling my sister in law Monday night was it, that, uh, you know, that I had that, that the weekend was, and she's like, we just started talking and she says, well she says it sounds like you may need something.  I said yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so we were talking and I said I'll let you know what, you know, I discussed with her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think that's a good addition, and also when you decided to raise the Abilify, that made a lot—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of sense too, and that's one reason I'm very glad to give you samples because that gives you some flexibility.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't have to wait until you can get to the pharmacy, or the next time you're, you know, your copay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is due or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, thank you very much for signing those and those are those receipts.  Then I'll give you an official one for the practice [INAUDIBLE].  I will set our followup.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is yours, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Great.  Yeah, thank you.  There's the official receipt, and when's good for our next meeting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, let's see, I guess Tuesdays, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tuesdays the same time.  So let me look at my book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We can do a month, 6 weeks, 8 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were doing what, every 4 weeks?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thereabouts I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably just once a month, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thereabout, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's see, we're in October.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we could look at [DATE].  We could look at the following Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, let's do the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that sounds good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And 6—ish is, uh, still good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fantastic.  And do you need a card with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm not sure if I have any of your cards at home or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okey doke.  I'm going to put my voicemail on there, but also—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The number of the practice is on the front.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Someone will always pick that up even on the weekends.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's an answering service.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So that's where, you know, that's what the pager's for.  I don't have a problem with it.  So next time we'll meet, it might be pretty clear who will be in the White House.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, really.  Right, yeah, how about that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boy, oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Keep my fingers crossed.  I mean I'm not much of a religious person, but I'm always, and, uh, it's funny because [NAME OTHER], um, [NAME OTHER]'s aunt, is it, or grandmother, or somebody, who's a lot, who's like in their 80's or whatever, they, um, every time she, they run into each other, she's, she's like oh my gosh, she says I am so afraid for him, and [NAME OTHER]'s like really, why?  She goes, she says because she says, you know, when, um, when Kennedy and Martin Luther King, she says, oh she says everybody in our house just prays for him, prays for the family in the churches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I said [NAME OTHER] it's really, they're really scared.  She goes, she goes [PATIENT NAME] that was, you know, God.  I said I can't imagine being, you know, you know, living in that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I was just a small child, but I remember how upsetting it was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, and I'm looking back in school, I'm thinking I don't really remember a big deal about it.  I don't remember, and, um, my mother goes to church with a woman who will, will not root for him because of his skin color, and I said Mom, you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's sad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said you tell her for me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What does it have to do with them.  She goes, I said so you mean to tell me, what is it about the skin color, and she goes, she feels that they are beneath her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What a shame.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm like are you kidding me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I only, I only care about the brain.  I don't care what package it's in, and if you went into researching that, we all probably came from Africa.  You know?  Get over it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I asked [NAME OTHER] I said okay, I said I'm sure I was taught this in school, I don't remember.  I said how did slavery begin anyway?  She goes Europe, or not, she says and no, in Europe or British or something, there was some guys or something that did, um, that had slaves, and then some, they brought some people [INAUDIBLE] can work here in America, so we'll bring them over.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I said are you serious?  She goes yeah, that's exactly how it started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can you believe Jefferson had slaves?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, but he had a black mistress who had tons of children.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, and guess what, they all went into slavery when he died because he was so deeply in debt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that awful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It is pretty sobering.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just, I know they did, uh, right after they did that, um, that movie, oh, I forget—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it the John Adams series?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know if it was John Adams, but it was about Jefferson.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was on, it was on one of the major networks.  It was probably several years ago, and I forget the actor who played him, but right after that, it was in the news or something that they had taken DNA from her and from him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And all his ancestors, they notified them, and they interviewed them on like PBS, and when some of them found out, they were like, they disowned half of their people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that awful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they could not believe they came from a black woman.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, isn't that sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like are you kidding me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's so ridiculous.  Just like beauty's only skin deep, so is skin color.  What difference does it make?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, there are preachers on other planets, they look at us and say what are they picking on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They all look pretty much the same to us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know, I, I really think he's going to get in.  I really do because, because they interviewed people that when he was just coming up.  Is he from [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Illinois or something like that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he' originally from Hawaii, but I think—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He taught at [DEIDENTIFIED]'s law school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he tried to make a difference in Illinois.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the, uh, district or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they interviewed some women who remember he tried to get some things, organizations started.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought, and they said he had this fire about him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He, he has an amazing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Inspirational presentation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought if he's like, if he was trying to do that, oh, he, he definitely.  He definitely wants to do this.  I mean he's capable of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I hope he can get in.  I hope he gets to keep it as opposed to what happened to Gore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I hope somebody doesn't try to kill him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't, well at the, during the convention, there was 3 people that they caught.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was in, uh, it was in Colorado.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were at checkpoints.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It might have been a cop, a local cop saw the car, something just told him check the car, check the trunk, and the guy had all, he had like a telescope or whatever you call it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everything and they were 3 white guys.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Racists.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because there weren't many organizations—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Well they are plenty of the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then they, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Vigilantes out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then one car had like, uh, methamphetamine, uh, lab and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And when they interviewed them, they were like, you know, we can't believe that nigger is getting, has gotten as far as he has.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they booked them and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't that sad?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In this day and age, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyway, I won't keep you any longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we'll know a lot more next time we get together.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.  But I mean, but yeah, her, her aunts are like, and then because of the stock market, one of her relatives said yep, took all my money out of the bank and, uh, put it in a potato sack and there's a hole in the backyard, and it's, the money's in the hole, and she goes come on.  She goes no I seriously did that, and her son's like she did that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	One, don't tell too many people about that you did that.  Two, get something waterproof.  Wouldn't it horrible if there was a flood or something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, she said, you know, she says if they come and take my house, my money's not in my house, it's in my backyard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, bless her heart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But yeah, I mean but a lot, yeah, [NAME OTHER] says a lot of them all worried.  They, they pray for his family every single night because they're afraid somebody's going to take him out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I pray for an end to all terrorism assassinations.  That's no way to solve a problem.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, but it's like this is 2008.  Come on people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they said probably by 2011 or 2020, the white population, or I should say, uh, Caucasian population, it won't be the main race in the United States.  The Puerto Rican—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think Latino is gaining on us.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is, yes, but I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so what, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't think of the politically correct—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Word to use, but the Latina is—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, what about the Spanish ancestors, so what, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're, they're all going to be, and I'm thinking yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Finally, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The more we see we have in common, the less we'll dwell on the ridiculous differences, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're all people, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Yeah, I have a, I have a tendency to, I think I have all the, well my mother's thoughts because every time I see like a, like a black person however they're dressed, I think something bad and I try to get out of it, and it's so hard to break that thinking.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well our media's got something to do with that and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, there's a lot of catching up to do in terms of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Expectations, opportunity.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call me if need be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We're fine tuning—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I think we're zeroing in on some of the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Things we can control and get through a rocky time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you don't have to have another birthday again for almost a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  I just wait for them to go away.  It's just another day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There you go.</p>

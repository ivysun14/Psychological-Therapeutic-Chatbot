<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a follow-up from what we were talking about last week with the poet John Cotner. He had this book he did with a poet friend, called <u>Two Walks, Ten Talks</u>, and it got reviews from all sorts of publications — you know, [Times New York] (ph), [Boston Scenic] (ph), a lot of blogs and also by one author. It's got a blurb from an author who's been on a lot of the top ten best books of 2011 lists, writing that — he wrote that book <u>Humiliation</u>. I don't know if you're — I mean the New York Times gave it a mixed review; it sounded sort of like hit or miss. But this guy called John "a latter-day Plato."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Right. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seriously here? (chuckling) All the reviews were so positive but that one was the most irritating.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) I bet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly what he wants people to think of him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just couldn't believe this top-ten-best-books-of-the-year guy bought it. And their book is just like these dialogues between these two guys talking about walking around New York City and everybody was saying, "Oh, it's like they're taking a closer look at these pedestrian interactions and infusing them with philosophic musings which makes them so much more meaningful and is an example for us all." (Therapist chuckles) Oh, I was so annoyed. And on one of our first dates he took me for a walk by the Hudson River and talked to me about it. So I felt like it's sort of this thing he does very impersonally for people. And it's so irritatingly pedagogical thrusting the value of his approach to walking around New York City in everyone's face. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Probably (ph). Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So anyway. (chuckles) I should probably stop ranting about him but I just had to tell you that blurb because it was so obnoxious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it must have infuriated you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, it really did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And why do you need to stop ranting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know. There are other things to talk about. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK. No, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know it sort of seems like sour grapes (chuckles) but it has genuinely annoyed me. I actually ordered two chat books from a female poet who I found reviewed on this website (inaudible at 00:02:31), so I'm going to read their poetry and enjoy it and appreciate them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, hopefully the chat books are good. The excerpts were good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Oh, good.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But something I've been [really upset] (ph) about in the last week (inaudible at 00:02:51) but my grandpa has been questioning my mom about why I'm taking time off and it was hurting my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He actually had a series of mild heart attacks on Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Oh, gosh. Sorry to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I was debating whether to go over there immediately or to go see him once he had recovered a bit since there's so many relatives there and only a few were allowed in his room at a time. And I felt like I should go over immediately but I had these freelance assignments to do because they turned around and said, "Oh actually, we need you to write three articles. We're having everyone write three articles as a test just to make sure we still want to hire you all." [00:03:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was (inaudible).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that was pretty lame and it really stressed me out because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a post-offer interview exercise?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Except my offer wasn't official at first ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... but they didn't say, "This is not an official offer." So I thought I had it in the bag and then — I knew those three articles determined whether or not I got hired so I spent forever on them even though they were supposed to be shorter exercises and just sort of exhausted myself working on them because I knew how crucial they were and I didn't get an official offer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Right. Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now they've sent me actual paperwork to sign.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:18)<br></p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm relieved. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Well, congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. But I don't know. I just felt really guilty and like I should be in a position to go over there immediately and I shouldn't have spent forever on what were supposed to be really short freelance articles. And I still feel guilty about not going immediately. And now I — I told my mom I wanted to go when he was recovered a little bit and when there were fewer relatives crowding around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it seems like that would make sense. Even though maybe that was sort of self-interested bit of logic, it's still logical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she said that it might be good for me to come for a long weekend this weekend and I'm going to. I'm going to go in the next several days. But I'm having a terribly selfish concern that I feel really guilty about. My friend Michelle is going to be in town this weekend and we've been talking about it for weeks and how we're so excited to see each other again because nobody just gets me on a fundamental level and I've just been through so much stuff over so much time as she has. And she has this feminine understanding that no — (chuckles) You know. I haven't found like a woman here who just gets it. You know? And so I just ... [00:05:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) [You haven't found anyone who that situation gets it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean we just — but spending so much time together in New York just sort of shaped us the same way; in a way that I feel like no amount of explaining can really create that same sort of bond as [the main time] (ph) in the same places.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And really like an angst-y time when you're sort of vulnerable. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah like so things you've been through together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And we're also sort of similar in ways that are not similar to other people, especially girls here. And so I've just been looking forward to seeing her for so many weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't want to totally miss her but that seems terrible. My grandpa just had triple bypass heart surgery. I could go to New York the following weekend to see Michelle; except I don't really have the money to, which is a problem. If I had the money to go to New York this would be different but I don't. And so I'm trying to figure out a way to maybe go Sunday through Tuesday and then come back in the evening because it's Valentine's Day. I know it would be kind of shitty to — not only push back seeing my grandpa so I can see Michelle but miss Valentine's Day with Jeff so I could do that, too. Because of the timing of this, there are various people with claims on my time and someone's going to have to get short-changed. [00:07:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Right, right, right, right. Yeah. Right. Does it — I guess I'm a little confused why it — so she's coming this weekend. Valentine's Day is Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yeah, she's coming — yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it matter if you see him next Wednesday or Thursday and a few days after that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean that seems sort of delinquent to me. It seems like I should go sooner, especially since my mom and Uncle Tom talked it over and said I should come this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that I have a good excuse to give them. "Oh, I wanted to see Michelle." That would just sound terrible. And he asked — he was like, "Oh, where's Sharon?" when he was feeling — and I felt really guilty that I hadn't just immediately gone out to see him even though I had this freelance stuff. It seemed really the wrong decision. So now I'm trying to think, "Well, I could see Michelle on Friday night and Saturday and Saturday night and then see Grandpa Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday afternoon." I don't know. But this — I'm just feeling bad about it. And I think also I'm really nervous because I know he's been grilling my mom so much and my mom said to me, "When you go, be prepared for lots of unpleasant questions." I mean I shouldn't let that get in the way of going to see my Grandpa when he's sick but I think, on a more subconscious level, that's definitely blocking my immediate action on this. And ... [00:09:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What will he ask?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you just shared that there's more to my absence than like mono and migraines and my mom says she's stuck to a consistent story, which is that I felt really exhausted and decided to take a year off instead of half a year and I'm still planning to go back in the fall and that that's perfectly fine and it's not a problem. And she says she's told him that multiple times but he still keeps asking. And I mean obviously there is more to it but not stuff you want to explain to your grandpa — or grandma, for that matter. Plus she's too forgetful. But if I tried to explain it to her she'd just forget it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's still sort of with it but she forgets new information pretty quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm also afraid that they're going to question me about my religious views because I don't know if I mentioned this but when I was there last there was an abortion debate ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... which is something that I lose my temper about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Generally I can sort of keep out of the really charged debates, especially like the political debates, because I know trying to debate my relatives when the base values are so different will just drive me crazy when there's not really a point on which we see eye to eye at all about politics. [00:11:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But my Uncle Claytono, who I can't stand — he's my only relative who I really hate; the rest are really nice — just made such an illogical argument that I couldn't help but jump in. And then he said, "Well, they say that by the time a woman figures out she's pregnant and can get an abortion, the baby already has a heartbeat and a spinal cord." And at that point I should have said something measured but instead I just lost it and was like, "So what? That's like barely better than a frog," (both chuckle) which obviously is not going to convince any really religious people who believe it has a soul already. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm afraid I sort of outed myself as an atheist then, or at least somebody who's not as religious as she should be which is something I have been trying to avoid doing. [00:12:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see. (pause) How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have so little common ground with my family. But I really love them and they're important to me and I just worry that if they knew I was an atheist they would feel like they really had nothing in common with me and might feel strange ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they bring up faith a lot just in little ways; in the way they phrase things. You'll get like a "God willing" here or a "Trust in God's plan." You know, talking about people's character, religion comes up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't — let's just say I don't really want them to feel self-conscious about that because it's something they feel the need to talk about all the time and I don't feel the need to talk about atheism all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it seems like I'd rather just them feel like they have a receptive audience in me because, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So most of what you're talking about has to do with all these ways you'd have to accommodate to various little schedules and claims on your time and interest in knowing more about what's going on with you, regardless of how much you might want to say, or where you stand on abortion or God. And (pause) — [doesn't look like] (ph) you have very much room to maneuver, really, or opportunity to, I don't know, assert how you want things to be or how — at least you know how they are for you. [00:13:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think I am going to selfishly make sure I can see Michelle (chuckling) but I really feel bad about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) So how come what you want is selfish and guilt-inducing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like your grandpa having a big heart attack is — it's kind of ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a total trump card, like ...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like that should just be above everything else. And running to see my friend, kind of so I can feel good — also so she can feel good because I know I have a very positive effect on her, too; it's like a mutual thing. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Right. Right. Right. Right, right. And I guess (pause until 00:15:01)— part of this, I think, is about the sense that the other person really couldn't possibly understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: With Grandpa I feel like that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That he couldn't understand what? Why you'd put off seeing him for one day?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it'd be three days. They wanted me to come Thursday or Friday and I want to come on Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Oh, OK. You'd come Sunday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was thinking of making up some big freelance assignment that I need to finish but I don't like lying. [00:15:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean sometimes you wonder if it's really the better course because if telling people the truth, if they just wouldn't get it then it's like lying to them in a way. (both chuckle) Because you're telling them something that will be false in the way it's perceived.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're responsible for that. (both chuckle) I mean in other words, OK, as long as you don't hold them responsible or kind of at all for how they see things, no matter how you explain it or try to explain it, which may be something you're doing ... (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. I mean it's important to know your audience. If you know how your audience is going to react, you might as well not tell them something to give them a false idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand and I'm not actually trying to encourage you to do one thing or another. (Patient chuckles) I'm just saying I think there's also, I think, something characteristic of you here which is to make it all the way through — make all the decisions about it and manage how you're going to handle it; how to decide and foreclose on any alternatives about how the other person is going to react or what they're going to do. [00:17:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It does feel ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I think is mostly self-protective and may be very much warranted. I'm sure you're right about him. I imagine you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess trying like — it seems like that then makes you completely responsible; his inflexibility makes you responsible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't seem very fair.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think things are ever fair with really old people. Doesn't being old just create totally unfair situations all the time? (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. [Maybe part of it is not fair.] (ph) So if you were — again, this is not my way of stressing you do this but the way I try to understand more of what's going on here. So if you told your mom or him that one of your best friends who you haven't seen in months because you've been in California was coming to town probably to see you for the weekend, you had this plan a while ago, this is the only time she can come, so you were going to still see him but you were just going to put it off a couple days or something, when you say he wouldn't understand, what do you mean? [00:19:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In his value system, and my mom's, family comes first. And I think partly because I have such a different value system — like I have a friend who I feel more responsible for who seems more familial. It's not many, I mean really Emily and Michelle. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you're closer to, especially in certain ways, where they know you in ways that your family probably never will.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And so ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not like that for your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean just based on what they believe, the family should come first. And I feel like even my mom believes this in a way because she was really upset when — I have two cousins who are a couple of years older than I am, both of whom are married, who had some sort of falling out when they were both in the same college; the same college all of our family goes to. And then neither of them had involved the other or any of the cousins in the wedding. I mean of course we were all invited. But then Jackie didn't go to Tracy's wedding because she had a close friend's wedding the same day and she chose the friend's wedding over Tracy's wedding. And my mom thinks that's just terrible. So I can kind of understand if Emily and Tracy were getting married on the same day — I mean I haven't even had a falling out with Tracy but (inaudible at 00:20:59).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see. I see. I see. Right. Right. Right, you feel closer to Emily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would feel really terrible about it and no one would understand but it would be the right thing to do in my mind. It's more practical value with them than the simple family comes first I think a lot of people in my family adhere to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) I see. I see. So it's something that feels kind of comparable with seeing your grandfather [at the start of the weekend] (ph) versus sticking around to see Michelle?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I think if I told my mom that it was because of Michelle, I think she would see it as sort of heartless and incomprehensible. [00:21:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And does a part of you that would feel really bad see a kind of that same way even if there's also another part of you that sees it differently?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do sort of blame myself for being in a position where I have to be so selfish. Like it would be nice if I were just doing fine and didn't need to see Michelle so badly right now and could just go see Grandpa with a clear conscience and see Michelle too, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: By staying in such a bad state for so long, I'm making it impossible to really make the right decision because it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How bad a state are you in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (chuckles) One in which I need to see a friend so badly that I'm putting off going to see my sick grandpa. Something could happen that's unexpected. He got through the surgery fine but when really old people have surgery, you never know what's going to happen. [00:22:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm risking a complication taking his life to see my friend who's going to be around for the next 60 years or whatever, which just seems pretty illogical.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you telling me that you're in pretty bad shape?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad enough that I need to make decisions that don't make sense in the larger scheme.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How is it — how is it manifesting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really worried about starting my job because the freelance assignment just took me so long and stressed me out so much. But I finished them and they really liked them, which is good, and hopefully, like I did with my other job, I can sort of get used to what they want and produce it quickly after I get used to doing that task. But it's scary. I know that very soon I'll need to put seven hours a day of hard focus into something that has nothing to do with myself. And so much of sort of my reading and my writing lately has been very self-directed and I've felt that I need that sort of. I need a lot of time with myself, which I feel guilty about; it's just more selfish, all about me, life-centered sort of. And I don't know. And the things that I've been really doing well in are like cooking, which isn't going well because I made a goal of cooking dinner every night so I could be more healthy, save money, and lose weight but I keep buying expensive ingredients to cook with and it takes forever. And you know I may be putting in as much fat as the restaurants do and I haven't lost any weight. I mean I have all these old clothes that I can't fit into but I would love to wear but I can't. [00:25:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Yep. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've been cooking dinner every night but it's not having the results that I sort of planned.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've been writing in my journal a lot, which is good, because I feel that that is helping me develop my writing voice further. So it's good to be really diligent with that and it's helping my psychological state but — because I don't really think that you can feel good about a life based on having a good relationship, cooking dinner, and writing in your diary. (inaudible at 00:26:07) that would be fine but if not ... (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just really don't have much to hold onto in terms of hoping for better things in the future.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you mean including when you go back to school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm hoping that my job — that acclimating to my job will help me prepare for going back to school. And that's something that's future tense; I can't start my job yet [because they're still doing groundwork.] (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — but in my daily life right now, the writing in my diary feels very productive because I think it's helping me work towards working more on the novel. I've been working on it here and there but way too spottily. And with the novel there's a lot of where it feels like taking a scene and sort of blurting out a stream of consciousness but then I have to go back and turn it into part third-person narrative, part dialogue, cut it down so I don't tell all these things. (chuckles) And there are just many hours that I want to put in. And so spending a lot of time everyday on my journal and then the novel here and there isn't ideal but the journal seems necessary right now. Because I'm trying to write myself back into my life here and I'm really hoping that by writing about good things as well as bad things I'll maybe like it here a little bit. (chuckles) And we'll see if that works. [00:28:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (inaudible) you've been mostly focused on things that take care of yourself and some of those are helping and some of them, like the cooking, not as much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, although I like the cooking. But I kind of, at the end of the day, feel like, "Well, I cooked sort of a fattening, expensive dinner and I liked it. Yay!" (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [Then the feeling's nice.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And I don't know if there's a way in which you feel like that more broadly about a life that — this time that you've spent mostly focused on taking care of yourself. You don't feel like there's achievement or a lot to hold onto from it. [00:29:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And at the same time you're worried about what happens when you start working and can't just focus on taking care of yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I was a little unclear about the school part. I thought you were kind of looking forward to that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm not looking forward to it at all, which is bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Be nice to look forward to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible at 00:29:51) sort of dread about it that you felt [through the fall] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean my only hope is that by living a life totally separate from it, I can sort of feel like a very changed person and it can become something I can do instead of those things that made me sick and gave me hallucinations and migraines. Because the way it lives in my mind it's not as a mutual entity or a stepping stone to a career I would like but it has all of this very negative causality surrounding it and I need that to dissipate before I can really go back and be rational about it. So I'm just staying as far away from it as I can for a while, hoping the negativity will go away by itself and they can see it for what it is. But I — but while I'm still sort of living in the shadow of the illness, I don't think that's going to happen, which is one of the reasons why I've been writing so much in my journal. I've been trying to — I feel like if I don't write it down it didn't happen, so I've been trying to create a life that exists and is important and isn't totally terrible or at least is interesting (chuckles) through writing about it. [00:31:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So you're kind of writing down the life you have in order to give it kind of substance that you can inhabit happily.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping conversation) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because telling people about it hasn't been at all helpful so far. Because Tricia is always looking for sort of easy answers like, "Oh you know, it must be so nice being here with a car. Oh, you must feel so good now that you've found a job." It's all about, you know ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The things she says never make it interesting or really make it seem that worthwhile.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And talking to other people about it, it's hard not to just be totally negative. (chuckles) Because according to my value system, like what I'm doing right now isn't great and what I want. [00:32:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So — but when I write in my journal, I can let that down a little bit and sort of admit that I enjoy cooking dinner and watching an episode of Battlestar Galactica with Jeff before I went to bed — that was nice (chuckles) — and write about other things that are interesting but that I don't necessarily want to go on about (inaudible at 00:32:56).</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now but we'll talk more next week.</p>

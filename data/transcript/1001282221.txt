<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that there are a couple of things I'd like to say, one is in regard to this mob(ph). Ah, these are people who are ah, going to be high school counselors and ah, I've been working with them several days and I guess I can just say that I know they're ah, friendly and sympathetic group so, even though they are listening in on this, I think you don't need to feel that ah, they're listening as though they would be critical or anything like that. And uhm, I guess another thing I would say is that, uhm, I really am eager to talk with you but I realized this may not go, I mean maybe uhm, maybe you'll feel at some point, "Gee, I don't want to do this any longer." You're perfectly at liberty to say, "I wanna to stop it," if you feel like it. And uhm, I don't know what you may want to talk about; I'd be interested in hearing anything that would let me know a little more about you. Or if there are things that have been of concern to you, talk about those.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I, I have about 50 million different questions I'd like to ask you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right try asking some of them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, a lot of&mdash;</p> first and foremost, can you help a student who needs to find an occupation, a goal or set goals or make the rest of his years, who doesn't have one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, I guess I would say that ah, I'm no expert on occupations, but ah, yes, I have been able sometimes to help people find the kind of goals they want for themselves. Ah, are you saying that that's a part of what ah, concerns you, that you're not really sure what direction you want to move, hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's not say really. I'm just not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah. (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not. I haven't got a pass yet, ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know at all where you want to&mdash;</p> what direction you wanna move or what you want to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm. I'm stuck in one little place. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, I'm not quite clear about that. You're stuck in one little place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm moving on with my class, but I mean, I have no certain goals to go to. I don't know what my future is gonna be for me. I don't know what I wanna be yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm, and I know&mdash;</p> I guess, I feel just as trifle puzzled by this notion of you being stuck in one little place. Where, where is this little place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Between here and there and nowhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty clear cut in my own way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And have a wait station between nowhere and nowhere?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm in between nowhere and somewhere, really. If I get a goal then I can work that much harder toward it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay, but if you&mdash;</p> wherever you are now, you really could work if you had any notion of where you did want to move toward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also I want to ask&mdash;</p> I'd like to ask you a question on uhm, your views of us, as juvenile delinquents as we're called by everybody, all the grown-ups and if there's any way that that can be helped too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, ah&mdash;</p> I guess, I'd say a couple of things. Ah&mdash;</p> you may call yourself a juvenile delinquent, ah&mdash;</p> I only thought of you as Mike.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mike? I don't go and get in trouble, it seems like&mdash;</p> if that's what you mean, but people have a way of looking on teenagers as well&mdash;</p> little bit the ah&mdash;</p> not a little bit either&mdash;</p> devil, just to put it that way. We get more mischief than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I can't quite ah, be sure there, what, what ah, your real question is. Uhm, you're wondering how I look at teenagers, is that? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, how would you help them?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How would you help them? I see. Ah&mdash;</p> well, ah, the reason I'm slow in answering is so many things come to mind. Ah&mdash;</p> I go up and try to help them by giving them a chance to talk out their own purposes and feelings and so on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boy, that knocked me down, real quick.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That had knocked you down real quick? You feel, "Boy, that would be no help to me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: In order to have a purpose, you gotta have a goal. What am I going to say, if I'm not (inaudible [00:05:45]) to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah&mdash;</p> you feel that a person couldn't talk about himself unless he already had a goal, is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something to establish, to work with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm. Well, I guess what I meant was that often in talking about their feelings and so on, people find goals they would like to move towards.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kinda skeptical on that though.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't see how you can do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It, it can be done, I know. Ah, how do you go about uhm, take me for instance, how do you go about&mdash;</p> like I don't have a goal like I told you awhile ago. How do you go about helping me find one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well ah, let's, let's talk about it a bit. Uhm, you say you have no goal. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not even one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There isn't anything you want to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well yeah, I wanna keep on living.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a goal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, uhm&mdash;</p> otherwise for picking a career, I have none whatsoever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, you do want to keep on living?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, who doesn't?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel everybody wants to keep on living?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't feel that way. I know quite a few that don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. So do I. And so I'm interested, you say that for you, that is one thing. Life, life somehow in some way or another seems worth living. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It somehow has enough possibilities that ah, give it a chance any way or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, ah, if a person didn't wanna go on living and had no goal, then that would be a sign of ah, mental trouble, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it sure would be a sign he wasn't very happy. Uhm, I don't really go very much for this business of... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Many...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... mental trouble and so on. What I mean is ah, to me a person seems to be a person and ah, sure some of them are doing very well and some of them are very unhappy and so on, but ah... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, how do you go about getting a person you wanna say, ah, have a brighter outlook on life?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I&mdash;</p> the way I get that is, that you're partly asking that to yourself. How could I have a somewhat brighter outlook on life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my outlook on life isn't dim but it's not ah, shiny as to the world either. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. It's about ah, 15 what, maybe or something, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, maybe 75.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, 75 well. Ah, but you wish it were a brighter outlook on life. In what sense is it dim, can you tell me?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, ah&mdash;</p> family.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Family? I don't know if you'd be willing to tell me about that, but I'd be very willing to listen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's just the same old story, mothers and fathers try to tell their kids what to do and the kids revolt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, that's the only thing right now, it's between my parents and me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, I guess you are saying this is true in general, but it's also true of you. Did your parents try to tell you what to do? (indistinct sound) And you feel, "I won't pick that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't feel it, I say it. Of course what I say and what I do are two different things though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh uhm&mdash;</p> I'm, I'm ah, (indistinct sound) not quite clear there. You say ah... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you say it, but you don't really feel it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well ah, let's put it this way, if my mother tells me what to do, and whether I like it or not, I'm&mdash;</p> I have to do it. But boy I let her know that I'm not too happy about having to do it either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Are you saying that she may be able to ah, make me behave in certain ways or do certain things but she can't control the way I feel and I let her know how I feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And about twice at a time and she has to ask about two times of it straight in a row, I think she usually gives in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Save the mess and bother, you know... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... breaking the dishes and stuff like that. (laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughing) So that ah&mdash;</p> what are you saying, that when you sort of stand up in&mdash;</p> on your hind leg strong enough a couple of times in a row, then no matter what she thinks, she kind of gives in to save the broken dishes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not the broken dishes because she sees that ah, she's gone a little too far.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See I have a stepfather.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, well, let's put it this way. My stepfather and I are not on the happiest terms in the world. And so when he states something and of course she goes along and when I stood&mdash;</p> stand up and let her know that I don't like what he's telling me, well, she usually gives in to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes and sometimes it's just the opposite.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. But ah, part of what really makes for difficulty is the fact that you and your stepfather as you say are not ah&mdash;</p> your relationship isn't completely rosy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Let's just put it this way, I hate him and he hates me. It's just that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you really hate him and you feel he really hates you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know if he hates me or not, but I, I know one thing, I don't like him whatsoever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You can't speak for sure about his feelings because only he knows exactly what those are, as far as you're concerned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He knows how I feel about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't have any use for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: None whatsoever and that's been for about eight years now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So for about eight years, you've lived with a person whom you have no respect for and really hate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I respect him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, excuse me. I got that wrong. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to respect him. I don't have to but I do. But I don't love him, I hate him. I can't stand him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are certain things you respect him for but that doesn't alter the fact you definitely hate him and don't love him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I respect anybody who has ah, bravery and courage and he does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah&mdash;</p> I feel that though I respect him, I don't like him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. But you will ah&mdash;</p> you do give him credit for the fact that he's brave, he has guts or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm. Yeah, he shows that ah, he can ah, do a lot of things that ah&mdash;</p> well, a lot of men can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also he has asthma. I mean the doctor hasn't given him very long to live.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, he&mdash;</p> even though he knows he's gonna die, he keeps working.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he works at a film site(ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I respect him for that too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. So I guess you're saying, he really has quite ahm, few... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What it takes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... yeah, he has what it takes in quite a few ways. Ah, he has a number of good qualities but ah, that doesn't ah, mean that you care for him at all, quite the reverse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That is the truth. The only reason I ah&mdash;</p> put up with being around him is because for my mother's sake.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. If it weren't for her, you feel you just wouldn't stand it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my mother is good but if he would&mdash;</p> if my mother is gonna&mdash;</p> he&mdash;</p> if she died and he, say had taken care of us I'd get out of there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, I wouldn't, there would be no use for me staying around. I'd tell him what I thought of him about twice and then that would be it. He has a temper that can cause a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So between the feelings of heat that you have and the, and the temper that he has... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's something... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... you feel that there were just the two and, "Boy, I could blow up and nothing (inaudible [00:15:56])."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Little pieces?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, blow up in little pieces? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly about the way he is, because ah, well, he has old time ideas as I call 'em, and he does not&mdash;</p> he looks down on the younger generation, or what we have, what we're doing right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And our dances and that, he tries to put us back to where he and what he did. And so there's a constant go(ph) that and then of course, because I don't want to be a machinist and he is well, that's, that's the driving point right there. So we have an argument, about twice a night. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds as though you feel a little scorn about the attitude he has toward modern life (indistinct sound) and as far as his ah, desire for you to be a machinist, well, that just doesn't fit what you want to do and oppose on that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He can't, I don't&mdash;</p> I've tried to be a machinist and I hate metal work more than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel, "This is the last thing I would want to do."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I think if somebody told me to take either&mdash;</p> if I didn't take another work, they'd cheat me out of this. I would then pull the trigger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That bad, rather than be what he wants you to be... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... or rather than be a metal worker...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I&mdash;</p> if he&mdash;</p> if it was something that I like and he wanted me to be it, I'd be it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel it's not, it's not just resistance against him. You feel, "I just don't like that kind of work. I mean, I hate it so that I'd rather be dead than do that."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have no ah, skill in it at all. I don't have a knack for it or anything. I guess the only thing I can do in there is hand the person the tool and even then, if they ask for a certain tool, I usually give them the chisel. (chuckles)</p> 

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds as though you feel you're, you're all thumbs in that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's put it this way, it's like I have butter on my hands about that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Butter on your hands. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no&mdash;</p> and if I don't do this and he's that. He, he's getting kind of under the skin.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting into your skin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds as though he really had gotten under your skin.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) He's been at, in and out of there for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. Sounds like a real pestering, simmering...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... bubble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hatred. Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said bubble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bubble? Maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly (inaudible [00:25:10])</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess I like your word better. It's kind of a, kind of a boiling pot that's been boiling and bubbling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and (inaudible [00:18:44]).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'll...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The steam is just gonna blow the lid pretty quick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think once I blow the lid, then that would be it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you ever really blow your top with your stepfather, that's gonna be the end.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's, let's put it this way. After I do that, he'll wash his hands.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, he'll, he would give you up, sort of then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Well, let's just put it this way. He'd say, "There's the Armed Forces, here's your clothes, go. The Army is calling you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I get the impression. You're saying, "He would just coldly kick me out."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's about it. He's trying it so far and he's not getting it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda sort of let it soak in what I hear in your voice some of that too 'coz ah, I don't know, sounds that you feel kind of cold on that too, you know that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't like to be forced into nothing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nobody's gonna push you around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I'm not looking at it that way. A lot of people will. Ah, if I want to, maybe I'll be pushing them. I'm not holding a grudge, but Iant to, maybe I'll be pushing them. I'm not holding a grudge, but Ah, i'm not having my stepfather, or my mother, or anybody tell me what service I'm gonna join and when I'm gonna join if I&mdash;</p> unless I'm drafted, and then of course, I have no choice but ah, he's not gonna make me join the navy or the army or the marines. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess, I guess you're saying that all the strength you've got, "Not my stepfather, nor my mother, nor anybody is gonna boss me around and tell me what to do."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. That's not what I meant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just on that one point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Ah, okay, I see, I see... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Coz if I say I'm not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... okay, it isn't a general thing but it's ah, just that&mdash;</p> "They are not gonna boss me as to what I'm gonna do about going into service."</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. That's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not saying that ah, in general. You're not saying that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because if they ask me something, ask me to do something I'm not gonna turn around for no reason at all, saying no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 'Coz usually I'd do it just to keep on the good side of him but ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When it comes to that, I figured that's my right and I'm not, if I don't wanna go into that, I'm not going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying, "In some things that I would want to keep on the good side of them, I would wanna be reasonable, but there are some things that I feel are my choice and by George I'm gonna stick to those."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. And if I don't, well, (chuckles). I just don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If, if you don't stick to your choice then you've just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'm down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like a ship that's ah, caught at sea, I'm drowning and I can't get back up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I sort of get the feeling, you're saying there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sink or swim and I'm not sinking yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "These decisions that I feel are mine, that's my ship and if I ever let go of that, I'd really sink there, I'd be a ship without a rudder. I really wouldn't ah..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I wouldn't have anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That'd be about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get the feeling you're saying, "If I gave up on that, I would be giving up myself," is that it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're saying, "I have no intention of doing that." But maybe sometimes you're a little bit scared in life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's one thing I know of. And I make it ah, quite plain to my mother and father what I'd be doing and what I'm not. And they make it quite plain to me what they think of it, which isn't too much. But it's, it's just regular except about this fight with my father, well, that's... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, I see. And if it's regular you mean, a lot of these differences that you have with your parents, well if it happens to everybody, that's regular. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But as far as despising your stepfather is concerned...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... that's an extra part of your situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think there are many (chuckles) people who would walk up to their father and say, "Look, old man. I hate your guts and get out." And that's what I've done to him. And so, (chuckles) well, it didn't, it didn't hit too hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't quite tell from your description there about what your feeling is about when you stepped up to him and said...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we had had an argument though. I just didn't walk up telling him that. We've been, we've been arguing for about two hours and so. He was berating a couple of my friends and so I just told him what I thought of him and his friend at that time and he came pretty close to blow it at that time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. This was really a knock-down-and-drag-out fight and everything except the fist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh hmm. It was mostly all verbal. My poor mother stepped back and she didn't know which side to side on. She has the funniest expression on her face and she can't figure out what to do. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I know that as you think about that ah, scrap, you can't help but smile too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think it ah, this scrap really brought my father and I just a little bit closer on one part because now he understands my feelings a little better and I can understand what he is&mdash;</p> what he&mdash;</p> how he feels and so it makes, ah, easier on both of us to know that if we keep out of each other's, ah, social activities, that will be good enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh, so that even though this was ah, from probably from your mother's point of view or any observer's point of view, a pretty knock-down-and-drag-out fight, that you feel really, "that brought me and my step-father really closer together 'coz I said what I felt and he, he really heard it..." (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He recognized...(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "... and he said some things that he felt and I really understood some of that too."</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if you can't understand that he's never had any children all his life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there&mdash;</p> another problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel that, that ah, I, I get a real note of softness when you say that because you realize well, he never has had any children all his life and it probably was fairly rough on him trying to live with a teenage boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uhm, teenage boys.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Boys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And a girl.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Very... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he's got to, he's got to com (inaudible [00:02:30]) in his hands. (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All of a sudden he walked in to a whole family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, ah, when he first came we weren't teenagers. I wasn't... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... my brother was. He's on the verge but I wasn't. And so he's, I've been with him since the third grade. And so that's kinda long time. And so he's got, he, ah, like, to say, he could have been my real father except that I really wasn't. I've had two fathers before him. My real one and then my first step-father. He died of polio. And then he came in. Well, at the first ah, he didn't seem so bad. He took a liking to my older brother because he is a machinist, and my sister, she's an only girl. And so that left a space in between them and boy, I was I struggling to keep that one in order. But now it's no longer a struggle I just got punched in one way or the other and I'm gonna hit something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, uhm. Did you feel that you were somehow really left in the gap? Your older brother he liked, 'coz he's gonna be a machinist and took to him in a way. And your sister, it's nice to have a girl. That like, you know...</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've got... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That left you nowhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... and I've got a little brother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And a little brother too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you can see where that puts me. And ah...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda behind the eighth ball I guess, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no I feel farther on that I'm not bad as far as Pluto is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's pretty cold too. But ah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're way out in the cold outer space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm in orbit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I figure that if ah, I leave though I think that ah, I'll be doing him a big favor so I'm not moving yet. As there(ph) can see I don't want to leave home either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, uhm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's on an entirely different argument I think, I (inaudible [00:04:14]).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, but, your one reason that ah, you think, "One reason that I wouldn't leave home is that ah, probably he would like it if I left. (crosstalk)</p>


<p>CLIENT: (inaudible [00:04:23])</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I won't."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I have no judgment and I have no right, so far, huh. I don't know if I, and ah, well I find it's not too terribly hard there except that it does get kind of uhm, you know, gripe there I think and a bit of a political hot wind, you know, you always hear about that. Well it's not political hot wind that's going around that house, but its going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a real hot wind blowing most of the time, and it isn't political either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's not but ah, I don't know. I don't think we'll ever work, work it really out 'coz he don't kind of see my point of view too barely and I'm not interested in him at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But still whatever progress you might make would be pretty small because you don't think he really wants to understand you and you're darn sure that ah, you're not enough interested in him to want to understand him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you think, it couldn't really work out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's ah, he was the only kid. He was spoiled rotten and well; let me tell you, a spoiled rotten father is not the best kind in the world to have. He is used to having his way and that's it. In the army, he was lieutenant and then he dropped back down to master sergeant after the war and so of course right there, he got most of his way too. What he wanted done and so we're&mdash;</p> I'm living in an army camp with a one-man-general.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. And you also feel you're living with a spoiled child who's always had his own way and he managed to have most of his own way during the army too. (indistinct sound) (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, you're living in a one-man army with a spoiled child general. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Spoiled brat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Spoiled brat then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He's been taught&mdash;</p> it's not, it's no his fault; it's the way he was taught. Nothing against the Northerners but ah, he comes from the North and his aunts and uncle are quite rich and so of course, they taught him&mdash;</p> they, they loved him and they paid for him. But they taught him that you&mdash;</p> instead of love you can buy a kid a present to make him happy. And so, he thinks he can buy love. That's his political downfall, it's like 'coz you can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he may try to buy my love, but that doesn't work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, ah yeah. At Christmas, he bought me a scooter. I've been wanting it for years and he came up to me and ah, said here, you know he's really a nice guy, and he said, "Now, what do you think of your old man?" Your old man is what we called him and I told him, "I'll tell you, you can't buy love and turned around and walked off," and I think that hurt him. But it's the truth. He was trying to buy me to go on his side and I'm not gonna do it. If he really loves me then he'll show me so in different ways than buying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Saying, "I'm not about to be bought" then you feel&mdash;</p> when I told him that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible [00:07:46])</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... I freaked him. But ah...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the truth. I'm not a German and I'm, I'm not gonna be bought and I'm not a Russian. I'm an American. And we are free people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're free, that's it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We can't be bought.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, that's it. So if he loves you, he'd show that in different ways. It wouldn't be through buying scooters or anything else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. And you, you could call it maybe the show of ah, gratitude or maybe or something. Maybe it was just a little bit of love on his side but I don't think he showered and went for about five years and then ah, I think sooner, our mother finally got pissed on me because he was, he was dead set against it. And for a long while, my mother was too until I started pointing out to her the facts that I could have a lot more fun. I wouldn't have to be borrowing the car all the time. And I wrecked one of our cars so (laughs). Well, that helped me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel there are a lot of circumstances probably that led to you getting the scooter and you faintly think that it might be possible that there was a little bit of love on his part in it but then you think, "No, I don't think so."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't know, I can't read his mind. I'm not a mind reader.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're just not sure whether that it was just an attempt to buy you or whether maybe there's a small bit of affection there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've told you all about it. And my mother said, "I can't tell, you can't tell a person's actions. I gave that up a long time ago by trying to be in his character." So, it's in between ah, to ah, whether he really was trying to buy me, if I could say that or I say that or whether it's just a small part of his own taking time to show that he really does appreciate time with me. So, I doubt it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, uhm. You realize, you don't know, you can't be sure of his feelings, conceivable that some of his feelings that you don't know. You can't read his mind and you don't know his feelings. You don't know whether he feels any affection for you or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now, he's, he's been, him and I have been having a bout. We had one out about two days ago about either finding a goal for my life, set a goal and he was hoping that two to one that it's mechanic and I told him then it wouldn't be or to join the army or one of the military services so that they could help me instead. But ah, I don't know. Maybe he won't, you can't tell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If this is the latest ah, go-round you had with him with in regard to what you would do next, whether you would be a mechanic and on that you're darn sure what the answer is or whether you could go into the services and there you feel maybe some of his thinking is sound, you're just not sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think if I went in to services, he'll use his political pull to get me into being a mechanic whether I like it or not and that's the reason I don't want to go (inaudible [00:11:42]).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afraid that his long arm might ah, reach out even into the services and make you be a mechanic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see, he's got an admiral friend and that's the one he wants. If I join, I'll be under him. And you know, him and my father are very, very good friends and so my father just might accidentally whisper that I'll have to like mechanic which I don't. And so that would be it. I'd be a mechanic for the rest of my senior career. Dad (inaudible [00:12:09]) jumping off into a place where it says, "Watch out for barracudas." And I said to him that (inaudible [00:12:18]) in order to be one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just don't want to take the chance that he might somehow influence your Navy career and make you a mechanic in spite of yourself and that's a big risk than this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some people that is probably not and but then I said they probably can't understand how I feel about it, that I hated it. I can't see any... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: These people and probably most people wouldn't ever be able to understand the fact that that you just despise the whole... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Idea?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... occupation that he's in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I can't see anything into picking up a tool and walking over to a bolt and taking it off and finding out whatever is wrong you'll have to go down and buy a part. Then you've got to come back in and put it back in, then you have to put the whole thing together. And it was together when you started out, but then there's people that you can pay to do that and have it done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just feel disgusted with the whole damn enterprise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to put it nicely. I can't say it but you can. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, that's what you felt then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is and I don't see anything in taking off the bolt. Why should&mdash;</p> I'm not that I think that ah, I'm too low&mdash;</p> high to do it. I just can't see why I have to do it and it would be two to one that I take it off the wrong direction anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd get it on left hand in some way or another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right; I'd try and, and if I didn't I'd go down trying. I don't know. I'm not a mechanic, never will be and never will, it can't be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I'm going to have to stop in a few minutes ah, is there more you want to say or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I&mdash;</p> I'm ready to stop anytime you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Ah, (indistinct sound) I guess I feel very appreciative really that you've been willing to share this much of yourself with me, and ah, I know as well as you do that ah, there ain't any quick and easy answers to a lot of these things. But ah, I really do hope that you'll be able to make choices and directions that will have some satisfaction for you and I'll even hope that maybe you can ah, find some ways of ah, living a little more comfortably with your stepfather but I see that... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's something. That's the H-bomb, like the atom bomb will drop and go off... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel I'm an incurable optimistic. I hope that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know. I mean this world is full of scientific discoveries; maybe they'll discover a way to make a father where he can't talk anymore... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ... against you, that is. And a kid that won't talk against his father. Who knows? (inaudible [00:15:15])</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that, that would be an invention, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, You'd take a pill and all you think is happy thoughts and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hmm. But I guess it sounds a little skeptical. I'm not sure you would take the pill even if it would make you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) All right, all right. I'd probably think it'd taste bitter and throw it away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be really a bitter pill to swallow, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know him yet. I don't know. I'd like to get on the good sides of him. If&mdash;</p> I&mdash;</p> if he would ever come to my terms and ah, I continue to see ah, who Mr. Kelly tried to help me with this. And ah, for a long time my father came halfway and we had a compromise. But, well&mdash;</p> a father will be a father. That's all there is to it. And so he broke his compromise and well, I declared war in the end and so he's back at it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uhm, uhm. There's a truce for a while and it even seems that those things were a little bit better. But, war has now been declared again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bomb fails (inaudible [00:16:17]). I'm gonna hop off this subject and hop on to the subject of counseling, do you mind?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, I've got something to say. I'm&mdash;</p> to all these people just... (crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ah, Mr. Kelley is a good counselor and I'm sure that all of you will agree. And speaking from my point of view and from kids of my age and that. We need good counselors now. Some of these counselors we have aren't worth&mdash;</p> well, I can't say the words, but they're not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You, you wouldn't say it. I'll say it. Aren't worth the damn? Is that what you are trying to say? (crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And ah, they aren't. They don't&mdash;</p> they think that, "Well, they're juvenile delinquents, they're no good." And Mr. Kelley is the only counselor I've been able to confide and decided to and find a lot of help. When I came to our school, I was mixed up; I would admit I was looking forward to blasting my head off and that would have been a quick release(ph). And, had I waited a couple more days, I think it would have been too late. And Mr. Kelley helped me and my family in giving me a much better outlook on my life. And if you all can do that well then&mdash;</p> I mean, I know you're all going to be having a place in God's heart because you all are helpers of all these young kids and you don't look down on your nose at us, like a lot of people do. And that's all I have to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I would, I would just bet that a lot of these people think that's the best speech they've heard in a long, long time. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure they'll make good counselors.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well... (crosstalk)</p>


<p>COUNSELOR: Nice getting acquainted with you. Good luck to you. (clapping)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that okay? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's working fine. I'm laughing because it has been a crazy day. This was no different. I just was - I have been having a very hard time at work and literally to the point where I really cannot risk getting any more gaps. So I have been trying to stay on top of things and today just happened to be a day where I had to stay on top of things until the very end which basically meant until five of five. I scurried out and tried to find a cab and the rest is New York weather and there were no cabs to be had.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is hard to find a cab in the rain. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So I am very sorry that I am late. I didn't think we could do this at all and I was just coming up here to apologize and I figured I would find you going down the hall. So I am surprised that we are doing this at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it okay with you to do this till six?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is fine; it is just that this is above and beyond the call of duty for you who's been sitting here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I planned on being here till six. They will charge you though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As they should. What you mean from five till - of course? I thought they were going to charge me anyway. So, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And what is the latest hour we can meet on some of these evenings? You don't like have a life or anything? I mean, is it like 5 o'clock and that is pretty much the latest you can go or the latest you are willing to go or whatever because frankly this is - there are a lot of things that go on during the week and I am beginning to wonder if I am too busy to be depressed or something like that or whatever. I can't - this is the first time that I have had a job like this so I don't know what to say except that this seems to be very difficult to - and this is the second time this has happened. And obviously you problems with time but I am just wondering if there is any way around this or what? I gather from your hesitance this is not an ideal case and you can't sort of say, "Yes, six is fine." </p>


<p>COUNSELOR: I'm thinking about it, yeah; you are right about my hesitancy. I'll tell you where my hesitancy comes from. I probably have some flexibility but my biggest concern is actually getting a room here. Things pretty much start to shut down - people do stay a little later on, on Friday I know they shut down right away but on other weekdays, so it may be a possibility but I can't guarantee anything now I would have to check. I don't want us to schedule for like six and then have you come and we don't have anywhere to go. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if we could find this at all and this is something that you are willing to do or work with - I know next week is actually fine because my boss is gone and so that is would be a good time for us to do two in a row. .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's do two. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think we should just do the whole week and camp out. Therapy everyday and we will get all thirty done next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the crash course. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right; a sure ticket to hell. Okay, so next week five o'clock is fine or even four o'clock because I have complete 100 percent flexibility next week. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's do five o'clock Wednesday and Thursday next week. But for the following week what time did you have in mind; were you thinking; six? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Six would be fine. And what that would mean for me would be that I would not have to go back to work I could wrap everything up. Basically, meetings always run until five and I have to leave early and etcetera, etcetera and what I have been doing is leaving early. And I don't want to go into it but it makes it extremely difficult and then I felt that could sort of do some creative scheduling and so on and so forth but I am hesitant. What I think is going to happen is that this is going to happen; 5:30 is going to be the time and I will try you and there will be no way to get a hold of you because the communication system is down, and I could send smoke signals, but you are unavailable. You are only available for short term contact and I can get something to you in a day or two but that is pretty much it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially late in the day when no one is around. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And no one is answering the phones. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I will check on doing it at six and it may not be a problem at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well 20th century medical center here I would hope not or you can find a way to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well we can be flexible and we will figure something out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well, it was a pretty interesting session last time. I don't know if you remember it very well, it was a long time ago. We were at an impasse and I kept thinking of things in theoretical terms and you were frustrated by that and you don't like doing that. I had no idea what you had put in its place. And I was, sort of, amused and annoyed, like what would you put in its place. And you didn't even like working on that plane. And I wasn't quite sure what to make of all that, except that I found it to be an intriguing impasse. I was a little - it was interesting. I had tons to talk about it afterward. I don't' know about you but it was very - I wasn't quite sure why you - and it has been a while so it is all sort of foggy. But the long and short of it is that the take aware message was I think I felt like at the end of the telling you don't you understand how important it has been to stand at this distance from objects or from things, you know. This has been immensely critical for me; I mean this has been like a life boat to have that distance. </p>

<p>8.39</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say the distance from objects can you explain more what you are talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, like wanting you, for example, to tell me about therapy in theory, you know. It is like, if you tell me in theory then I can adopt it, try it, and come in and work on it for a while and then put it back on the shelf but if I let myself go down too deeply to the primary sources of it I - I don't' know. I wasn't sure what - I'm not quite sure what to do with this impasse I guess and I guess that is the bottom line. And indeed I am - it may be something that doesn't exactly come up because, or come up very frequently, because last time I was in the middle of a lot; I mean, things seemed much more horrible to me. Like two weeks ago I was pissed at you or at least I remember being frustrated. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you were pissed at me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if you have an opinion why don't you express it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I laugh about it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know that I was - I think that I didn't give a damn. But what exactly did I say? I think I was annoyed and frank and I didn't feel like talking at all. I don't remember being angry with you in particular. I remember thinking Jim, what a cry for help he is, or something like that. </p>

<p>11:06</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A cry for help? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That one is lost on me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A cry for help? Yeah, a cry for help, you don't get that reference?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm not sure what the - what it means too...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, if someone walks in and shows you their paintings and that is not a painting that is a cry for help. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is a joke is what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so another joke. I didn't get the last one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, Jim; that was a joke. How many am I up to?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Quite a few already I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Jokes on jokes on jokes</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh; yup. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But I remember not being mad because of the Sicilian comment. Remember, never trust a Sicilian in matters of death. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, don't go in against a Sicilian when death is eminent or something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's great. So it seemed like a fairly collegial impasse, all things considered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you were joking about it then and you are joking about it now. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well, what do you do at impasses anyway? I don't have a formula for an impasse. I do know that this is I don't know if it is a problem or not, maybe but it is kind of interesting that you brought up an impasse which is theoretic logic or is a theoretical claim at the same time.</p>

<p>13:23</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you are right but you know you are smiling again so I am wondering, are we back at the impasse and you are laughing, but I am wondering if we can stop and find out what that smiling is about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, Jim, this sucks. I don't know. I have been going all day today, what can I say, this feels like another meeting in some ways. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'm sure you are tired. I know how long your day must be but that smiling I can't get away from it because it is so constant. It is and it has been quite a few sessions that we have had now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is the only thing I can hold on to. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, tell me what you mean by that. I'm not sure that is so far from the truth. I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Basically, it was another smart ass comment, you know. But I think the truth is that in fact giggling keeps me alive. Being a smart ass is how I separate - I duck situations if I am going to - and we know that. Why am I smiling today? Do you want to do that one or the other one?</p>

<p>15:20</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm going with it yeah, you were thinking about it. It is a hard question I take it then? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, essentially I probably get more mileage out of; I don't talk like that to anyone. I am tired of being scheduled on the quarter hour and this sort of plays into sort of buttons. Hurrying to get up here and feeling like this is another meeting it's, sort of, kind of, annoying. Feeling guilty that I couldn't get here was annoying. I feel basically cornered. I think that is the bottom line. No matter how hard I work I don't quite pull it off. I don't know what other people in the business do differently but I certainly am writing as fast as I can, reading as fast as I can, I'm sleeping as little as I can, I'm doing all these things the best that I can and I am working hard and playing by the rules as Bill Clinton would say and I still feel cornered. And this is bothering me. And this is just such a small fraction of it. You know, every day that ticks by I am getting deeper in with Cynthia and for some reason every day that ticks by and this relationship continues I feel like somehow the final answer here is that I am going to be up to my neck in a new problem for some reason because I am not facing that one. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The final answer is here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No the final product is that in June or May I am going to end up in a miserable situation with Cynthia because we have spent all this time doing this side shit here and Cynthia is just getting gooier and gooier and everyday that I am with her it is, like on the one had we resolve more issues but on the other hand I feel like I am dating a seven year old; a very, very, very, bright seven year old, but none the less somebody who is not in my age group. Somebody who I don't feel connected to and there is no one to talk to this about. I don't know.</p>

<p>18:18</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so let me come back for a second. Because what you are talking about is important and it is a big part of what this impasse that we have been having is all about. I was curious and I am not sure if you answered about the laughing today. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I said it was a defense mechanism. I said I felt cornered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Cornered, okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So the connection between the two for me is I actually didn't want to, I was sort of too tired to head into another meeting where I discussed sort of rote. But actually I said, look, you really have to do this. So if it turned out to be the most correct thing to do was to jump in with both feet even though I was tired and tell you why I am angry instead of giggling with jokes  - -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And feeling cornered, just like being in meetings all day? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, only this turned out to be a meeting where I should speak up, besides the fact that I didn't want to, it is more kind of to please you, kind of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are joking again, a little bit. Are you feeling cornered now? </p>

<p>PATIENT: See that is it. Every time I giggle I'm cornered. </p>

<p>19:45</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am asking you questions. I am asking you questions and asking you to look at stuff and you are joking and giggling again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true. And do I feel cornered now? I don't feel cornered necessarily I don't know quite why I'm laughing. God, why don't you just shoot me Jim, gee?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's another joke I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that one is a plea. You didn't answer my question, I answered it again and I started giggling. Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder as you are giggling again I think -</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is something going on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If there is something going on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Jim, haven't we already answered that question about the giggling? I told you what was, can't we move on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we have gotten part of the answer to that question. And I think we have been working on, I see you, it is not a question of, I see you and I ask and I want you to seriously think about it and we are trying to come up with an answer, but I think it still keeps happening. It is like omnipresent, you know. And it seems to happen and it doesn't seem random to me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>22:01</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Forget it. It is not easy for you to talk about. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to say. I mean, I guess it's software error. What else could it be? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Software error?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean what else is there to be. If I don't have enough energy or spirit or horsepower to confront issues directly then I use this sort of budget measure of going out of it from the side and, you know, that's great. I am a little perplexed as to why we would go back and talk about it in theory. I actually was heading right into the meat of the topic which was, as far as I am concerned, feeling cornered and what it was that makes me feel cornered. Which, I said very specifically, was I over scheduled, I'm burning the candle at both ends; blah, blah, blah. I am working hard and all theses things and these are all sort of concrete stuff and - Am I getting this wrong, but aren't you the one doing the theory now? Why do you laugh or why are you laughing? I mean - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we are back to the impasse. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's a different impasse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's your impasse. You are the one doing the theory now, not me. But maybe we should avoid it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the laughing is important and I want to pay attention to that. That's - talk about cornering you. . </p>

<p>PATIENT: What better way to hold me then to watch me move away. What do you want to talk about Jim? </p>

<p>24:28</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you are laughing again now and again it's - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's your topic not mine. I already said why I was laughing. When I started talking about what was underneath it then you said, "No, I want to talk about the laughing again," like cornering me again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, actually we are running out of time and I wish we had more time to talk about this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you don't. . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have a funny feeling this is going to come up again. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm very sorry I was late. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's okay. Well, next time or next week you will be okay for five Wednesday and Thursday? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Wednesday and Thursday at five. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if I don't tell you be sure to remind me next week to find out if six is possible. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Thanks Jim. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. See you next week. </p>

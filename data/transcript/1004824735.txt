<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you're here. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm glad I'm here, too. So well, I'm sleepy. I did my—I had a presentation due for my—for my group—for my research group. And I was—I've been working on it kind of like reading background like throughout the summer and more like dedicated, devoted than in the past -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in the past two, three weeks. So I've been working pretty hard on this presentation and I was very nervous about giving it, well because—I mean, my advisor—like if you say something wrong, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he's not going to let you get away with it. As he shouldn't, but, you know, it's kind of embarrassing and it's like, you know—and it—it just sort of—reading through—my new project is based upon sort of a fundamental question that chemists have been trying to answer since 1930.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's hard to, when you're reading through all the pages, to sort of think that you can do a cont—make a contribution -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but one of my slides—as it turned out, after like I was just working on it non-stop, and Jeremy was actually gone during the hurricane because he had a business trip, and it was actually nice because I could just sort like work on my own hours. In a sense, it wasn't nice -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because like I wasn't really showering -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I was just (laughs) yeah, I was—I was kind of making up my own hours, I wasn't leaving the house. I wasn't—I wasn't really being a human being -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:01:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I was working like—if I wasn't working on that, I was maybe working on, you know, nail polish online, but (laughs) you know, it—it was—you know it was kind of—it was good that I had that sort of focus -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and then on Thursday actually I gave the presentation, and except for one slide, it actually went over pretty well. And like my advisor was very thankful that I gave such a—you know, a very thorough sort of overview of the field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is something that—I mean, since our group does so many different things, it was good for all of us -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so that we could actually have some sort of basis to sort of comment on each other's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —projects, and you know, I was talking to him—you know, to him and the group about chaos and how it's not how it's—how not many physicists know about it—you know, it's sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —physical implications on systems, not many people know about it. And -besides mathematicians, and he was just like, you know—it was interesting, because before I came, he had sort of moved on from chaos -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —which he had published so many works back in the days, and he had kind of done what was more fundable, what would get him money. But now I was the first one that I guess I brought chaos back into his life (laughs). And you know, now all the other new Ph. D students that are a year below me and a year below that, they're all doing works on chaos. And I don't know, I just thought it was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, I mean it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've had an impact. [00:03:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I did. And I mean that (laughs)—you know, and he actually said—he's like, "Well, I'm really going to miss you once you leave next year." And I was like, "Leave next year? He still thinks I'm going to leave next year? Maybe I am going to leave next year." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I—my research, it's kind of hard to balance out everything and you know, sometimes when I have homework or stupid presentations for the class to work on, like I sort of shift my focus, and it's hard to like really, you know, just concentrate on my research.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was good to sort of get that interest back and it's—it's interesting, because now that I sort of like—I sort of realized that if I fall asleep, it's generally just because I'm tired or, you know, (coughs) it's not like anything's wrong with me. So I can actually stay awake more during reading papers like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like, I'll just like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I'll just take more breaks or like—and I'm actually doing a lot more work at home, like I'll split up the day. Like in the morning, after Jeremy leaves, I'll work for like an hour, take like an hour nap, and then I'll be up and working again and I won't take another nap. And then I'll usually go into school, which is why I was taking the bus in to get to you, because you were my midday split. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—yeah, it's actually—by breaking up the day like that, I just realized I can't sit by myself in an office all day. I mean, I need different variety.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems to be some of the sleepiness was con—boredom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or at least just like kind of burning out in one space.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it was. And I mean, I realized that I do need—like last night I was just so happy about, you know, graduating in a year, I just couldn't get to sleep until like 4:00 A.M. I was just so happy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No wonder you were tired today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). I mean, normally, I don't do that, but—but today, I'm tired. I took a nap, so I guess that equaled five hours of sleep, kind of. That's not bad. But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's still way under what you need. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. I know. I'm planning on going to bed early, but I mean, it's just—it was interesting like because like I didn't realize how stressed out I was getting by the whole presentation and my Ph. D., and like I was breaking out—I—like all over my body. And I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, not serious, but normally, I don't break out say on my arms or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —and you know, it's crazy because I just sort of—I sort of realized that anxiety is like something—it's really internal and like it really—I mean, even though I don't worry about stupid stuff -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —the anxiety is, you know—like I really see that it's good that I'm trying to learn how to manage it because it's—you know, it really affects my body -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and it probably would affect most people's bodies. [00:06:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. What were the thoughts that were going through your head as you were preparing for the presentation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, as I was preparing the presentation, like every—anything that I put up on the slide, like, well, "Do I really know this? And is that—let me go back to what this paper says." And like, "Oh, this paper says something, I don't really understand this." And then you have to read other papers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I would read other papers and then I'd just like, "Ugh," and then I'd go back and—to see that point -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I was like—I would be like—you know, I would just keep on—every point was like a—it was kind of like re—setting something in stone. And like it—it—it was—it seemed like if it was going to go up there, it had to be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I had to try and disprove and improve because it was—it—it was like every—I mean, it was—you know, it's—it's—it's just—you know, giving a presentation, I guess in front of scholars and intellectuals, they're going to ask you questions, questions that you don't even know how to answer. And like, you know, you don't like—at least in our group meetings, like my advisor like when you're wrong, he'll say, "Oh, well, you're being misleading. And I don't really like this slide, you know, because people are now confused. Let me tell you how it really is." [00:07:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in a sense, he does correct -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he doesn't just call—call you out and say it's wrong, because you know the group legitimately was conflict—confused -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —on one slide. But I guess the week before there was another sort of visiting student. He gave his presentation and it was just very painful -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because Edward would say like, "Well, well, I don't know. Like, you're doing this wrong." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like, you know, "I don't understand. This—this—this doesn't make sense." And like he would say that over and over and over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like people were getting restless and like—and like the guy went up to the board and he wrote stuff and it didn't make sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and people were—it was just like I sort of—I guess everyone—like I didn't want to be like that, and I remembered -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —how my last presentation in the class went, which was not to the group, but to the actual quantum information class. And you know there—it—it wasn't as flawless, and I realized in hindsight what I should have done is taken notes while we were talking to the TF so that I could have captured -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —what is really the physical meaning and—because you know, when you're—you just can forget something when it's not very personal to your heart. [00:09:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—and—but the quantum information class that I'm taking is kind of like a—like I want—like I really tried and wanted to like it, but it was—it's definitely not an introductory course. Like, I mean, I don't know—maybe I was—maybe I was stupid for thinking it was going to be—I don't know what I was thinking it would be. But I thought it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I know what an introductory physics course is, but this is a graduate course. But still, introductory means that—like I mean, just the—the things he talks about and maybe like people—more—the people that are taking this class are more specialists, like people that have been in his research group, the professor's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —research group for like two years are taking this class. And I was like I knew nothing about quantum information, and like the lectures I don't really get much from, and like while I could prepare (coughs) for each lecture, it just sort of seems that—like there's so much reading to go—because he moves so fast. [00:10:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's like—it was kind of like no way—I mean, I learned probably more from reading for the homework than—I mean, I go to his lectures -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I didn't go to his extra lecture that was on Friday because I was too tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know, I just get frustrated because it's kind of like you're—I mean, there is sort of a culture in some of—you know, in this place, to go out and impress your professor. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like people aren't out to just—I mean, you share knowledge, but they're also there to look smart -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or get the professor's attention and ask a good question.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. Like I would just like to know what was going on (laughs). And like I mean, you know, the sort of—yeah, I mean, it's just—it's really interesting and it moves really fast paced. And it reminds me of like when I was interested in pursuing—another professor, when I first got to graduate school, and he's actually friends with this professor that I have now. They're like—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they team up. But the one professor is an experimentalist and the other is a theorist. And I was originally taking the theorist's class many years ago. And you know, it was just sort of like—it was such a scary sort of thing. And like, you know, like half the time I just didn't know—I don't know—like I guess for graduate courses, you do have to do a lot of work. [00:12:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And since I'm not getting tested on the lectures, there's sort—you know, the homework, but a lot of the times, I just do lots of reading on my own for the homework. I guess, maybe that's what he realizes is sort of going to happen. He just feels that he should, you know, just sort of give a good overview. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's why his notes are online, so it doesn't (laughs) I don't know, I guess—I feel kind of—I feel kind of guilty, but then I realize that I'd rather get my life in order, like order more contacts and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —(laughs) and get some sleep, and clean up a little bit, because, I don't know. I guess it's making sort of choices and I'm sort of starting to see like—you know, I'm starting to talk more with my friends and Jeremy about politics and it's actually interesting, because I'm sort of starting to see that maybe now I'm not sort of siding with what my parents say. [00:13:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'm trying to think about it. And you know, it actually—it feels kind of nice to just sort of think about what is important to me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like what—and—and you know, even though it sounds like, you know, stupid that I skipped lecture, I made the conscious sort of decision -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —based upon I was very exhausted, I'm kind of recovering over a cold, and I needed to get my life back together. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would not gain so much by going in at 12:00. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because I'm going to be—I'm working late tonight. I have—I volunteered for a physics—it's, they do free textbooks for education.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like free physics textbooks, so they're like having all volunteers come that are in the physics community—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like from school, to help arrange like—create a book. And so I thought that would be really good to meet -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like possibly other teachers in the area and talk—and you know, so I thought, you know, so I thought—that I thought I only have so much juice for the night in terms of like what I can actually accomplish. And you know, if I go in early, I'm just going to be exhausted by the time I get to this -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:14:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —networking thing. But I realized, you know, that because I was kind of slower getting—starting on my homework—I was like, I'm not going to go to the fabric store. I really—I just need one sort of thing, and that's the one thing. When I get going on something, I don't want to stop it. And I'm like, "Well, I should really be doing my homework rather than having to do it during the weekend"—I mean, where I'm actually going for this, the physics textbook thing, it's actually near Downtown, where there is a fabric store. But I just sort of realized that, you know, that shouldn't be my primary focus -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:15:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —today, because I can just get it online, and sew the table runner before Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't—you know, it doesn't need -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're sort of figuring how out to prioritize and filter? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do I really want to pay attention to? What is it I really want to devote time to? Is class more important today? Is doing these errands more important? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that's actually—I mean, that's something like I'm sort of starting to realize like—and all this week, I didn't go to ballet because I—you know, I realized it well—at first, there was the presentation. And then when Jeremy got back and after the presentation, like, you know, I want to spend time with Jeremy since he was gone and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I've just been so focused on my presentation and I want to spend time with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was just really nice because we were just laughing and like then I started sewing while he was watching "The Daily Show" and you know, it was just really nice to spend time. And it's just—I guess I'm starting to see that, you know, I can have it all, but maybe I'm just going to have prioritize based upon how I'm feeling. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it doesn't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't have it all all of the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). And I was just getting—because I was—yeah, I was talking to my mom last night because she—she actually—she's—I think she's—I mean, of course she's very upset that my sister is not talking to her, and so you know, we sort of thought that Thursday is our date night with -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —when I had talked to my mom and that normally is after Jeremy goes to bed. And so I wound up talking to her until like 1:30 just because my sister also really wanted to talk to me. And I was really wanting to talk to my family because like and—you know, I did something good -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I was feeling hopeful about the future. I was talking to my mom and she's like, "No wonder you're tired, you're trying to do all these things. You have all these sewing projects." She's like—and I just realized—it was like, "Yeah, I do actually have a lot going on." And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, you do. [00:17:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and it's—you know, it's good that Jeremy actually helps me manage because she was—it was really like the first time—because we were talking about, you know, how she—she's—like my mom was like, "Well, you know, you're sounding a lot like me." You know, just being really busy and on your feet, and getting so much done and accomplished. And I was like, "Well, I guess I am." I mean, it doesn't seem like it because it's never like a focus sort of thing. I mean, like—I mean, because there's other priorities that come up. Like if I had nothing to do, I'd just be like sewing all day -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and maybe cooking and baking. But now that I sort of see that, "Ok, well I have—I have work, I mean I can't just be a stay—stay at home blob right now (laughs)." And so there's—you know, I—I sort of realized—I'm starting to realize how to sort of manage these things and not feel burned out. [00:18:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And sort of know like—and also actually with my eating, too, I've been figuring that out, too, because for a long time I've been working on this. Like I just sort of gorge when I see a dessert or like—you know, and then like I feel—I just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What counts as a gorge for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Eating until my stomach hurts and I feel like I'm going to throw up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do that at parties because it was there -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I don't know. Because it used to be I didn't go to parties very often, so if there was a party then, you know, "Whohoo, something to celebrate." But if you're going out like once a weekend, and, you know, going out to like restaurants a lot -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like you can't do that because they give you obviously more food than what you can eat, because that's what people like. And I am starting—or like, for instance, when we have Women of Physics events and it's catered by Flower Bakery, like there's cookies and yeah, I take a little sliver of cake. And maybe just not have dessert later that night. [00:19:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's what I did last night. You know, because I ate at least of spoonful of straight frosting on—on top of a little sliver of cake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "You know, I'm full. I don't really need a dessert. Maybe I'll have a little bite of your ice cream, Jeremy, but I don't need a dessert right now. I'm not feeling"—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, and it was kind of interesting, because I was like, you know, I guess I'm starting to learn like when I'm like hungry, when I'm not. And before it was just sort of like I just ate all the time because I didn't know there was like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, I don't know. I guess and also—like, you know, Jeremy was making lunches that were too big and it always made me really hungry and like so now I'm just sort of eating smaller lunches and maybe -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, I don't ever feel like oddly full but hungry very soon. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I guess he has like he would pack—he would do these like really big salads, and like my stomach would feel big -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —not like physically big, but it was just feel like there's lots of stuff and fiber and I guess I don't like that feeling in the middle of the day. I like that at the end of the night. [00:20:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess it's sort of a preference. He likes bigger lunches, I like bigger dinners. And so I guess switching back to more what I prefer, I'm starting to get back into the feel of what -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, what is the right amount, based upon how hungry I'm feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it—it's just interesting, because I—for the first—I don't know how this is happening, why I'm starting to make like decisions. Like I don't know why—you know, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're listening to yourself more than you're listening to other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like with—with Jeremy noticing that, you know, that might be your preference but it's not necessarily more right than my preference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or figuring out your own priorities of what am I going to devote time to right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you're listening to yourself. [00:21:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not to other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and if I—I—it seems like I'm a lot more productive like when I like actually want to do something. I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel motivated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if it makes sense to you, you want to do it more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I mean, there's sometimes, like instead of going to review sessions, because I mean, maybe it's—yeah, maybe it's going to sort of help out on the homework -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but then I'm going to have to stay a long time, then I'm going to have to, you know, just sit there waiting to ask my specific question and then I sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, it sort of makes me anxious sort of just sitting and waiting. And then like sort of—yeah, I'd rather just sort of duke through it myself -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I think I learn more that way. I mean, maybe I don't. Maybe I just see the trees. But anyway, I'm able to answer the homework, and you know, working with other people is sort of—it's kind of a chaotic experience because like—you know, if everyone's tossing around ideas, and—you know, it's harder for me to think -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —when the other people are there. I guess I think slower or maybe I—but anyway, but yeah—I mean, and then I found like I'm just a lot happier if I'm, you know, at home doing the homework like looking at my laptop. [00:22:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or like if I'm in my office and—it's just—it's—it's just really interesting. Just—yeah, I guess, I mean—and Jeremy is actually being understanding, too, because like, you know, the fact that he doesn't mind that I work at home. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would he mind? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you know, maybe he thinks that I'm being a lazy bum or (laughs) not getting out of my jammies -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but, you know, he—he's actually done it once himself, like worked at home and then went later to work. And he's like, "Hey, I actually—I like this." He's like, "It really breaks up the day. I can have lunch where there's kitchen" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"and then go, you know, go do"—you know, because he was working from home on his laptop, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but—but anyway, I mean—I don't know. I think Jeremy's just very routine oriented and sort of like trying to need to fit in—it's really good that I'm surrounded by routine. And my mom even said that Jeremy was a really good, stable influence on me. [00:23:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is true, he really was. Without him—I mean, that's one thing I realized was that when the hurricane was coming and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —Jeremy was gone, like I was just sleeping odd hours -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and God knows what, not showering, probably eating too much candy (laughs). But you know, I—in a sense it was sort of a good sort of like—I guess I got it out of my system, two days of living like a college student and I realized that, "Ok, maybe I'll live like a more responsible-to-my -health college student."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—but yeah, so I—I'm really happy that that's happening and like my mom—it—I was actually—I was really happy that she realized how good Jeremy is for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like she's like, "You know, that boy holds it—holds everything to his word." She's like, "You know, I don't know if I"—she's like, "I don't agree with everything that guy says" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"but, you know I know that at least he's going to fulfill what he says."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then she's like—respectable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's nice for her to be on that side, be able to see some good in him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, yeah, it was actually really nice. And so I told Jeremy and Jeremy was like, "Oh, well, why is she saying this now?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so—and Jeremy was like really kind of confused and he was getting kind of irritable, and I was like, "Oh, you know, my mom is saying how good you are for me." And I was like well—I told him that—I was like mostly I try and keep my life pretty private because you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:25:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —when you tell people stuff, they can either—if—they'll give you advice and you can either take it or leave it, but family is a little bit more pushy on giving their advice -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, and want you to take it, not leave it. Or at least I feel that they're pushy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, my family is pushy and I have a hard time saying no. I think that would be the more correct statement. But—what it is—but—but yeah, so—but I mean, he understood that you know, I—I said that—you know, I was just telling my mom how much, you know—how I'm able to accomplish so much and how Jeremy is such a really good influence on me. And she was just so—you know, so surprised about like what I do -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and like what I do do in life, and I guess it—yeah, it made her really happy. And one thing that made me—I don't know, it kind of—I don't know why it made me mad, but like when Jeremy got back from his conference and he was talking to a lot of the guys in the insurance industries, they're—they're not very—well, I guess they're not very—they're kind of your old sort of skeazy business dudes, you're stereotypical -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:26:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —they sort of fulfill that and like this one guy—and you know, Jeremy said he seemed like a really nice guy at first, but then he was saying how he—how he like—he was—Jeremy was saying, "Oh, you know, I have a girlfriend and you know, we're soon to be engaged or we're thinking about getting engaged, you know, within a few years or a year or so." And he was like—you know, Jeremy was just trying to make conversation and say, "Oh, do you have any advice?" And he was like, "Yeah, don't do it." He's like, "I married—before I met my wife, I was churn and burn in college."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is really graphic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he saying that you know, "I just—she gave me an ultimatum and you know, it's just kids this and you know, life is so miserable." And there was another lady who works in the insurance industry who's Jewish, very like kosher Jewish -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —which means she's probably pretty orthodox, and she was saying—like Jeremy described—told her that I was a Christian and then she—she was like, "Oh, well, there's a problem, you should have seen that problem from the very beginning." And it's like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a problem for you and Jeremy that you're different religions? [00:27:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I celebrate Jewish holidays and I want to bring that to my kids because it's part of his heritage and I love the food.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I love any party. I love any reason to make a cake and justify it. And I -you know, he said he was also raised Christian. He was—his mom put him in like camps like Jews for Jesus, so (laughs) -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) </p>

<p>CLIENT: —and Jeremy says his mom was hedging bets. But you know, he said that if he could raise his children up any religion, it probably would be the Christian one. But you know, just keep the Jewish holidays. And I think the Jewish holidays -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds like you guys have discussed -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —discussed it and found something that would work for you. [00:28:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But you know, I guess I was sort of feeling sort of insecure about whether we were actually going to get married and whether it was just going to continue on, and like whether graduate school—it was like I'm tired of things of getting held off for graduate school -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think your insecurity was based off of or based on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I had talked to my sister earlier that day and she was like well—she was like—because I was talking about, you know, sometimes you just need to do what you need to do. And, you know, mom's not—wasn't happy with my decision, but it was the best thing. And she's like, "Well, I personally don't agree with it, but you know"—and then she was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, she was being sort of fair about it. She was like, "Well, if you and Jeremy do eventually do get married"—and I was like, "What do you mean?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Do eventually like" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you heard doubt in her voice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it gave you doubt about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like—no, no, no. I was like—I mean, I was just sort of well—well there is—you know there is nothing set in stone, I mean, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is kind of scary in that sense. [00:29:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's based on trust. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, you have trust what he's saying and what you're saying, because there is no—you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if there were a ring and a date, there's no guarantee.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). I mean, he could get -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's trust.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And he could get even in a car accident and—I think about that. That would be horrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, I guess there is a sort of trust and that's sort of like—that's interesting because he said that—you know, he had told my mom like, "Oh, I could—I don't see the point in getting a promise ring, because that's sort of a material thing that sort of takes away from my word." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Because he gave a promise and I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He really wants you to trust his word.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And have that really mean something to the two of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I guess—I mean, that's one thing that my mom and I were laughing about because I—I said—because I was upset. I really wanted cats and I was tired of just like waiting until I finished my Ph. D. because I was really wondering or upset because I didn't think about—that's going to happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:30:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't going to happen—apparently—I mean, my advisor thinks I'm going to graduate in a year, so I have more hope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just sort of a refound enthusiasm, but it—yeah, I was just like tired, like why do we have to put on a—put off engagement, put off cats, and put off everything and like put off getting decent sleep. And Jeremy was just like, "You know"—he's like, "I believe in you. You've just got to keep on working."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's like (laughs)—he's like, "You've just got to keep on keeping on." (laughs) Which is kind of a joke because I think it's a cute thing and I don't—I think it's that's a cute sort of thing -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to say and I think at the time when Obama had said it—it's a Bob Dylan line, but Jeremy keeps on like—I mean, I like the line. I thought it was kind of cute. And I was like I—if I told my parents—if I ever said that I think I'd be like not allowed in the house for a day or something, or like (coughs) set to watch Fox News all day or all night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Until I was—but I think it's a cute saying. "Keep on keeping on." And you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and you know, that's sort of like when I was like, "Ok." But I guess—he was like, you know—like my dad always says, you have to finish one stage of life before you get to the next. And you know Jeremy is right about that, because I realized, "Oh, well, if I'm going to graduate, you know I—I don't have time to focus on cats." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, they do occupy your space and mind. [00:32:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if they're destroying your furniture and being cute and adorable. And I sort of realized that is something that, yeah, I just have to wait for. It's something that is out there, but, you know, just because it's there doesn't mean I need to buy it or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know—and I guess that sort of—I guess I'm starting to learn slowly what control is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's hard. It's really hard for me. And the other day I went into this CVS, I was really tired. I don't know, I wanted to buy something. I just waste—I—I'm frivolous purchaser. I was like, "Oh, is there some nail polish?" And I was like, "No, I'm just going to grab a water and go home." And I was like, "Wait, I do need something." And then I grabbed—oh, it was like razor blades. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't bought those in a year (laughs). And it was like I really do need those. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was the desire to—to buy something? What—what is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) I don't know. It's kind of like a—I mean, it's just this sort of like I've had a long day and—there's just sort of—kind of like a happy moment when I buy something. [00:33:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So it would feel like some sort of reward or at least -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, a reward. And I think after -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I think I realized that, you know, there are rewards -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but you just can't keep on buying them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there's other rewards in life, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It sounds like you really want to somehow celebrate or reward or somehow mark the end of the day, having worked hard, and you wanted a different feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And while financially you can't always afford for that to come from purchasing something, that doesn't mean that you can't have something to look forward to, to mark working hard. You did work hard. [00:34:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can mark that and acknowledge that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need to find a way that fits into your budget.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). And that's why this month I'm really like trying to, you know, sort of figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sort of like tell myself no, like, you know, "If I'm going to get this, then I can't get that."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What can you do instead so that it's not just depriving yourself of that good feeling that comes from purchasing something? What can you do to have that feeling that's not connected to money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably like some activity. Like bake something or sew, like that's what I did last night is I sewed -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that felt good?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it felt really good -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because I was just like I got all excited and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it brought you that different feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like that good, gay feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I—especially because I got this fabric for—like I bought some fabric from eBay to make pillows, and she gave me a sample fabric—a sample to go along with it. And it's this beautiful fabric and I realized that it—I was like rather than buying a table cloth or table runner, why don't you just use this sample fabric, because it's free. [00:35:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like Jeremy like, he was like, "Ok." But then like—you know, I got really excited about it and I was cutting it and I was like, "We're saving so much money."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "We're saving $70." And it's very perfect for fall and I think being resourceful actually makes me happy in the long run.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have that tinge of feeling guilty. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's not the good feeling marked by something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you actually—you had the giddiness and the excitement of starting a project.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt good that you were being resourceful. It sounds like that's a win-win.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. I think I just need to go back on that and I—you know, and it's hard—and I talk to my sister and she's like always buying these little things and, you know—but I sort of realized that—you know, Jeremy—like sometimes—like I can do a frowny face and he'll buy cookies at Trader Joe's, but I think he's a good one, like if I—he knows how to control his impulse purchases.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I need to sort of look for something to replace that excitement. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I do get excited and I was like—the first of the month I was so excited because I got to—I mean, I was—you know, because every first of the month I get like an allowance to spend. [00:36:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Yeah, I can buy nail polish." And you know, but then I sort of—that's when I bought the nail polish and then like, "Oh, I guess I have to wait on them, and that's it for the month." And I was like, "Oooh." I guess I sort of realized—I mean, it was crazy how excited I got at the first of the month because these were nail polishes that the pigment is no longer available, or at least affordable. So these are like exclusive Indie nail polish (laughs). So I guess—yeah, I guess I sort of realized I have to start finishing my projects -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and using my purchases.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's where sort of the prolonged joy comes from -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —is not just buying things but you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it might—it might be a little bit more delayed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:26]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like, you know, part of what you're searching for is that immediate response.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's hard—it's hard to find something that's as immediate. But maybe getting used to having a longer lasting but more delayed response—you might start to be able to appreciate that, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It takes some getting used to being able to tolerate the—the time between the urge to satisfy the impulse and getting the response. And that -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —takes time to practice tolerating that waiting period. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you had a taste of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's something to build on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't we wrap up there for today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I'll see you in two weeks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that's so long. I was actually really happy that I had therapy today because I—I—I don't know. It felt like a nice sort of—a nice way to end the week. I really enjoy it. [00:38:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad it's good timing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is. It's—it's been really good for me and that's one thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My mom, she was like, "Well, if I was—if I could be there, I would thank your therapist for helping you," and I was like, "Well, I will thank her for you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're very welcome. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad we're able to work together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

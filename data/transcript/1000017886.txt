<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know (inaudible) fight with my girlfriend (inaudible) I may get to the relationship. It's really funny because I didn't think there was going to be any. What did I say? I said I was going to move out. And I said, "I think I'm going to look for an apartment in May," because it's easier to find apartments than trying to get one in the summer. So she said, "What? And leave me with the rent?" And I'm like, "Oh, well that's okay, I'm sorry, I didn't think of it." That's what I said to her, "I didn't think of it." And I guess it's the wrong thing to say to her (inaudible) type thing. "You thought of yourself first and you're terrible and you're selfish and you're this and you're that." And I said, "Okay, it was kind of bad," because I have had a tendency to panic when I feel like if I don't know where I'm going, Jesus, what's going to happen? She says, "You can stay with my mother." Well you know her mother's got like a one-and-a-half room apartment and I've got to move all my junk in there and stay with her for a month? And I said, "No, I wouldn't do that." But it's just the idea, like the first thing I thought of is, "Wow, what's going to happen if I don't have any place to go? So I'd better start looking even I have to pay a double rent for a couple of months."</p>

<p>So we had this great big fight. Mostly it was her. I just sat there and listened because I didn't know what to say or what to do, I said, "Oh boy, you really hurt her this time. What are you saying?" So I don't know. Anyway, the next morning, we started talking about it and then everything was okay again. And I said, "Well don't worry, I won't move out and I'll help you ..." in fact I called her ... this happened Thursday night, because I called her Friday right after the gym. And I waited until she got home from running and then I called her and talked to her on the phone. </p>

<p>But I still find myself, when I have to say something like that, I get real harsh (ph). She said I sounded like a (inaudible) from when I called her ... (gruffly) "Hello, Jodie ..." (chuckling) She said, "I was expecting you to say 'achtung' in the next sentence!" But I said, "Well, I guess that the way I get when I'm trying to ... I try to ... let's see, how can I explain it ... I don't know what it is, but I end up sounding very hard and I never realized I did that. But either that or I sound like my voice goes up (inaudible) because I get scared. I really get really scared when I'm going into that. I don't know why. And maybe it's because I used to ... didn't say anything, I just let it go. But what happened is I would hurt inside and things like this when we have ... because I was hurt during that too, when she was ... [0:02:22.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before you said you were scared of hurting her feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That was part of it. But it was ... I think that's part of it and part of it is just plain scared. And I would just ... like there's many times when she hurts me and I won't say anything. And I just, you know, I just keep it inside. Usually that's what I would do, and that's why ... that's part of the reason I got like I was when I was younger, was that (inaudible) shell because then nobody would hurt me, see, if I went deeper into the shell, nobody could even hurt me in the first place. Because the hurt was what put me in it! And it's like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but I don't understand that. If you're the one who's sort of pushing her away or maybe potentially hurting her, then why does that make you get all hard and ... ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, partly maybe it's because I felt like this was part of it that came into it after I ... I felt ... first thing I thought was, "You're the worst person in the world, you're this and you're that and the other thing," you know, to myself. And then I thought to myself, "Well look, she's not worrying about you. All she's worrying about is her convenience." Even if I moved out in May ... say I moved out in May and she had to pay the full rent for two months, it's not going to hurt any. This girl makes money like it's going out of style. And yet, she would put me in a position where in July, she would leave, not worrying if I didn't have a place to go, "Well, you could stay with my mother." Well she knows damn well I'm not going to stay with her mother. But it's like, she couldn't care less if I had to stay, and then maybe I'd have to pay a double rent for a month anyway in order to move in. You really can't move in, in like one month and one day or two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was like she wasn't caring about you, so why should you treat her decently?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well this was part of it. It was part of like ... you know, I thought it was fair to do what I was doing. But the idea was ... what I didn't like is the first thing she thinks of ... then afterwards, she says, "Well I don't care about the rent. The rent? I don't care about it. It's the thought." But the first thing she jumps at me in is, "What about the rent?" So in other words, the rent WAS important, because it would, it might give a little dent in her budget or whatever. [0:04:11.7]</p>

<p>So the first thing I said was "Okay, sure, fine, all right, I'll pay the rent for two months even if I'm not here. I'll pay it. Don't worry about it. I'll pay my half. Don't worry about it." And I mean I didn't think that was so unfair. It's just the idea that she couldn't care less if I couldn't get an apartment in July. And yet she's ... most of it too is I think she was afraid I wouldn't come back even if I left to help her move because she figured I would. And I get to that point where that's how I feel - kind of paranoid - even of a good friend, because I know she's like that. You know, she thinks about her and everybody else is supposed to think about her first. And she says, "Well all the stuff I've done for you ..." and I keep thinking to myself, "You have done stuff for me, yes, but almost every time you've done something for me, it's partially your gain, and it's not going to hurt you." Things like that, that's going to hurt me. I'm moving into one apartment, I've got to help her move out of her apartment, I've got to do this and that and the other. It's going to hurt me, but I'll do it for a friend. But what I don't like is her attitude coming back, like "Well this and that, now this is better for me and this is it for me and this is that for me." And I'm supposed to be giving.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she mainly cares about herself instead of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And this is what I'm saying. I don't mind giving to somebody, but I don't like the idea of me giving ... see, it's like, I don't have as much to give, but I give what I can of what I have. And it might hurt me or she might call it being ignorant, like she said to one of her friends that he was ignorant because he self-sacrificing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, well you just didn't like the way you were treated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't like that idea of it. And so I just went along and said, "Fine." Everything was fine, and then we started going back and forth again. I let it go. And I was the one that came back and said I was sorry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually at that time, she didn't have anything to say she was sorry about. I don't think she had anything. It was just the idea that ... I would think that maybe afterwards, she would say, "Yeah, well I see your point and that's going to be hard, but I wish you would have explained more fully." [0:06:04.6]</p>

<p>See, she blew up before I had a chance to say ... I said I'd pay the rent, but she blew up before I had a chance to say, "Look, I'm not going to be moving out exactly at May 1st. It's going to take a good month. I'll help you pack your things and that." She didn't give me a chance. All she did was just go WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! And so I just sat there and I get like this. And so I figure, "The hell with you." That's more or less what I do. And I say, "Okay, you can scream you can holler ..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the part of it ... you didn't like it sort of that you turned off that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I didn't like the idea of myself turning off that way. I think ... see part of it is, I don't know what it is about myself, but lots of times, I won't speak up. People can hurt me, and I won't speak up. People can (inaudible) and get mad or whatever, and I still can't try to explain my part. I just sit there and say, "Oh s***," you know. This is another thing I did and that I didn't realize, because I HAVE been giving. It's been coming, seeing other people's needs. But just for this one moment, I panicked. I really did. Like my girlfriend called and said, "Look, there's a couple of apartments here May 1st. You're going to be damn lucky to get something during the summer."</p>

<p>And so ... but the thing is, I would still have to pay double rent. She's saying it would be better money. Well I would probably have to for a while get into a higher priced apartment or live at the Y or some goofy place like that and half get killed on the way home. And then eventually when I did get an apartment, I would still have to pay double rent for one month to move in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there were two parts to that (inaudible) one was that you were really angry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was angry. I really was, because like it was saying, "Okay, I'm sorry, I should have thought about you. I don't mind paying the double rent." I don't really mind it. It doesn't bother me. I'm taking a loan out to cover it, so I'm not worried about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was sort of like, "Well forget you. If you're going to treat me that way, then I'm not going to have anything to do with you."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's the way I felt. I really got to the point, I said, "Okay, I'm going to do all this stuff for her, but when she leaves this country, baby, that is it. You're not coming back to a friend, because that's enough. I've given enough and I can feel like ..." And this is another thing that bugs me. She says ... I [talk to my other] (ph) girlfriend (inaudible) it's the first thing she came back with was, "It sounds that way, doesn't it?" Because I said ... she said ... what did she say ... oh, she said ... then we're doing the fight, she said, "All the stuff I've done for you and then you do this to me!" And she says, "I don't mean to be throwing it up in your face ..." but every time we have a fight or every time she thinks I'm inconsiderate, or maybe I am, sometimes I am, sometimes I don't think I am. But I let her throw her tantrum and then afterwards, we get back together again and I usually say I'm sorry and then everything starts going again. [0:08:31.8]</p>

<p>But it's like ... she DOES throw it up in my face. "I've done all this for you and look what you did to me." And then she tells me ... just on the other hand, she says, "Well giving is you're not supposed to expect things in return." Well I don't expect things in return when I give to somebody. I don't expect now just because I gave to you now next week or next month or whatever it is, you've got to give exactly the ... or whatever. I don't believe that. So it's like saying I could never teach her. I could never do whatever, like she did for me. I can't say I did. And yet I'm saying that most of the time, she didn't give me special ... something ... that she didn't give to other people. Like she'd let me sit in her classes to learn whatever and I was supposed to become a teacher and I did student-teach which helped her. And when she was sick, I would come in and things like this, at a lesser pay. So she'd still make money even when she wasn't there because I was working for her. But it's like ... you know, like I would say that basically she did give me a lot there. I'm saying she did give, but at no real hurt to herself. She had ... no, said, well she could have gotten fired and all this stuff, but I don't agree with that because they needed her at that school. And she went out and played baseball with her kids one day and they knew something was up, but they couldn't really catch her. And if she's not going to get fired for something like that, she's not going to get fired for having somebody sitting-in in her class. And she had, I think, two other girls from her other classes, her business classes sitting in on these charm classes too, so I mean she'd get in trouble for those kids being there and they didn't pay. So I'm just saying like, fine. You did a lot for me, and I'm very happy you did, but again, you didn't really sacrifice yourself. [0:10:07.9]</p>

<p>And she says, "And then you came and lived here." Well I pay two-thirds of the rent, and that pays for, like, use of her furniture and that. And yet she's actually making some money on it too, because she only pays $50 a month rent that way. And so I said to her, "Okay, you've done a lot for me. I'm saying that. But I'm saying that most of the time, it's for your own good anyway."</p>

<p>So I said to myself, "Okay. I'll do this for you, and then that's it." But then we started getting back together again Saturday and she said, "It's nice," and we started crying on each other's shoulders. It was real cute and everything and all this baloney, but like I feel ... I have a feeling for her as a sister or something, but I still feel like I don't mind giving. I really don't. In fact,  like it if somebody ... I don't expect somebody to get down and bow to me and do everything back to me, but all I ask is like a little consideration in return. And things like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you're not getting that from her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's things like when she's in a bad mood, I try to work around her. Things like this. When I'm in a bad mood, she's, "What are you so damn crabby about?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always the one that has to give somehow, you always have to give in or give up or give.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way I feel. Yeah, because she's a very dominant person. The problem is there, I'm reading this book this one fellow gave me ... it's so funny, this is a sociologist ... husband gave to me ... "You've got to read this! It's called Psychic Self-Defense." It's funny as heck because in it, it says that there's one that's like a parasite to the other. The dominant one is a parasite. I'm going, "Oh come on, it's not that bad!" It's like, you know, when you're sleeping, they take the life out of you and everything. It's the weirdest book. I said, "Oh come on. All right." I got what they were trying to say though, they were not trying to say that this was real, but they were trying to say, "Now look, she's very dominant and you're weaker." I'm dominant in my own way. I'm not really ... I feel like I can stand on my own two feet in certain ways. So I'm not really what you'd call a real weakling or a real dependent person. And I think this is one of the reasons we can't get along, because usually there has to be a dependent person in any kind of relationship and a real dominant person. That's the only thing this book made me think of. And it's like, this is one of the reasons I don't get along that well because I am dominant in my own area, and like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She can't handle that. [0:12:25.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And this is the thing. And so like we're going back and forth, but she's more dominant than I am, and the respect and everything I have for her, I'm always giving it. I always say, "Okay. I'm wrong." I'll just sit there and I'll say, "Okay."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But more than that, it sounds like when you get into one of those fights, like neither one of you is really talking about what you're feeling. I mean, she's probably feeling ... I don't know what she's feeling, but I would guess that somebody in that situation would be hurt or something about separating from you, from someone that they've known for a long time and you were saying you felt that because she hurt your feelings all the time and that wasn't kind of getting said. So that it would sort of escalate into this argument over who gives whom more and that sort of doesn't move anywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right, because it's not really saying ... this is what I say ... this is one thing I admire about her, though, is if she's hurt, she throws a tantrum like a little kid which almost shakes me up because I can't stand when people get like that, just all hysterical and they're screaming and yelling at you, and things like ... like she'd say things like ... this ... see, I'm the type of person ... this is one of the reasons I hold my tongue, because I know when something is said, if you're a sensitive person, you can't take it back. And so this is one of the reasons I take and I try to weigh my words. This is why sometimes I sound like a Gestapo agent because I weigh every single word exactly what I'm going to say so it's taken the right way. </p>

<p>So this is why it took me a whole day to figure out exactly what I was going to say, to make sure that I would hit the right feelings and she would understand what I was trying to say and everything so that she wouldn't feel hurt and all this. You know, she comes out and says, "That's it! The friendship is over! Maybe the next time you have a friend you'll be ..." I'm going, "Come on!" [0:14:11.2]</p>

<p>She did this to me once before. She said something about ... on my birthday. And she says, "I can't take this anymore, and next week, you look for another apartment." And here I'm going, "Aaaa!" It's like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like that, like it's really scary if you ... it kind of leaves you defenseless, you know, like she's just saying, "Forget it." And then what can you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well this is partly because it happened to me before. You know, you say, "I'm sorry." "Well that's not good enough." But you know, what can you do? Again, it's like saying something, what can you do after you've done something? There is no way you're going to be able to undo what you've done. The only thing you can do is try not to do it anymore. It's like ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I heard you saying that too, that one thing that made you so hard or tight was that you didn't think you'd be able to make her understand or that you would do something irreversible. And it almost sounds like the same thing with your gym teacher. Like it's so hard for you to think that somebody will really understand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe it's because like when I was in foster homes, I couldn't talk. I couldn't explain things, and this is one of the reasons ... But see, she's wrong. She says to me, "Well no wonder everybody ... you say that people give you love and then they take it back." Because this is the way I felt when I was a child. And so then right away, I said, "Well everything was my fault." But it's NOT true that everybody took it back. Even with my brother, I think he still loves me. But this is one thing we talked about too Saturday night, and I've got to get back with my brother. I don't know if I'm strong enough right now to do it. But when I am, I've got to make the first move with my brother. She brought that up. She says, "Do you ever think of how HE feels?" And this is why ... one of the things I'm TRYING to feel now is how SHE felt. And I can understand it, but the idea is, okay, all right, so I had my reaction, so you had your reaction. But the thing is I came back to YOU and I said things, but you never said then, "Well, okay, maybe I'll go with you to look for an apartment, or would you like me to take a look at your apartment after you've decided?" Nothing! Nothing of interest to what I'M doing. [0:16:08.5] </p>

<p>Like the other girlfriend said, "Oh I'd love to come down and see your class," no the other one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you didn't feel like she was extending herself to get with your feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or to even be interested in me. It's like when she comes home, and she'll talk about someplace she's been or something even happened in school, she'll complain or whatever, I'll sit there and listen. I'll say, "Oh that's awful," you know, like ... I try to get myself into it, like I couldn't care less what so-and-so, some idiotic, neurotic ... REALLY neurotic ... worse than I ... you know like some idiot that ... you know, a drunk or something does at the school ... once I found the basic idea of the woman and knew how she was, none of the things this girl told me really shocked me about this woman. And I said, "Well the only thing I can do is feel sorry for the woman." Like she can work around her. And I know it makes hell for her sometimes and so it's like this, I sympathize with her feeling, her reaction. But like, otherwise, so what? So, but I'll listen to that. But it's an idea like ... I mention running and if we do, it's almost like she'll say ... like I'll say, "Well this is what I like about running." "Well you've got the same thing in the gym. Nah ..." you know, and that's it. CHOOM! And it's like I'll say, "Okay." "Oh we're learning good health in gym. I know what it is. You don't have to tell me." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, how can I share anything that's important to me? Because to her, it's not important. Or if I had something like ... when I made that correlation between the dog and myself, she said, "Well, yeah, that's a single ... I guess that's a little beginning, but wait ... you should see what I went through ..." And it's like, it's almost like saying ... she says I shouldn't feel second-rate and I say I shouldn't feel second-rate, but yeah, it's always like saying, "I do one better." </p>

<p>We went out with these idiots from Connecticut and they were idiots. The one fellow was sort of with me, and one fellow was sort of with her. And then it was like ... you know, he was really paying attention to me and the other one was paying attention to her a lot. And this made me feel good because it's like saying, "Look, you are attractive in your own way." And even when she's right ... not the idea ... I couldn't care less about either one of them and it wasn't the idea that I was trying to catch either one of them. I was just myself and it was, "Oh, the hell with you," but then I felt ... made me feel good at the end of the night that when I AM myself, I am naturally attractive to men too. So I figured, okay, so what? [0:18:18.6]</p>

<p>So the next day we ... we even took off work, it was the funniest thing, we took off work and she doesn't get paid and I might not get paid, and we were going to take this plane ride to Iowa. She did have like a premonition that there was something wrong. I thought maybe they were just tired. I could see it a little bit, but partly it's because I knew she had already made up her mind. She's checking out her (inaudible) how she's going. I know she is. And I said to myself, "I know I'm going too, because I want to. I want to go up to the plane and I want to go see this aeronautical museum. I don't really care about the fellows one way or the other, as long as they're not too rotten to us, I don't care." It's just the way I felt. </p>

<p>So we went through the whole day and we both kicked ourselves for going out, but at the end of they day, she's saying things like, "Oh, and you should have seen how the one that you were with, when I got off with my mini ..." I had a longer dress on because I don't look good in the mini. It's not my personality. I look vulgar and I realize it when I wear a real short mini. I do. So I said, "The hell with it. It's not my personality, I'm not going to try and be somebody else." So she says, "Oh, you should have seen the way he was looking at my legs." And it's like, I couldn't care less, but why ... the one that you're with supposedly or the one she was sitting next to, the one she was talking to most and the one that her girlfriend had actually fixed up with her in Connecticut ... why don't you say anything about HIM and your reactions at all or what he did to you or what he said? But it's the one that pays the most attention to ME, is the one that you have to bring out what he's doing towards her. Like saying, "Look, I don't care about either one of them either, but they both liked me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I said, well I couldn't care less, it's just the idea of the thing. Yeah, it's the same way when we got in the car he took a hold of my knee and he said he liked knees and I said, 'Yeah, they're great, they're just like ball bearings, they move and everything' and I turned him off. He was all ready to hit me, I knew it, but why? Why should I bother with him? I knew what they wanted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but like what she was doing was really putting you down and again throwing something up at you. [0:20:08.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like, "Ha ha, the fellow that you were with, he was looking at me. He really didn't want to be with you, but it just seemed like it was an extra girl there so he had to be with the girl ... the extra, whatever." And it really bugged me. It really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it's like maybe you feel like you weren't even there. All that counted was her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I don't know if she ... I don't know, maybe I should just bring it up to her because the other one had said the same thing. This other girlfriend. She'd say things like, "Well, she's done so much for me. I know she's very selfish, but she's done so much for me." And it's like she feels indebted. And yet they go through the same thing because I can see it. </p>

<p>Oh Jesus, I can see it now. They'll be sitting there and they'll ... like I'll be standing there and I won't get into a conversation purposely. I will later on maybe get into something with them, but I saw there's a man standing here, they're waiting for an elevator. And the two of them meet and they go, "Oh hi, how are you!" First of all they, you know, that's it, the two of them go, "Hi, how are you?" and I said, "Well that's all right. So what? They don't see each other very much." I'm not that close with the other girl anyway, so I said, "Eh, let them have their fun." But I noticed them both looking out of the corner of their eyes at this guy. And they're trying to be cute and "La la la," this type of thing. And I'm saying to myself, "That's not the way they are usually. Usually we can get into a conversation and if there's something funny or something, then you turn on and you get all excited or whatever. But you don't just see each other and go, "Ha ha," and all this stuff and you start getting ... and then you look out of the corner of your eye to see if the fellow is watching. </p>

<p>And that's what they were doing. And I said to myself, "S***, this is what I do." Or at least I did and I'm trying to get out of it. Now I'm getting to the point where I almost don't care. If they react, fine, if they don't react, the hell with them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're not going to go overboard making a fool of yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, more or less. Or at least ... not even making a fool of yourself, but getting like overdramatic, not really ... not to the point ... like I went to the point at one time where I made a fool of myself. And I know it. I'm getting over it. I'm not saying I'm over it. I still do it sometimes when I feel insecure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you want it to be real. I mean, you don't want it to be this faking kind of stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the real interaction. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. And that's what I'm trying to get away from, and then when I saw that, I said, "Oh my God!" [0:22:10.0]</p>

<p>And I think ... that's one thing about this book that I did agree with. The only way that you're really going to get someplace is to get separated. And I think one of the best things that's going to be for me is when she leaves, because partly I'm dependent on her and I know it. I'm standing on my own two feet that way because I don't HAVE anybody to depend on. And partly it's going to be the idea that I don't have to put myself in competition every time I turn around because I say to myself ... it's partly me, and I know it, because when I'm with somebody who's above me, that I really FEEL is above me, I put myself in competition. But it's partly the idea that it's THERE. The competitive nature is there for both of us, and it's not good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's partly you because I think because you've got yourself into the relationship in the first place, but it's not like ... that means that it is part you, but still, that's the way she is really. I mean, that's true. The competitive stuff is there ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she admits it too, she's very competitive. And I am too. This is what I said, we're both competitive, and we're both semi-dominant. She's probably a little more dominant than I am partly because I don't have as much confidence as she has yet. And like, we would make great friends if we saw each other maybe every couple of months and we just ... just the girls saw each other. But as soon as fellows come into play ... she says she doesn't like me when fellows are around. I hate to tell her, but I don't like her either. Because it's like we're both doing the same thing, because we both had a similar problem, I think, like my father wouldn't pay any attention to me. And my mother admits it, she said, "He was afraid. He was afraid you were going to break." And I can see now why I got to be such a tomboy, because maybe I felt if I was HARDER, if I was more like my brother, my daddy would pay some attention to me. I mean, he wouldn't. And it's like, she had the same thing. Her father wouldn't take her along when he'd take the brother and everything and she felt like he didn't love her. So we're working under sort of like the same thing. That we're both working for fellows and like she says she has more fellow friends because the girls feel as if she's trying to take the boyfriends away from them. And I have the same thing. I really do. Like I'll be down ... at least I did ... not quite so much anymore. [0:24:20.3]</p>

<p>But like I'm starting to spend less time with Chrissie and James because I can see James, not liking me, but paying more attention to me and I can see Chrissie thinking he likes me, and it's like, oh, Jesus Christ, what a mess. And I don't want to be in that. I don't want to lose those two people as friends, and the only way I can do it is by not seeing them very often. And she brought this up to, she said, "You shouldn't spend that much time because you're an idealist and you can't ... you've got to be a realist. You've got to realize that that's it. And I said, "Okay." </p>

<p>Like I said, she does a lot of things. Again, it's like there IS a certain amount of giving, there's a certain amount of telling me you know like, "Hey dummy, this is the way the world is." And she does do a lot of that. So I can't really say she sits back and does absolutely nothing for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. But it's mixed for you. You get something out of it because you really need a friend, but yet she does all this s*** that you really can't stand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I ... at least ... see, at least that hurts me. Now there are some things that I say to her that if I said to somebody else would (inaudible). And there are some things she says to me, and I guess if she said it to somebody else, they would either like it or they wouldn't ... you know, like ... I can't stand when things she says like, "Well you should be spanked for that," things like this. You know like, "Here I am putting you on a five-year-old level." And I'd like to just turn around and slug her. I really ... that's my feeling. Like, I'm not a child. Why do you keep treating me like a child? Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's really important to you, not to be a child.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because I've taken on responsibility since I was 12 years old. I was watching kids, I was cleaning houses, I was doing this, I was doing that. I had to make decisions and things like this. And I was not a child. I never even had a real childhood after I was about eight years old. And I say to myself, "I don't mind that so much, I mean it's over, there's no way to recapture my youth or anything. But it's an idea like why then if I am so adult and I feel so adult, does she treat me like such a child?" [0:26:17.6]</p>

<p>My boss even gives me lots of responsibility now, you know, you should do this and you have to do this, you know, you take care of the clients, you do ... You don't give that to a real immature person, you just don't. You keep them away as far as you can from client contact, you sit them there and you say, "Here, do your typing and stay there. Don't talk to anybody, don't see anybody." And I guess maybe that's one of the reasons too that I feel like I like more public contact with people because it takes a certain amount of maturity to really ... you know, and a certain amount of personality of course to interact with people. But I don't know, I can't understand why, but it's always in that type of content (ph), not even "slug you," but "spank you," or sometimes "you're like a child." And I sit there and think, "Come on! Tell me I'm ignorant, I am ignorant, okay, you can tell me that. It's a truism. I know it. Come out and say that. But why say I'm a child? I don't like that idea." Unless she wants a daughter so bad or something, let her get married and have her own kid, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she's putting you down again. She's attacking you when you're really vulnerable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's one of the places I am, because I don't feel ... I don't feel in that area ... I mean in many ways with love and that, I'm very dumb. I really am in lots of ways. Like, I don't know how to handle men as well as I should that I like. If I don't like them, boy, I can handle them, I have one fellow that calls me about once a week and he always wants to know if I want to go out. He always ends up hanging up on me because I tell him I'm busy. He always goes, "Aarr!" and bangs down the phone! But it's like if I really like a fellow, I don't know what to do. I'm just ... I took care of this one fellow for about a year, I was going out with this fellow and he was taking me to all the nice, real nice places around town, I had no problem because I didn't like him. I liked him, but not really DIG him. And when I really dig a guy, I act like an idiot because it's like this is somebody I really have something with and I really ... again, it's like I want to hold on to him. It's like ... I don't know, I guess it's like maybe I loved my father too but he didn't love me or I didn't feel he did, so ... [0:28:17.1]</p>

<p>And my brother the same way. Oh that really hurt, but I guess I've got to figure his side too, maybe he felt like when I left and I didn't write to him or whatever, that I didn't care. But even when I was there at Orbits I can remember going ... he was like ... the idea like I wasn't there and I was there, like I wasn't his ... really his sister, he was more going for my mother, I don't know why, my mother. And I cannot understand that. There was lots there, but I can't really understand it yet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've outlined two problems (inaudible). One was with fellows, you don't feel like you know the right things to do or how to relate to them and then with your brother this kind of feeling of being left or abandoned, but you think you should think of him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm trying ... see, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying maybe because I've been told that that's what I'm supposed to do. I don't know if I'm at the point yet where I really can feel for his feeling and sort of forget about my own. And whether he ever came back to me or whether ... as long as it would help him to try to explain to him what happened and why he feels hurt too, because he probably does feel hurt. I can't see how you can have a relationship as close ... we really had a close relationship. I mean, you can live in the same house with somebody for eight years, but if you have a real close relationship between brother and sister like we had, even in Springfield for that next year and a half, and all of a sudden, like POOM! No brother. And he's even living under the same roof, and it wasn't the same. And it was like, I don't know, I just got to the point where I didn't feel like he cared. So when I left, I left my brother behind. I really ... I didn't even think about him hardly. And I know why I don't think of people when I love them, it's because I don't WANT to think about them. Every time I do, it hurts. So I just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Every time you do, they go away. [0:30:13.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just don't think about them. Oh yeah, I've got a brother some place ... you know, somebody will ask you if you have brothers or sisters ... "Yeah, I've got a brother, I don't know where he is, up on the north side someplace."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're saying you see you're a part of this now, that you did kind of cut him off and leave him somehow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think there was an idea for him that I left him, but I think partly it had something to do with Andy my one step-brother who I had actually a crush on. It wasn't a big brother image. See, but I don't think Ed understood that. It was more like a father image, as young as he was, he was only 10 years older than I was, but it was like either like a boyfriend or a father image. You know, like you could really ... I didn't realize this, but I'm sure that you can actually have a crush on somebody at eight years old, you know, like on a fellow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And so this was what it was. It was a crush, and so I can see now my brother's point that this was like (inaudible) I used to be really ... he was a good looking fellow. And he was also very nice and funny and everything, and he was a real sweet guy. But he didn't know how to handle me either. And I didn't realize the relationship I had ... I remember having a little crush on him, but I guess the thing is the reason I didn't want to remember so much because it's like HE cut ME off. I don't know exactly why or maybe it's partly because he didn't know what to do! You've got this little eight-year-old kid, what are you supposed to do with an eight-year-old kid who's madly in love with you? You look at them (ph) like, "What the hell's going on here?" So he probably ignored me or tried to push me away for my own good, but of course I didn't understand that. First thing I thought was, "He doesn't love me. He doesn't love me. HE DOESN'T LOVE ME!" And then meanwhile, probably my brother was thinking the same thing, like I did care for Andy and I didn't care for him. And so ... I didn't realize that, but yeah, I guess that's probably very true. Here I was liking somebody else and then when that one threw me over, it's almost like a (inaudible) well I think I'll go back to my old boyfriend and expect him to take you back, you know. And I guess you can't expect that. [0:32:15.4]</p>

<p>And so when he was acting that way toward me, it was probably the same thing. You know, the rejectee (ph) saying, "Ah ha! You're going to reject me, now I'm going to reject you when you don't have anybody." But I guess probably that's why he definitely liked Mary, he was liking Mary when I was liking Andy. It started across. I started transferring my affections to one person, he transferred his to another and then when there was no more contact between the two of us, he probably wanted ... what the hell, why want her back? </p>

<p>But I don't know, I guess that's part of that (ph) and then like when we were separated for that length of time too, like for six years ... I didn't see him for almost six years. No, I think he came to my 8th grade graduation, so we had been separated about a year and a half, about a year and a half before I'd seen him ... the first time, a year and a half. And he came for an afternoon. And boy, did I do a thing too, no wonder. That time I was going with a fellow who the same day happened to be going into the service. Well, I was 14, and my first mad crush and I always liked them big and strong when I was younger because again, that was that big, strong protective image that I wanted. And I spent more time with him (inaudible) my mother and my foster mother yelling at me saying, "Why didn't you spend more time with your brother? (inaudible)" And I remember saying to myself, "I haven't seen him for a year and a half. He comes by and he just says 'hi' to me and so what am I supposed to do? What relationship do we have with him? This is the fellow I may MARRY in three or four years. This is the guy who's important." And I never realized that my brother, I think he even left without saying goodbye, and that was the first time I felt hurt, "Well he didn't even say goodbye to me, the lug." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then you can see the second time that you shut him out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that I shut HIM out and it wasn't just the other way around. And [in that way] (ph) I was very selfish. [0:34:07.1]</p>

<p>And I realize that, because it was ... I was taking a pick between the fellow who was taking the place of my father, which would be my boyfriend who was big and strong, and the fellow who was also my protector or whatever, but who ... I probably had felt at that time like he hadn't paid any attention to me for a year and a half so why in the hell should I bother with him, and we were already separating in the other place. So I was feeling two things. Like, who would I rather spend my time with, this guy here who ... partly because he loved me, I thought, or at least ... yeah, I think he did, he had like a crush or almost a love for me, and I loved him. See, and that was sharing with him. I figure, "Well, why bother with this guy? He's only my brother." But now when I get a little bit older and I realize how important it is to have a brother, and when I saw like these other things, like the way he was with Mary, I really shouldn't have been shocked, I should have expected that, because what can you expect from somebody who's been rejected by you? But I never thought that before. All I thought of was like me, me, me. Like "He doesn't love me, this one doesn't love me, that one doesn't love me, so the hell with them."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just caught in that. You couldn't see the other person's feelings (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I couldn't see that at all, and now I see a lot like with my brother, oh Jesus, I never even thought of that for the longest time, like that time when he came out to see me on my graduation, I never even thought of that. And that must have really hurt him. Because like he wasn't ... he comes from the same background I am, he's probably about the same as I am in that way, you know, like as soon as somebody says something to you, you get hurt. And you can get hurt by the goofiest things. And I don't know, it's just very, very funny that I never even thought about that. And I can remember when I went to that thing for my foster parents when they had all the whole family over and everything, and like they had a gift for Ed and everything, and he didn't come out. And I was wondering very seriously, the reason he didn't come out is because I was going to be there. [0:36:03.4]</p>

<p>Because (inaudible) said, "We'll make plans to get together now." And I said, "Oh yeah," you know ... well partly, maybe I shouldn't have done that. See, I didn't realize his point either. I was thinking that we were going to go down to the south side for my sisters and see my mother and see my sister and then go over to some church something or other. I think it was an antique sale or something. That's what it was. And so I asked both Eliza and Jodie to go after I had made plans with my brother, but the thing is, I asked him, I said, "Do you want to go out to see Mom?" That was the first thing. And then I said, "Well how about ... you've been out to see my sister ..." because he did take me out one time to see my mother, and I said, "Well how about we stop by Jenny's and then would you mind taking two girls with us?" Well I saw the line like, "Here's a single guy, there's two single girls, they're both good looking, they're both my friends, why should he mind? He should have fun with it." You know, like these two girls in the car, these two extra girls in the car. And I said ... but I guess I didn't realize the idea that like what I was saying is that you're not important enough for me to be alone with you, like, so why don't you almost be like our chauffer is what I was almost saying, and I didn't realize that. It was like saying, "Here, you take us here and you take us there and my girlfriends are going to come along too and we'll do this." And I guess it was like, not worrying about his feelings of what he might want to do or what he might want to talk to me about even.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's almost like before you ... your consciousness ended two inches outside your nose. You're sort of surrounded by this cloud and now it's really different. Now you can see out of that, see beyond your borders and see other people and how they work and how they feel. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's hard though to try to ... see, like first of all, maybe one of the things is part of the thing that retarded me in thinking about other people at all was that I would sometimes be idealistic in the way I WANTED people to feel because of the way they reacted and the way I would take their reaction. Like with my boss. I actually thought he liked me. I really did. I thought that he really had a caring and that there was something in there, it was almost like a protectiveness, but it was like ... you know, like he really dug me. And I was such a dummy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You believed the way it was you wanted it to be. [0:38:23.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, not the way it was. See, same with my brother. I guess I WANTED it to be, in a different sense, I wanted it to be that he rejected me because then I wouldn't have to see that I rejected him too. Of course, like, with my boss, one of the things I didn't want to see is like that I was wearing these short skirts and things like this and actually what I was doing was turning him on as being ... maybe not cheap, but like easy or whatever. And then like when I ... </p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't want to look at your part in it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. And like when I would say "no," then it would be like to him a rejection of his ego because he'd say ... like if you see somebody, you know, you're walking around with these short skirts on and that, you're more than likely ... and some of the actions I used to do too I suppose were like a little bit suggestive. So like, what I was doing to him then is like he was looking and he says, "Well, look, here she is and she seems to be pretty easy ... and why not with me?" And then what he was probably thinking was like his ego was probably hurt because I wouldn't react to him and like everybody else ... or like he would assume I would react to almost everybody else. He'd see lots of the fellows would come up and talk to me and that. I used to think maybe it was because they liked me. Now it probably is, because I dress more conservatively on that, and it's like if you want to talk to me fine, if you don't want to talk to me, the hell with you. And it's like, that's the way I feel. And I'll talk to you if I want to goof around or whatever, fine. But stay off the dirty lines, stay off everything else and any insinuation, forget it Mark. Because I'll put you down. Before, I would just act innocent. Now I say, "To hell with it. I'll put you down." </p>

<p>I hope I didn't ... like one time, this is so funny, that one boss, and he was talking about, "When do you work," and we were kidding, so I said, "Oh, I come in at 10:00, I work 'til 10:30, I have an hour coffee break and then I work another hour and I have a two-hour lunch," and this and that. He says, "Well when's tea time?" And I said, "Oh, that's 4:00 in the afternoon and I don't work anymore after 3:00." And then he goes, "And when's bedtime" or "when's go to bed time" or something like this, well he was insinuating, you know, and I looked at him and I said, "I hope I didn't really hear that last remark right" and he went, "Oh, uh ..." And this man's like 50-something years old. [0:40:38.4]</p>

<p>But it's like I don't play games anymore. I know maybe that's the best way to be, to be feminine and all this bull****, but I can't do it anymore. Like if I feel something, I'm going to say it ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like people putting you into that box even if it IS supposed to be feminine. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And it's like ... it's not my idea of being feminine. My idea of being ... well partly, if you do that, I don't know, it seems like ... sometimes it turns people off of that and they won't start it again. But sometimes they'll just try it on and on and on. They'll think it's very funny because you don't catch it. And so I just want them to know, "Look, Mark, I know what you're talking about, I'm not interested, so fly a kite. If you want to talk to me decently, fine. If you don't, then the hell with you." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to be treated that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's not only that, I don't want them to THINK that way about, at least, me. If they want ... if other girls want them to think about them that way, fine. But I don't want them ... number one, I don't want them to think I'm dumb. And number two, I don't want them to think that ... how can I say it ... I don't want them to think like they can maybe get away with something or anything like that. I want them to know, look, toong, toong, toong, you know where you're at ... And partly I think it's more fair for the other person too. I mean, seriously. [0:42:00.0]</p>

<p>Like if the person ... if he's going to keep playing these games and you just keep playing the game too only you're doing this, (innocently) "Gee I don't know what you're talking about" stuff, you know, after a while ... like first of all, either you're going to slip, because they're going to know you know what they're talking about and then they'll say, "Well, you phony ..." and then partly they're going to feel their ego is going to be hurt because you're playing all this baloney and they caught on. And partly they're just like ... I think they're going to take this and put it into another area, I think. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my idea. Then they think that you're really a dumb dingbat and forget it. So I don't agree with that either. This is just one of my things. I'm getting to that point, like if I don't want something, I just go ... that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think that's a way that men learn to put women down. I mean, I think it's a societal thing. And the only way to change it is to stick up for yourself the way you're doing. (phone rings) (inaudible) expect that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Counselor answers phone)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I was just thinking, it's so funny how it doesn't bother me as much to do it to men anymore. But another thing that really bugs me too (inaudible) when Jodie (inaudible) and what my other friend told me too. Like she said to me ... this is one of the things I'm thinking too, like what would a real friend do? What would I do if I were in the situation, if I had the things she had? If I had the money, first of all, I would not want my girlfriend, if she was a real friend, to go to the bank and get money and have to pay interest on it. What I would do is I would say, "Look, here's whatever you need ..." because she's got lots of money to go. She's got no problem going, she's got lots extra (inaudible). Now this would be a give and take and I would still be ... she would still be coming out ahead. But it would help me now. All right, I wouldn't have to pay interest on the money, and I would have the money. I wouldn't have to worry about credit and all this other stuff. And then like also I wouldn't have to pay it back so quickly, like say she'd say, "Okay, now I'll be over here six months, now I want you to send me after six months a travelers check for $100. And then maybe in another two or three months, send me another check for $100." [0:44:32.1]</p>

<p>See, this way I could pay this back in spurts, but they would be far enough in the future where I wouldn't be pinching every penny. And she would actually be saving, because then she wouldn't have to buy traveler's checks. I would buy them and she wouldn't have to carry as many with her and all sorts of things. It would be to her advantage and my advantage. But she didn't mention that, because see ... and she would because she's got a very good mind for figures and things like that if she were thinking at all about the other person, that's what she would do. And this is the way I feel, because this is what I would do, and she's got a lot better mind than I have. </p>

<p>And then things like "You'd better be careful because people will offer and they'll offer and they'll offer, but when it comes right down to it, they won't do it." In other words, don't get too close to these people, and part of it's the idealism but part of it is even more than that. I don't think she WANTS me to have other close friends. I really don't. It's like, it's almost like an insecurity SHE still has. Like I've got to be your best friend. But she's also got to be Yolanda's best friend. And like two of us can't get too close because then maybe WE'LL become best friends and not them. And it's like, I don't care you are my best friend, but why do you have to sort of feel like ... I almost feel like I'M caged now. And it's like, I don't like it. I don't like the feeling, because I've never been in that feeling before. And ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like she wants you to be best friend, but then she sort of doesn't follow through on what that means. And even thinking in terms of "best" and it's not something that you want to be involved in. [0:46:06.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't. I don't like that feeling anymore. Like I said, I don't care. I think from my own watching that Eliza and her are getting closer. But I also think that's fine, because heck, they're going to be living together for a year and a half. They're going to be traveling all over Europe together. If they're not pretty close, they're going to have problems. And yet ... like, I say to myself ... when I said something about leaving or something I guess that I got the loan, I could take the loan whatever I needed, I know she got mad at me again last night because I said I may look for an apartment next week probably or maybe this week, and I said the reason I'm taking ... well I may even take the loan right away because maybe I might have to pay two months rent right away. And if I find something, whether it's for May 1st, June 1st or July 1st, they're going to be out already. Even June 1st, they'll be up already in April. And I said, "So I'll have to pay two month's rent right off the bat." </p>

<p>Well then she starts bringing up these things later. First she didn't talk to me for a while. Then she starts bringing up how inflation is going up and depression at the same time and we're losing jobs and everything. And there was just a purge at my office and I was afraid ... last night I brought this up, I was afraid that I wasn't going to be there because I walked in and everybody said, "So nice to see you here." "What? What's going on?" Because I was sick ... well, I took off Monday to go flying. I said I was sick. And they said, "Yeah, because 14 people on the audit staff got canned again." Well this is what happened before. First the audit staff went, and then they started hitting the secretaries. Well we've got a skeleton crew of secretaries right now. If they take any more people off, [we're going to be] (ph) working 12 hours a day. And so I said, "Well, you know, at the end of May, they're probably going to do it again." And she is right in that way. If I take out that loan, I'm going to have a problem paying it back if I get canned from my job and have to take a job with less money or whatever if I can even GET one. </p>

<p>But you know, just an idea to me like all right, so they could fire me, start looking right now, meaning myself to settle with another job, maybe before because this is a very insecure position at this place. [0:48:07.2]</p>

<p>But it's an idea like, so what? All right, so maybe I might be in a little trouble with the bank and maybe I might (inaudible), so what? It's like ... I don't know. It's still to me, it doesn't seem like she's really working for my good. That's probably why I'm doing it more than anything else, because like I'm afraid like, "She doesn't really care about me." I don't know, it's such a hassle, a relationship that you really care about somebody, but you don't know whether there's really a relationship or whether it's just like a dependency upon each other, for whatever your needs are. </p>

<p>All right, everybody's got to fulfill each other's needs, but what kind of relationship is that? And I don't like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Funny kind of fulfilling of needs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's almost like a sick kind of fulfilling of needs, and that's what I don't like about it, because I'm trying to get well. And I don't know, I just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sticky and competitive and you don't have a feeling of really seeing each other and really caring about each other.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like many times, we'll be in the same apartment and we won't even talk to each other. Like I'm not saying you HAVE to, like I guess married people get the wrong impression like if you're not talking every night, you're not, you know ... But it's just like ... I don't know ... And you know another thing that's scared the s*** out of me because like we talk like this, we'll say like ... one time we were fighting about something and I thought of the Odd Couple. Well she thought of married people. I thought of the Odd Couple. She thought of married people. Well the funny thing was, was like I was telling some of these things about dominant personality (inaudible) that sounds like a homosexual ... Oh Christ! ... now wait a minute, not that bad, please! If I'm in that kind of a relationship, I'm getting out tomorrow. But you know, just like, I don't understand lots of things that go on and like I don't know, I don't understand my feelings. Like I really care, I would care if something happened to her, if somebody hurt her, I really care about it. But it's like, I don't know where the heck I'm at. I don't know like whether there's really a caring or whether again, like it's ... [0:50:13.1]</p>

<p>Like she's really gotten me in with her mother. Her mother invited me to stay there. She actually was the one that said that, you know, I could stay there if I couldn't find any other place. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like she's sending you two kinds of messages and you don't quite know whether to believe that or not. That you would like her to be the caring person, but then you keep getting messed up because she is sending you other messages too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, other messages like "Don't hurt me, but I don't care." The other thing that really gets me is like, "Don't hurt me, but I can hurt you. It doesn't make any difference, because look what I've done for you before." And I can't see a relationship like that. Because like with Chrissie and James and I even, it sounds funny or it's a triangle and that's kind of goofy. I wish to heck ... like I'm going to see if Harold will take me out, their friend, Friday. So if there's two couples, it's fine, because then you can all four interact and then there's no problem. But then again, I don't want to spend too much time because they are married and it's true that they have other things that they have in common that I don't have because I'm NOT married. But like I don't see why (inaudible) to have a relationship as long as, again, there's lots of people around or at least there's another person there ... why you can't see each other every couple of weeks even, socially. Sit down, talk for a couple of hours, whatever. </p>

<p>She says she's got the problem that like when she meets (inaudible) and she is, she's very attractive to fellows, and part of it is this "on" thing and part of it is she's a very attractive person. She really is. I mean I was attracted to her as a person. And lots of fellows are attracted to her as a girl, you know they really think she's really WOW. But it's an idea like she says she can't see them because like with her one friend, she sees him maybe once a year socially at a party, but he keeps talking about how great she is and all this and she says it's hard for a woman to take that, which it is, like a wife, I'm sure that if a man keeps talking about some other woman. So I say, okay. But I don't ... it's not ... with that (inaudible) gets so much with me because like I don't ... I don't ... like when I'm not playing games and I don't play games, I like to get into like just a mind discussion, that's all we think about, we're in deep discussions, we talk about things and they're helping to open my mind a little bit more. And we just throw out different subjects and topics and everything and like they'll broaden my mind, giving me some of these [on the way] (ph) books. Like even the Psychic Self-Defense, you wouldn't get that like with the normal run-of-the-mill people would not be reading Psychic Self-Defense! Let's face it. More like some of the doctors, they've got (inaudible) doctors diseases and help talking you know about homeopathy and things like this and osteopath and then talking about the regular orthodox doctors who give you all this crap to put in your system. And like lots of the things make sense and they're very interesting. They're nice for broadening your views on things. And I think there's a little bit of jealousy there. I really do, because like she's broadened my mind in many areas, but like lots of the things she thinks are important I don't. Even the other one says ... Eliza says she places too much importance on money. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. She doesn't want to let you loose. She doesn't want to let you be different (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and like, I don't care. I can be just as comfortable in like ... first of all, I love slacks, and she was giving me an idea like I shouldn't wear slacks to work and things like this because it's not really up in the (inaudible). I said, "Tough. Maybe that's not YOUR idea, but it is MY idea of being comfortable, it's my idea of ... I love to wear slacks because I can move more freely, I don't have to worry about the skirts going up and all this other bull****.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you just don't want her running your life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And that's the way I feel. Like it's okay, as long as somebody's there and like ... but I feel that this is a good thing for me. I don't know how it is for her, but it's a good thing for me, because like I've always wanted that. And she says that too, she says, "For a long time, I had to tell you, 'Now this is what you do to be a friend, you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to do the other thing.'" [0:54:13.0]</p>

<p>Well I don't agree that she has to do that anymore. She said, you know, like when we had that fight, "That's what I've been telling you for the last year. I tell you what to do and what ..." Okay, at first you had to, but when somebody doesn't know, that's what you HAVE to do with them. You have to lead them and say, "Look ..." like a child, admittedly. You have to say, "Look, this is what you have to do. And you have to think about other people's needs ..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now your relationship has changed and you're really different and you want her to see you differently and the other part of it is that you don't even respect her opinion of what friendship is that much anymore because she's not so hot at it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know, this is one thing that Chrissie and James brought up too, like I said that you know, she did all this for me, and I said, "I don't like the idea of her throwing it up to me," but I do like ... I admit it ... she doesn't have to tell me. It's like, I FEEL the things she's done for me. She's done a hell of a lot for me, you know, even just getting me into therapy was a hell of a lot to do for somebody. And it's like ... but she says ... it almost seems like she puts like ... this is what Chrissie said, she said, "Well it almost seems like she says now I have to do this much, and I have to almost buy your friendship. It's almost like buying you. Now you're in bondage, so now for the rest of your life you're going to have to tell me, 'thank you, thank you, thank you' and do anything I want and don't worry about yourself at all." And I said I never thought about that. </p>

<p>Because like, I admit it, like with Chrissie and James, if I find something that I like or that I think is nice or ... they had these candles so what I was looking for because I had gotten them for myself were these matches with their sign, their astrological signs on them. So I was going to get that because they had the candles at home and they could use it to light the candles and put their signs right next to them, both of theirs - one's Aires the other one's Scorpio. And I couldn't find them. So I ended up buying these itty bitty little matches from Sweden, they were real cute too, so I got those instead. But it's like just things like this that you think about these people and you WANT to do things not because you feel like, "If I don't get them something this week, they're not going to like me anymore."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Bigger and not so petty] (ph) [0:56:13.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because sometimes I'll go and I won't have anything for them. I might have a book, like if I see something and I knew Chrissie was interested in painting. Well I had this miniature - Indian miniatures book. And it's all from like way ... and it has all big color plates. She likes to take some things from a picture and paint from one. And so I thought of that, I said, "Oh great!" So right away I brought that for Chrissie. But it's like with Jodie, I can't do that. First of all, she's a woman that's got everything. And you feel almost like if you get her something, she's got it already and like she's going to be more appreciative of somebody else's or something and it's like, you try your darndest, and like I don't have lots of money. I can't go out and spend money like she can. But I try to. I try to, like, if she's going to have company over, I'll get her wine and then I'll go out. </p>

<p>But like, okay, this is the reverberations of that. Maybe I'm saying the same thing. "Now I do this much, so you should do this much." But it's like, I wanted to give her ... what did I say ... I said I wanted Chrissie and James to come over ... this is what I said ... and Harold. Even though I knew Harold would be there and I know damn well that she's so darned attractive to fellows that I may end up not having Harold anymore. But I would give that up. I said, okay. I want to share my friends with you because you shared yours with me. And I said, "Okay, when will you be home?" Well it was I had to do this, I had to do that and all this baloney, almost like ... she says, "But I might be home sometime to meet them anyway, if I don't have dinner with you." I said, "Okay. If you don't want to, fine." </p>

<p>So then she tells me at the beginning of the week "I'm having people over Saturday." I said, "Okay." That's okay. She didn't ask me whether ... and I'm certainly not going to stay if she doesn't ask me. So I'm making plans and everything. Then she said she's changing it to Friday night. Well I said, "Well I take a gym class on Friday." I didn't say anything. Except when that night came I said, "Oh, well we're going out to a Spanish restaurant." And then she says after all this is over, "Well if you want to, bring your friends back." [0:58:12.8]</p>

<p>And then one other time, she said, "Well if you want to ..." the night before, she told me the beginning of the week that she's having somebody over. She didn't tell me who, I knew the girls, both of them, that she was having over for dinner. And then she says like the last minute, the night before, "Well if you want to ..." this is the way she put it ... "If you want to stay, you can." Not like, "We'd really like to have you here." But "If you want to stay, you can." And I said to myself, "Well s***, if that's the light you put it in, like I don't WANT to stay." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like sort of casting you off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it's like, again, a piece of the furniture, if you want to stay here and stand and hold some platter, you can, but if you don't, you know ... And I don't think that's friendship and I just ... I don't like that idea of not thinking at all about the other person's feelings. Just because I'm getting a little bit stronger, that means that you don't care about my feelings at all? And, I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to stop. Next week is our last time. Does that square with your ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bleah. Well ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it is. I'll check. Why don't you check when you go downstairs, do you have time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What do I do, just ask her?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ask her. I think it is. So, we need to talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I get back after waiting after that - a waiting period, then get back into therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so, except this place is closing. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you're kidding. Oh wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On July 1st. There might be an institute starting after that with the same people, but that's really up in the air. And I'm kind of pessimistic about (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) Okay. Well let me talk to them and find out what's going on. [1:00:17.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um ... that's going to be hard for you, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) It would probably be good to think about </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know, I just wish I knew whether I was finished or not, whether I'll need eventually more help. And like, I don't know. It's like I feel like I've done a lot. But like Jodie said too, like, "You'll probably be in therapy for another year and a half. Or another year." And I said, "Oh Christ! What more do I have to find out of my deep dark secrets?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't think that's necessarily true. I hear what you're saying. But one of the reasons that we have this what's called (inaudible) therapy (inaudible). I'm not saying that you might NOT need more. That will be your decision. It depends on the way you feel and what you want to do with your life. But I don't think it's necessarily true. [1:02:05.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether I'm thinking more on terms of ... what kind of scares me is I'm wondering if it's not ... the reason why ... because I do think on my own now and I have been thinking lots of things out on my own, like why are some things, like why I can't be like I want to be sometimes. And yet sometimes I wonder whether it's like, maybe she doesn't want me to be a woman. Maybe she feels like if she keeps saying I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, then I'll be dependent on her. Like, I don't know. I feel like lots of the things I've found out, the more of the things when I think on my own, and like I said I'm thinking in my own way, I think maybe I'm almost through or maybe I am through. I don't know. Maybe time will tell, I don't know. I just hope they have another program in case I have to get back in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right. It is your own decision. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, thank you. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. See you next week. </p>

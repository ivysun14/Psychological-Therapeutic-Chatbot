<p>PATIENT:   (Silence) I don't know, I was just thinking of a couple of things.  Uhm, mm, I had been just thinking about the fact that uhm, over the weekend I felt this way.  Very nervous and again, as if there was something that needed to be done, and I didn't quite know what it was because I was busy doing other things.  And so I never sat down to think about it, and then I knew, knowing enough of my reactions to know that it was, I was seeking something that had to be done as a way to justify the feeling, when it probably had nothing to do with anything that had to be done. </p>

<p>And uhm, and I was just thinking of how today, uhm, MSCZ's aunt is coming for dinner, and then sh, she's going to stay over night.  And  uhm, well it's her grandson, MSCZ's cousin, I guess it is, is coming also for dinner.  And I'd like things to be pleasant and have things done as much ahead of time as possible.  But it isn't some crucial thing and yet, I felt very nervous about this.  And uhm, I'd alrea—, I'd done a little uhm, preparation yesterday.  And then, uhm, this afternoon I was doing some of it. </p>

<p>And i—, i—, I don't know, there really isn't a problem, but I was feeling very nervous in the fact that there's anything to be done when I get home.  Uhm, or mainly some things I want to do before I go home, I had—, I didn't have time to do this afternoon.  Uhm, I don't know, it seems like it's an outlet f,f, for this nervous feeling that I'm feeling anyway. </p>

<p>And then I thought when I came in here of, or I remembered, that on Friday, uhm, at the end, it wasn't really a surprise to me, because you had even suggested it earlier I might be feeling that way.  And I'd even said something earlier, but I guess I'd sort of s—, continued to deny it.  That I, I think I did feel angry that you didn't actually say, well, this is why you're feeling this way, or did feel this way at the BFM's, even though you were leading me to think things about it. </p>

<p>And uhm, well the thing I'm recalling is not so much what we talked about last week, in connection with that Saturday and other things that were connected.  But just simply that I think on Friday at the end, I felt uhm, somehow I think I'd always thought, well, you'd say something at the last minute.  Or uhm, and it wasn't even so much at that point that I felt well, I can't go meet them. </p>

<p>I, I think when I did see them that night I felt very much I had to be sort of on best behavior.  But I didn't feel as tense and uhm, I don't know, so, as much on good behavior as I thought I might.  But still, I think I felt angry that you hadn't somehow said — I'm not sure I knew what I wanted you to say, but I think I wanted you to say something specifically.  And, well I don't know whether that has anything to do with this feeling I've had all weekend.</p>

<p>But, and then I thought of uh, right after thinking of that, I thought of a conference that I had today (Clears throat) with a mother who uhm, actually today was the first day I was supposed to start arranging the conferences.  But this mother had called a little bit earlier and had asked if we could have a conference.  And I don't think she recalled that the school was planning them.  She just thought she wanted to have one and talk about where her daughter should go next year, and things like that.  And uhm, (Sigh) her daughter's a very pleasant child, but she struck me as being extremely uh, restrained, and, and afraid of doing the wrong thing and very careful to have proper manners.  And just that she's uhm, holding back an awful lot of strong feelings.  Because every once in a while her feelings will come out.  And they always come out in a very hostile way, usually toward boys. </p>

<p>And uhm, well I don't know, I just have found her, I felt there's something that, it would be nice for her future happiness to be able to work with, and for her family to understand.  Uh, in a way I think she is exactly what her family wants her to be, and so then it was always a question how much do you say, because it sort of in a way, saying, well, what you want is wrong, which of course, I think any parent might immediately react to.  And uhm, but beyond that, I think I found it hard to think about — her name is FKQ — uhm, i—, I mean, it's specifically connected with this conference.  Because uh, I don't know, I just find I, it's like I get a mental block about it.  And then, the conference went a lot easier than I thought it would, partly because her mother, I asked her mother if she'd had any reason for asking for the conference.  And (Sniff) she said no, and then uh, started talking about the schools. </p>

<p>And I'd just introduced the thing that I thought was the main thing to talk about, and that was that she shouldn't go to a school that was too pressured, because she puts a lot of pressure on herself already, and it would just kind of confirm what FKQ's doing to herself that I thought might be harmful for her happiness.  But it didn't mean so much, she couldn't do the work. </p>

<p>And uhm, and then her mother mentioned 1 or 2 things which was exactly along the lines that I had in mind to talk about.  And so, the conference went all right.  But as soon as it was over, and I have to write out the conference and the mother's reaction, and anything she contributes to it that's helpful for her understanding.  I found I started blocking it out again, and uh, I couldn't think about it. It was as if the whole thing had happened in a haze, and uhm, and yet, while we were actually having the conference, I still found it hard.  I would have found it very hard, if the mother hadn't been uh, conscious of these things, anyway. </p>

<p>Uhm, w—, I don't know, it just seems rather strange to me, because it isn't as if I really don't have any idea of what I'm thinking about FKQ.  But then, then I muddle it all up, so I can't think about it in any kind of a straight way.  And I don't know whether uhm, it's because I'm identifying too much with her, or what. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Think you might be, with FKQ, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, what you've just been describing is really a very good description of the way you have sounded the past uh, especially last week, here.  But I think, partly the week before, also.  You've been feeling — and all last week it's true you wanted me to say something — but you were sounding as though you were feeling terribly confused, you couldn't put anything together, and it all started with uhm, MSCZ saying that you were playing stupid with MW.  And I think that's a pretty good description of, you know, it's as though in y—, the week before you had talked about uh, now what does an IQ number mean?  You can't be what that implies.  You're not that stupid.</p>

<p>The point I'm trying to get at, it's as though all week, what you have been doing — for I think, a very particular reason — is muddling up your thoughts.  Uh, you said, when I did say some things that I was trying to put together, uh, help point you in a certain direction, you find yourself not thinking about them, ignoring them.  As though you were trying to maintain this very state you're just describing, feeling muddled, confused.  And not because you didn't know something.  Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Now, you see, I think what's behind all this is  uh, I think what really started this, was when you made love Sunday afternoon with MSCZ, during FSO's nap.  I think it's been really, since then, that increasingly you've found it necessary to be in this frame of mind, where you're sort of pseudo-stupid.  Playing stupid, confusing yourself, muddling things, unclear, not putting things together. </p>

<p>Now, I remember one thing about that Sunday afternoon, that uh, I thought of, and you didn't uhm, bring up in connection with it, it came up in another way.  There was another time, when you were taking a nap, when you were a little girl.  And you were supposed to be sleeping, but you weren't.  And you saw something.  You saw the rabbits and the dogs.  And you were troubled by it, but you couldn't tell anybody.  You couldn't talk to your mother about it, because that would mean letting her know that you weren't sleeping.  That you weren't taking your nap.  You'd seen something you couldn't own up to.  But you had to, in effect, play stupid about.  Play dumb about.  Muddle up.  And the very thing you're just describing, this incident today, but you've been doing it increasingly, I think, since, since Sunday afternoon.  You didn't want to really go into that, or tell me about it much.</p>

<p>So, I think what's been going on, is connected with what that reminded you of, which is something going on behind a closed door.  Something you want very much to overhear, to know about.  You've been preoccupied with that in a number of different situations.  What did they say?  You wanted to overhear somebody, did they overhear you?  Whatever it is you're tensely curious about, I think, is also summarized by that little girl in bed with her parents when they were making love.  You thought she would be very curious, and very interested in that.  But in all of this, you have to be stupid, you have to not know something.  You have to hide what you know.  I've talked enough now.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Laughs, Pause)  Well, I'm having trouble with one, well I don't know, I me—, I've gotten stuck on one aspect of it that uhm, (Sigh) I don't know whether I'm just quibbling, because I don't want to (Sniff) get any further, uhm, and how I'm thinking, or what.  But uhm, when you mentioned that the time of uhm, that Sunday afternoon, MSCZ and I making love, then brought to mind another time when I'd had a nap and uhm, I wasn't sleeping when I was supposed to, w—, I, I, I'm having trouble, I guess, all around that whole thing of how you got to thinking about my taking a nap, and the rabbits. </p>

<p>But, then the first thing I started thinking was, well I did tell my mother.  I don't know if I really did or not, but I immediately start thinking that I did.  And, and I have this feeling that I did tell her, that I didn't hide it.  Uhm, and then I guess I had trouble seeing how that followed into the uhm, my curiosity of what happened behind  the closed door, which I know I've had curiosity about.</p>

<p>But I, I guess I'm finding that I don't, I don't even know if I r—, let myself hear you just now, when, when you went from talking about uhm, my napping and then, uhm, seeing the rabbits.  And uhm, well I took it that you were saying I didn't dare let on, because then it meant I'd let on that I wasn't sleeping.  And I just kept feeling while you were talking — and maybe this is the first time I've felt this way, I don't know, but — that I had let on. </p>

<p>And uhm, (Sniff) but then, I don't know, somehow, getting into my curiosity, as if, w—, I keep thinking, well, are you implying that the, seeing the rabbits, and then pretending that I didn't see it, uhm, well I don't know, somehow it, I keep thinking, well it must be from what you were saying — and I know I have lost something you've said — is symbolic of my curiosity, and the fact that I know something that I don't want to admit I know.   And then I don't know, then I think, well I don't know what that is.  That I know that I'm pretending I don't. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   It's true you don't know, and uh, what, what's mak—, you know what makes it hard for you to, to try to get at what it is, is this playing stupid.  Because you see, in effect, that's really what you did about the whole incident on that Saturday night with —</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting) Mm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   — with MW.  All last week you, everything I said you sort of heard it, and then dropped it.  And you even commented on how you hadn't dealt with the things I had said I thought were related in some way.  You said many other things that probably uh, would give some explanation.  But I think you're keeping yourself from trying to put them together.  You're finding it necessary to be stupid, to stay in this state, to not know.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Silence) Mm, it's not that I'm getting anywhere, and, maybe I am.  But I was just thinking of the fact that i, in just thinking of not letting myself know — because I feel as if that's what I'm doing right now, too — and not understanding in the way I know I should, what you've just said.  Or not just this last time, but before.  Uhm, because I did understand what you said, but then I come away feeling I didn't.  And uhm, and it just reminds me of this feeling of tension that I had all weekend. </p>

<p>And, and then also, I started thinking again of the way I felt today when I was thinking about the conference, after.  And the reluctance I had of going into it, and feeling I didn't know what to say, essentially.  And uh, and then afterwards, I didn't know what had happened, was effect, in effect, what I was feeling.  And yet I knew what we'd talked about.  And then I come away thinking, but I don't know what we talked about. </p>

<p>And uhm, well, I don't know what I, I know in that particular case, then I also have this fear of giving myself away, somehow.  I don't know exactly in what way.  But because I'm, well, I'm always dealing with other people, I suppose, when I'm not knowing something I know.  But uhm, (Sigh) I guess I'm just afraid th, this approach, because I have to write up this conference, I have to talk to Mrs. BBF about it. </p>

<p>And FKQ's mother went in to speak to Mrs. BBF right after, because she's the one they have to talk to about the s, specifics about the schools.  And usually they do it the same day they have a conference with me.  And uhm, Mrs. BBF was, s, said that she was very pleased with how things went, because the mother came in with good attitudes, and understanding certain things that she had thought the mother might not understand.  Or at least, expressing a certain amount of understanding.  So it would suggest that I had had a good conference with her.  But I come away feeling that the whole thing was muddled, and uhm, well I guess that, what I'm really thinking is, I'm just sort of doing it right now, too.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yes, well I think you, see, had to muddle it up.  You had to somehow, not know what was going on behind the doors in your parents' room.  You even said last week, you remember, that you didn't know, after all.  And I said, but you were playing stupid.  And whether you knew in a literal way or not, you had some ideas about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Interrupting) Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   That's clear.  Because you've been expressing them indirectly, in all kinds of ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Sigh, Pause) Well, that makes me think of when you asked me, well what did I imagine the little girl knowing, or experiencing, when she was in bed with her parents.  And uhm, and I, I remember having a very mixed feeling about well, she would just see her parents having intercourse, which is a very normal thing.  I mean, not normal for a child to see it.  But on the one hand, I think of it, well that's what  man and a wife do.  Or, not necessarily even a man and a wife, a man and a woman.  And uhm, but then on the other hand it just is something very uhm, well I guess, unthinkable, or uhm, because, I mean, if I think well, what did I think my parents were doing behind the door?  Because I clearly must have had some idea, to be so curious, and to be so upset over the whole thing.  Uhm, I think, well, I must have known they were having intercourse, and what's so disturbing about that.  And I can think of it that way. </p>

<p>But then I also think well, that I can't imagine them having intercourse.  Because it is unthinkable to me.  And I, and I mi—, start mixing it up with thinking, well maybe I thought they were doing something else.  I don't know what.  Uhm, because how could I get so upset over just thinking of them having intercourse?  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I was thinking of 2 things.  And one was just back to that Sunday when FSO was taking a nap, I mean, it's not the first time we've made love when FSO's had a nap, or, uh, certainly anyway, been in bed.  And uhm, I think it must be due partly to the attitude I'd had that it was upsetting to me, because I wanted very much to make love with MSCZ, I think then.  Or at least, uh, I did not feel he was coercing me into it, or I couldn't pretend he was, or anything, that day, really.  And uhm, so maybe that's partly why I've reacted to it more than some other times. </p>

<p>But I just, I don't know, I still don't quite know if I understand why I would react so, unless somehow I kept getting caught up in well, what was FSO thinking on the other side of the door, even though she was unaware of us.  Uhm, well I don't know.  But anyway, then I also think of the fact that yesterday, uh, I had had some things that I wanted to do that would be good for FSO not to be in the way.  I was staining some furniture, and uh, the weather hadn't cleared, because at that point, we were still expecting it to clear.  And so we were planning to do something all together outside when it did.  And at first I was just going to quickly do what I had to do, and uh, then we'd see about going out. </p>

<p>Well, MSCZ thought, well he could — FSO was very eager to go out — and so he thought well, he could just take her out for a little while, while I mainly stained the furniture, which is smelly.  And she's good now at keeping out of things, but still, it w—, it was easier without her. </p>

<p>And then, when they got outside, he kept, he had taken out her tricycle too, which she can now ride.  And uhm, they kept getting further and further away from home, because she was energetic and wanted to go different places, and he didn't mind.  And finally, they got quite far away.  And then they were coming back, and she was tired at this point.  And at one poi—, he carried  the tricycle across th—, uh, big street.  She couldn't ride across.  And he put it down, and he had uhm, because of the way he was carrying the tricycle, pinched a nerve, or done something.  So he lost the feeling first, in his arm and hand.  And then the mobility, partial mobility of it. </p>

<p>And uh, there was FSO cryi—, crying, and tired, and wanting to be held.  And apparently, this made him very nervous.  And he thought something worse was happening.  Well, by the time he got home, he had had to carry the tricycle and FSO.  Or, I don't know, I think he sort of dragged her, or made her walk, because he didn't dare carry her, too.  But anyway, they got home, and he was very excited about h—, it was an emergency, and he had to have the doctor immediately.  So I, and I didn't, I don't know, I mean, he called, "Can you come here?", from the door, and I just thought he needed help getting in, so I went.  But I didn't, I didn't rush as if there was something dreadful happening.  And he got mad at me right away. </p>

<p>Well, it turned out later, he was afraid he, th, there was some blood clot that was causing his, he called his hand paralyzed.  Well, it wasn't, he could move it, but it was, he didn't have all the mobility of it.  And uhm, he was afraid that he was going to have a blood c, clot in the brain.  And uhm, I don't know why he started thinking this way, because right from the time he described what had happened, and, and also there were problems getting — I called the doctor he's been going to lately, and he was out of town.  And the, the answering service couldn't right away locate the person that was covering for him.  And when I called the doctor we'd gone to previously, and uh, he couldn't be reached.  And all these people were going to try to reach somebody and let us know.  But meanwhile, MSCZ's sitting there, afraid he's about to have a blood clot.  Which I didn't realize, I just thought he was disturbed because his hand wasn't doing what it s—, usually can do. </p>

<p>And uhm, and anyway, it seemed to, I, I think my feeling is, you have to react in a calm way, because to get too excited doesn't help.  And MSCZ was so excited, and uhm, (Sigh) so forth.  I was trying to be calm, and then he got mad at me for being calm, not properly appreciating the situation, which I guess I wasn't, because I didn't ever consider what he was afraid of.  And uh —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) Was that because he didn't say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, he never said that.  He said, "Oh, I think I've had a stroke."  But it didn't seem to me he did, or uhm, (Sigh) I know if he'd had a stroke at that point, whatever had happened was over.  And he looked fine, and h, he was doing a lot of moving of his arm and hand.  It's just he could not turn it quite, in certain directions.  And uhm, but he never said anything about a blood clot. </p>

<p>And, but anyway, I was trying to be sympathetic, and, and do what he wanted me to do.  But he got very angry at me, and uhm, and then also, I was trying to be calm because FSO was quite upset at having come home the way she had.  Because clearly, he had communicated to her something.  And uh, so anyway, then I began to feel very guilty, that MSCZ's overreacting.  Because I never thought anything but that he was overreacting.  And that maybe he really had some fear.  I didn't dream it was what it was, but uhm, but that it was just fear.  And so I didn't say anything about, well MSCZ, don't be ridiculous, of course you haven't, because I don't really know.  And anyway, I kept thinking, well, he's having this overreaction, because I've been uhm, well because he n—, he has an emotional need to, because I've been, I don't know how to put it, except such a drag on him, I think was the way I was thinking of it.  So I think I, I've kept feeling that I was responsible for his terrific reaction. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, there's a clue for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Laughs) I don't see it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Your question was, "What's going on behind the door?  And how much did you know?"  So you end up feeling you're responsible for this man's tremendous overreaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause, Sigh) Well, that makes me remember when my father would start screaming if well, I — because I never was too concerned about what he did with others — came in if he were undressing.  (Pause)  And I think I also imm—, I'm denying it all now, so I don't know, I guess I have to go under my immediate reaction to what you said just now.  But uhm, because, because the other part of reacting immediately, when I was thinking, well, thinking about my parents behind the closed door, it must be, the man must be my father, really. </p>

<p>And the only overreaction I could think of, was when I would come in, and he was not clothed in the way he wanted to be for me to see him.  And uhm, so then I think I thought, well why would I feel responsible for that.  Except then I, the only thing I thought immediately was, because somehow he would assume I knew something I didn't really know.  Or that I at least was pretending I didn't.  Anyway, his o, overreaction was to my knowledge, and uhm, now I'm thinking, well, I didn't know anything, or how could that be, or I don't know, I'm sort of backing away from it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How would he overreact?  What would he say?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, I'm not sure I'm remembering, except I think of him as just shouting and saying, "Don't come in!  Don't come in!"  And, "Shut the door!"  Or uhm, (Pause) I just thought of something else that (Laughs) uhm, I, I don't think I've even really thought of it this way.  But uhm, I mean, I had thought of it to some extent.  But I never thought I might really be doing it on purpose, to tease him.  Uhm, or had before.  But mm, my father being so modest, obviously then, one of my thoughts might be, well maybe I should be not letting him see me, at all.  And uhm, so then it almost was as if I would purposely let him see me, not nude, but in my underwear. </p>

<p>And uh, i—, there was one period where — now it kind of, I'm surprised that I would ever even think it would be a proper thing to do, but at the time, I must have been doing it to tease him — I kept trying to come to d—, (Laughs) how are you going to understand this?  I used to try to come to the dinner table in my slip (Laughs).  And it made perfect sense to me then, because I would take off my clothes when I came home, you know, just to be more comfortable.  And I'd be studying, and I could have put on a house coat, but I wouldn't.  And knowing my father's reaction, I can't even believe I would go down, try to come to dinner in my slip.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   How old were you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, I must have been in high school.  Well, I don't kn—,</p>

<p>ANALYST:   (Interrupting) You can't, you can't believe it, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, that's the point.  See, that's exactly the kind of trick you're playing.  You have to be stupid about it, you have to not know it.  But now you just remember doing something that's unbelievable.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause)  And I'm also immediately thinking I'm remembering it wrong, too.  (Pause) I don't know, there's something I'm, I'm having trouble with here, because uhm, because I definitely am having, I definitely thought I remembered exactly what I said.  I'm not sure of the age, I might have been a bit younger.  But in any case, I was old enough to know what I was doing, and, and yet as soon as I said it — or maybe it was after what you said, I'm not sure which, maybe I would have done this anyway — within a minute or two of saying it, I've started retracting it.  And that I just can't believe I would be doing something so obviously wrong, especially considering my family. </p>

<p>And, then I think, well I wouldn't, I can't believe I would start denying it, and not remember it, or not be able to believe it, if it uhm, were just to tease my father.  And so I must, there must be more to it than I'm seeing, or admitting.  Or uhm, I might not like to think about the fact that I would try to tease my father in that way, but I can't, I don't know, I just don't think then I would start denying it, if once I thought of it, in that vein.  (Mumbled)</p>

<p>Because, I'm not, I'm not denying that I used to let my father see me in my underwear and think it was kind of amusing because it would upset him.  And I didn't parade in front of him.  But if the situation were such that there I was, and uhm, I could have said, "Don't come in, yet," or I could have quickly covered myself up, I wouldn't.  And uhm, and I, in other words, I was doing the exact opposite that he would do.  And I don't have trouble remembering that.  But this coming to the table in my slip, I do.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and then I think, well maybe it had some—, maybe I'd understand this, there must be something I'm not thinking of, how coming to the table in my slip was significant.  Or, I don't know, something I'm —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What do you think it signifies?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Sigh) Well, all I can keep thinking is, it's unbelievable I would do it, because it just was so totally wrong, and obviously I knew it.  And therefore I was, I don't know what word, a bad girl, or uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But what do you think it signifies?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   You mean, my actual doing it?</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What would you be wanting to, what do you, what would you be up to?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   MM. </p>

<p>ANALYST:   Now, you see how you're having to be stupid, right now?  I mean, it's perfectly obvious.  Nothing could be more obvious.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, it isn't to me.  (Laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And that's right. And it's not the kind of thought you haven't had before.  I mean, you would be aware, I'm certain, if you had the idea of coming in here, and lying down on the couch in your slip.  It wouldn't take you 2 seconds to know what you meant by that, would it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Right.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   So.  You see, having to play stupid.  I use that phrase because that was your phrase.  And that's what you were doing that night.  At the BFM's, with MW.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   (Pause) Well, uhm, I just can't accept that that would be, s—, it would be the same significance if I came in here with a slip on, or if I, it, going to the dinner table where all the whole family is.  Uhm, except then I, I mea—, I keep wanting to think of it, I guess, as it was just to annoy my father.  But then I know, I can remember other things better than I can think about that.  So it must be more than that.  And then I just uhm, can't accept what you just suggested.  (Pause, Sigh)</p>

<p>But then, sort of in that, uhm, I don't know, I guess, it sort of implies, well maybe I am partially accepting it, or something.  But I think of well, reacting the way I did at the BFM's, what, in that situation would have caused such a strong reaction that uhm, MW shouting, that might be reminiscent of my father in a way.  Well, I don't know, I just uh, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But shouting when you did things that he thought were stupid was sort of ordinary, wasn't it?  That's regularly what happened, isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   I mean, at least you've told me many —</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Yeah, except that I started the evening, it seemed to me, or at least —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   No, I don't mean MW, I mean your father.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   No, I know it.  But then, I'm thinking back to that evening, and how I, I'd sort of already made up my mind when bridge was to be played, that I was going to play stupid.  Because of, well I suppose, I knew MW reacts that way.  So, uhm, (Sigh) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And if you went to the table with your slip, you would have every reason to believe that your father would object, and shout at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Umhmm.  Yeah, well, that's what I keep thinking is the only reason I did it, so he would shout at me.  But then I think, well, then I'd be able to —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, the question is, what does that mean, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Well, so then that makes me think back to uhm, (Sigh) the feeling of responsibility I had with MSCZ yesterday, and your suggesting that it's connected with other feelings of responsibility.  And I'm having trouble with that.  And uhm, (Sigh) I mean, if I felt responsible for something, and guilty, then I suppose one way that I could feel I was being punished, and therefore, I wouldn't have to feel so guilty, is to do something so that my father would shout at me. </p>

<p>And uhm, (Sniff, Sigh) well then, then I think, except somehow, it doesn't seem to fit in, because of the way I was thinking about MSCZ.  Uhm, but I can imagine feeling guilty uhm, at the thought I wanted it to be me in there with my father, and not my mother.  And then assuming he knew it.  And that might be why he, whenever I came in c—, across him when he was undressed, would start shouting at me to go away.  Because it was almost as if I were about to attack him.  Because I was wishing it were me, and not my mother.  But uhm, well I guess, I sort of did answer my own question about it.  Because that would cause his overreaction, and in an entirely different way, I feel as if I caused MSCZ's.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, and so then it seems like I went, wanting MW to shout at me.  And I don't, I can't, still, fit it in.  Uhm, — (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.  
??</p>

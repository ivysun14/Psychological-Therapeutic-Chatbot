<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, we're going to ignore it, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, to start off with, I have high blood pressure, as you know, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, every time I go see [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other day I thought I heard [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s name in there but my blood pressure goes sky high.  Okay, the thing, what it is, I hate the public.  Every time I'm around the public, my blood pressure goes up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You get angry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I get very angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it every single time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every single time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were just over at [DEIDENTIFIED] before you came here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was it there, how'd you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We were laughing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you weren't angry with anybody?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I was calling people schmetty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The service was okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were out in public, you were at a restaurant?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was okay, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then we went to Wal—Mart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We couldn't find what we were looking for, either one of us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that Wal—Mart sucks but I was talking to my nurse about this and she said you see a psychiatrist, I said yeah, I see him, so she said, mention it to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm mentioning it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well with being angry in public or with the public, is there any theme, is there anything that happens because it's not every, in every situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's when I'm there at the doctor's office, right, all these people come in for no good reason and all that, it really gets me upset.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You mean the other people in the waiting room?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They come in there for stupid things, I swear, it gets my blood pressure boiling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then when it's time for me to go in, my blood pressure is already boiling, so it goes up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, but whey does what they're coming in for to the doctor's office get you angry?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I just can't, to me I don't, I just can't face the public anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to be a damn loner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If they're in the waiting room there and they're waiting for their appointment, does it effect when you get seen, for example, or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's like, the clinic is more like you sign in and they take people in order of who comes in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, they used to do that, now they take them by appointment time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay, are they usually pretty good on their appointment time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, if the doctor's in or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it may not be the other people in the waiting room that makes the difference to coming into the appointment, it's just having to sit with them?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I have these two idiot friends, they'll call me up and tell me their stupid f'ing problems, okay, like I'm a goddamn psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you say anything to them about it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been listening to their problems for years; one, ten years, the other one, twenty years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has it bothered you all those years?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does because they never think of anybody but themselves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they don't listen to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he could attest to that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They don't listen when you're having problems or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, yesterday he says why don't you start, you're too damn quiet, why don't you start talking a little bit, let out your frustrations.  I thought to myself, if let my frustrations out, brother you're going to hear me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it sounds like your friends have an outlet and you haven't had the same kind of outlet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're able to talk with you about their problems and they talk and talk and talk but then if you're feeling something, you can't share it with them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I remember one time I was feeling something and he changed the subject and started talking about something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm saying to myself, what, I hear your fucking problems, why don't you hear mine.  They both do the same thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I guess one approaches looking at the people in your life that you can talk to, you know, if they're ones that you can't then—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can talked to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He'll listen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so I mean you have maybe different outlets than them, you know, it sounds like they don't have a reciprocal friendship with you, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what you would call it, what would you call it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know but if that was me, I would get my [INAUDIBLE] and I wouldn't give it to them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why do you stay friends with them?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I keep telling him, he don't want to listen to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well it's been ten and twenty years, I mean obviously they've been a part of your life for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But with each of them, why would you maintain a relationship, what do you get out of the relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean if they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then he wants to know why I don't come and see him.  I don't come and see nobody doc.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but if he's sitting there and telling you his problems, how does it feel when you're listening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?  Say that again?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you like to listen to their problems at some level?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anymore, right now it's just getting to a point, it's the same shit over and over again, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean it sounds like you're frustrated with them now but listening for ten years, it sounds like you're getting something out of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he keeps talking about the same thing, his job, the girls he's screwed, his girlfriend, he's nothing but a worry wart, he never thinks positive of himself.  I told him to go see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He don't want to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I should be charging him fifty dollars an hour.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did tell him once and he changed the subject and the other one, the only thing she talks about is her kids and the same thing, who she's screwing tonight and her kids are screaming at the top of their lungs and she's screaming to shut the F up to them.  She ain't a mother, she's a mother fucker.  She ain't a good mother to them.  When do you tell a kid to shut the F up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean it sounds like they both of issues.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they both have problems, they need to see a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And neither of them are there and open to listening to what's happening with you, so that's what I mean by reciprocal friendship, that you're providing something for them and it's not necessarily equal, you know, you're an open ear to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, so was my mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They were friends of your moms too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'm saying my mother had an open ear too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Got it, okay, so you are like your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but that's not always a bad thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it ain't but I'm just, everybody has problems though doc.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, but you know everyone has problems and everyone has people in their lives, part of it is knowing which people in your life you can trust to talk about your problems with.  Obviously, they trust you and maybe they trust you because you don't, you listen and they don't necessarily expect—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they say [PATIENT NAME], what do you want me to do?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you've been an open ear to them, you know, not—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just saying, they can't talk about anything else but, that's all that's on their stupid mind, I'm getting tired of it, I told them about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he still brings it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean until you're feeling better, I would avoid making the phone calls to them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They call me.  One, I can't call anyway, she's long distance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She lives up in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Caller ID.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have caller ID.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have an answering machine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have, let's see, right now, roses are red, violets are blue, drop dead twice and go to hell too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On your answering machine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ask him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's very welcoming.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other day I had roses are red, violets are blue, go fuck yourself and go to hell too because I was getting harassing phone calls so I put that on there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well if you screen—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, it's just, if anybody hears it, sometimes they'll crack up laughing at it or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm sure the people that know you, know that's like your sense of humor.  People that don't know you might wonder.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, this son of a bitch, I swear, was trying to sell me a washer and dryer Saturday and he kept it up and he kept it up.  I had to unplug my phone Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  Trying to deliver a washer and dryer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he was trying to sell me a washer and dryer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a little odd.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I told him not to answer his phone but he don't listen to me, so that's why he [INAUDIBLE] the other one, he answered his phone all the time, every they called.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I told him, don't answer the phone, let the machine get it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let the machine get it and listen and then pick it up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I told him, he don't want to listen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you can answer it, you don't have to let the machine—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If it's your sister or something, then they'll say something on the machine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know she does.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He ain't going to listen, I told him this before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It don't do any good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What was it, Saturday I put the phone done and what was it, she was calling my name because I was having a coughing spell and she finally hung up which was funny.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, screening calls might help but, you know, if your blood pressure is up, it may not be just anger or frustration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm lightheaded and dizzy too and that's because of my blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lightheaded, after you take medication for it maybe?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It lowers your blood pressure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, it don't lower it.  Tomorrow I'm supposed to go get an MRI of the brain.  Thursday I'm supposed to go get a stress test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, what's the MRI of the brain for?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lightheadedness and dizziness.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Up at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well the stress test will be helpful too but, you know, I'm sure they're probably going to suggest what we've talked about before, just watching your weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know, here's another one.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah, bring it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you know, if I didn't care, I wouldn't be bringing it up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hey doc, how's my weight, give me your honest opinion?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it up too?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I weigh 250.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What'd you weigh six months ago?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	About 250.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's about the same.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Six months ago till now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Up or down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess about 50 pounds up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, in six months?  I mean if you're normally and have been at a particular weight for a while, then it may not be as bad but I know you gained some weight during this time—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'm sure your blood pressure goes up because of that too.  Even myself, if like, you know, this January I weighed more than I ever had and my blood pressure was up and I ended up going on Weight Watchers and lost like 25 pounds.  My blood pressure is down, I don't have to take anything for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How in God's name does it work on Weight Watchers?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, that just works for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it works for my doctor too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or whatever her name is.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, is that the resident over with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's a stickler about weight, she hates fat people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She hates fat people, I don't know if that's the case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it finally dawned on me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She said that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every time I see her, if it's a month or eight weeks or whatever, when I see her she jumps down on my throat about weight, I don't care when it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well maybe that's not [INAUDIBLE].  I'm obviously not going to jump down your throat on weight, I'm just bringing it up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You do and I'll jump right back down on you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I only bring it up because you're talking about your blood pressure going up and I imagine when you go for the stress test, you're probably going to have the cardiologist saying the same thing too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well they think they're some kind of blockage in there.  If there is, then I would have to get operated on for a bypass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or maybe a stent?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Catheterization.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, catheterization, one or the other, a bypass or that.  What's a catheterization anyway?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Catheterization is when they put a tube, like a small tube up through the vein in the leg and they go up to the heart, they inject dye and then they take pictures and they look at how the blood flows.  You know, you're heart is a muscle and it has veins in it and arteries—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know your heart is a muscle.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they inject the dye and they look at which arteries are flowing normally and once ones are—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which ones are clotting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they can see if there's actually a blockage and then sometimes they can even introduce, through the same way that they put the dye in—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little catheter up and they put a little stent in which is like a little piece of hose that keeps it open, you know, that like will open up the part where there's a blockage and then it keeps it open.  If they do a bypass, they go in and they actually take a vein and they bypass where the blockage is, you know, the take a vein from here to here and create a new pathway for the blood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's was a bypass is, it's bypassing the blockage but a stent means if it's narrowed and they can put something into that hole to open it up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then that's what a stent does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well, we'll find out after Friday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you'll get the stress test first and then they'll make a decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well I don't have to take the treadmill one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll probably do Persantine, they'll inject—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is a Persantine stress test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They'll be able to see that and my guess is if they see any, that just looks at a picture of the heart and how it uses oxygen and energy, in a sense—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you start exercising or when it's stressed.  If they see any areas of what they call ischemia or low blood flow, then they'll probably suggest a catheterization but the stress test is the first and sometimes they do an ultrasound too, like an echocardiogram.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I already an echocardiogram done last month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's the first thing; stress test and then depending on what those two things show, then they make a decision.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I had an echocardiogram done last month so I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but the heart center up at [DEIDENTIFIED] is relatively, I guess you know that they've just renovated the whole area up there and it's very nice.  They have good people up there and the cath lab is very good.  You're in good hands if you're having everything done up there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The stress test is being done at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they don't do it, they don't have a catheterization lab at [DEIDENTIFIED], just [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, in other words, I would have to go up there then, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For the catheterization part but they're used to doing tests at that division for this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well right now it's just a stress test, then from there—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean how are you feeling about all these tests though too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to find out what the problem is, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But do you think that might be what's getting under your skin more, like the worry about that that's making it harder to listen to your friends, for example, about their maybe trivial problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When they're talking about their trivial problems over and over again and you're going through all this heart testing—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I can imagine that would be very frustrating and you'd want to strangle them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to pull them through the phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they say why you so quiet, they said you never was this quiet before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Besides, he's a bragger too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I imagine the two of them have never had health issues either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because all the sex he has and I didn't get any, big deal.  I know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he hasn't had the illnesses.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's never been sick?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He had a couple diseases already on him, his privates.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	See I don't have to go through that, he does, so I told him not to do it if he don't want to do it, I told him don't answer the phone, that's all and I'll take care of everything, that's what you got the answering machine for.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If they don't want to leave a message, then the hell with them.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He say that now, he ain't going to listen, he's going to do the same thing again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pick up the phone?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well maybe it's more of the idea that you're like your mom, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's not a bad thing, if you know what I mean.  Whatever decision you make, it comes with a—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If your waiting for a doctor, they'll leave a message, you know that, if the doctor calls.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They'll leave a message.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I would just say see how you feel.  If it's really, like you're really stressed out, then listen to our advice, let the answering machine get it.  If you're kind of just feeling okay, it's not a horrible day—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You don't even [INAUDIBLE], you get me to talk to on the phone, what do you need them for, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Obviously, when you're out getting the test, the machine is going to get any phone calls.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When you're out, even now, the machine is getting phone calls, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, big deal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, that's all you got to do, pretend you're out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretend like you're at an appointment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let the machine get it, let it do its work.  Are you getting any sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Barely.  I was up like about three or four o'clock this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have samples of the Cymbalta, obviously.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I need a new prescription for it anyway too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Another one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I think there's probably like six weeks worth in there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's only seven in it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, I think there's six boxes there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hey doc, I found a psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh you did, who?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED], Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She, I can't say her name but she's a lady, a Russian lady, a Russian psychiatrist.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A Russian Jew.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's the therapist there?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER], do you know [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  There was a [NAME OTHER] that used to work there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you probably just have only met with her once or twice, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it's been more than that.  The psychiatrist I only met once.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But [NAME OTHER] I've been seeing once a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The physical, I mean the therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you both go or just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, he does.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I come here to see you but he don't come to see mine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How come you don't have no therapy?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's not fair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why we don't have therapists in our group?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because we're a group of psychiatrists that do mostly medication visits, you know, we work in the hospitals like [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we're not outpatient, it's not an outpatient clinic or an outpatient group per se.  The majority of my time, I'm in the hospital.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, in [DEIDENTIFIED] more so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep, because I have a unit up there that I run.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think your old office is a podiatrist now in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It used to have a whole bunch of people down there [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well they just put [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in there now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], yeah, I saw has some office in their hallway down there too, the GI doctor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I have to see him the [DATE] again for my hernia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's a renewal for the Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think it for the other too, I think I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ambien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ambien, okay, and they won't cover Ambien CR, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, you told me that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As long as the Cymbalta [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they give you problems with that too, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's that, oh yeah, if it's more than 60 mg then it's twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the Ambien, are they giving you the generic?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cymbalta they're giving the regular.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they don't have, there's no generic for Cymbalta yet but Ambien just had a generic in the last year or so.  Help yourself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What is it, Hershey kisses?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Want one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not great for a diet but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go to hell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, I have them in there so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well maybe—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is [NAME OTHER] here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, she's off today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.  I asked [NAME OTHER] if she was going to be in today, she told me yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that like more than a week or two ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, I think she, I don't think it was something that, I think it was [INAUDIBLE].  She was here this morning and she'll be in tomorrow though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said they both need a vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They both need a vacation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think they said something, [NAME OTHER] had one not too long ago.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, next visit, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll be in June.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You sat on my stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He sat on my stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh geez, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll be in June, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's coming up here, pretty close.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Four weeks is the [DATE], we've been doing like six though, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess.  Well I counted for six, it's the [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's it, that's what I count too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I counted it this morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you kind of anticipated it, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's wide open, two o'clock?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think, I can turn around, I already know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just what we do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I already know if I turn around and look.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Let's see, we go in [DEIDENTIFIED] and we ask them if they have all these [NAME OTHER] movies.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that's why we need a TV guide—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Weekly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thanks for this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi. Sorry I'm late.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So . . everything's going good. Sunday was my Easter and we had everybody over and it was fine. My uncle, my aunt, my cousins - they came over after work at the restaurant, and my cousins were pretty cool about it. They don't mention what's going on. They don't mention anything about work, you know? And they just let it go. And then my uncle comes in and goes, "What's the matter? You don't want to come see us anymore?" This, that, and the other thing. He just doesn't understand why I'm not there. Since I've quit I've felt so much better. I don't have the anger issues there. I don't have the anxiety issues there. I just don't have all this other drama and stress in my life when I'm not there. It irritates me to the point where it's like everybody else sees it but him. [00:09:08]</p>

<p>It's just to the point where I do know in my heart and I can see it is that they're hurting for employees, because my sister worked all day Saturday and she worked all day Monday because they just don't have the employees. I'm friends with a lot of the employees that are there and I see on Facebook they're all on vacation; and then they come over and tell us how busy they are and how this is going on and that's going on. Part of me the emotion side kicks in again. (inaudible at 00:09:46) I mean I could go help them if I wanted, but the other part, the brain, says think about how much better you are, how much better physically you're doing, mentally you're doing, when you don't have that in your life. It's a constant battle because even my uncle is like "You need to come visit. You need to come do this. You need to come do that." When I'm away from there I'm fine. It's when I go there, even as a customer, it irritates me just knowing what goes on. [00:10:21]</p>

<p>Another thing that pissed me off about the business is that they have new employees; and I didn't like the fact that my cousin, who is in charge of the Facebook account, posted something kind of hurtful about one of their employees online - how they thought feta cheese was fettuccini and this, that and the other thing. They just don't understand the menu. You've got to understand they're a kid. They're not going to know it right away and I thought it was very unprofessional for them to post that on Facebook; but I don't want to tell them how to run their business. I don't want to get involved in that aspect, but to me I thought that was very classless - to put that on Facebook and embarrass her and all their "fans" and all that are commenting on it, laughing, having a good time. Well I'll tell you what, right now, if that's my kid and I found out who posts that, I'm coming after you with a lawsuit, you know? There are things you keep private and there are things you go public with. [00:11:26] That has nothing to do with the business, and when people see that you're criticizing your employees in a public way, I'm really embarrassed. I'm embarrassed, but I'm also happy in a way because now the whole world on Facebook sees how they treat their employees because of one comment, because of what they're doing. To me it's very bothersome because there is this emotional attachment to it but, like I keep saying, the brain and my body is just reacting in such a more positive way when I'm not there and I'm not associated with hit - to the point where it is what it is. Yeah, I'm upset I don't have any income coming in; yeah, I'm upset all this happened and went down but, again, this is the first time in years that we've broken apart civilly. [00:12:33]</p>

<p>I'm just stuck in a crossroads. How do I sit down and approach them and tell them this is it - this is the end? Because when we left it yeah, the door was open a little bit. There was a chance of me going back there - there was; but now the more and more that I'm away from it the more and more I don't want to be there. The more and more happier and more and more my body's reacting to the positiveness of not being there. I eventually want to just close that door and lock it up and never go back there again. I want nothing to do with it. That's there choice. That's there business. It's the line of work that they chose to do, but I don't want to be associated with it. [00:13:21] In my mind, I know my uncle has contacting me and coming on me because he's already getting it from the boys that they want their time off. And now they don't have me, the filler, to work the hours that they want off, you know? It's starting to wear down on all of them and they're only a month into the season. They've still got four more months - four or five months - left, so for me it bothers me in that way but in essence I'm like, well, this is what you chose. You could hire more people. You could hire new people. You don't want to piss off the people that you have, but you've already pissed off the people that are leaving you and you can't keep people because the dictatorship from non-management is brainwash stuff. They're too into it. [00:14:21] I want to tell them my opinions of it. I want to tell them how I'd run the business, but they can do what they want to do. It's their business. The other part is I saw my aunt coming over and she's on crutches because she's damaged her body so bad from working so much - the doctor told her not to - that she's having surgery next week. She can't understand the fact that she's going to be out the rest of the season because she needs to heal. For two people who are in their seventies, they shouldn't be working 18-hour days. [00:14:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're in their seventies?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, my uncle is 71. My aunt is going to turn 71. So what does that tell you right there? They shouldn't be doing the physical labor putting that kind of strain on their body. They can't recover any more; and to do it every day for six months doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. In my mind I thought they were trying to groom me to take over the business and run it to the best of my ability; but the more and more I look at it, the more and more they're not. [00:15:36] I say this to my girlfriend and I say this to my brothers and sisters all the time, if they came and asked us if we wanted the The restaurant I'd decline it. I'd honestly decline it right now because I know that's not the lifestyle I want to live - because I know if I do ever rent it out from them I'll still never have the final say. I'll still never be able to run that business the way that I want to run it. So, in essence, I'd rather they just keep it, run it til as long as their lives go out for it, and then sell it, because I don't want anything to do with it. It's their problem. I don't care about the money. I don't care about the product. I don't care; and I can confidently say that right now. Five years ago that was the life I wanted. That was what I wanted. Today, in this moment, in this time, I don't want it. [00:16:35]</p>

<p>I just have so much anger towards that place. I have so much emotional bad memories there & so much stress it's caused me that I don't want it. I tell you right now that if anything happened to my aunt and uncle and my two cousins and they left it to me, the first thing I would do is sell it. I would take my money and run because I know how chaotic it is. I know what a disaster it is. Or if they left it to me I'd either sell it or I'd knock it down and try to sell the land. I know that's difficult for me and this is the problem that I have - that when I do have my anger issues and I do have my problems with something, I take it to the extreme. I take it to the next level where - you know something? The only way to get it out of my life is to eliminate it. And I have this conversation. I won't even go back there as a customer just because there are two different people. There are the people that I grew up with, that I wanted to hang out with, that I enjoyed hanging out with; and then there are the monsters that came with the purchase of theThe restaurant. [00:17:52]</p>

<p>It's tough because people talk about it all the time and they don't know that I'm family related and they just criticize them and criticize them and then I drop the ball on them. I go, "Yeah, that's my aunt," and then they take everything back. But I tell them, "you're fine. I used to work for them. I know how you feel. I know how he treats you. I've seen it all." I'm emotionally blank to it, you know? People criticized them before and I would be the first one to defend them and do all this stuff - and the next thing you know they're doing all this crap to me and I don't even defend them. I'm actually agreeing with the other people. [00:18:36] For me coming from my family background - how close family was, inner family, - to criticize your family it makes me feel bad, but I don't. I don't feel bad at all because I want people to understand how the business operates. This is what it's come down to and it sucks. [00:19:07]</p>

<p>Going back to that Facebook thing, last year, when I was on Facebook and somebody commented why you don't have sprinkles, I commented back, "It's not about sprinkles at The restaurant, it's about the expense in doing all this stuff." My cousin absolutely blasted me: "You're an employee at The restaurant. You shouldn't be doing all this stuff. You shouldn't be doing that stuff on Facebook." And that really hurt me because I didn't say anything back, I defended you. I didn't think it was bad and absolutely blasted me. I said to her, "How do people know that I'm an employee at The restaurant on Facebook? They don't know what I look like. I have all my stuff blocked. You can't see my space on Facebook. How do they know what's going on?" [00:20:06] And then here we are one year later, they're posting garbage about their employees on Facebook. Where's the line there? I'm defending you. I'm not attacking anybody. I'm just telling people about the experience and what good qualities The restaurant has and here you are blasting your employees, you know? There's a give and take there and I know it's going bad when my aunt and my uncle work and my cousin. But my other cousin, who has a full-time job in the corporate world, wants nothing to do with the restaurant. It's too stressful. She can't handle it, and it's all that. But when she's working every weekend now and I know she hates it, (snickers) you know their struggling for help because no matter what she doesn't want to work there. She wants nothing to do with that place. She'll take in her piece of the pie, but she wants nothing to do with it. She's already made that clear. [00:21:11] And yet, in the month that they've been open, she's working every weekend, which tells me that they don't have the staff that they once thought they had. And the regular staff that they have is all getting older and they're not going to last much longer. It's to the point where I was really upset this weekend because my uncle just can't let it go. My aunt, my cousins, they don't bother me with it. They let me be. They give me my space. They kind of understand a little bit what's going on and I think they realize it's for the best that I don't work there. For him, I think it's an image thing where before he was happy to have all his nieces and nephews working for him and doing all this stuff and brag - and now he has nobody.</p>

<p>I think when he's outside of the restaurant he realizes it doesn't look good for his image if his family was all working there and now they're not. I think in the back of my head - this is just me speculating - I think that's what he's looking for. I have been a very popular face in the restaurant for twelve years because of all the people I know; because of all the relationships I've gained and all of that stuff. I just don't think they like the fact anymore because people are always asking for me. People are leaving notes when he comes in, "Can you give this to him?" They say "hi" to me. [00:22:58] To me I think that bothers people a lot. It bothers them a lot. I do know a lot of people. I am a noticeable person and when I'm not there, when I'm always working on my free time, people start looking at it. And now at the store is getting out of how they've treated me and how they treat their employees, people see the light in a different way. It does bother me to talk negative about them. It does bother me to criticize them because they are family. They are blood and all this, but in the other way I want people to know what's going on. In a way I want them to know that what they're doing is wrong. I want them to know whatever they're doing - they can do whatever they want - but I'm just waiting for the big bomb to drop on them. No matter however hard they work to get it, it can be taken from them just like that (snaps fingers) and to me I don't think they understand that. It's chaotic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what would happen after the bomb drops? [00:24:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I have this conversation with my sister and my girlfriend all the time. They put all this energy and pride in keeping Peter and his brothers happy, but I do tell them if the The restaurant ever burned down or something ever happened where the restaurant was taken away from them I want to ask them, "Do you think those three would be there behind your back? Do you think they would really defend you and help you rebuild and help you get going again?" and the answer is "no". They all have families to support. They all need money. They would kick them to the curb and move on in a heartbeat. The reason they stay there now is because they're comfortable and they dictate what goes on. As soon as you take away that dictatorship in the back and you start cutting their hours, they'll move on. They'll survive. [00:25:35] They'll find a way to survive. Why would they do it now? Not for nothing. All three of them were illegals. All three married American girls. All three got their citizenship through marriage. They're not educated. This is their full-time job. This is what they do. You know something? I can control what their destiny is. My aunt and uncle think they depend on them. They don't' understand how much those boys depend on them. That's why those boys put everybody against them and pit my aunt and uncle against everybody else - because then they have the control. You go in there; you eliminate those three; you eliminate that control; there's nothing they can do. The way they were treating me with my hours and shifts, you put those boys on that for a whole season like I did, they wouldn't last a month. They'd quit. I didn't say anything because I had school and I appreciate all that but if you put them on that regular shifts, "I only need you 4:00 to 8:30. I don't need you in the morning. I'm going to change it. I'm going to do all the prep myself. Why don't you come in at 11:00? If you cut those four hours out of their paycheck, there's hell to pay. And that's slowly what I would do. [00:27:08]</p>

<p>That's what aunt and uncle and my cousin need to realize. Everybody is replaceable. The problem is they want to keep what's been working for twelve years. Unfortunately, you're getting older. You can't do what you could do. Your reputation's getting out there of you abusing your staff. You've just publicly abused your staff online and now it's all starting to make sense to people. They'll still get the regulars there that want nothing to do with it but the other kids that have had bad experiences - and I know people who have had bad experiences - they're like me. They don't go back. They don't care. The new people come. Fine. But once they have that bad experience they don't go back. I say this on a regular basis - if it weren't for the regulars they wouldn't have a business. They do have a lot of regulars but they're not bringing in anybody else new from the outside and it bothers me. Talking about this now I still get irritated because I want to move on from it. I want my personal relationship with my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, to start healing, to start moving in the other direction. The only way I can do that is not work there. Like I mentioned earlier, my only struggle is closing the business relationship. How do I kill that? How do I approach that and just squash it? That's ultimately what I want to do. I want to do it that year and I want to just shut the door completely. But I don't know how and I don't know when and I don't know the reaction. I don't want to get pissed off. I don't want to do it. I don't know if they have time, but ultimately I'd like to sit with them and tell them I'm not coming back. This is it. For my own health and for my own sanity - I don't want to bring in that - but for my own health and for my own reasons I want to let them know that the business relationship is over. To me, personally, I think that will affect our personal relationship. [00:29:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you take the business relationship very personally so, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, both sides do. And that's kind of why when I first left I left the door open, but I don't even want it open. I don't even want to smell what's going in that road. I don't want to be there. For me, I guess I'm scared to take the final step to shut the door. I think the emotional part will just be too much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what is that emotional part?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) The failure. The letdown. The not being there behind family to have their back and to be there for them. They say blood is thicker than water. You know something? In this part, my blood's very thin right now and my emotions and my body have been pushed to the limits. My mental capacity, my mental state has been pushed to the limit where I have no more to give to that place. [00:31:12] I have no more to give to my aunt and uncle and my cousins at the restaurant. I had it; I lost it. Ever since the overdose I've never really felt that emotion that we had before. I think after the overdose and finding out what was going on I don't think either side really got over the hurt that occurred. No matter how much I say, "I'm sorry," and how much they think it's fine and they want to move on, it's not. It's not. With their schedule I can't sit down and talk to them and do all this stuff. The only thing I can do is heal myself. And I think I want, personally, I want that closure that they have forgiven me for the past. They have moved on. It hasn't bothered them. I understand it bothers them. I understand it does this, it does that; but it's been seven years since it happened and we're still at the same place where there's still a trust issue with me. [00:32:45] I can fully understand that but, after seven years if I haven't given you a reason not to trust me and I've been clean for the most part, it's tough.</p>

<p>I will say that since I quit working there my cravings and my urgings to turn to drugs, to turn to tobacco, to turn to alcohol, they've all subsided. I don't have that thought where I'm feeling so down that I need that comfort of the drugs, of the tobacco, of the booze. I think for me that's a real relief where I'm not depending on that to put my body at ease, to put my body in a place where nothing matters. My body's just been through so much and I can constantly feel it changing the more and more positive I put into it. My anxiety level since I left has gone down. My stress level has gone down in a different way, where I'm not worrying about work and worrying about getting yelled at. It's getting more stress to the point where I'll be finishing school in a month. I'm just preparing myself and getting all my stuff completed before I graduate, and that to me is a good stress because I've put in the work. I've done the time, and now I'm ready to move on with my life and start my new career and start my new journey. [00:34:44] I can't say enough how good I feel when I'm not there, but then I still feel that when I don't work there and I don't do this, there is a resentment between my aunt and my uncle and my cousins. I kind of feel there is a resentment. There is still a lot of tension just because of the hardship that we've had and the problems that we've had. I don't think it's been a long enough time to heal them but I also don't think there's been any work done to heal them. That's just the reality of it. The reality is they say "time heals everything". I don't know if I'm going to have enough time to be healed from all the mental beatings and all the emotional beatings that I took to help benefit them. I did have this conversation with my girlfriend where I was seriously considering going back because I had a job and I was figuring out what I was going to do. [00:36:12] She told me, "They will 'yes' you to death to get you there and then we'll go through the same garbage again. They will do whatever you want, you can tell them when you want to work, when you want to do this, what hours, where you want to work - this, that and the other thing - and they will 'yes' you to death. They'll do it for a week. Then after that week, she said, they'll slowly start getting back into their old ways. They'll slowly start weeding you out again. They'll start pissing you off and it's just going to be in a bad place." I understand that. I do understand that now because I know in the back of my mind the dictator in the back of the kitchen will work it. He's wanted me out of there for a while. That's just my personal feeling. I think he thinks he's going to take over the restaurant and run it, when I don't know how you can take over a restaurant when you don't even direct the customers. You don't know how to scoop the ice cream. You don't know how to work the cash register. You don't know how to make change and you're going to run a business? [00:37:30] An uneducated person like that is going to run a business? Someone who runs people out of their business is going to make all the decisions? Good luck to you. I want them to have that failure experience. I want them to experience the failure and experience all the bad times I've felt for the last twelve years. I don't want to give them the satisfaction either of going back and them saying, "We helped you out. We gave you a job. When you needed us we were there for you." Blah, blah, blah. I don't want that anymore. I don't want to give them that satisfaction. I was down in the dumps. I was on hard times. I was unemployed and there was a job waiting right there and "We had a job for Jordan." I don't want it. I don't want it. (snickers) You could make me a part owner tomorrow and I wouldn't take it. That's how much I've been affected by this place. That's how much emotional attachment has been into this place. [00:38:50] That's why it's so hard to finally close the door shut. I don't know when the right time is, where the right time is, and how to approach it because no matter what, when I drop the bomb, there's no chance of me coming back. They're going to get very defensive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you need them for money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did, but in the last couple of weeks with the support of my mom and my dad and my girlfriend and my brothers and my sisters, I realized I don't. Do I want the money? Yes. Do I need the money? No. I'm willing to sacrifice doing what I can for my own health, for my own sanity, for me to be happy. To me I've slowly come to the realization that life's not about the money. Life's about enjoying what you do. To be honest, I enjoy working with students. I enjoy working with kids. I enjoy the atmosphere at school. Granted it's stressful, but it's a different stress level. [00:40:09] Everything I do is to help benefit them, to help benefit the kids; and as I've mentioned before I do like helping people. They don't necessarily depend on me in school, my students, but they do look up to me. They do value what I have to offer them for insight and that gives me the emotional high and the positive energy I've been looking for for almost 30 years. It's a hard thing to find because all I know is the restaurant. All I know is negativeness inside the corporate world. Granted, I've been in the school systems for eight months almost every day and just seeing the atmosphere - yeah, there are some ups and downs, but there are usually more ups than downs and nobody's trying to stab the other person in the back. Nobody's trying to finagle this one so they can get paid on this, that and the other thing. [00:41:28] There's just no back-stabbing. I mean there is but there's not as much, and for me personally I haven't seen it. And that's what I do love about it is because we do have the same goal, and that's to help the kids out. For me (sigh) it's something I wish I'd started years ago. Now that I've matured and I've figured out the direction I want to go, I'm happy I made this decision than not make it at all because I was tired of waiting for stuff to fall in my hands. I realize now that nothing falls in your hands anymore. I realize that I have to be a go-getter and I can't just sit back anymore. If I do just sit back I'm never going to get anything done. I'm never going to be that person who is successful and who has the drive to succeed. [00:42:32] Once school is over I'll look for a job and I'll move on with my life. There are other things that I want to do. The more and more that I sit down and think about it, the more and more I want to go into business with my father and my brother in the home inspection business because I know it is a dying breed. I know my dad is not getting any younger and I know my dad worked hard to start this company. It is a family company that is in my immediate family. For me, once my dad goes, I don't see my older brother carrying on the business and I don't want it to die. I kind of want my dad's legacy and my grandfather's legacy and my uncle's legacy to kind of live on because they were the originators of the business and to me, that's a huge accomplishment. To me, that's a success story.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're thinking about doing that rather than going into guidance counseling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. I'm going to do that as well as guidance counseling. I worked with my dad yesterday. I'm just starting to learn the business and yesterday I was looking up about licensure and getting licensed and doing all that. The one good thing is I want to work in guidance. I want to work with kids. I want to be in the school system but also I do have a lot of down time with vacations and with the summers off and personal days. I've seen my dad. He's been successful financially in this business. For me it's a good side job. It's good to know because I'm at that age where I'm going to be an eventual home owner. [00:44:33] I am going to have to take care of my family and for me I can take care of my family by not only getting involved in this but also knowing the steps and the ropes and how to maintain a house. I don't know any of this stuff. I tried to get into it when I was younger but I had no desire. As I get older and as I mature more and I understand the reality of owning a home and doing all this stuff, the more and more interested I am in it and the more and more knowledge I want to gain from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Jordan, I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off but we are going to have to stop for today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not a problem. Thank you for switching times. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, absolutely. So I'll see you next Tuesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care. Bye bye. [00:45:29]</p>

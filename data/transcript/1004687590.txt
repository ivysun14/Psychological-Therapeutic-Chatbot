<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well at least I was right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [inaudible at 00:00:21] pessimistic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well not just, I mean I was rational about it. And she's younger and, God, I'm separated with two kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, what you wrote to me was that she had just got out of a complicated relationship and she also didn't want to deal with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: She said she got out, she just ended a long complicated relationship and she's looking for simple. And that she said that a messy divorce with two kids is not simple. I was going to argue on the messy divorce part but the reality is it was messy no matter how you look at it. And it just drove me nuts because it was like, I don't know what got into me but I was just like I got to, I just did it. I just couldn't take it any more. And I felt kind of bad doing it by e-mail but I don't know when I'm going to have the chance. And there's no response, no response and then I got hit—it got to a point where I knew she was had to have been done with work and I was like okay, she's just trying to figure out a way to let me down easy. And she ended up writing an e-mail at quarter to nine, quarter to midnight Friday night...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you had written her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: At 1:30 and I didn't see it until the next morning. And I was at a campground with some friends. So luckily I went to the festival and kind of had that to distract me because it really didn't start bothering me until last night when I was home alone. But, I don't know. I probably just shouldn't have done this but in Words With Friends, the only word I could come up with was Cupid. And that was 14 hours ago and other than the time that she didn't write me back, she had never gone 14 hours without playing. But she's really struggling for words; she's freaked out. I don't know. [00:02:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you write back to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I said cool; I understand; see you Tuesday. I'm not arguing with her, trying to convince her. I have to face her today, after it's been—this afternoon, this evening, something like that. The whole thing just sucks. Sucked before; sucks now. My friend was—I had to tell them I might be a little [inaudible at 00:04:05] the whole weekend and not go there—she said, I never quite understood why, but she said she was glad. She thought it was a good idea that I did it. I said after knowing that—she kind of knew. I didn't even say—I said I asked her when I want to date and then I said one or two things and she knew exactly who it was. [00:04:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, when you were playing handball?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I remember it just seemed kind of weird but she just went oh. And then on Sunday, I tried not to bring it up and obsess about it and she made some comment that Barbara likes me but that just, she just wants something different. So I don't know if there's something else there that she knew about that. I don't know why she would be glad that I asked her alone. For some—even now I'm not obsessed with it any more as far as, you know, but now I'm like now what do I got?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know we had you pick before but... [00:06:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not going to be able to play in my favorite Fantasy Football league this year. I want to go down to Florida for it. I kind of have a gut feeling but my dad is coming up the last weekend in August and I got a feeling that what inaudible at 00:07:22] job was. But at the time I was like I don't have the money to fly down there, I don't have the money to rent the car, I don't have the $150 entry fee. I just don't have the money and my dad on Friday, just called me up out of the blue to tell me that he paid my plane ticket and the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean to go down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To go down there but it's going to be the weekend that he's in town. If I had known that he was going to pay for all of it I would've said come and get down here for the weekend. I don't know if there was something special that weekend why they had to come but the following weekend play every day there's the games, there's one guy who's going to be at the ] Game and other people that are doing stuff for labor day, so all weekend but it's not looking good. [00:08:22]</p>

<p>Just—there was something we were talking about on Friday and didn't seem to finish. I can't remember what it was. I remember being in a pretty shitty mood and I was wondering if this is why it subsided now. Maybe in five years she'll change her mind. But simple doesn't come along. I mean for all I know she just —that's her excuse. That's easier than saying no, no, no. If I was 32 and single simple answers just don't [make that now] (ph). [00:09:41]</p>

<p>They're having a good time at the festival now. It was very, just laid back and a lot of good bands. There was no [inaudible at 00:10:15]. Sometimes at these festivals it's a pain in the ass just to get in and the stages are far apart. It was just kind of small enough that it worked out well. I'm really basically spending Jess's money to eat and buy coffee and gas and I keep doing these f***king titles and for every three titles I do they send me one check and they're just not paying me. I sent that e-mail about $1,000 that was over 60 days and I never heard back. And I don't know, they may have tried to write me back on—that was a Friday that my e-mail was down two weeks ago and I don't know. I kind of don't want to drive up to Beverly today but I just don't think I'm going to get any work done if I stayed at home. It's just kind of a mess. Doing a lot of driving. But I feel completely—Jess doesn't want me to use the office. She said I can occasionally use it but... [00:12:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably means as far as...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just going in and getting work done, just not being in the house. I don't have that any more so it's an hour and a half in the car or more just to get to an office space. I forgot one of the, something I needed to—I needed a draft of an agreement and, a draft template, on Office. I do this every f***king time. I leave something, just—I was going to work from home today but that wouldn't have f***king worked. Just f***k around. Do you remember what we were talking about on Friday? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes I remember part of it anyway. And I think it does relate to why you asked Barbara out. I said that I thought there were a lot of things in your life like that where you kind of—let's see, how did I put it —where you kind of back off of taking responsibility for things for how you deal or what you want or what you want to do, and then you feel kind of crummy about yourself. And you also generally feel like the other person around you, whoever that may be, probably Jess, is kind of responsible, that leaves that person kind of responsible and in charge. And it was unclear, at least to me, sort of what can make it so difficult to kind of sit up and take responsibility and deal with things too. [You want to do it one at a time, you want to do it?] (ph) [00:15:10]</p>

<p>Another example would be with parentally you and Jess and the kid. Behaviorally overwhelming; you don't want the arrangement; you just back off that and that leave Jess in charge. And that's kind of the poor responsible person that would do both as far as that goes. Not other things like money but as far as that thing goes. And I think that leaves you feeling sort of crummy and sort of powerless but also without having to deal with pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think on Friday Ian was in some play at the [inaudible at 00:15:59] so I went right to there and I was talking to Jess. And I brought up about going to the festival or something like that and her mood completely changed. But we were in the middle of a conversation and I was talking about the housing coordinates, she just kind of—in the middle of a conversation—just picks up and walks off. I really got f***king pissed off. I didn't say anything to her, whatever, and that might have been part of why I decided to ask Barbara. Because when I got home—I did it when I got home from that. And then Jess had a post on Facebook about she just wants to have fun or something like that or she needs to have fun or something about not having fun. So I know there's some—searching for the word—but she begrudges me for something already. [00:17:14]</p>

<p>I offered to pick Ian up this week from school and it's Wednesday or Thursday and she's like well why don't you do it Wednesday? Then she texts back oh Erica's going to be picking up Ian for Wednesday but you can do it but he may be expecting a play date. So even when I try and offer, I've already been squeezed out before I even get the chance to try and help out. I was trying to—Wednesday's better because I don't have Handball so it's not like I've got to bail at 4:30 or whatever. Seems like things just keep getting worse; nothing seems to improve. Whether it's work or... [00:19:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I f***king need to do laundry today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I'm thinking about your asking Barbara out. And I'm thinking you seem to feel like it was kind of a disaster. And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me it was like a potential escape from everything that's going wrong. But all it did was solidify in my mind of everything that's going wrong. [00:21:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how is that? How did it solidify in your mind of everything that's going wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she might as just well say your life's a wreck right now; I can't deal with that. And that was in essence what she said. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. No, that's not really how I hear it at all actually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How do you hear it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She knows what the f***k is going on with you and Jess and the kids. I don't hear it as oh my God, your life's way too much of a mess for me to deal with. And you're in a complicated situation, you have a kid, I don't want to get involved with that right now. It's not the same as saying your life is a mess, though. I mean, you could be making a half a million dollars a year and have any number of other things going great and she could've said the same thing. [00:23:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't have any of those things going great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's terrible but that's not what she was referring to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I guess you're right there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: For me it was a potential for something to go right, for something positive to happen. And it didn't happen because of my situation. And whatever—that's all inter-related. There's a reason that I'm separated with two kids. I just can't separate her [any how.] (ph) [00:25:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think you're inclined to read everything indicating that you're a failure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And why shouldn't I?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why should you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why shouldn't I?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why does you being separated have anything to do with you failing at that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that's where a lot of this came from. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to live with Jess?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not anymore. There was a time I did and she was just so ready to move in a different direction and cast me aside that I was like f***k it. She's ready to move on with her life and could care f***king less about me. All that matters is the kids and who gives a shit what happens to Cameron? I mean I'm in the f***king hospital and she could care less about me. It only matters how it affected the kids. I had to beg her to bring the f***king kids to visit me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, again, that's terrible and so hurtful. [00:27:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the whole process, even when I went to the Hospital, she had no f***king idea how to react or be sympathetic or just understanding or anything. She f***king gets into a fight with me. She thinks I'm blaming her for it. Work sucks; I'm not making any money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you are; it's f***king Jess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's the same thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think, I think at the moment the scenario you're talking about is going on in here between you and me where you'd rather not look closely at the things we're talking about because they make you feel bad. Which puts me in the position of saying geez if you look closely at what we're talking about it's not actually what it feels like to you. In other words, I'm kind of the responsible one who's saying geez, Cameron, look at all these things actually you're saying it all feels like failure but if you look at it that's not what's going on. It's not that it's not difficult or upsetting or hurtful but... [00:31:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I can't pay any of my bills. I've got months that I haven't paid my student loans or my car insurance or the website. I mean, I can't f***king—I'm behind on f***king everything, everything. And I've got to make these f***king tax payments and just, the money's not there. It's just not f***king there. I'm not making it up. I'm not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I agree I don't think you're making it up. But I also don't think that's a lot of what this is about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's wearing on me. It's really wearing on me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. No question about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's nothing else. I mean it's f***king 90 degrees out and I don't have f***king air conditioning in my car. I don't have a radio that works. My sunglasses are broken. It's just like every little thing just adds up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Yes, when everywhere you look you see a sign of what feels like you're a failure could be overwhelming. You could have the same thing with Barbara's business. Although it could be frustrating and upsetting and depressing, you often will make an effort to give something a try to try to get more business. You go meet with somebody, you'll give a presentation, you'll do some networking things, knowing that it's not likely to work out but it could and you got to—and it's certainly not going to work out if you don't do anything like that. [00:35:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been a while since something's worked out. I can't even remember the last time it's worked out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You made a bunch of money in June. Not a lot but more than you had. You had a few closings. There are a few this month as well if I remember right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Might be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: My point is, less than trying to give you a pep talk than to say that I think that may be a part of that you're doing something that is intentional and kind of unconscious in reading everything as a sign of your failure which is convincing yourself it's not worth taking the risk or making the effort. I don't think you're better off in the long run living with a fantasy about you and Barbara and feeling like you don't have the guts to ask her out. I don't know if that does you much good in the long run. [00:37:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I know that's why I finally asked her out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is a big risk and not an easy thing to do. As for which I've not heard yourself, not heard you give yourself any credit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but the big thing that bothered me all along and why I didn't want to do it is for the very reason why she said no. I saw it coming. I don't—it's...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what's the big consequence? I mean, it might be a little weird at first but my impression is that you guys will get it back on some kind of friendly footing. And of course you feel crummy about it but, and you don't have the fantasy any more it sounds like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: As far as just like sort of the reality with her you have the same thing you had before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's true. [00:39:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look I'm not saying it's not upsetting or it isn't tough to ask somebody out and have them say no. I'm not trying to talk you into feeling good about how it went. But I do think there are ways you feel about it that sort of it feels like well beyond what's actually happened, you know what I mean? [inaudible at 00:40:34]. I'm not sure what it is but your level of upset over it gives the impression that you need to feel really ashamed or you really lost something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean on one hand you say you saw this coming and even for the reason that she gave. On the other hand you're really bummed out about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but it's just, it's everything though. All it was was one big huge reminder. That's not what I'm upset about. I'm upset about where I am in life. I'm just putting more focus on everything else that's not working. It's not that I'm oh so upset she said no. It's just, it's just a reminder that I've got nothing. I really have nothing. I just can't make anything work. [00:42:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Once again, I guess I just want to be clear that I'm not quiet because I agree with you; I'm quiet because I'm trying to give it [inaudible at 00:44:35] the way I think I thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what positives I have. I need my hat on. But I have something to feel good about. It comes down to it doesn't matter, I really need to have going for me or not. Jess f***king wants $500 a month from me and I can't even afford my own shit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just sucks. [00:46:15]</p>

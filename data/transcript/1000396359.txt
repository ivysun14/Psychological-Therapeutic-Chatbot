<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I'm thinking about, uhm, thinking what I was thinking yesterday, I guess near the end.  Uhm, I don't know, it seemed like it's almost a conflict of (sighs) fighting with you even when I'm talking about it and think I'm not, but I still am.  Or I don't know if I think I'm not but I think I don't want to and I still am.  And, uhm, well, again, I, it, it's all, seems to me, very connected with, uhm, thinking about well, the way I think of it sort of is coming forever or stopping.  And if I think of stopping there are some things that are very attractive to me about not needing to come.  But, uhm, there's always a stronger feeling, I think, of being very reluctant to give up — well, I don't really see what it is I get out of fighting with you or not being able to, uhm, well, I, it always comes back to make love with MSCZ without fighting there too.</p>

<p>And, uhm, what, what came to my mind too, is just that last night at some point I said something to MSCZ that was, uhm, I guess kind of criticism.  I was asking him to stop doing something and he said something about my having complained all evening or, I don't know, it was, he wasn't really mad but it was just some kind of a d— comment like that.  And I didn't think I had been but — and we got over it all right.  But I suppose maybe I really was because I did have very much on my mind I didn't want him to make love with me.  And I suppose that was one way to sort of ensure his keeping his distance by, I mean, to be sort of crabby and uhm, unpleasant.</p>

<p>And, well, I was just remembering, too, which I hadn't thought of when I was thinking at the very beginning of coming in here, but of, uhm, at the very end yesterday, of thinking about how the day before I had imagined being so sick I wouldn't be able to come.  Uhm, and, well, this is, it seems like so often this is what happens, you react in a way I thought, well there's more to it than I can see.  And yet I thought there was something to it the way it, the way I thought of it following, I, I think I was thinking then about fighting you.  Uhm, but it still seemed like well, not exactly a natural thought because I knew I wasn't sick enough and I knew I was looking for an excuse not to come.  But still some—, something about it in the same way when I'm fighting you that, uhm, I don't know it's almost like, well, of course I felt that way or I'm missing seeing something about it.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Well, the next thing I started thinking was of the fact that, uhm, when MSCZ's mother heard that we were going to go on this diet she immediately started going on and on about, "Oh, you'll be sorry," or "You'll wish you hadn't," or something, "Because you'll be constipated."  And, uhm, I suppose I'm a little more casual about being constipated than I used to be but I still don't like it at all.  And, uhm, it bothers me very much if I am at all.  And today is the first day where I have been.  And, uh, so I was just thinking about that.  Because I suppose I was wondering, I mean I think it probably is the diet because it's mostly meat and eggs and very little, well no fruit and then very little vegetable.  And, uhm, but I, I suppose I was wondering, too, if, it seemed to me there have been times in the past where I've been constipated partly just because that's been, I'd been feeling so tight.  And, uhm — (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, it, I just keep thinking I'm really feeling as if I've got to hold everything in now.  And, uhm, uhm, I don't know, it seems it's slightly different from the way I feel when I'm feeling I've got to really keep myself under control but it must be similar.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, it seems like I keep going back to thinking about FSO and, uhm, I don't know, it seems like every time I've thought of her I think of taking her today to the woman who baby-sits for her.  And, uhm, I don't know r, really what I'm thinking about except just sort of recalling how she went in today, which was a little bit better than other times.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, I suppose it beats thinking about beating the hell out of me, fighting me, kicking me in the groin, all the things that you just don't want to think about. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, uhm, I, I know that well, even yesterday and certainly the day before, I had a, uhm, stronger feeling of connecting fighting you in the way I was imagining fighting that character in the movie.  And I just can't seem to do it at all now.  But, uhm, instead I think of something that I, I just can't tell whether I'm really concerned or if it just is an easier way to think about this.  But, uhm, I started thinking again, of, of the thing that — well, I think I am concerned but yet it also is easier to think it — uhm, just this feeling of I don't know, not ever giving up fighting you as if I'm, I always am going with the idea that maybe, even though I know I'll never win, maybe something would happen so I would.  Uhm, I can't see else why I'd keep fighting.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But again the point is that now, eh, you're fighting in this different way.  You're fighting in a way that's much more like your description of being constipated where you're holding everything in.  You're being passive, you're — this is a different style of fighting.  And here, quite effective in making sure nothing happens. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, again I g—, I suppose what I think next is something I guess it was yesterday that you pointed out because I have this feeling again of, uhm — and it's, yesterday wasn't, I mean I've had it so many times lately of — it's a feeling, I guess, almost of it's out of my control.  How can I do anything else if that's the way I'm feeling.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But then I, I know, what it comes down to is if I really wanted to stop or do something else then I would.  (Sighs) but it really, I mean I clearly want to but I really don't understand why I want to.  I mean I can see why I used to want to because I used to convince myself I'd get what I wanted by doing it but, or maybe I still am going under that.  But it seems like well, I don't know.  I mean I think I don't think I'll get what I want any more by doing it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, something else came to my mind and it seemed like it was very much off the sub— when I was thinking about — it must have been after you pointed out I was still fighting you here.  And, uhm, I thought about that for a while, what I said, what I finally said.  And then it seemed to me I kind of drifted off and it didn't strike me at first that it was anything to go back to because it just seemed like thinking something unimportant.  But it's sort of hanging there in the back of my mind and bothering me, uhm, because I guess I just noticed my feet.</p>

<p>And then the next thing I thought, I think was wondering whether FSO will have feet like me or like MSCZ.  Because MSCZ has, uhm, very wide and sort of fat looking feet, and short, too, especially because of his height.  And then I was thinking about FSO walking barefoot and how my mother noticed one day that she often stands curling her toes when she's barefoot.  And she was sort of laughing at that.  And th— I was thinking of, also, FRA and the way she treats fha when she's baref—, was barefoot the last time in PTN and didn't want to walk on stones and, uhm, wondering because FSO sometimes is very delicate, too, and thinking I'd do it slightly differently.  But then it, but what's bothering me about it I think is that, uhm, well, that I've always been bothered by MSCZ's feet and hands.  And I don't quite know why.  I mean they're not very attractive, I guess.  At least, I don't think so because they're short and fat, both of them, hands and feet.  And, uhm, I don't know, it's gotten so I generally don't think much of it but when I first married him it really bothered me.  And it clearly still must be enough because thinking about it now I really want FSO to have my hands and feet.</p>

<p>And it wasn't just MSC—, I mean it's, it's the kind of hands and feet that he has that I've never thought were attractive on anybody.  But, uhm, it really bothered me when, when it was the person I was going to marry who had them.  And then it's, it was bothering me when I was just thinking of it now, mainly because it was bothering me.  It seems like it's something that shouldn't matter to me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, how do you explain it, I mean why it does matter?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause, sighs) Well, it just seems to me it's part of the way I am with him of, of, uhm, not really being that close and, and always being critical when there is something to be critical of.  (Pause) Because I was thin—, I was just thinking that on sunday, uhm, when we were out at MSCZ's family, we were actually at his brother's, uhm, and I, I can't, I don't know if I've ever seen his brother barefoot so I don't know what kind of feet he has but I know they're different.  And I think his hands are well, probably, well, they're more like his fa—, like MSCZ's father and, and my father, I guess, and my brother, and more what I'm associating, used to seeing men's hands being and thinking that I want men's hands to be.  And MSCZ has hands like his mother and, uhm, and feet, I'm sure.  Uhm, but anyway, at MSCZ's brother's, MSCZ's brother wears cowboy boots all the time and really loves them and has, on several occasions now, brought it up that MSCZ should get some.</p>

<p>And MSCZ just would never wear them.  And he's tried to say that nicely and his brother keeps pushing it.  And the last time this happened before this sunday, uhm, he went so far as to try on his brother's boots because his brother was insisting that, saying — because MSCZ has a very high, I guess it's instep, it's not the arch, but it's the bone over the arch.  And so he really, he just can't get into the boots.  And they wouldn't be comfortable even if he could.  And, uhm, then again, this sunday his brother went through the same thing again as if he — well, I guess he didn't remember he'd gone through it before.  And, I don't know, I found I was getting very defensive about MSCZ's feet then and, I mean I was sort of thinking of what they were like and, uhm, because somehow it seemed to me MSCZ was being attacked then and, and through his feet.  So then I was feeling very defensive.  But, uhm, but then other times I feel like I did just now when I was thinking about them.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What else do feet and hands remind you of?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) (softly) Well, penises come to my mind (pause) and I know I've al—, I've uhm, somehow associated the kind of hands and feet I like with being more masculine.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, at first, at first I was thinking I'm finding it very hard to think in what way I connect the hands and feet with penises except that their fingers and toes are, uhm, what I think must make me think of penises.  And, uhm, and it — I, I guess it's something to do with bigger feet and bigger hands, longer and thinner fingers and feet, toes, uhm.  But I don't quite understand exactly what I am thinking about the two so that, that kind of hands and feet are better.</p>

<p>But then, then the next thing that came to my mind I guess I was aware of sort of, uhm, well, holding my thumb.  And the, the image that came to my mind with that was many times uhm, but especially in church this would bother me, my father would pick with, (stutters) I don't know whether it would be the same fingers a,a, as on the hand that his thumb was on or the other hand, but anyway, he'd, he'd pick at his thumb, he'd sort of pull at the skin around the thumbnail.  And, uhm, it would — makes a little noise.  But the noise, it, I don't know, I mean the noise bothered me because then I could visualize what he was doing even if I didn't look and it was looking that made me feel so upset.  And I was just thinking now his thumb makes me think very much of a penis, just somehow the way it is.  So I guess I almost took it as his handling his penis when he was doing that to his thumb.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, so you see how you provided yourself an answer to the question of — your question is why do you feel this profound inclination to go on fighting me, MSCZ, your father, men, period, forever.  So it's a lifelong grudge battle.  Your associations give the answer.  It's the old answer.  Because your thoughts end up, it's the penis that makes you so mad, furious and that the grudge battle's all about.  You feel you're never going to give up trying to destroy them and all that stands for them and symbolizes them and so on.  (Pause) You think of MSCZ's hands and feet, which you feel are ugly, as a substitute for thinking of the real appendage that you think is ugly, hateful, that you'd like to destroy. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, it, I, I guess I see the answer to the other part of it that was bothering me of why when I, I mean that I kept thinking the fighting would make sense only if I really thought I might get a penis out of it.  But, uhm, (stuttering) I mean when you were saying that it just seemed to me very clear.  And I recalled, I think really feeling this way, uhm, mainly when I was in high school and being so unpleasant at home, that just being unpleasant and people who could not get rid of me having to, having to be stuck with me and therefore I could be unpleasant and make things unpleasant for them even if I couldn't really get what I wanted.  It would at least get back.  And then that I suppose that helps explain why I think of coming here forever, too, because it's got to be this whole thing only makes sense if I'm going to, if you can't get rid of me.  Or if MSCZ can, whenever he threatens to get rid of me then I get very frightened that my whole thing is upset.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   But you feel I'm stuck with you and so you can go on forever this way.  I have to put up with it like your father did. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, but then I'm remembering, uhm, well, I suppose even with my father I had this, uhm, but sometimes I'll interpret things here or I'll think of what if you said that was all, you weren't going to continue or that clearly I wasn't going to get anywhere so you were going to stop or I, I mean I've even specifically, I can't recall now, but interpreted your remarks sometimes to be your sort of saying you're not going to be stuck with me.  And I don't know.  (Sighs) and, and I know with my father, too, there must have been times.  But it, I suppose the mean feeling, though, still is that basically I feel fairly secure that, that you're stuck with me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, you know, you were very concerned about that at the very beginning, the very first time we ever talked here.  That was one of your main questions, you know, you, eh, what would happen if something about the research or the recording or anything like that, would I continue to see you without it.  In other words, would I make a real, you know, firm commitment.  That was on your mind even then. </p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Pause) Well, I was also just thinking about that I mean basically things are a bit less secure, I mean in, in the way I see it, with MSCZ.  But even there, I, I suppose I've seen this already but I'm just seeing it (sighs) again, perhaps a little more clearly, how I've use coming here for hi— against him in that that's how I've kept myself fairly secure and, and able to continue fighting him by saying, "Well, I'm coming here so give me more time."  And, and also I suppose, playing on his basic feeling of not really wanting to get divorced.  But I was also just thinking of, of, uhm, when I even think about it, in feeling you're stuck with me, I still feel (laughs) that you are.  Because I, I mean I was thinking about whenever I think of not coming any more, it's always thinking I would decide, not you would.  (Pause, sniffles)</p>

<p>Except on the other hand I really think I must have been feeling there is a time limit, I don't know.  I don't know how much I really believe I could keep on doing this forever.  I, I don't really think I, I, I think I have thought there must be some limit to how much you would continue to take or i— it's not exactly take but, uhm, (pause) well, I suppose it is take, in a way.  But I, I was thinking of it also as sort of, if I continue to fight in such a way that I wasn't letting you have any influence over me, there must be a point at w— I think I'm, I think I do feel underneath it all there must be a point at which you'd think and decide that it was pointless to continue.  And (sniffles) I don't know, it seems like, at least recently, there's been th— some idea of, uhm, eventually I can't continue like this so I've got to, well, it's almost like enjoy it now because I can't continue for very long.  I don't know, I didn't feel this way at, right at the beginning but after I realized what I was doing for a while, or at least realized in part, uhm, when was it?  2 ye—, well, right after FSO was born and when I made you much more important than MSCZ to me and the important thing was coming here and so forth, I think even then I knew that it couldn't go on forever so I re— wanted to really enjoy it while it could.</p>

<p>Except the other part is I don't think, well, I really, I, I don't know what I enjoy exactly.  Because it doesn't seem like I'm feeling terrifically happy when I'm so involved in either fighting you or during that time, turning so much to you.  (Pause) But I do think of it that way, I don't quite know why.  Well, I suppose then it was a way to fight MSCZ.  (Pause, sighs)</p>

<p>I don't know, th— I guess then I was just thinking that, uhm, well, I don't, I don't know if it exactly goes like this because I certainly haven't stopped fighting MSCZ but it seems like I'm (swallowing) not fighting him quite as much or same way when I'm fighting you more.  So then it, it just seemed to me it ends up that I have to be fighting somebody or something.  Which makes me think of my mother, who's always fighting somebody or something.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, again I'm not sure whether this is connected or if it's a getting off the subject but I just started thinking about, uhm, having gone to the dentist today because of course, well, it seemed like for a while, right before I went, I had been having trouble every time I'd chew anything with any substance to it at all, I'd get a pain.  And then first it would happen only every onc—, every once in a while and then it began to happen all the time and then I sort of had a dull ache.  And, uhm, so I made an appointment to see a dentist that the BFM's gave us the name of and, uhm, stopped chewing on this side.  And then, and, and so then of course I didn't feel so badly.  And then today when I went I didn't even have the aching.  And it seems to me it's almost started again.  Because he couldn't find anything superficially.  And then I was just thinking about his X-raying me.  And he took, uhm, I guess I'm used to just having, uhm, the film put in so that you bite down on a piece that comes between your teeth and it films upper and lower teeth.  And, uhm, he, I don't know how many he took but it seemed like he took a film for each individual tooth.  And, uhm, while he was doing it I kept being worried because I kept thinking I'm going to start getting burned by having so much Xray going on.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, we have to stop.</p>

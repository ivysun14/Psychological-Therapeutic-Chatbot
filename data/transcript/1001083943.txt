<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, how are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm doing pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good, what's new?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm looking for a job. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No luck in finding one yet, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'm hearing from a lot of people that it's taking longer than it used to, to find a job. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they give tests and I haven't had to take a test.  I did with the [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To see where I was at and if I would pass and I scored a little low on my reading comprehension so I'm taking - I passed it, but.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> it wasn't where I would like to be. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I'm taking reading comprehension classes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where are you doing that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'm taking computer classes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they're free, so. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's going pretty well. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long are the classes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're six hours, I had to six hours of the reading comprehension and three hours of computer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twice a week, it's an hour and a half twice a week and then the other reading comprehension is just whenever I want to do it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Self pace?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So you have to put in six hours a week and so I'm doing about nine hours a week of that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.  Now do they have any kind of job placement there too or more just training?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, they send me messages when there's a job opening on the computer. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So then I just apply for whatever, usually whatever comes up, I don't apply for everything </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Are you looking for any specific kind of jobs?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B>  No, I'm pretty much willing to do just about anything.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't want to be a waitress, or there are some things I would just rather not do, but...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.  And are you finding - are there very many job openings out there or not very many? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's job openings, but they're just not calling me.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What I'm hearing from other people is there are openings, but there are so many people applying for those openings that they will just pick a few people to call and not even call the rest back.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what they're doing, I think. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and the other thing I've heard is that, you know, the [DEIDENTIFIED] employment market has been flooded because there have been so many high tech layoffs.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That there are a lot of people that are looking for any job they can get, you know, maybe they worked at MCI or Intel or somewhere before there were computers, but now those people instead of looking for more computer jobs are looking for other jobs.  There are more people looking for fewer jobs.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They kind of have to do that.  The industry isn't that stable anymore and you know what...  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Actually it's never been that stable.  Ever since I started they've always laid off people whenever they felt like it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now I started back in1979.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they always had that threat of being laid off.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I just heard that [DEIDENTIFIED] was going to shut down their plant here.  That was in the news.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what?  A thousand workers or something?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  The competition is really tough and... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know if they weed people out by age because I'm not getting any younger. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> None of us are, [PATIENT NAME].  Well I hope, hopefully more companies will move into the area, too and bring some more jobs in.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are your spirits holding up okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, it's going pretty well. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just dealing with my parents and that's working out pretty well. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's kinda tough sometimes when they argue and I don't really - the way they argue is - I think they need professional help, but that's just my opinion. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's tough. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because they just didn't learn to communicate very well and the things they fight about are like - why?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that generation never did learn very well how to communicate and there is a lot of arguing often times and they never really resolve anything. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The next little thing pops up and they argue about it again.  It's unfortunate. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  It's about things that really are not always important and they should be talking about things that are more important to me, they should be.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And their feelings and they don't about their feelings very well and I grew up learning that too, so. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah. So you're making it work for you, though?  It's okay living there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I went to therapy and I learned you know, a little bit more about what dysfunctional families are and they are definitely that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and that generation, unfortunately, generally didn't either have access to therapy or didn't take advantage of it or won't take advantage of it. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or don't want to.  My dad is real stubborn about it. He doesn't think that he needs help and sometimes he does and he just won't admit it</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, you know there was just an article and it was on the cover of Newsweek Magazine about men and depression.  They were talking about how many men have depression, but won't get help for it because they just think - either they don't know what it is or they think they should be able to tough their way through it.  I think that's not just true with men and depression, it's true with men with so many other kinds of problems too.  They don't ask for help well. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They get that macho - I don't know what that is, but... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well are you sleeping well at night or keeping you awake?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I'm sleeping real good.  So... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Energy level holding up okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been able to walk much? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been working out at the gym.  My dad paid for a couple of months there for me to go and ride the bike, treadmill and weights and I've been doing that about three to five times a week. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Between 45 minutes to an hour. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that's going real well.  Some days are a little, not as much energy as usual, but </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did your weight stable do you think?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I've been losing weight. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You look like you've lost weight.  Do you know how much you've lost?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've lost nine pounds in the last six weeks. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.  Just from the exercise you think?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and then eating better, and trying to eat better.  I still like to eat pizza every now and then. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's hard to resist.  I just saw leftover pizza in the fridge this morning and I thought oh, I don't need that.  So, appetite's still go though then? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's real good and I do like my sugars, though.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that's kind of addicting too.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It is. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Most people won't say that, but I think it really is. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Are you able to focus pretty well like when you're taking the classes?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It took me a while to focus on the reading.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I'm starting to do better at it now then I was at first and I think I just got out of the practice of reading, you know? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On a daily basis for about two hours a day and, but that's how long - I take like two hours a day three days a week and go to those classes. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and they have you reading books or newspapers or magazines?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> On the computer. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On the computer, okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they have their own topics.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and do they measure how fast you're reading?  Or do they give you questions to see how much you remember?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They ask questions about what you read. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And at the end they have step-by-step strategies that they make you go through and at the end of those I'll have to take another test and see if I did any better than I did the first time and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So they're going to measure that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, excellent.  What about any anxiety that's more than you would expect these days? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm a little stressed about my parents let me have my cats in the house...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And there are six cats in the house now. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh boy, do they get along okay? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I have one cat in the bedroom with me and that's all, she just stays in the bedroom because my mom doesn't want her to come out and when I introduced the other cat into the bedroom she just attacked him. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, boy. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They used to, they've grown up together and she attacked him, so I don't - I can't have him in the bedroom now, so...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, she's territorial or something, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's real territorial now of the bedroom, I think possessive and </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Territorial.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh, that's too bad.  Hopefully, maybe when you get your own space again they'll get along again, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but there's a lady that my dad knows, he goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] and he met somebody there that has somebody that she knows that wants a cat. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I might be giving him up, so - to an older lady that just lost her husband. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And she needs companionship and he's a real good companion.  So, he's not a , he's kind of like a dog.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he likes a lot of attention and likes to be petted and likes to be with you. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Some cats are like real distant, but he's not like that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so that would be really good for her and you'd be okay too if you gave him up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'd be okay with that as long as he went to a good home, I'd be happy for him, so... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he would get lots of attention it sounds like there. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, any problems with voices at all recently?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no voices, no. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Any feelings of being afraid of people trying to harm you or anything like that recently, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  Any problems with the medication at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I really appreciate you sending me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're welcome.  I hope they keep giving me samples.  They're actually cutting back on the size of the packages they're giving me, but they're still giving them to me, so - are you getting low probably?  Or, let's see when's the last time you got some?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you just sent some to me. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's right, good.  So that will last a couple months at least.  So February to mid-April hopefully.  So just keep letting me know when you're getting low, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay and I thought maybe I could apply for the medication again. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's a good idea. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because right now I don't have insurance or anything, so - before I had insurance, [DEIDENTIFIED] or whatever and they wouldn't - even though I was out of a job.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, let me see if I have that form that we use.  That's an excellent idea.  This is the latest one.  I think this is the one.  Yeah, that's a good idea, because then we get a three month supply so I wouldn't have to be worry about being dependent on the samples.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you want to fill it out now or do you want to?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we could do it now, do you have time?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.  You want to fill out your part and I'll fill out my part so then, if you know it all it's like, you start up there. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  Yeah, my moods kind of go up and down with the job situation. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's stressful. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hopefully, you'll find something good that will, a job that will stick around.  That's the hard part these days.  It seems like there are no jobs that are permanent.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They even stipulate when you're filling out an application that if you get hired that they can fire you at any time for any reason.  They don't have to have a good reason. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately, that's true in the State, the way the laws are written, they don't have to have any reason, it just doesn't make for a great work environment though if you never know if there is any job stability.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yeah, I didn't really like having that fear over my head, it makes you work differently, I think. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I agree.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It actually makes you make mistakes sometimes and - contact name is my name? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I believe so, yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I only have like one week left of unemployment, so I don't know whether, should I just put zero. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if there's one week left.  Yeah, if you don't have any regular income after that, so yeah put zero for now because you won't have income after this week.  Got it all? Okay, looks like the rest is all my part. Let's see, insurance, you don't have private insurance, you don't have prescription drug coverage, you don't have Medicaid.  Have you applied for Medicaid in the past and been denied?  No?  You don't have Medicare, A, B or D?  You don't have military benefits?  It looks like, I just need you to sign and date here in those two spots.  Let me see if there's anything else.  I think the rest of it's all mine to fill out.  Yeah, so I'll fill this out and I'll send that off and hopefully - I don't think there'll be any problem with approval.  So as soon as I get some I'll let you know and send it to you then, okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What else?  Anything else going on, good or bad?  It sounds like you're doing okay, just trying to find a job and living at home with folks a little stressful, but you're coping. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah.  If I get tired of it, then I just go to my room.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's probably the best approach.  Are you getting out socially at all with any friends or anything?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I speak to a friend on the phone, that's mostly how we, you know, is contact each other is over the phone. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We try to get together every now and then, but not too often. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Are you watching sports at all?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, I watched the Rockies yesterday, they were televised. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, and they won didn't they?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They won 4-3.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think we should stop the season right now, they're undefeated.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, 2-0.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, 2-0 that's right.  Who'd they play yesterday?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They played the White Sox. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, again?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They beat them twice, right?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they won 12-4 on Thursday, no Wednesday and then 4-3 yesterday. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's encouraging at least, huh?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I heard they're picked to finish last. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they are.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But they have some good young talent if they could just get them going maybe, and last year the first half of the season they did really well.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was the second half they kind of went downhill. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  So if they could just maybe sustain it through the second half this year, who knows, maybe they'll surprise some people. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They might, yeah, well, we'll see. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, good.  So you're watching some baseball.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And football.  And the last month, no, haven't seen, been watching movies and I like to watch Dr. Phil.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's pretty interesting.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've never seen him, but I hear he's entertaining. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  He's, I think he's a pretty good doctor, so- </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He gives good advice. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've learned some things from him. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  So you like to watch TV during the day and anything you're doing?  Exercising?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Exercising and then just looking for jobs...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Filling out applications and going to school. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, so you're pretty busy these days? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I've been pretty busy. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My dad wants me to go back to school.  He said I could live there until I finished. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Now what's the furthest you've gone in school?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One year of college. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you can go back and either get an associate's or bachelor's degree.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah. That's what I wanted to.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you did, do you know what you might want to get a degree in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean do you know what you would to study?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I thought you had a suggestion. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, no, I don't have any ideas. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, I would like to get in as a medical lab technician and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I just called yesterday and they don't have any classes.  They have Biology and Chemistry, but they don't have any actual courses geared towards medical lab technician.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know how people got their jobs without going to [DEIDENTIFIED] or - that's what they suggested that I go to [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED].. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's strange, where did you call?  [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I wonder if there's a different school in [DEIDENTIFIED] that offers it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] I went there and they want $22,000 for two years. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> $22,000?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Holy cow!</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I also heard from somebody that they don't hire people that went to that school as easily as other colleges</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I wonder if you could call the hospital and you know one of the labs and just ask people, you know, where did you go to school?  Or where would you recommend or something like that because you know with building those two new hospitals there would probably be a lot of opportunities for new positions.  In fact, I know somebody that works at one lab and they said they are always trying to find more people to work there because they are always understaffed.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's a great idea.  So, maybe try to find out where else besides [DEIDENTIFIED] could you go?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's the thing, without - if I went anywhere, it would probably be [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't want to drive to [DEIDENTIFIED]. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, no that wouldn't be fun. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, but if it was on this side of [DEIDENTIFIED] it be easy-  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Yeah, that wouldn't be too bad.  Where do your folks live? What part of [DEIDENTIFIED]? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They live on the north side [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] so it would be </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, probably an hour drive or so to [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ugh, well - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Also to [DEIDENTIFIED], but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I'd still rather go to [DEIDENTIFIED].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand, you know, [PATIENT NAME], you could call the hospitals because there's another young man I know, who isn't a lab tech, he's a radiology tech. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They actually had a program right at [DEIDENTIFIED].  He went to school there right at the hospital and got trained and now he works - I think he ended up going to work at [DEIDENTIFIED] later, but he loves it and he got trained right at the hospital, they had classes and all, so maybe the hospital would even offer some kind of lab tech courses or know somebody else in town that's good that would.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that would be something else you could check into at least. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I could do that.  My dad did talk to somebody at the hospital the other day and she didn't say where she went to school, but she said that, you know, that they're in demand right now. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  I hear a lot of the medical special-, medical fields are short of people, so </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Medical fields right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again in [DEIDENTIFIED] with the two new hospitals opening, that's going to create a huge new demand for more people, so it's a great time to get into the field and that's a fairly stable field too.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Unfortunately, people are always getting sick and needing help so - and it just seems to be growing, too.  You now, more hospitals, more people and more need for medical personnel so it's a great idea, so yeah, even at the [DEIDENTIFIED] maybe they have some ideas about other schools, too, I don't know. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well, they thought I should volunteer, try to volunteer somewhere first and maybe get in that way, but I don't know- </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's hard, if you don't have the degree, though, so - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the lab tech you have to have a license for.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah, so you'd have to go to school. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They won't accept people to volunteer. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah, so I think your idea is to check out schools - I mean that's a reasonable idea, if you get some training in a field like that it might be able to be something you could do the rest of your life if you liked it. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and I really want to get into something that I thought I would like and I really like Biology and Chemistry and that's what I took in college. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I took a lot of it in high school and did really well. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So I thought I should try to get into something that requires that background.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think that's an excellent idea.  Well, good.  Well, good luck, I hope you find something.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I just gotta start talking to people and - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm such an introverted person and it's really hard for me to, you know, have a networking, not networking, but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To get around and talk to people.  My dad's really good at it.  He talks to people and I didn't get that from him.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm more like my mom.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, again if you can just the information you need, which is, you know, where would there be a school you could go to.  I don't know where you'd call, other than, I don't know if the phone book has lab tech schools or something or again you might even just call the hospital and ask to speak with the laboratory and you can get a lab tech and ask if there are any schools in [DEIDENTIFIED] and maybe one of the techs might be able to tell you.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Call personnel?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I can give you the name of a doctor I know if you want at [DEIDENTIFIED], there's a lady pathologist there that I went to medical school with, real nice lady, her name is [NAME OTHER] and I can give you her name and if you want and you can call her and ask her.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, she's real nice.  I mean one of the nicest doctors I know of, so.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I like watching CSI and what the doctors do and figure what happened, what killed somebody and I like dissecting and I like doing all that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just reminded me, I know another gentleman, he's not a patient, but he worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] in the lab for a long time and then he went to work for the coroner's office and loves it.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He said it's really fascinating because they get to do so many tests. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  I'm the kind of person that works well on my own.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think you do real well, so that's [NAME OTHER]. She's pathologist who knows me. You can call her.  You can use my name or not and just explain that I mentioned becoming a laboratory technician, do you know of any good schools in this area where I could go and get trained. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She would be one contact person at least.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right, great. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, anything else before we set up another appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You don't know her number?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I can write down the main hospital number for you. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then just ask for the laboratory or ask for her, [DEIDENTIFIED] is the main hospital  number. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And then just ask for [NAME OTHER] or the laboratory.  And they should be able to trans- I'd ask for her directly because they might put you through a bunch of extensions otherwise you might have to get transferred.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, just call the operator and ask for [NAME OTHER] and that should be able to reach her.  Well, should we check back in about three months again?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure, that sounds good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that will put us into June.  And do you want to do morning or afternoon, [PATIENT NAME]?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Morning.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  How about I've got Friday, [DATE] at 10:30, would that work? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or even sooner? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I've got [DATE] at 10:30 and [DATE] I'll be out of town, you want to [DATE] at 10:30?  Did you mean earlier in the month or earlier in the day? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Earlier in the day? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, gotcha. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DATE] is good, so.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I start as early as 8:00 so I don't know how early you want to come in.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it's pretty much open then, so 8:00 is good.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I like setting earlier appointments and, if I can that is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, works fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> If I do get a job by then, if I can't make it I'll call you.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine, we could always reschedule. [DATE]  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or go back to school or - I'm kind of up in the air right now, so - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, if there's any conflict just let me know and we'll reschedule.  Okay? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I'll take care of that prescription form for you, get that sent off and I'll let you know when I hear from them.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, great. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, well good luck with everything you got going on.  You seem plenty busy.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  You take care. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Alright, [PATIENT NAME] you too, stay warm.  It looks like it could snow some more.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was snowing out there, a little bit ago.  Snowed on the way here.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Supposed to get high winds too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, boy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but then Sunday is supposed to be real nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, Spring's coming, hopefully soon.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Hopefully, yeah, I'm looking forward to it you know.  We got a lot of snow this year.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I know, it's been a long winter.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it has.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And cold.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Okay, [PATIENT NAME], take care. </p>

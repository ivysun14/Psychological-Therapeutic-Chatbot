<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are you?  You said you had an operation today?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I, well, [INAUDIBLE] half way, you know, and the doctor was the one that was really scared.  When it was all over, he started dancing.  You see, this, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said this eye here is half blind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And if he'd have hurt this one, goodbye.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What was the procedure you had done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, cataract, but he left it on there so long because he was afraid.  I just gave him a coronary.   </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and that was this morning?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was, uh, last night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It got done Yesterday, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, right at the end of the day.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.  Okay, well, I'm glad it went well, good news.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, well I've been feeling better.  I haven't been feeling too bad.  I know the wife's been complaining.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-oh.    </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That I'm a baby. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I go and see the priest once in a while and he told me what to do and it was a big help.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What did he tell you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you see, I don't know what the hell [INAUDIBLE], But whine, whine, whine, yknow, I would be sitting relaxing, watching TV and I'd say an unintentional lie, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Like what, what would you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I feel guilty and I'd go, whoop, what'd I do?  And it's too late, it feels like you're touching hot water. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What would you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then [NAME OTHER] stands up you know gets red in the face, yknow you're skin's red.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Get embarrassed?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, what would you say though, like what's an example of what?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's that?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're sitting in the evening and - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what kind of fib would you say, or lie would you say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I would just say oh she's [INAUDIBLE] marriage, yknow, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But my, see the priest told me you gotta learn how to courage it, let it burn. yknow, until it calms down then use your reason and then you'll be fine.  When you try to react right away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my wife said I'm not complaining but I love her [INAUDIBLE] but one thing about her is she's calmed, cool, and collected.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And when that happens, she sees it in my face.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure.  Although when that happens, are you like dozing, are you like half asleep?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it like a dream or - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It could be, yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is it sort of like a dream like you're -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes, yeah and she'll be sitting on the other side of the room and she'll say can I help you hun?  And after a while, I go over to her and I forced her the right way to do it, and I lift her, come over here and sit on my lap, put your hand around my neck and say can I help you hun, yknow, right way, it's a big difference.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that's her nature, I don't know. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you want her to be more - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There could be a big fire across the street and she'd sit there doing a crossword, she's a crossword person.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> She doesn't react, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You'd like her to come over and kinda give you a hug and be more emotional.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE], yknow.  A couple of weeks ago, I was that bad.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I haven't been that bad since [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what sets it off.  A lot of times it's the spooks, you know, a little lie like that, yknow but the thing is once it snaps, once the electricity hits ya.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You can't shut it off like a switch.  Like I said, [NAME OTHER], you've got to come over and sit on my lap and calm, yknow, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You said, since you've been here last time, there's like maybe one week that was bad?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, I was bad for a couple of weeks, I don't know what the hell I was doing. Well, I hate to complain, yknow, like when I went to get my wife's [INAUDIBLE] I tell um every thing I have and I'm takin' pills for, I forget what else -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The anti depressant.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The depression, he says what the hell man, you've got [INAUDIBLE], yknow, all the things I have, I just got another rotten thing, divers -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Diverticulitis?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You gotta mark down each thing you eat.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have to watch what you eat, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> When I go to the bathroom and when I take this, we worry about gee did I go to the bathroom today.  That's enough to drive a normal man crazy, yknow, especially you have a crap [INAUDIBLE].  But I'm feeling, the yellow pill, sometimes it works wonders.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Klonopin?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But not always.  If I take it real late, and then take the sleeping pill, I usually bong, go to sleep right away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been keeping busy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes I have to ask her for the yellow pill because it is - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Have you been keeping busy?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There isn't much to keep busy.  I, uh, play cards, yknow.  I never win, I don't [INAUDIBLE].  I always used to read nonfiction, Lives of the Saints or stuff like that and I don't enjoy reading fiction because the way I think in my head, it's just started the lies, and why, yknow, why read it 'cause it's wrong, if you start out that way.  I'm a lousy reader to begin with.  I went all the way through high school and everything but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You told me that the last time, too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] high school.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Watching a lot of TV, I imagine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Watching TV?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we keep pining for a good one.  There's so many, it really is bad, they're really bad for you.  All right, everybody's entitled to their opinion, yknow?  And it seems like the whole world is against religion, but they do it in a real sly sneaky way.  Me and the wife can see it right away, [INAUDIBLE] and they'll have animals eatin' each other that makes, I don't like that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On the Animal Planet.   You usually watch that, like Travel, and Home and Garden, and Animal Planet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  But some are really good, we bought a new big screen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> High, uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> High definition.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> High definition, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well good.  How's your sleeping overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't do it without the pill.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, okay, but they're working?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, you think I should try it?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not if it's, I mean if it's working okay, you're not taking high doses of anything at this point, so - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, if they increase it, yknow, these salesmen come around and they've got something new, its called the same thing, [INAUDIBLE] twenty six or twenty nine.  But the purple pill it seems stronger.  And uh, that stand there on the market now, I don't even think they'll see you the other one</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is that from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see if I can get some.  You didn't bring the list, did you?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, she [INAUDIBLE].  She's so perfect in being methodical, except when I said what I said, she's the perfect wife.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, you're still taking your, the Effexor?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Whatever that is, I don't know.  My memory is bad though.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, they have the Effexor and the Remeron at bedtime.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Remeron, I -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Those are the two antidepressants.  You were using the Ambien CR.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's the one, they raised that. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, yeah, you were taking 6.5 before, are you taking, what, 13?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, [INAUDIBLE] I can't be sure.  I thought it said 9, I don't know.  She can tell you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you have the Klonopin.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Like I said -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you're taking the Klonopin now up to three times a day, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The yellow one?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, but sometimes I'll ask her for one and she'll say you gotta wait two hours -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At nighttime, yeah.  She watches out for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, she does that, exactly.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, let me go check with her real quick just to find out what prescriptions you might need, okay?  I'll be right back, okay?   You wait here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll come there if you want.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I'll go ask her real quick and then I'll come back so you just relax.  [INAUDIBLE] three times a day.</p>

<p>CG: That's what we seem to do.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [PHYSICIAN NAME], one of the reasons that I had to start using [INAUDIBLE] is my ears ring all the time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What about that fan, does that shuts it up?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Been there, yeah.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It shuts it out.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it's like white noise, yeah, it keeps you from hearing outside, too, but I find it very loud sometimes this time of the year.  You've been on a sleeping pill for a while and your wife was just saying it was increased, it was Ambien CR that was increased.  We were just chatting.  It sounds like you don't need any prescriptions today.  You already have renewals on everything, but the Klonopin is one that, yknow, if it's a real bad week, you can take up to three a day.  If things are going a little better, you can cut it back to twice a day or even cut a tablet in half because your wife was saying sometimes she's worried you're a little bit tired in the morning, a little sedated still.  So that could be a little left over from the nighttime, it could be the Klonopin, but, yknow, if things have been going okay this week, I'd just keep things the same, yknow.  You made it through your eye surgery well, so hopefully things will settle down.</p>

<p>CG: The one thing, he's got a lot of problems with is dry mouth anymore, right?  And I notice the Effexor and the Remeron does cause dry mouth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he still taking the Meclizine?  Antivert?</p>

<p>CG: I'm thinking of Remeron, is that the same thing?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Meclizine was a dizziness pill.</p>

<p>CG: Oh, no, he's not taking that.  He's not taking that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That causes much more dry mouth than either - </p>

<p>CG: I think when he started taking that, he stopped it because the dry mouth was so bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, because Meclizine will do that.</p>

<p>CG: And he said forget it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Effexor XR shouldn't cause too much dry mouth.  Remeron can, but not as much as alternatives.  Even the - </p>

<p>CG: I always look at the side effects when he starts to complain about something, those two both say, yknow, creates dry mouth.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That shouldn't be very high on the list, it should be very low on the list of side effects because they're not that common with those two, they're not prominent side effects with them.</p>

<p>CG: Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're not taking any other, any allergy pills or anything like that?</p>

<p>CG: No allergy pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How about anything for the bladder?  Ditropan?</p>

<p>CG: He takes - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think the last list I have -</p>

<p>CG: Flomax, he takes Avodart - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Flomax, Avodart, the Meclizine was stopped 'cause that was actually on this list.</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.  Let me see if anything has been changed, I'll tell you if there's anything different.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p>CG: Oh, the Ambien went up to [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Years ago he told me that one, [INAUDIBLE] turned yellow.</p>

<p>CG: I don't have - </p>

<p>CG: Oh, that was, that was [INAUDIBLE] something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p>CG: Well, you had it for such a short time, I couldn't remember that name.  [INAUDIBLE] He's also taking two blood pressure pills that I don't have on here.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you remember the names of either?</p>

<p>CG: The one is Atenolol?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Atenolol?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah and the other one is, uh, Norvasc.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Norvasc, okay.</p>

<p>CG: I apparently didn't put him on that [INAUDIBLE] - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I think even though the Effexor and Remeron may not be very common side effects with them, my guess is that between the two blood pressure medications, the Remeron, the Effexor, the Avodart, and the Flomax, I think all of them - </p>

<p>CG: A combination of all that, you're gonna have dry mouth?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes, because of each of them, I think if you take them by themselves wouldn't necessarily cause it, but you get the cumulative effect.</p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When taking several things with the same kind of side effects.  I just wanted to check on Avodart, I don't remember if that one does or doesn't. </p>

<p>CG: I don't remember if I looked that one up I don't think it said it.  It starts blurring in my mind.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED], happy [DEIDENTIFIED] by the way, too.</p>

<p>CG: At least it feels a little better out there, a little more like spring.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> As opposed to last Friday?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.  I just, I didn't even touch the ice when I was outside.  I put the shovel down, I thought I was going to shovel, I thought forget that, I don't want a heart attack.  I just put the shovel away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I had to get the hoe out to actually shovel.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's what I ended up using.  Four pages on it.  Okay, let's see here, precautions, precautions, precautions, [INAUDIBLE]. I don't see dry mouth as one of the major [INAUDIBLE].  If the dry mouth becomes so bad, I mean theoretically we could cut the Remeron back a little bit, instead of taking the one and a half just take one. </p>

<p>CG: Oh, he's only taking one now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just one?  Not one and a half?</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, I guess that wasn't changed - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </p>

<p>CG: [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said go down to one.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, because that's something we could do.</p>

<p>CG: He's been on that for a long while.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Although, January - </p>

<p>CG: Yeah, somewhere right after that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, Yeah.  I mean in terms of trying to cut it back, I wouldn't suggest cutting back any further on either of the two antidepressants, I would keep those the same. </p>

<p>CG: I used to cut one in half when - </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was just gonna say cut it in half again, but - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That would be very cautious of that, only because, yknow, you're doing well right now and I wouldn't want you to have one of those periods where the anxiety and depression was real severe again and I think the Remeron 15, that's the lowest tablet that they make of it and the Effexor, you're taking 75 once a day, that's a very, on the low end of the dose as well.  That combination is what keeps Klonopin at hand and everything else under control, then I wouldn't want to take any other risks.  I think if you go too low with the Remeron, then you run the risk of the anxiety getting worse, too.</p>

<p>CG: So just drink a lot of water.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or hard candy, that's the other thing, having a mint.</p>

<p>CG: That's not a bad idea.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huh.</p>

<p>CG: Having a mint.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A mint?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> For the dry mouth.</p>

<p>CG: Our those sour balls, too, probably could create better one. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll tell you, sometimes a plain piece of stone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some peppermints or cinnamon and I think there is some grape in there too. </p>

<p>CG: I have some at home, I'll have to -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have a few extra here, besides the [INAUDIBLE] Remeron, so that's good. </p>

<p>CG: Uh-huh.  [INAUDIBLE] a little bit at a time, [INAUDIBLE] started to go down lower.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't need any renewals on anything today?</p>

<p>CG: No, I'm pretty sure I have everything.  Uh, I have, yknow, two or three renewals on them and they're ninety days things, so that winds up being another month.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you want to I mean we could go, I think we did like two months this last time.  You wanna go like maybe ten weeks, like right before the [DEIDENTIFIED] holiday.</p>

<p>CG: Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> In that ball park?</p>

<p>CG: Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wednesday, [DATE], at two thirty.</p>

<p>CG: Uh, something going on - I'll have to look and see.  Wednesday - </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [DATE]</p>

<p>CG: [DATE].  Okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well you take care then.  Keep doing well.  I'm glad to hear about the eyes, good news.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah, maybe he'll be able to read a little more, that's another problem, he can't read and do other things.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So give it a try once it's all healed and see how it goes.  Hopefully, you'll be back to reading again.</p>

<p>CG: He needs something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> He told me about the TV too.</p>

<p>CG: Oh, yeah, we have a great big one.  I needed that too, I can't see the small print. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's great.</p>

<p>CG: The next one's for [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Take care.  You did the right stuff to get the eyes taken care of.</p>

<p>CG: Yeah.  Happy [DEIDENTIFIED].    </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]. Have a Happy [DEIDENTIFIED] yourself. Okay? Okay, bye-bye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hi.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hi.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I could tell by the smiling you're in a better mood, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she had a friend over after school today, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Somebody from the high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've known her from fifth grade.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So you're back at school now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You like it this time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Is it different than before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  But you feel happier because she came over.  What's her name?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You happier that she came spend time with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was fun, yeah.  We always hang out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  How did the week go?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Long week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What made it long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	School.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	School.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You going to talk about your week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has there been any difficulty at home?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She had an issue with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your sister, what happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I did?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I didn't even talk to you about it.  You don't even know what I know?  So why don't you share it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I don't know it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] was on the phone with [NAME OTHER].  You and [NAME OTHER] were on the phone with [NAME OTHER].  Did you come out with a knife?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was a joke.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was a joke, it scared your sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me what happened.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I came out with like a big knife for a joke.  I was like [NAME OTHER] thinks I'm crazy now, what about now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who thinks you're crazy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just a joke.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but that's still scary with knives.  I mean, did it scare him too?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He wasn't there, he was on the phone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It scared [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She talked to you about it after?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why, because, you know, you've been threatening to hurt people or yourself.  If you hurt yourself, maybe she's afraid you would hurt her too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just scared her.  You shouldn't have a butcher knife.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did she say anything to you?  She didn't say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she didn't say anything to me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And she didn't say anything to me the day that it happened either.  And I'd asked her if there was any issues.  And then she sent me an e—mail the next day when she was at school because she had nightmares about it.  So I think you guys are going to go see [NAME OTHER] on Tuesday, which is the earliest appointment I could get.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Isn't that when I see [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, you see [NAME OTHER] Monday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Monday?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is your therapist, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is her therapist and [NAME OTHER] my therapist and [NAME OTHER] therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.  So she'll see her with your sister and you can talk about the episode.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And why it scared your sister.  I haven't even told [NAME OTHER].  I've just not said anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you have to?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I suppose.  Don't you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because it was just a joke?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.  Nobody understands that but me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Understands what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That it was just a joke.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, could you not tell her dad?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, well, actually not her dad, her stepdad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] and I, her stepdad and I are going to see [NAME OTHER] tonight.  It'll probably be brought up then because just because we're going because of the issues between the girls and stuff, whatnot, family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You go together to see?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  But it'll bring it up, it's like he'll find out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To family counseling, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that okay with you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I guess.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's not a big deal.  You just, you scared your sister.  What else happened this week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You got a retainer.  You got your TMJ device which you've been waiting for.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that helping?  The headaches are better, you can't tell?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't have headaches.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She has backaches and they're very severe today, so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are they, they're not any better.  Battery replacement.  What'd she say?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We were talking about being late for her dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you called for him to come at six fifteen or come late.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I told him to come at six forty five.  And then [NAME OTHER] verified that that was okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  So what do you do at his house this weekend?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just hang out or?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe celebrate your birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When's your birthday?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Happy birthday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to be home by then, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'll be home Sunday night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're not afraid to go to his house?  I mean, you feel pretty comfortable?  Your sister's not going, just you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel comfortable there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you less worried, I mean, the last time she went we had all those problems.  But you're not as worried?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, the problems stem from, you know, [PATIENT NAME] wanted to take her medicine or not, and [PATIENT NAME], I think she's learning that the medicine helps, yes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, tell me what it does for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it was the Depakote, that seemed like a good medicine for you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could you tell the difference?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, tell me, what you could tell.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your mood seems happier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Do you get less thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Have you had, you haven't cut yourself, right?  Pull up your sleeves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, let's just see your forearms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wear t—shirts around you all the time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.  See, no cuts.  So we're having better moods.  You think the Depakote helps with that then, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And no side effects?  Did you get the blood level on her yet?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but you probably won't get it quite yet.  We did it on Wednesday, Thursday, just yesterday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No side effects or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Twenty pounds.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Weight gain, she's complaining about the weight gain since she went on it and so I, what else did we do this week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Joined Curves.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Joined Curves so that she can use the exercise equipment three days a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Will you go and do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's close enough where she can ride her bike.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a good point though.  I mean, to control her weight, you know, it's important.  So I think maybe watch your carb intake as well.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, we sat, we went to the doctor for a couple of reasons and we talked about weight loss because I think she got a little mad at me during that appointment—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Talked about what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Weight loss.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the doctor?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With the doctor.  And I think she got upset with me because it's like everything I told her is the same thing he's going to tell her, so I said, you know, he had no suggestions other than, you know, what goes in has to come out, calories.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, as far as calories and watching carbs will lower the fat.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, so eat more meat, less noodles, exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you been doing that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just saw him yesterday.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean, she knows.  It's the same thing I tell her.  She just, you know, everybody would like that magic pill that just takes 20 pounds, or 40 or 50 go away.  I keep apologizing for my genes that run through her body, but she really just has to learn to work with them.  So I'm trying to help her work with them.  Are we getting there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Who else did you talk to today?  The social worker at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Did you have some problem with her?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We just talked.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PATIENT NAME] refuses to dress for gym.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So she told me on the way over here that the gym teacher has the pass already written out to send her down to the dean's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before he even comes out of the locker room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So every day she's been going to the dean?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And so the dean sent her over to the social worker today.  So she sat and talk to the social worker and.  They're not yelling at her.  They know she's not going to dress.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you talk to the social worker?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's actually you felt more protective than the gym?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could they set that up instead to go over every day or not?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, apparently they're just going to give her a pass to go to the dean.  They're supposed to be setting her up with the groups and the dean, the dean's aware now that I want him to set up the groups and that's what this period should be used for.  They just haven't done it.  And I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does she have any meetings or do you have any meetings with the school set up at this point?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mom, my chest hurts again.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you anxious?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know, it hurt all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your chest hurts, where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like right here and right here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you don't think you're anxious today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So you're not quite sure why it hurts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is that that pain in the abdomen?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, that's over here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often do you get those pains?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Chest pain and the abdomen pain?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Both.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The abdomen pain every now and then, and the chest pain, I don't know, just today.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Normally when you have anxiety though.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but nothing's wrong.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are you worried about going to your dad's 'cause of you're going to be with [NAME OTHER] all day tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean, I don't want to be, but.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that's not bothering you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My stepmom.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Her dad works tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, so she'll be alone with [NAME OTHER].  How do you feel about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And you don't think that's what's bothering you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can't wait.  No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you could sleep in or something.  Could you do that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or bring some homework assignments and tell them you have to study.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do that.  I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and study so you won't have to spend the whole time with her.  How about that?  All right, well, we'll keep this end, the Depakote is still 1,500, correct?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The Depakote is still 1,500 and you should have the level by next week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we'll keep it 'til we get the level, and everything else is pretty stable, so.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You good with the Lexapro, because in the beginning of the week you were a little worried about school.  Are you feeling better/</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I need to know 'cause for here that's what we're here for.  You don't feel anxious during the school day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay, 'cause on Monday you thought you might wanted to kick up the Lexapro to 20.  But you don't feel like you need it now?  You were just, you'd been more relaxed throughout the week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes or no?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't know if you're more relaxed at the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are more relaxed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Her mood looks general depressed, let's keep it the same, let's keep it the same.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  I think she's tired during the day.  I do think she's too tired during the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean, it might be too much Depakote.  Let's wait and see before I [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or the Seroquel during the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much of that are you taking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fifty once.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then 50 again after school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but after school.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then 200 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if we switched it to 250 at night and don't take any in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I already have problems getting up 'cause I take 200 of Seroquel and then.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we'll just leave it for another week and see how your sleep goes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But that 50 mg during the day might be really making her tired.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She slept, she went down to the nurse's one day and slept.  She was just going to come home and they asked her just to sleep at the nurse's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What if we do this?  What if we do 100 after school and then the 200 at night?  Just try to cut out the 50 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's try that and see if you're less tired during the day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Is that a good idea for you or do you want to leave everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel you need the 50 in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What if we do the dose like earlier in the day after school, 'cause I can't get up in the morning.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what he just said, 100 right after school.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, but he says 200—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At bedtime still.  Can't we put like 200 earlier?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, 'cause I'm thinking if we switch that, once you get up the Seroquel will start wearing off to some degree so you'll be less tired during the day.  Let's just do that to see if you're less tired during the day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To see if you're less tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	'Cause you're tired when you get up then you take another 50 of Seroquel first thing in the morning, you're going to get more tired.  So you'll be tired during the school day.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She'll take it, after school take the 100.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm saying like, 'cause I'm 'cause the 200 at night is so much, like in the morning I can't get up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're tired, and so then you take another 50 and so you're tired already.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't get up, I don't even get up on time.  I can't get up on time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, another approach we can do if we wanted to cut back maybe do 150 or do 100 and 100, let's see, you take 50 and 50.  Do 100 after school, do 100 at bedtime, and then just do 50 in the morning.  So that should reduce it by 50 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's try that.  All right?  And you have the 100 mg pills, so you can do that, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we cut them in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we leave them whole, so yes, we have 100 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So do 100 after school, 100 at bedtime, and 50 in the morning, and we'll see her in a week and see if she's less tired.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

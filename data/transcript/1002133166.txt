<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of his or her particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>The therapist featured in this transcript is Dr. Russell J. Becker, a noted pastoral counselor. Dr. Becker graduated from Kalamazoo College in Michigan in 1944 and received a B.D. degree from the Colgate Rochester Divinity School in 1946.  He received his PhD. Degree in theology from the University of Chicago in 1950 and while there, he studied with noted therapist Carl Rogers at the Counseling Center.  During the time of his studies there, he collaborated with Dr. Rogers on an article on basic counseling which appeared in the first issue of the new journal, <i>Pastoral Psychology</i>.  Dr. Becker would go on to contribute many articles and book chapters in the area of pastoral psychology and the interaction between religion and mental health. He authored books entitled <i>Family Pastoral Care</i> (Prentice-Hall, 1965) and <i>When Marriage Ends</i> (Fortress Press, 1971).</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following interview is a demonstration session of joint marital counseling. It occurs as a demonstration interview in front of a group of about 25 to 30 naval chaplains, men who are at various stages of service and experience in the Navy chaplaincy. The interview with this couple, Mr. and Mrs. Navnor took place a day immediately following their initial request to the base chaplain for assistance in their marriage. Because the base chaplain had been alerted to my interest in conducting a demonstration of joint marital counseling, he offered my services to the couple. They accepted and they accepted the terms of participating as a demonstration interview in front of the group. (0:01:13.2)</p>

<p>At the outset the chaplain introducing the couple to the counselor is barely audible because of very considerable background noise. People still adjusting their seats, and there continues to be some steady background noise of air conditioning equipment. The audibility of the record immediately improves, however. The initial interview follows.</p>

<p>BEGIN SESSION:</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: (Inaudible at 0:01:49.6) I'd like to have you wait (inaudible at 0:01:50.9). The chaplain sergeant has told me that not only you have a problem, but you were kind enough to come into this particular setting seeking help. Each of these men here are chaplains, and as ministers would be concerned to be of help. Their interest will be in the helping process, but I'm here to be interested in you. Would you like to tell me what brings you here?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Well, we still can't get along (inaudible at 0:02:58.0) can't see eye to eye on things.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Things seem farther apart than they ought to be?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Much farther.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER:I take it you've tried to work this out in some way with yourselves and come to an impasse or get no place?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:03:54.2) she just came back home for about five weeks. She went back with her family for five weeks, nothing changed when she came back.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: You thought you would just try a separation for a little while and see if you'd get a different perspective or feel differently about things or what was it?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Thought it might work.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But it's the same old situation when you got back, is that it? 0:04:30.5</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So the question is now what?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's the question.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER:I guess you figure you've tried everything you know how to get along or to work it out?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Reasonable basis and including this time away, and it just doesn't look any better for either one of you, is that right?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I don't know we just can't seem to talk to one another. And I think things could be straightened out, but we just can't express ourselves, at least I can't. I get disgusted and clam up (inaudible at 0:05:47.1) say anything (inaudible at 0:05:48.1).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So, times when you need most to talk things through, why, your own reaction is one of closing off all talk, closing off all talking through?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yeah, so I give in, I won't argue, doesn't seem to be any point.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: You drop the argument, but (inaudible at 0:06:16.8).</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I either agree or I just cut him off.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: That's the kind of feeling, you drop the argument and go on feeling your own feelings?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And in a way this doesn't really help?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: No.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Somehow, I guess you're saying, perhaps the both of you, it's hard to handle in words the way you do feel at times, hard to put it across to the other one, is that it for each of you?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So in a real way, I sense you don't want things to take a bad turn or stay that way and yet, kind of feel helpless to get through to him, get through to the other one, your own point of view, your own picture on the situation. Kind of like you're being trapped in two different parts of the cave, two different turns the cave could have and you're really just off by yourself, as isolated as that from each other at these times, and hurt and angry and alone. Is that the way it is? Is that the way it is for you?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Well, when an argument does arise, I usually bring up the past, things that have hurt me; I just don't forget them very easily and I just keep reminding him of it.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: That is when you get going in the thick of it you want to say all that you haven't said before.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And you got your memories well rehearsed and</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: This is the time to let them out. 0:09:45.6</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: They're just minor, little things, I can't pin them down to exact times or places, but I just— things that just seem to stay there in my mind, just don't erase very easily.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Kind of— it's a picture in my own mind of a sowing pin cushion, you know, each one of those little pins, it's a little thing, but it hurts because it's sticking in you and easy to bring up, easy to remember, easy to try to push out, push back.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm. They may seem silly or selfish when you repeat them, but they don't to me.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Because they may seem like little hurts or</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Childish hurts maybe even?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But they're hurts.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And they've ached, and I guess you're saying you really want him to know.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I can't tell him, though.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Pardon?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I can't (inaudible at 0:11:35.4) to tell him that (inaudible at 0:11:35.4) because I get (inaudible at 0:11:43.2) that it's my fault or it's a laughing matter or it gets some remark from— I mean, I'm just not a person that can take remarks. Sometimes I don't know how to accept things. And the more you can let some things slide by, I just don't. I mean, I just don't have that sense of humor in that way, I guess.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Your husband may try to just toss it off or toss it aside, perhaps even lightly sometimes when you do bring these things up, and seem to be saying that hurts all the more?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes, it does.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: With the kind of feeling, well, maybe I'm</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Like you're being laughed at or something.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Maybe I'm a very sensitive person, but nonetheless, that's the way I am, is that the way you end up feeling?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes. I mean, like, I can't argue with a neighbor or something, I'll end up crying before, I mean, if something's happened over here and something like that, I (inaudible at 0:13:05.1) go in the house or just walk away or just not argue with them. I mean, I usually end up having a good bawling session over it and then I feel a lot better.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But when something unfair happens, it hurts you and you end up having to pour your hurt out in tears in some way? 0:13:30.8</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: (Inaudible at 0:13:39.6) usually get over it, but maybe that's with the neighbors. You seem to be saying with your husband, I keep remembering these things?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Everything seems to be�that I could let him, let my husband really know how I feel without having it become a situation and another fight and another argument, the letting him know how I feel?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Be a cause for another hurt on your part?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I don't ask several times, I mean, I don't like to beg for things. And I'll ask once or twice and if I'm refused, that's it. I'm not going to keep asking or going to be asked more than twice (inaudible at 0:15:21.9).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: That is you don't want to keep getting at him, but when he doesn't take your requests seriously, your inquiry seriously, then what, you smolder a bit?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: No, if I can't do it myself, I find someone that can help me. I can be very independent if I want to.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But you get a kind of feeling, you won't help me, forget about it, I'll go about it my own way, is that it?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: If I can't do it then�</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: I'll get other</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: If it gets left, I do it the best way I know how.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: How do these things look to you?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:16:41.4) at home (inaudible at 0:16:44.0).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: At home too. Not sure what you mean by that, are you saying by that— that not going to make a big deal out of everything, is that it?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Or is your feeling of perhaps, I don't want to argue with her, there's a disagreement or maybe she can come around or</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Oh, we argue, that's (inaudible at 0:17:42.7).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So you're kind of saying, the times you really get into the (inaudible at 0:17:52.8) and other times you would just rather sit and listen?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: I sit and listen and walk out and forget it.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Turn away from it all, wait until she gets over it, is that it? 0:18:10.7</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Yeah, either that or wait till I get over it.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Saying by that, you can get kind of steamed up and need time to cool off. So you've been sitting listening here too, what do you hear your wife saying, what she said earlier?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:19:23.0) she has a hard way of expressing (inaudible at 0:19:23.2).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER:As if she may not be able to get it to you with the real feelings she wants you to know about, is that it?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Want me to know about or everybody else?</p>

<p>DR. BECKER:I don't know; is that your feeling at times that</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: It's just kind of put on the Public Broadcasting system and you're waiting for it to turn off, is that it?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Not silence.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And she can make you pretty angry when she gets to going, huh?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: But I get pretty angry.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Because she's what, throwing everything at you or</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: No, just misunderstanding (inaudible at 0:20:37.0).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Interpreting it way different than what you mean?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:20:46.8) I figure that a marriage ought to be two people's ideas, not just one, and give up an idea then expect that to be it and no argument about it. (Inaudible at 0:21:03.6) that way, I never have and I never will.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And you get the feeling at times that she throws an idea at you, and it's, you know, it's take it or leave it or it's in that form? And that really bristles. I mean, that really gets you angry enough to what, throw it right back or turn on your heels and depart or�</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: I've argued back.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Both?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Both.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But you seem to be saying it's a take this or else attitude that really sets you off?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's right.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And you really expect things to be matters that you would talk over or two people would agree upon, two people have a chance to consider at least?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's right.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So I sense that there's a time when you were�point out the hurts you felt and what may be adding more than the thick of the moment to the situation, but feeling as though you're not taken seriously when you do try at these times to get through to your husband. And I hear you saying that it comes to you as a very high-handed or critical kind of attack, and you get your defenses up?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:24:34.1).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER:Is that the situation?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Not the way I see it.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Not really, not fully, huh? Tell me more. 0:24:51.7</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I think what he was referring to was the recent incident, I did go over his head, but it's been once in seven years and he disliked it. But I have helped him out of a lot of situations. I mean, I think I have given all that I have (inaudible at 0:25:11.5) was refused and just wanted it - I felt that we could do it, we really couldn't in a way, but we've always (inaudible at 0:25:23.3) other times to get ourselves other things, or fix things up or get along somehow.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So you think he kind of has a reference to a specific situation here in which you</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: You more or less took the bull by the horns and decided to go ahead, what, buying something or (inaudible at 0:25:47.6)?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes, I purchased something.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And you know that really made him angry?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes, it did. And it seems as though if there's something he wants, we always find a way to make it out. I have remarked that I wanted something once, and a friend of our neighbor of ours got something, so if they have it, there's no reason we can't have it. It isn't what I really wanted, I wouldn't argue with him, but we'll put it down on paper, we could do it financially, so that was it.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: (Inaudible at 0:26:47.8) when he decides that you can do something, why, very often that could be done?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: That's it, if I disagree or not.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: It works both ways.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But you're saying this comes around from the other end too?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's the only part of our marriage that is 50/50.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Where both of you go off on your own?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's right.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: That's the only part where you feel things really get bounced off, huh?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: They bounce themselves out there.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Yeah, but not elsewhere?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Nowhere else.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: What are you saying? You feel like you're on the short end of the deal?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: No, (inaudible at 0:28:00.4) some things, yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So you disagree and you get angry with each other, or don't like what the other one has decided to do or the more— how everything is all right for the other, but not for me, some of what you're saying at various times and places and these things just keep accumulating, is that it?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: That's right.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: I sense that getting your point of view over to the other or discussing anything through with the other is a very difficult thing.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: It has been ever since we got married.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: This is no new thing, huh?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Lived with it seven years.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: What's your feeling</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:30:00.7).</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Right from the start?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Off and on.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And you feel this put up with it until you feel you can't any longer and then have tried to see if just time away would do it, would help. But it's still the same problem of, you know, how can I talk to you or how can you talk to me? 0:30:46.7</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Out of the seven years we've been married, the six of it he's been to sea. This is really the first time that we have been together this length of time. That before when we had an argument like that, he always seemed to go back to sea and everything would cool off. And things would be in our letters, things are going to be different when you change or I can express myself in a letter.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Writing.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: And I mean, I can't to his face, and I think that's the only reason we have gotten along this long, I mean, with him being at sea so much.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And seven years sounds like a long time, but</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Really it's not.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Maybe it's really just one year?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes. Maybe I've had my independence too long because I've had money to take care of— to pay our bills, I mean, I've had the car. If I want to put the kids in the car and we go to the beach, I could go, now I ask for it, I refuse (inaudible at 0:32:04.6) hurt. I mean, I've just come and go as I please. I've never neglected my children and I have run no bills on him, just this recent one. I mean, I feel as though I've tried.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: You're kind of saying there is quite a switch really for you. You've been trying to make it, but it is quite a switch?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes, it is.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: When everything is up to you, you just go ahead and do it and when suddenly, but at one point from that point on for a while your husband's there, why, perhaps it isn't easier, it isn't natural, it isn't what you've grown accustomed to, to consult or to really ask, or what may seem like begging permission for things you would ordinarily just gone ahead and done, is that it?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But I guess I hear you saying even though you've been somewhat aware of this as a problem, you've been trying to work at it. And this one instance more or less drew a line about how much you would trim your sails and give in. But for the most part, I guess I hear you saying it's been a difficult matter and I've been working at it.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I haven't been working at the point where I try to discuss things with him. It just seems to be a losing battle, so I haven't even tried. There's been lots of things I'd like to discuss with him. As he has said, I use the broadcasting system, I ask my neighbor's advice or I have a couple of friends I do go and cry on their shoulder sometimes. I mean, I have to release my feelings to someone and I can't do it to him. And I think he releases his-self too (inaudible at 0:34:50.2) in a different way.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Can't have a load of reactions all bottled up and not have come out someplace I guess you're saying, either one of you.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But you seem also to be saying, this isn't the way I'd like it to come out. 0:35:15.9</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: No.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Partially, you're saying also, maybe I've been wrong in not trying some new way, or trying somehow to work at this one of getting through to him when I do get a bottled up set of feelings, is that right?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I mean, after you've wrestled with four children all day long, you may have something you'd like to tell him at night when he comes in from work, and blare it at him maybe when he comes in the door, this has gone wrong, or that's gone wrong. And you get a reply, "Don't bother me with your troubles, I've had it at the office today." So why discuss it with him? I mean, I don't feel as though I'm going to get anywhere if he can't spend the time to listen to me. Maybe it is something happened over so and so, or something here or</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Kind of saying, maybe I pounce on him when he comes in the door because I've been through a lot during the day, but (inaudible at 0:36:37.5).</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: But if I wait and tell him if one of the children tell him before I do, and then I get yelled at for not telling him. For instance, a little while ago our little three-year-old was hit be a car and the minute he walked in the door, I should have blared in his face, your daughter was hit by a car today. I waited until the next morning and our little six-year-old told him. I mean, I had intentions of telling him.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But you can get wrong— be wrong either way?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Whether you do or you don't.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Like, I've asked him to speak to the children about matters that I think he should, and I usually get some smart answer and that's just it. I mean, I guess it's I just don't know how to take them. It goes way back to an incident when I ask him about razor blades, if he would keep them out of the children's reach and he says, "Would you give them some shaving cream," or something like that, but</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Oh, wait a minute, now slow down. 0:37:53.7</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: I mean that's a little far fetched.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: It's mighty far fetched.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: No, it is not.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: I came home one day and she told me the kids were playing with the razor, didn't cut himself, why worry about it? If he cut himself; something to worry about, am I supposed to sit down and cry about it? He didn't cut himself, the kid wasn't hurt.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Well, you could tell—at least put them out of the way.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Bring up another one while she's bringing that up. Little boy played out in the street on his tricycle, (inaudible at 0:38:21.7) two or three days in a row, put him in his room at night, thought it was enough punishment. Kids are going to play in the street. If you live in a place like that they're going to play in the street, can't get away from it. I come home one night and she— I was setting there watching TV and she told me, "Guess what?" I said, "What," she said, "Your boy was riding a bicycle out in the street and three days I punished him." So I told her, I said, "Buy him a crash helmet in case he gets hit." I didn't mean anything by it, it was just the idea that the kid is going to play in the street, he's going to play in the street, that's all there is to it. Boys will boys, I don't care. I've done the same thing myself when I was a kid. I've been told not to do things and I turned right around and did them myself when I was a kid.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So I guess I hear</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: It's a bunch of petty stuff; it doesn't have anything to do with what the situation is now.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Well, I guess I hear you saying that you try to respond really to the situations that she will draw your attention about the children. You may not respond exactly the way she wants.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: It doesn't do me any good to punish them in the evening when they get away with it all day long.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Something</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Not fair to the child I don't think.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: They're all under the dam by then and this is no time to be settling the scores, is that it? 0:40:00.7</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I still— that's something we disagree and I think you can talk to a child. I don't punish my children. I mean, if I get real disgusted and mad at them, I lick them or I hit them, but I don't beat them continuously and [that we were expect in my childhood] (ph) because they're going to turn around, I got hit, you know, if I did it or not. Well, I talk to my children and they don't mind me. I can yell at them sixty times a day, their father steps in the room and speaks once and that's it. He just has a demanding authority there or something, I don't know what it is, but they mind him a lot better than they do me. But I can't see beating a kid every time he doesn't— or just hauling off and whacking them or hitting them. And I have heard my children in little discussions on the porch with their playmates. They know when I talk to them, they know what's right and wrong, they do it though. They'd be slaphappy if I hit them every time they didn't move when I ask them to, and I've seen some children that get switched every time they've asked to, and they don't mind any better than mine do. My kids are no angels, but they're no devils either.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: I guess you're kind of responding to this point that, well, maybe you ought to discipline them during the day.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: They get punished when they do something.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Like you're saying to that, that you may do some disciplining, but you're not going to overdo it.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: And that your real preference is to talk the thing through with them, so that they understand what you expect of them.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm. Not talk way over their heads.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: But I also sense that you really admire the fact that when your husband does speak, it gets through to them and sometimes you would like him to add this note to the course, or add this word at the end of the day.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: They tend to jump when he speaks. I mean, if I say something to their father, they won't touch it, yet, they'll get in my jewelry box, or they get in my perfume, or if I'm in the bathroom they just come barging in, but if he's in there, they won't go.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So it feels pretty hard to handle the authority as clearly as he does with them, but</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I've heard</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Times you'd like him to add something.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: The six-year-old say to the three-year-old, "You're not supposed to do that, mommy won't like that or that isn't nice," or something like that, or "You shouldn't talk like that." I mean, it gets through to them in a way, they know and they tell the younger one.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So, you know, basically, they're registering what's right and what's wrong.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: So basically, you're really not worried.</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: They're never been into serious, with anything serious. They have childhood (inaudible at 0:43:10.5) them back and they have their little arguments, but five minutes later they're playing together again. I've had two mothers on my neck, but it's just over little things. I mean, my child is older and my child is bigger, please don't pick on my son. I mean, it's just things like that, where I mean, the person would turn around and hit back, I think he would be a lot better off. But I don't like them picking fights, but if they're going to get hurt, I'm not going to run out there all day long and say don't hit my son, don't look at my son, or don't do this to my daughter. They can settle their own little arguments.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: This is an interesting thing and in a real way both of you seem to be saying here the kids are getting along, and getting along all right. And yet, in spite of this, you're going to have a lot of [knock down] (ph) to do about a shade of disagreement or a little tidbit of the whole thing on top of it. And there's a little, in a sense, that basically, things are going all right for the kids, they'll manage and they are managing. It's kind of strange. That is, the things that are so— with basic things in terms of how the children are coming, being in fair shape, to find yourselves in so much of a crossfire with each other. 0:45:33.1</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: It's not only the children. I think they get blamed for lots of things sometimes, really isn't the reason.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: That is, the disagreements are over more than them?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Yes.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: This is kind of back to this matter, the two of you now just— for the first time now in the past year, I guess you're saying, really having to find a way of living together, back to that kind of thing, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Not sure where this brings us to at this particular point. Maybe you would like a chance to do some more talking, or an opportunity to come again and explore this a little bit further. Not necessarily in this setting, but to explore it further in terms of other facets of what represent disagreements that we may not have touched upon today, and that you would like to utilize (inaudible at 0:48:10.8) hour for this purpose. Is this something you would like to do further?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: I don't know, if it would help things I'd do it every day, doesn't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: What time are you available tomorrow?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Probably about the same time, in the afternoon.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Twelve-thirty?</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:49:06.2).</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: It's a little early for me.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Twelve-thirty is (inaudible at 0:49:08.6).</p>

<p>MRS. NAVNOR: I could make it, though.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Twelve-thirty at the chaplain's office, I could see you there and see if this will help a little bit more.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: Okay.</p>

<p>DR. BECKER: Appreciate your willingness to let these other chaplains get in on our conversation, and I do hope it starts something that is of help for you. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>MR. NAVNOR: (Inaudible at 0:49:48.4).</p>

<p>END SESSION</p>

<p>THERAPIST'S NOTE:</p>

<p>As the couple left the parking area, they had a slight mishap with the car and the husband went to the dispensary for some first aid assistance. At which time his wife exercised a considerable solicitousness with respect to his well being. And this had a healthy effect following their session together, and they continued to talk together in a rich and full way through the balance of the day. The next day when they appeared for the interview scheduled, without the demonstration audience present, they reported a more happy relationship, a more solid understanding of each other, and a greater sense of confidence in their ability to work things out. So after that second session, they— no further appointments seem to be indicated and no appointment was made.</p>

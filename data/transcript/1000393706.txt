<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I quit college and then worked and then I went back to college about three years ago to finish. And I was alone and I didn't know anyone. And I didn't live on campus. And all that I, really all that I did was like study. And yeah, I guess I really did feel like I was doing something. I didn't feel anything that I normally feel. I guess that makes sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kinda doesn't, I don't understand what..</p>

<p>CLIENT: What don't you understand the whole thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What about it makes sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh that here I actually was doing what I always thought I should and I was feeling good about it. 0:01:05.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So actually maybe it's not wrong that I'm feeling bad about these things because the one time in my life that I did them, I felt good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So maybe there's the reason for you to not, maybe there's good reason for you to feel you're not doing so well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh there is. Because I'm not doing anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels to you like you're just stagnating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah. If I really stopped to think about it, yes that's very true. Although that's something I don't think about very often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I even do that in day to day life. I mean I really procrastinate. I don't do things. And I can't blame that on James because I didn't do things before. 0:02:12.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This trip to Europe. Now I did buy a plane ticket and I've got a passport. And I'm amazed that I've done that. But I haven't done anything else at all about it. I mean I don't even know where I'm going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I want to know where I'm going and I want to make some reservations for hotels. And I don't know anything about anything. Some transportation and stuff. I don't know anything about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not doing anything about it real quickly. I could do it tomorrow but I'm not going to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. It's not that you don't know what to do, it's just like you're not doing it. 0:03:09.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly what it is. And it's (inaudible at 0:03:15.2) Maybe I would feel better with James if I would leave him sometimes too. I mean for a day or two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't do that either. Talking about him, the only reason that I wanted to leave him is not for me in my own, this is what I think it's so that I won't be boring to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not because I wanted to be you know (inaudible at 0:03:52.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you want to leave him before you become displeased with him. 0:04:02.9</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't mean leave permanently. I mean for a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For a vacation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For a day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just so you don't get on his nerves and he doesn't start finding you dull.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have done that. A couple of times I've gone away for the weekend and I was extremely proud of myself. Oh my God. Out of proportion proud of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, look what I've done. I've finally managed to do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying like you shouldn't be that..</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I didn't do anything that special.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well except that it sounds special for you. Like it's awfully hard to do. Awfully hard to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm hearing you say like you know for other people or something it wouldn't be such a big deal. 0:04:55.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And actually maybe doing some of the things that I think I should do on my own. Why don't I, I think I don't do them because I suddenly want to go out and be around people or something. I don't know why I don't do it. I don't feel depressed about this but I feel like I'm wasting time. 0:06:20.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now wasting time? Or wasting time..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here. Yeah, here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How? Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, I'm sure I know. I'm just not thinking. I don't know, I don't know if these things are important or not. I mean I guess they are, but I go both ways. I mean I think that's not important, I think yes it is. Just like I think that I really feel things and then I think no you don't really feel those you're just feeling sorry for yourself or being spoiled. Do you understand? 0:07:36.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me make sure I do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying like on the one hand sometimes you're very much into what you're feeling. And then some other times like it just flips for you and you say to yourself, "Hey, I wasn't really feeling that at all. I was kidding myself. I'm just spoiled."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, I guess what you're talking about but not entirely clear.0:08:14.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah well, it's like I don't know which is the truth. And I don't think that both things can be true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's because I guess I think it's wrong to feel the way, the different ways that I do. And so I, maybe that's it. And I say, "Well you didn't feel anything. You're just angry or spoiled or feeling sorry for yourself or something. Because it's wrong to feel like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You're looking at me like, no that's not it. 0:08:56.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know if it's it or not. I, there's something in that thing, you know. But yeah. I guess I don't now. Like you'll be angry. You say that you'll be angry with James and then you'll say no I wasn't really angry I was just feeling sorry for myself? I don't understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know about anger. I mean, yeah that could be something. No, being depressed. That's a better example of feeling sorry for myself. I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hmm. But then you say, "Well no, I'm not depressed. I wasn't really depressed." What's the difference? Between you being depressed and feeling sorry for yourself. Maybe that would..</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because to me being depressed is, maybe I feel that's all right. Yeah. That's something real. But feeling sorry for yourself you shouldn't do.0:09:55.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it doesn't, ok. So it sounds like it isn't that you call the feelings into question. You don't say, "Well, I wasn't feeling that." It's like is it all right to have felt that or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're depressed, like it's all right. But if you're feeling sorry for yourself, that's a bad thing. I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it's not even all right to be depressed. But it's better to be depressed than feel sorry for yourself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I get the feeling like nobler or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feeling sorry for yourself is real..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is selfish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Selfish and XX0:10:35.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: XX0:10:39.5</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Do I have to go? I mean I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we started at..</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was late I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't know. Do you want to stop? I don't know. Let's see. We started about five minutes late I guess. So about five minutes. 0:11:06.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you wanted or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it doesn't matter. I just wondered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I see you possibly this Friday instead of Thursday, is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. This has been a bad month for Thursdays.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that really all right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It'll just you know, my God I won't be able to be with James. I'll feel horribly.0:11:43.4</p>

<p>0:12:18.1</p>

<p>CLIENT: Make you wait. I bet the traffic isn't too long now. It's usually not bad but I'm sure XX0:12:38.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well it won't be until you get XX0:12:42.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's where I XX0:12:48.9 Ok, good-bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good bye. Maybe it'll be over by Friday.</p>

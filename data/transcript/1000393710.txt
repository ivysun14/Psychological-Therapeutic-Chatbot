<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (4-minute silence) I was just thinking about uhm, well, 2 different things in a way, my comparing how I felt yesterday to today.  And then it just seemed to parallel having to actually start by saying something here — that there were lots of things going through my mind while I was, after I came in.  But just to begin, no matter what it was I began with, I was finding very hard just to say the first word and it was the same thing as yesterday.  I had thought about going shopping and I, I couldn't get myself to make the first step outside and,and to go to a store.  I just somehow felt as if I couldn't do it and I found lots of excuses not to.  And then today I just did and then it was fine and I, and it didn't bother me and I could make decisions and choices.  But I guess that was part of it yesterday — I just didn't feel I could make the decisions that I'd have to make.  Which leads me to wonder, is there something that I don't want to say, and that's why it was hard to start?</p>

<p>I was — maybe this is it, I don't know — I was thinking of (clears throat) sort of a double reaction I had when I saw the way you were standing holding the door, because my first inclination was you were sort of, oh lord, here we go again, inside, and, and impatient.  And then, and then immediately I started thinking, well, how could you stand while you're waiting holding the door and what does it matter?  And it, I, I think I'm sort of torn between the 2 attitudes but it isn't bothering me the way some days it would completely crush me if I started thinking the way I did at first.  I wouldn't get beyond the way I felt at first.  For instance, I think if yesterday I'd seen you standing that way and I'd had that initial reaction, that's what I would have thought.  (Cough; pause)</p>

<p>I was also thinking when I did get out today, that it uhm, I think I've al—, I've said this in other ways but I think one reason that I have in the past wanted to have children or a child, is because well, it would sort of give me a direction.  There are certain things you'd have to do to care for the child and aside from wanting to have something dependent on me and so forth, I think just the fact that I'd be focusing on something is part of it.  Then I would get out, because you'd be want wanting to get your child out and there'd be no other decisions than that, maybe where you'd go to.  But, but then I, then one of the things that I think I'm still afraid of is that the confusion and the pressures on me would increase in a way and the — it would be different types of decisions, but there still would be those that would have to be made and there'll be new ones that I'm not used to, and that I think frightens me.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And another thing, I don't know how much this has to do with it, I, I think it's more the attitude I somehow began the day with but I had my hair done this morning and I finally got around to saying to my hairdresser that I wanted my hair to be done differently.  And at that point I wasn't too sure exactly what I wanted and I was still hesitant anyway to direct him too much since I was unsure.  But yet I was still willing to try something different and what he did I didn't like.  And I sort of half changed it but I still, I don't know, it didn't bother me.  It was sort of if you don't try then you can't know.  And I know that, I knew that other people didn't think it looked as well as other styles on me but that didn't really seem to bother me that much either.  And I, I don't know, I just somehow felt a little bit freer, again as if what does it matter because I've gotten that much closer to know what I do want.</p>

<p>But then I think of something that happened this weekend which the closer I get to know what I do want, the more I sort of reject it.  Uhm, we saw the movie "I am curious yellow"  and I think that I was aroused or something by the fact that there was a nude man in the film.  And in any case I felt that I wanted to have intercourse with MSCZ and I felt much more intimate with him, much more interested in this type of thing, but then when it came right down to it, I, I was more inhibited than I'd been in a long time, as if I felt very guilty that I was admitting that I felt this way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you remember what you actually thought about at the time?  
PATIENT:  Which time?  The movie or —?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, either, but particularly the one you felt inhibited.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah.  Well, it was, I wanted him to uhm have an orgasm.  I wanted to, well actually, I wanted to just masturbate him because I didn't want to be involved.  And it, and I felt very almost sickened if I began to respond but it gave me some pleasure for him to respond.  And yet, it was that mixed thing of I couldn't respond without feeling sickened by it and yet uhm I felt very definitely the lack,that I wasn't responding.  And it was funny, just uhm — I don't know whether there's any connection or if the connection is more uhm with the mixed feelings I've had about the dream I had concerning the professor and, and my other reactions.  Uhm, but I think it was Saturday night.</p>

<p>We saw the movie Saturday night and then Saturday night I had a dream that uhm, was in a class situation.  And I don't remember if there was anybody in particular who was running the class, but it was something we did do in a, in a way in the class I'm taking; because we were all, we'd all made puppets.  And the part I recall now about the dream was my playing around with the puppet I made and feeling fairly free and yet always knowing that pretty soon I'd be asked to perform in front of others.  And when this did happen in the dream and I had to make my puppet work in front of others, I completely lost control over it.  I, I just sort of froze and I couldn't do anything.</p>

<p>And then I think there was some awareness again of uhm — because I had frozen and I wasn't handling my puppet, especially after having practiced much better or played with it beforehand — again of incurring disapproval.  And in fact, there is a definite connection — because — with what was happening with MSCZ because I think what I did with my puppet when I realized I was freezing and was going to get disapproval anyway since I wasn't going to be able to perform with it, I then — I can't remember now exactly how I did this — but in some way I turned it back on the class and asked them to tell them, tell my puppet about themselves.  And somehow it ended up I and my puppet weren't doing anything and that I was making the class do it.  And even though it was still a fiasco, somebody else was acting, it wasn't me.  Somebody else was doing the work or, or expressing themselves, revealing themselves.  And that is what I was doing with MSCZ.  And it was that inability to feel free to really express myself and know what I liked and didn't like that I think was what was bothering me in that class.  When I felt his disapproval,even if he really didn't give it, I assumed he was because I knew I wasn't doing something that is a standard of his and that I wanted to be able to meet.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's interesting that it's so — the dream which had — I know I was very emotionally involved in this because Sunday morning when I did, I was sort of — I always had the feeling I was kind of half awake when I was having the dream since I do remember some of it.  And then later I just had this feeling that my mind was just full of things and I didn't know exactly what they were.  And we uhm went for a drive.  We were going hiking and had to drive quite a way and I just wanted to be quiet and say nothing and just think, try to get to what all these things were.</p>

<p>And the first thing that I began to think of,and after this I recalled the dream again, was that well, 2 aspects that I think are,are involved in why I find it so hard to make decisions and know what I want, to even have the confidence to think what I like and don't like and want and don't want.  Because first of all, in our family we weren't ever asked in anything that really mattered, "What do you think?"  Or "What do you want?"  That I can recall.  And even if we were, still my parents made it very clear that their opinions were the ones we should have and that if we didn't agree then we just were stupid and didn't know anything, and, or immature, and when we grew up we'd understand.</p>

<p>And then the other thing is — I think is perhaps even more important — is just the way my father is when you do agree with him, when you choose the same foods or agree on political philosophy or anything.  That it's almost like you're a comrade.  You — there's a closeness and he's very moved by this because well, in a way it's giving him his confidence, I suppose that he needs.  But even, just like ordering an ice cream cone at a Howard Johnson's or something.  If you chose the same flavor as he did, then there was somehow an intimacy between you and he'd get in a very good mood.  And I don't know, you got his approval and, and in a way his affection by choosing as he chose.  And I th—, I don't know, I was thinking too in terms of how so often I'm ask—, I want MSCZ to make his decision first because now I think I'm doing this with MSCZ — that if we both are eating the same thing or somehow share the same opinion, there's a certain intimacy or closeness.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And on the other hand, that this would lead me to assume that if you strike out on your own, have your own ideas or choose your own kinds of choices, you get disapproval.  And I know this is true in, in discussing political things with my parents that this would happen.  And I was just, it just occurred to me now that in my family when we were little, everybody liked ice cream but me.  And I really just didn't like it and, and I only enjoyed 1 or 2 flavors.  (Cough) And it was sort of like I was a family outcast because I didn't enjoy ice cream as everybody else did.  Nobody could understand this.  And it really was a big thing, since my family ate ice cream quite often.  And it's also interesting, I just thought that I sort of felt I had to like a flavor, so I'd chose one flavor for a while until I got sick of it and then I'd chose another.  But I did begin to like ice cream more, and I think it's right around when I went away to college and afterwards when I was out of home, and also when I began to eat some flavors that were sort of novel and unheard of in my home, since we always had the same old good basic choices.</p>

<p>(Silence) It's funny too, that for years and years I've been aware that this same thing that works in my family, of sort of that togetherness because you're choosing the same things and enjoying the same ideas doesn't work outside of the family.  And even though I knew it didn't, I couldn't do anything about it, even though I knew it would drive my friends crazy that all I'd do is agree and follow sort of their choices and tastes.  And I didn't even want to be that way — frustrated me as much as it frustrated anybody else.  But still even though I knew this, that was the way I functioned both inside and outside of the family.  And I think that's one of the things that makes it so hard for me to be with my parents now and particularly my father.  He's — my mother will just sort of enjoy a good fight if we disagree politically, and (clears throat) she's not so emotional if you do agree and so forth.  But my father really practically — tears will come to his eyes.  It's not quite that bad, but that's the way I think he's feeling inside, if you agree.  And if for no other reason, right now I'm feeling I can't agree just because it sickens me to have to go through this whole thing.  And yet I know it hurts him and it's sort of needless to hurt somebody.</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Cough)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because I think I was just thinking that MSCZ had wanted this weekend to go to PTN.  And, and I just really haven't wanted to go, as much as I like PTN, and I thought of all kinds of excuses — that it really won't be very nice up there and that the drive up and back is horrible and I can't face it especially after the accident we had and the awful time we had driving it.  And, but really basically I think it's just I don't want to see my parents and if they're up there I just don't want to be there.  And his family wants us to come to their home and usually both of us much prefer to go to my parents than to his and here we have the perfect opportunity.  And I think I'd prefer to go to his family, because somehow I'm not involved emotionally.  And just that fact, even though I may not like a lot of things that are happening,makes me feel much more relaxed and happy.  So now I'm happy with his family and he's happy with mine.</p>

<p>There's something else too.  I think that I was just thinking of an evening when they were at our apartment for dinner, his family (cough) and uhm I've always thought his mother says some very stupid things and is a very difficult person to get along with anyway, because she just sort of monopolizes things and doesn't even listen to somebody else.  And I've just always kind of let her rattle on because there's not much else you can do.  But MSCZ used to be very fond of her and sort of blind to this and it used to really bother me that he didn't see this side of her, because it was so blatant to me.  And now he's beginning to see it and it drives him crazy, the way she'll carry on.  And I think I get some kind of sadistic pleasure out of that.  And that's one reason why I, aside from the other things I've said, I like going.  Because then it sort of is making it very clear to MSCZ how I suppose I'm better than his mother.</p>

<p>(2-minute silence) It's funny how today everything seems to be running in terms of, of, of my ha—, ha—, sort of my looking at how I have in the past, and probably still do, seek approval and disapproval or feel it.  And yet today I felt very much that I, I could sort of, well, like when I'm shopping, admit when I didn't know exactly what I wanted or I didn't know (cough) exactly how to use something and, well, just simply admit my ignorance.  And I used to always feel that I couldn't admit it, especially in things like if I'm buying make-up or something, because then the saleswoman will be very scornful: "Why don't you know these things?  How can you be ignorant?"  And so then I wouldn't buy them just because I'd be afraid of admitting ignorance.  And today I, it didn't bother me and no—, and it didn't strike me anybody was scornful either.</p>

<p>ANALYST: It's interesting in light of the dream that you had Saturday night and in light of the way you describe your feelings of your sexual experience with MSCZ.  Because in the dream you were very worried and in the end felt your ignorance — not knowing how to handle the puppet or not being able to handle the puppet — uh persisted.  But that dream followed the experience in which what you emphasized, what you emphasized about it was that you wanted to, that you couldn't enjoy yourself and you wanted to satisfy MSCZ.  I think there must be some connection between wanting to masturbate him and this dream about the puppet.  And the feeling that you couldn't do with the puppet what needed to be done.  You couldn't perform with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And my mind jumps to, if there is a connection it would be the fear that if we,if I involve myself wanting intercourse and then couldn't have an orgasm, or the fear that I wouldn't be able to, or that that would be the parallel that — I suppose that sort of reflects on the whole way I've been feeling today.  And that I didn't, whatever it was I didn't want to risk it.  I didn't want to just say, oh well, we can try and if we, if I can't so what?  If I can so what?  Because very often when I have felt in that mood, when it's been not,not colored by sort of feeling guilt at having a definite attraction toward MSCZ, then I've been very bothered if I haven't been able to have an orgasm.  I've been very frustrated and I don't have the attitude, well, so what.  Sort of, like that's the one and only chance and I failed.  But I wasn't at all aware of feeling that way.  Yet I suppose that must be part of it because if I felt guilt at just wanting to have the sexual experience, then I should, or just sort of liking nudeness, which I used to find very hard to admit, then I probably wouldn't have even wanted to masturbate MSCZ.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was the puppet like?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's funny, I,i, I can recall enough to know that while I was practicing with it, playing with it, it had a very definite character and face and so forth.  And now all I can remember is that it was, the hand puppet type that you put your hand up inside and it it's like a glove or a mitten over your hand.  But I know that it had much more than that and I'm left with the feeling that I had at the end of the dream, which was, "What is this thing?  What can I bring out about it?  It's faceless."  And that's what it, that's what I recall now.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you think you could have thought of it as a penis?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when you say what kind of a puppet it was then I thought of a hand puppet and then of masturbating MSCZ.  I did make that connection.  But it was, I, I don't, it's the first time I'd thought of it in that way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You didn't say that thought, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean you think I've thought it before?</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I mean you, you said that you had just thought of it when I first brought this up?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, more in terms of I thought that's what you're driving at.  (Chuckle)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Ha, yeah, right.  But, but you didn't mention it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  I immediately go to this defensive reaction that it's too far-fetched.  I mean, when I think about it, it all fits together.  (Pause) And I think somehow somewhere in the back of my mind — I can't recall now exactly what feelings I had about my reaction to my class on Thursday and the dream I had about my professor, but I, I right now am thinking in terms that I feel still confused by what all that meant.  And so when I had this dream, and it was in terms of a class and puppets and so forth, I sort of went aha, another clue to what was happening in this other situation, and so that's always the light I was looking at it in.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah.  Well, but sequence of your thoughts essentially was: you go to the movie, and the way you described it was that you saw the man's genitals.  You saw him naked.  Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhum.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And then your focus is that during your sexual experience with MSCZ you wanted to masturbate him.  And then later that night you dream you have a puppet that you can't make perform.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And it wasn't just once during the weekend that I felt that way.  I felt that way Sunday too.  No, I can see that, but it, uhm, I think I was going to going back now to just what was happening when I had this reaction,when I had the dream, and the other dream, and then the reaction I did in class.  (Pause) I think maybe part of this feeling is simply, well, I don't know, I can't quite get my finger on it.  But it has something to do with if I, if the dream was just purely and simply fantasizing about my professor or about you (cough) and having a sexual experience, I can't, I just can't tolerate thinking that I was even fantasizing something like that, unless what it really means is that it's symbolic of somebody else.  I think I said this on Friday too, that if it represented my father or MSCZ then I could accept it but this is why I have to keep going back to it and it has been disturbing me.  It's almost as if I can't let it alone until I make it mean something that I can then accept that it means until I can sort of pattern it, work it around, fit it into some form that I can stand.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Again, it's just I get to this point and then I can't go any further.  I think that happened to me practically at this point on Friday too, and I started to think of uhm, well, sort of more or less of school.  And I was thinking of something that occurred to me some time recently about part of the trouble I was having after Christmas I think, was sort of a strong reaction to things that I think bothered me when I was growing and I didn't want to do the same with the children.  So I overreacted.  For instance, in giving any kind of criticism, I wanted to make them feel whatever they wanted to do was alright and lots of freedom of choice.  And I just took away all the structure because I didn't feel any structure.  I didn't know what I thought was right and what I didn't, and I was so afraid of hurting them the way I think I've been hurt, or at least the way I reacted and was hurt, whether or not it was really being done to me.  And in a way I was hurting the children by sort of not giving them any direction at all.  But I don't really want to think about this.  Because when I'm talking about — I just sort of find I'm not really interested in it and —</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, as you said, your thoughts go back to the dream about the instructor and you're thinking about him and about me and that's where you're sort of stuck, unresolved.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because it just struck me, why does it bother me so much if it remains unresolved?  Why can't it just be unresolved?</p>

<p>ANALYST: There was a feature of that dream that you didn't say anything about and this was that you weren't sure whether you were alone.  Does that bring anything to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It brings to mind something that has occurred to me this weekend that was in uhm "Portnoy's complaint"  when one of the mistresses that he had was talking about, well — it was also an experience they had of having more than 2 people there.  And then when she was talking about a couple who asked her to watch them while they had intercourse and sort of this element of an audience.  And that thought kept occurring to me almost as if I wanted it and in a sort of perverse way.  And yet I wouldn't want it at all.  But, and it also made me think of uhm how back in the fall whenever MSCZ and I had intercourse, I would always — well I don't know exactly how I thought of it then, but somewhere in the thoughts either right then or afterwards would be, now I'll have to talk about it here.  So it was almost as if you could be there watching us.  But yet this liking of nudeness and,and being able to be nude myself now without feeling the way I used to or generally without feeling the way I used to — it's almost as if now I don't care if there's another person or not.  I'm not hiding in the way I was.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

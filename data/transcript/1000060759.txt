<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is Client 0518-014, Session No. 18 - May 17, 1971</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible]... talking about himself (ph) in past tense since then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I think...I think her being sick physically just was kind of like - I think she really wanted me to pay attention to her... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and daddy to pay attention to her and stuff. I think that's what it was, so I did. I don't think there was any - the doctor said there was nothing wrong with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (big sigh) We're all crazy. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm good generally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not so good right today but... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, what's wrong today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, (chuckling) oh, never mind, it's a long story.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're about to - you're going to hurt yourself with that pen, with your pen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it does that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's funny, we're both wearing cameos.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, all right, there's a nostalgic data there all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nostalgic?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it's gone, your plant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was an avocado?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it didn't make it, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it was a dead avocado.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I'm growing an avocado now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was quite fond of those days. And I bet you think of all your previous fucked up relationships and sit around and you cry. And then you nurse your real closeness (ph)...that's like nice because you feel real. I mean like you feel like - Can I have one? Oh, God they cost ten cents now. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder if they're really like truffles?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the quality, even though it's nice to feel, the quality of your feeling is sad, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're sad and stuck and it's gone down. All these fucked up relationships and no way out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, all your fucked up relationships and knowing that the next ones are going to be fucked up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or these are going to stay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: These are going to stay fucked up. I'm not even thinking of any new ones. [silence from 0:02:54.8 to 0:03:13.8] Except for one who [would say that somewhere there's been and like,] (ph) well everybody's, everything's going to disperse in just about three or four weeks, and so once I'm really happy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and it's going to disperse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand. It makes you - what? It makes you happy that people are going to disperse or no more hangups?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just won't have to deal with it. I won't have to deal with this community anymore. It's just been making me so miserable because I won't be anymore and it changes everything and everybody will change over the summer... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and that's it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...kind of. And so I've kind of been feeling like (making noise).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll get a fresh start?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess that everybody - I don't know. Everybody's like deciding where they're going to live next year and I can't decide what to do, as usual.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't decide whether I want to - I mean I can't commit myself to stay here, because I was so unhappy this year it seems like I should start over somewhere else. I keep on thinking that I want to leave. Then I keep on [lot VA.] (ph) [0:04:24.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know because - so I don't know what to do. So I'm unhappy because all these apartments are set up with people that I like and then that I'm not... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm not going to be there. And I can't say, "Well, hey can I live with you?" Because I'm not sure if I'm going to be there. So I can't like...do that to anybody and not show up. Except for that I don't have anywhere else to go to, so it feels like I'm losing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, I'll never have anything else set up. Is that - can I have one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. That's - no, you can have it. That was for you. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you. So, are you going to be here next year?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think so, I'm [pretty sure.] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Has your life taken any happier turn?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, somewhat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I feel...like I feel like crying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you know better too that there's no reason for it? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really love these.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, they're good. [inaudible at 0:05:46.7]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I started finishing my incomplete address list for the... [inaudible]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [silence from 0:05:54.4 to 0:06:04.7] I didn't know whether to tell you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [silence from 0:06:07.0 to 0:06:29.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you still have a cold?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have this... </p>

<p>PATIENT: You've got it again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...with a little allergies this time I think and so... [inaudible at 0:06:35.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you live where I saw you the other day, on Brighton?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no. I live over in Long Island. A friend of mine who, Joseph Parr lives in that house. Do you live where, next door there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That's Betsy house.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Betsy lives with Meredith and Rebecca and Jackie and Dane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And not very happily. They all think Rebecca is really crazy. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so that's difficult?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's another - but it's a beautiful house and they have a backyard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was really difficult before there were all sorts of unfortunate things going on between Rebecca and Meredith and a boy. He was both of their lovers or something but I stayed out of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The window's different now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's sunny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A cast of the green.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was very gray before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of feel like an old friend who like sees somebody they were once close to and then doesn't know what to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: So like estranged or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Maybe partly because I'm so packed here. I've had... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I should have let you do that thing that you had to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe so. I just wanted to take a walk and so... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...walk it off because I feel crappy...and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, if you would've told me that it would have been really different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would be glad to even stop and let you do that. Because I just, I knew that I felt like if I was put off because you hadn't done something that you were supposed to do, I knew I would've felt shitty and I, and I wouldn't have felt like talking to you or something. But... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...it makes me feel - because I was supposed to be somewhere, etc., etc.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel put upon. But the idea of - that you have to do something of your own... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in your head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...makes me feel good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I would be glad to stop right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we? [0:09:37.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't feel like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh? Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean, well what do I mean? I mean if you want to stop for you then we should stop. But if you want to stop partly for me, I don't want to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I should figure out what all I'm into?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. [silence from 0:10:29.9 to 0:10:42.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. [silence from 0:10:43.4 to 0:10:56.0] I guess I feel I wouldn't mind talking to you, but I don't want to be sitting here... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in this room looking out the window with that tape recording going and the idea of trying to get something done. You know and I also just feel like I can't talk in that situation. I just had a really long talk with this girl that I don't know well and it was just a really important talk. And I'm going today, I guess that's why I was feeling nostalgic because I was thinking about - and I can really easily talk to her and I don't know her any better than I know you, so... [inaudible at 0:11:25.1] But I can talk to her and I feel the same trust towards you that I feel towards her, but I don't want to talk to you, I mean about it anymore for this one reason. So maybe I resent - yeah. I mean I don't know what I've gained by it, you know? Like I said, I don't know what help it's been to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I have a feeling like, well you were bothered by something when you walked in and I was a bitch and said, "I have to be somewhere." Which is true, but if I had known that it was something for you I would've...it would make me feel...it would've been fine with me. But just somehow, like you have something like on your mind and I'm keeping you from...feeling a little bit better....because that's - now you have to listen to me and you still have this unlooked at grumbling this morning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Partly also you feel like I'm being here not wanting to be here? And like...uh! Who want's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's part of it, yeah. [0:12:36.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know and I don't want to...I meant I don't want to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't - I really don't feel that way. In fact saying it got it off my mind. I don't feel half someplace anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. I guess then it's just I don't know what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I don't know what... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...we can do. I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because that's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I guess a lot of it is I don't know how far I can personally move right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't know how far you can help me in this situation or, I mean I don't know. And I still like you a lot, but somehow trying to get somewhere that I don't think I'm going to get this way, just makes me feel like, "Wow, that's really a shame." You know it's a shame that that's how I know Ariel, so that when I see her in somebody's backyard she kind of is a little bit, "Hi." But doesn't stop, just...like but it's like not that we're friends, you know. That's a shame.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Part of what you feel is that the therapy is a barrier between us?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And if it would've been besides, it wasn't when you went into it?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, yeah. I mean I feel...it's not necessarily, but since I don't feel like I've bloomed really far in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I guess I've gotten certain things from it, but I don't feel like I've really done as much as I thought therapy was supposed to do or something. I mean I don't know what that means either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But at any rate it hasn't come to very much?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I guess I'm also kind of - because I knew like when you - the telephone rang and I walked into that room, I all of the sudden had this...the other room over there, I wanted to say, "Oh, Ariel, lets go sit there because it's more sunshiny there." I thought, "Oh, lets go sit here. I'd much rather sit here." And I thought of - just all of the sudden I had this comfortable feeling of you and I sitting on the couch and talking, and then I realized why we couldn't sit in there was because of that...and then I realized as I walked back in here that I really didn't want to sit in this chair. I had an impulse to go sit there. And I said, "No, no. This is the chair you're supposed to sit in. That's the chair Ariel's supposed to sit in. And we can't go sit in that room that's more sunshiny." And everything was how I didn't want it to have to be. And so I'd, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You felt constrained and imposed upon, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that wasn't what you what you wanted to do. You wanted to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and also I don't even know what I want to tell you, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's not that I feel like there's anything to like keep from you, but what am I supposed to do, tell you all the key things that have happened since I saw you last? (chuckling) [0:15:40.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But...the main thing you... </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I mean like, I keep on... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...talking in summary...keep on saying - I mean you - go on, you were about to say something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well I just got caught by what you said there at the very last, just that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I keep on trying to like, take an overview of things and then present them to you, instead of like sitting in the middle, like I...because you don't know stuff so I tell you. Like I can't get across what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...anyway?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you - yes. Yes, I think I know what you mean. Like you mean today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That and like you can't get down into anything and do anything with it but - because you have to sort of just convey information.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I know I maybe feel like doing that. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and I'd kind of much rather hear what's with you, feel better, be supportive and how come I'm feeling a little bit better and...or like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or, I don't know, you never... [silence from 0:16:57.5 to 0:17:04.6] Also I... [silence from 0:17:05.5 to 0:17:14.5] Sometimes it just helps to like have a really nice conversation with somebody...but it's just like, you don't like talking about passed stuff. You're just talking about something right then. But it like gives me new energy. It makes me feel better instead of like, just confusing you with passed stuff, but like stress for exactly where you are. Okay, so there are like a whole bunch of icky things but you don't have to necessarily talk about them. You can like talk about something that is making you feel good and it will make me feel better for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Partly you don't want to kind of like delve into icky stuff when you could be feeling good today? And that is nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like I spent all day, I mean all - the reason I came in and said I was nostalgic was because I spent the whole day talking to this girl about Oliver. She's definitely delving into passed... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...ickies... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...so it's not that I feel so really just good from that. I guess I just felt good about also, I mean, having - I mean I - she's Oliver's new girlfriend, Oliver's found a girlfriend now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I really like her. I knew her before. And we had this really important conversation about me and Oliver and Oliver and her, and stuff. But overriding all the pain in the conversation, I ended up having a really good feeling. First of all because I really talk to somebody... [0:18:53.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and they really talked to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And also because I could, because I have made contact with this new person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it just really made me feel good to - because she's a super woman, she's just really neat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mean superwoman... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...not that. She's like really... [overlapping voices at 0:19:07.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, liked her very much... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...really got in touch with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And she really and she...and I really felt, it made me feel good that we could both care about each other so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's really, and I've really liked her from afar for a long time and I know that she's like me. And that just made me feel good...and I don't know...I don't know how much you're ever a person with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's just having that really good contact making with her just - I don't know, it illustrates more of the distance between us in the way you're not making contact with me and you're not making contact with me as a person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. And I can't tell if it's because you don't want to or if it's because that's what you think therapy is...if it's a combination of the both or whether you're just not accessible or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know what's wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel rejected by me a little?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I did. I mean I guess I've taken myself farther away and then become less involved in my family (ph). I mean I'm... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today maybe... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's probably subtle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Except for - I don't know. For some reason I kind of resent or there's just a little bit of feeling resentment or something. I don't know exactly what it is. [silence from 0:21:10.1 to 0:21:34.2] Like I would just say all these things and I realize I'm saying them kind of, not hostilely but definitely... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...putting a distance and barrier there. And I don't know if I feel as much of a distance and barrier as I'm putting there. I think I'm trying to get like a spark out of you. I'm trying to like get you to at least say, 'fuck you' to me, and that I'd rather have you say that than just say what I - repeat what I say. I kind of I guess also...I don't know. [0:22:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I almost feel like I want to put you on the spot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean there's...like I'm not your girlfriend and...like Cathy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am seeing you as part of my job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. That even helps, just having you say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean well, yeah. How does that make you feel?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What you said. Does that like relieve you kind of?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it makes me feel a little relieved or something. I, yeah. Yeah. Because I've been getting angry or like I feel really pressured.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. Yeah, like I'm really pressuring you. [silence from 0:23:25.4 to 0:24:12.5] And so I can't tell if I'm involved or not involved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like maybe what I should say is then I feel like I'm not able to get to myself or do something that I feel is real progressive in therapy so maybe I should just stop. You know and as soon as I think of saying, 'well Ariel why don't we just stop.' Then I think, 'okay, I'll get up and leave the room.' I think also that, 'come on Stacy that's really melodramatic or are you doing that just...are you doing that to stop from admitting you're already back in Ariel's office and involved in being a client again?' And then I can't tell if I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. If we were really used, like therapy with me is not what you want or whether... [0:25:14.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or whether if I'm just like saying that so...and I can't tell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Damn it. (chuckling) I don't know. [silence from 0:25:30.0 to 0:25:59.8] I don't know. [silence from 0:26:00.1 to 0:26:55.6] I feel like I've rushed in and pointed all these boney fingers at you and forced you into some corner and started barking at you or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, how odd.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you feeling now like, 'oh, I wish I could start this over again' or 'that wasn't really exactly what I wanted to do.' (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Well that, that's... [overlapping voices at 0:27:30.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not that the feelings weren't real but that... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. I'm also just wondering where all that came from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have no conception of when I came over here that any - I would say any of that and I don't even know how much of it I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I must feel enough of it to have said it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But why should I bulldoze you into a corner...and like I mean it wasn't very much of a corner but (chuckling) I mean all those feelings of getting mad. God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did it do to you when I got mad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It made me feel better. (both chuckling) [0:28:17.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the sense of like, well that's real?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [nonverbal 'yes']</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe that's what I wanted. You know? I don't know. [silence from 0:28:31.1 to 0:28:41.4] Also I was sitting there trying to self-righteously be a bitch. (both chuckling) You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? No. I mean what do you mean? Trying to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the way you said it almost sounds like that was an agenda or something, to see if you could?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't plan it but, I just had this feeling like I can - I don't know. Like now I feel like, 'I'm talking to Ariel, isn't that great.' I don't know. I guess it also hurt me to say that I hadn't gotten anything from it. And I think maybe I wanted to hurt you or something. Because I thought it would and then I mean I said, ' it probably wouldn't hurt you and I mean because it's not that much skin off your back one way or another.' But it was kind of like I was - I don't know. It was like, it's like a disappointment and I was trying to - because I wanted to make you a part of the disappointment, too. I mean, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean, do you mean like you feel bad and like well, it's only appropriate that I should feel bad, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know really but maybe that's it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean to me it doesn't - I think it did hurt me, even though like...if someone had asked me I would've said, 'well, I don't think she did get very much out of it.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Why is that? Is that because I wasn't ready to get anywhere?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. Maybe because you were already into feeling the stuff a whole bunch already. So, more feeling stuff...big deal. I don't know. [0:31:18.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (big sigh) [silence from 0:31:18.7 to 0:31:29.8] Yeah. I wish I knew. It would make me feel easier. You know it might, I mean I also had the flash that maybe it's like the first time you get stoned. You know you don't know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm getting there? (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you don't know what to look for, you don't know what...and it takes so long, it takes a couple of times before you realize that...that you have or that you're incredibly stoned. (both chuckling) And I'm like...I have this feeling, 'well maybe in a while or next time after I see it...at some point I'll see a therapist again and maybe I'll realize, wow, I really got a whole bunch from Ariel.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: 'Maybe it like follows in retrospect.' And I think probably that's a lot true. And I don't know. I don't know. I really feel like I was vicious though when I came in and I'm really sorry. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't really feel vicious. I mean I really don't. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I mean, no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And if anything I guess it's like I'm disappointed because I wanted to go further... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and I wasn't able to and so I wanted you to feel badly that we couldn't go further, and so to do it I had to like shove it in your face or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shove it in my face... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I think I mean. [silence from 0:32:58.8 to 0:33:31.3] [I just don't know things. Like I don't know what the thing to do is.] (ph) (whispering in a singsong voice)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What are you going to do this summer?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I work at the, what's going to be the [Comp. Set Center] (ph). You know the... </p>

<p>PATIENT: What's... [overlapping voices at 0:33:54.5]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you know that the [inter vista] (ph) was coming? Yeah, right. That we're going to start a new place at the [inaudible]... bank building. Work on my thesis perhaps.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Stay in New York? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. [inaudible]... Oh it's just, when you said that before I was just thinking, you see the therapy in the past tense, disappointed but not as, not as still going on. Not as, well these three sessions are part of it or something. Which I'm not saying is wrong exactly, because that might be realistic, too. [silence from 0:34:48.1 to 0:34:57.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess, yeah. Yeah, I guess maybe there's an unwillingness to try to dive back in and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and then...have it only be three sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess there's also just a general unwillingness to dive back in. I mean I've...basically been not talking to anybody and I, it's been a relief not to see you. Not so much because of you or just because of knowing that I will be seen thinking about myself a lot. I think about myself a lot anyway.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A large part of, a large bunch of introspection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, I just have a feeling like it's not, my life isn't good enough and I can't make it good right now. And that when I change, when I like move from this place and I have the ability to start all over... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...then I have...then I'll have a fresh start and then I either make it or sink, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I have a feeling like I really fucked up this whole year and I've... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...antagonized all my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not all of them but...a lot of them. And I'm not close to anybody and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you want to give it up for a bad job, not sort of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...stay in it and heal and that's a... [inaudible at 0:36:38.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I mean because I, it...gives me a lot of pain even though I'm trying to bury it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean...and I don't know if it's better to, I mean it's always saying to yourself...'well it's just better to bury it because...chalk it up to experience....'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: '...or something'. But...I don't know what I can make of it. I guess I'm a lot...some of that comes from everybody else around me is giving up, too. I'm not, I'm just talking. I don't know. [silence from 0:37:08.8 to 0:37:23.3] I guess that's what I was almost glad about that it was going to be over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You won't have to just say in this situation, which is all messed up and it's already all messed up and you're already caught in... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:37:55.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially in ways, not only that it's all messed up, but then a lot because it's so painful. Because the people you really loved you're all at odds with and I think really unhappy about some of whatever it is in you that does that or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, [I think I am.] (ph) Yeah. [silence from 0:38:26.4 to 0:38:50.9] And I guess and then there's another part that says, 'well...you should go away'...and you said I've, how somewhere else maybe it will turn out the same. Maybe you are essentially, maybe you essentially fuck up any situation you get into. That's like too heavy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...to worry about. I mean it's like too important...and I, and too - what's the word, devastated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you're saying, 'I couldn't face that.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean I know there are elements of that in there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know what is and what isn't. I mean I don't know what is, what are a lot of unlucky circumstances, which there are some... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and what is my doing. And I really think it's a combination.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't feel like everything that's happened, happened to me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like and I feel like I cause things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel responsible for some things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's true I don't feel responsible for everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't separate what it is, I mean what I do from what's happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think there is and I'm afraid of saying - I mean I know that it can't be. It's not that stuff happened to me because - I mean I know that isn't true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know it's just like this passive relationship to the world and it is fucked up and untrue..and it's just a way of shirking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But...also I think the hole I'm in is a lot deeper than I could possibly dig myself. (both chuckling) You know? God.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your life really is in a hole. A lot of it is just... [0:41:02.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it's...there are nice things, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's some nice things. I just had a really nice talk with that girl Tricia.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was so close to Cathy and - I'm not close to her, I haven't seen her at all but I know that Rachel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I've met some new nice people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Things like that but, basically the people that I'm worried about and that I care about, nothing's...Marco and I are still negating each other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know we can't be friends and I really want to be. And Melinda and I...got going now but we're really not friends. We're more just nice suited to each other and we do things together every once in a while but I'll never trust her, you know. The next day after telling her, talking to her, she'll treat me like shit...and I'm not surprised.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Angry and [hurt you think?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not even that. I don't even...I'm more, I'm angry more than hurt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I'm glad that there's been that change. I used to be just crushed and now at least I'm angry. And I'm angry at Marco too, for like keeping me so far away when I know that he cares and he knows that he cares. He tells Tricia that he cares.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why the fuck can't he tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like why can't he tell me? You know why can't we, why can't - and now I know we like know each other so well. I know that...it's just we both have really strong intuitive feelings about each other. You know and he knows that's true and I know that's true. And with Rachel, he like keeps me really far away, just...in two years I've talked to him three times...for ten minutes a piece or something...that's really ridiculous when both of our lives we've had a whole lot to do with each other. And so Tricia tells me that he really cares...but he can't say that, you know. He says, 'hello' and walks away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's such bullshit. That really just makes me feel - and every time I've taken initiative he doesn't, he won't respond even, much less take an initiative of his own. So he catches me in this trap, you know. I can't make him do it...so it just makes me feel impotent...and fucked up. And Diane was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And sort of left with the frustration and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know and I'm also angry for like putting me in that position, because he knows that I love him and he knows that I'm really, in some emotional way, always going to be involved with him. So he has that security. I can tell every time I see him because I can't help it. It just like radiates out of me. [0:44:19.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and he knows and I can tell he knows that I can see that he knows it, and like...just - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I'm also scared to call him on it. I'm also scared to say, man...because I'm always scared he's going to say, 'fuck you, I don't care.' You know like although somewhere I know that he wouldn't mean it and that he was just hiding...but I'm scared he'll do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to hear it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to hear it. Yeah. Because there's nothing else I could do after that. I mean I couldn't even say hello to him after that. At least I can still say hello to him. But I don't think I even... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to be cut off from him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm just...and John's getting married on the 12th of June and Alan would call up every three weeks and say, "You wish you were marrying him?" What can I say? (chuckling) Nothing. And that's another thing. I mean Holly's away, and she was here and I felt pretty far away from her. I think that she felt pretty far away from me. And Katie and I are completely and utterly estranged. We're not even friends anymore. We just never see each other and there's no warmth for me to - and I've just kind of stopped wanting to. I stopped - I don't know. Every once in a while, like my friend Michelle came in yesterday and I had a really nice time, really. You know and I've been getting letters from people that are nice you know. And my sister calls up and tells me she'll pay my way to Texas if I'd come out and live with them, and other nice things, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You still really enjoy the nice things but...when you talk about all the rest of this stuff, it makes me feel something that I can't quite describe and I'm just like, 'oh!' I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's how it makes me feel, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel really like there's nothing I can do now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know the only - the best thing I can do is get away from all these people...and not see them. And hopefully when I see them again in a year or something...a lot can be forgotten and maybe we can start all over again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like kind of sweet...like... [0:47:11.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really need to pull away and not to be caught in a failure that you can't fix.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, yeah. [silence from 0:47:29.4 to 0:47:44.5] But that almost... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That gets at some of the way it feels sad I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. That's it all right. And also that I'm feeling just excluded from the families that are being created that I'm not in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that's there, too. I feel often I wish I could start over with everything...everybody, everything. I saw this little kid the other day, this little blonde boy. He was... [inaudible at 0:48:15.2] ...and I could see that. I was seeing a really - I just started watching him, just really wanted to be really like that and I could just like start all over again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Go back try again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I guess also there's...then I think, 'okay, I really should go someplace else in time, which is, but then I get really scared because all my life I just always end up going - like Holly's going back to New York next year. You know? She went to Joseph and she couldn't find the people (ph) that she wants, and Joseph is in Trenton and he's just going to finish graduate school there but...he hasn't found the people that he wants...and the reason I came here is - and everybody I know it keeps on gravitating back here. Because everywhere else I meet you really need people and I find neat things going on, but there's this core of really great people here and I'm really scared that...that somehow the vortex is...or the place to be or something is here and I'm not making it so I shouldn't stay. I mean it's not making me happy and I'm not feeling good so I shouldn't stay. I feel that about - there's this crazy scale. Oh, this is really - uck! I don't even want to talk about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's really icky to talk about rating people that you... [0:50:10.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But inside I guess I feel that way. I only feel that way when I'm in New York though, never anywhere - whenever I'm anywhere else it just seems like people are people. When I get back here there's this like nasty superiority about this breed of New York people. That really...I believe it but I'm also repulsed by it. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and also, and then also the idea that they're really the special ones and not - and they're not...and they're not all liking me means that - and all the other people are, means that I'm not really - I don't know. This is so crazy. It's hard like for me even wanting to say so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Makes you so - yeah, you're sort of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: And then it's, what am I going to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hate to have ideas like that in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. God, it's really, it's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to live?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go, go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, what were you going to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just that you're afraid you, in their judgment makes you one of the ordinary people, not one of the special people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Right. You know like except for immediately, as soon as you say that I feel that's not true. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know like it's really horrible. I don't want to talk about this anymore. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I know what you mean. Like it's the kind of values that just make you wince and like you don't want to feel that way and that's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's, I mean... [inaudible at 0:51:55.9] And I also know that it has to do with rotten things like intellectuality and games like that, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like...I know that I was division in my head about west coast people and New York people. Like west-coast people are much looser and easier and less uptight about stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But they're also less deep in some important way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know maybe less moronic (ph) but they're losing something in the deal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that really is my experience of the west coast in a large part. But I've met really super people who are really easy but there's something that I miss about being mentally torn . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that makes me close to somebody when they share it with me that I feel here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? God, that's really disgusting, too. (chuckling) You know? First of all to generalize for a whole group of people but also to end up liking what I like is pretty disgusting, too. I don't know. [silence from 0:53:05.4 to 0:53:10.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess going away - is it like this, because you didn't say this but - if you leave you would, you're afraid you'll lose touch with the people here and the kind of people here and be excluded from something that you want to be included in?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's more it, yeah. Yeah. I mean I've always - that's like...the most, that's the most consistently painful past memory I can remember. I mean the memory, my earliest memory is one of exclusion, of being forgotten and like the very earliest thing I can remember is when my parents left me, you know? I mean and I've always had this thing about... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being ignored and stuff and being out of it and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...missing out on any stuff, missing out on this really big thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Missing out on something important that's happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I still have that all the time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...on a day-to-day basis. I mean Jesus, should I go over to Jen's tonight or should I go to the something?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, which one would be better for me to do, which one, you know? And I go through those imaginations (ph) all the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really horrible. I haven't grown out of it at all. And only when I'm with somebody I'm utterly hung up on do I feel comfortable, like I'm not missing anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was with Marco I never, was never missing... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...anything or John... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or with Diane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because they were the, you know? (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you have to love someone in order to feel like you're in the right place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's completely it. Mostly I've, once I'm with someone that I really love it just doesn't matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But unless I'm with somebody that I really like, I'm just really - I mean the horrible thing probably always like frantic about not being where I should be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And, but it was if a way you're disgusted with yourself, too. Embarrassed too, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean if anybody was telling me about these things I would think they were this horrible person. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard to like reconcile myself with these things that are very objectionable... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and which are like inside feelings that I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But like if you listen to someone you're afraid of that someone being sort of status seeking... [overlapping voices at 0:56:09.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like status seeking doesn't sound right to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something vague - it doesn't sound right to me either, but something vaguely in that, like that. Something to do with... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think it has that much to do with status. I mean it has to do with being accepted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I guess it is, I always pick a particular bunch of people that I have to be accepted by in order to feel really accepted. I usually pick people who don't. And I can't tell if I pick them before or after they exclude me. (chuckling) It might be after they exclude me...when I pick it. God. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or it's just... </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the thing is, I'm going to start like realizing how fucked up I am when I tell you about all these things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay. I was just thinking about that in a way, because I was thinking about your seeing that kid and wanting to start over again. Like not like wanting to be yourself but wanting to - wanting to grow up not so fucked up or something, to have another chance of coming out better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I also go, I like keep on refusing to identify myself with the fucked up parts of me. And I keep on saying, "Well that's not me."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? Like when you said, just when you said the thing about seeing the little boy and wanting not to be me. It was like, well it's not that I don't want to be me. I'm fine being me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But not just not this fucked up things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which I don't, which are the not me...things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's probably part of my problem. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think mostly you have some feeling like you should already have done a whole lot more than you have about being mature and stuff. That... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I feel like I should be a lot more together than I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I don't know what it is. I mean I guess that...I want to be happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know? And I look around and most of the people I know are. I know that's part of or at least Katie is. For some reason everything's revolving Katie now. That's because she's the latest person who doesn't like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she's really happy and she feels really close to the people that she's around and they really have a family and they spend all their time together, you know. They went together and all bought a waterbed and play on the waterbed...just every time - they're a really close-knit thing now and I just feel very left out of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And, [silence from 0:59:04.2 to 0:59:16.5] and she's really happy, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she also knows what she's doing this summer and things like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She's together, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that somehow seeing Katie is somehow, especially because she doesn't like you, it just... </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not also that she doesn't like me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean because she, I mean it's not clear. I mean it's not like she doesn't like me - it's not like Diane.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, she doesn't want to be close to me at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But just it shouldn't bother me so intensely but it does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (big sigh) I don't know. (making noise)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (making noise) [silence from 0:59:56.3 to 1:00:05.1] Well I don't know. [silence from 1:00:05.4 to 1:00:12.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well so did you think... </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't...and somehow because I haven't made it here I don't feel free to start anywhere else, because it's not...but I know coming back, because it's all icky, I might just be perpetrating (ph) the ickiness. I might just make it worse and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'll keep on being stuck where it's icky and not be able to move away from it. And it seems like maybe I should just leave it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and some days I just really feel like, 'well I'm just not coming back to New York. I can really set up a life somewhere else. There's no reason I have to dwell in this thing that is making me unhappy.' You know? And there's no reason to do it again, you know? I've spent the whole year trying to get something that I never, trying - I'm looking for something I never found. You know and why come back again to try to find it and alienate yourself even more. Why don't I just like start all over someplace else?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well but then...then again...something really nice happens. So I had a nice talk with Tricia. And I think, 'wow, Tricia is this really nice person and she's going to be here next year...and Marco is going to be here. And as long as Marco is somewhere it's worth being.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I certainly love him, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, Jesus, maybe I'd be, could be Marco's friend. If I leave then I won't ever see him. I mean not that I won't ever see him but I'll hardly ever see him, our paths probably won't cross a lot. And then... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to stop now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, okay. Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want to do about the last two appointments? Do you want to come in and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always do it in the middle of something. I never do right before. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. When are you free?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My next - [silence from 1:02:09.7 to 1:02:31.1] sometime on Friday?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably I was going to go downtown. Can I see you Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that too difficult?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I think it will work. I just have to figure when - can you come at one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [silence from 1:02:56.0 to 1:03:03.2] Yeah, that's a good idea (ph). [silence from 1:03:05.3 to 1:03:19.4 - then it starts with a new session, same client, to end of audio]</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, tell me more about what's been happening with your eyes because, you know, we've been talking on the phone about different things going on and I just want to be sure I have a handle on what's been going on.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It might have been like 2 weeks ago—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was, um, I think I strained my eyes, I was looking for, I freak out with the itchiness when I go outside, the bugs and everything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's chiggers in our backyard so every single one, you know, I thought it was chiggers all over me and they were but you couldn't see them, so I figured I strained them doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um, all the sudden, I can't read small letters, I get, literally I can see it for a second if I look away and then when I go back to it, it, you know, it's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this is changed dramatically—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's totally, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In, uh, in a couple weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get itchy any other time when you're not outdoors?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not really, it's like a nervous thing for me too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I do it when I get really stressed out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, has that been true for a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Not this bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I never cared what bit me, now I've got to see it this time, I have to look for it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And make sure it's off me.  It's almost like a, um, a tick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because nobody can tell me, [NAME OTHER] will tell me, stop, there's nothing on you and I know there is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what my head is saying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And have you noticed things being more like that in the last few months or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my toes, I crinch them, is that the right word.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's still going on and that's been for months and months, where I flex them all the time in both feet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  And the Abilify is totally out of the picture now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you noticed any change with that, before and after the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I haven't noticed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you aware of that starting to happen around the time of starting any medication or changing medications at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, the one, I forgot to bring it because it was in my kitchen, the Lami something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take it, I take it every other day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But at the same time, I started this, um, uh, I'll get it, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, that's Vistaril, yeah, Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And this one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and the Cogentin, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I had to stop taking them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm afraid that my eyes might get, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.  Any improvement at all since you stopped these, the Cogentin and the Vistaril or Hydroxyzine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With my vision?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No change at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gosh, okay, and you're taking the Adderall every day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me exactly how you're taking that, is it, um, both of the 30 mg capsules in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how's your level of alertness during the day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I feel like I'm okay with, I'm not organized, I feel like that, that's like an effect of the ADD, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sort of scattered, yeah, the ADHD?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And with my girls, I'm too attentive to them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think that gives me, where most of my nerves comes from.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or talking to people, I have a hard time getting out of the house now too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Why do you think it's hard to leave the house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think, um, because I look hideous, I gained so much weight, so yeah, I feel like I don't want anybody to see me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even [NAME OTHER], I don't even like him touching me anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's, you know, I never had that, that's hard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel like you've lost any weight since stopping the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And I know at one time you thought that the Risperdal had been implicated, um, and that's out of the picture, um, could Lithium be impacting it?  Lithium can sometimes lead to some water weight gain and kind of [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's probably the Lithium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it's like over the amount of time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I didn't wake up 40 pounds heavier, it was something that was already there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So the Lithium is more of a steady thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what else could do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, Adderall tends not to promote weight, as you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that should be even weight neutral or even maybe curb your appetite a bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin XL also similar, you know, that also antidepressant and even for some, uh, some support with treating the ADHD.  Um, Provigil, are you still taking the Provigil on a pretty consistent basis or is that a once in a while kind of thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, it was a once in a while thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um —</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you take 3 of the Wellbutrin every day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh, and the Zoloft, it's 100 mg, 1 tablet in the morning, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how about the Imipramine?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I just stopped taking that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that also could have aggravated weight, so we're kind of gradually eliminating some of the things that could aggravate weight, um, and then, you know, I want to look at the whole picture with you.  With the Lamictal, you're taking that from the starter pack I gave you, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you feel any difference with that at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not that I notice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, so you usually take 1 every other day, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, how about the Trazodone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take 1 but I'm supposed to take 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But when I can't get to sleep I take three.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I haven't been sleeping well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you mostly take the Trazodone at bedtime to sleep—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's 50 mg tablets and you might take 2 or 3 as needed, you can take up to 4 a day if you need to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.  Has it been working for sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, not as good as it did in the beginning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I'm, I'm used to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's possible.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I still wake up during the night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  [INAUDIBLE] Cogentin, about how many hours of sleep would you say you're getting in a night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, before I wake up?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, and then I wake up and I go back to sleep sometimes for an hour or 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so it may average out to 5 or 6 hours a night—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which isn't a lot, plus it would be nice to get uninterrupted if you could.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  When was the last time you took any of the Provigil?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, um, like in the last two weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took it, out of two weeks, probably [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you usually take 1 or 2 tablets a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [INAUDIBLE] I take more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, now I know some of these medications, you really have long experience with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With the Zoloft, which you've been familiar with for quite some time, I think it's fairly unlikely that the Zoloft is having a dramatic impact either on your weight or your eyes, your eyesight because, um, you know, you are pretty familiar with that medication, you know, you are pretty familiar with that medication, it has helped with the premenstrual symptoms, uh, and I doubt that things would shift so that it would have that kind of a side effect.  Also, the Adderall XR you're pretty familiar with, you've been taking that for a long time also and there have even been times, I think we've tried the shorter acting, that wasn't as effective, it didn't sit as well with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's unlikely to be implicated.  With the Wellbutrin XL, are you getting a generic form of that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's Budeprion or Bupropion?  Are you aware of whether your pharmacy has changed generics, do the pills look any different lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, because there can be a difference in potency between generics.  If there had been a change, it might be something worth looking into.  Um, let me look at some of the, uh, I'm going to get out the PDR and look at some of the really unusual side effects with Lamictal and Lithium because I have a feeling those being the more recent ones, you've eliminated Imipramine, Vistaril, Abilify, Cogentin, you're keeping the Provigil more or less at a minimum, so I'm thinking, at this point, those are less likely to still be having an impact on your weight or your eyesight, so let me take a look.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My memory is pretty shot too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's really the worst, like I can't remember anything.  Short term memory, I don't even know what that is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And that differs from your experience with the attention deficit, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, let's look at some of the fine print on these and see if we can narrow it down because it may just be, you know, the more specific physiology from the other things you're taking.  Oops, sorry about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a big book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know, it's huge and it just gets bigger every year.  Um, any other, um, medicines that you're taking from your primary doctor?  For a while there you were on Prednisone, as I recall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Still or not now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Did you notice much difference when you came off that with any eyesight or weight or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How's your pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like, there's nothing I can do about it, I think that's what, another reason I don't go out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is it affecting you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My pain?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My back, my lower back, um, you know, the pain goes from my legs—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, my spine to the top of my neck to the bottom, it burns on each side, and my shoulders, I'm very tense all day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Does the pain ever migraine any place else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get any numbness?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, my hernia, that's what hurts too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was supposed to have surgery for that and I never went.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  What's holding you back from going for the surgery?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I feel like I just don't want to go, I mean I honestly don't want another surgery with the girls, you know, I have like ten reasons, I don't like to leave the house, that's it, plain and simple.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If somebody would deliver the surgery, I would take it.  It's so hard for me to leave the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that reminds me of when we first started working together as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there anything that you can think of and, you know, I know we've tried some different medicines and so forth, that tended to help the most with being able to get out of the house or, uh, do what you need to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think the Wellbutrin is good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to look up the Lithium in here, okay, 1670—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do you really read out of there?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I find that this book is very helpful, the PDR, when I'm looking for really obscure, like it'll tell you in 1% of people they report such and such and even if I had a computer in here, which I don't in this particular office, and I looked online, I wouldn't always find as much, you know, specific minutia—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I think you're having some unusual side effects that could be associated with the Lithium and possibly the Lamictal as well, um, so let me just see if anything jumps out.  Some of the things that they talk about in terms of eye stuff includes feeling like your eyes are bugging out, that's called exophthalmos, um, transient scotoma, that's like if you see things moving across your field of vision, it's almost like a clear thing moving or fleeting—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With your eyes open?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, um, to have a metallic taste in your mouth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I have dry mouth all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Polyarthralgia can happen with Lithium, that would be aches and pains, um, psoriasis, itching, generalized itching with or without rash.  You're talking about itching a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh and you're thirsty a lot, that can happen, um, now I'm looking at the central nervous system issues, it says twitching and muscle hyperirritability, you're talking about your feet, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which you've been talking about for quite some time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's an eye movement disorder where the eyes kind of oscillate, like you're trying to look down at something but they're kind of, it's called downbeat nystagmus, you're looking down and it's oscillating up and down, that could be involved and your difficulty reading, okay.  Do you ever have a situation where you feel like your visual field is constricted, almost like tunnel vision, like you can't see as wide was you used to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, I think Lithium has enough, um, potential vision side effects that I'm going to propose that we look at cutting the Lithium in half and maybe putting back some of the Abilify because I think the Abilify did help and it may be able to substitute for the Lithium.  I'll tell you a couple of other things that have come to life recently about Abilify that I like for your particular situation.  Not only does it have an indication for, um, mood swings, um, and bipolar disorder but it does also for augmentation of the treatment of symptoms of depression—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it seems like when used in relatively small doses with Zoloft, um, Wellbutrin, it can help those be even more effective but maybe also provide some relief from mood swings—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it's not going to interfere with the Adderall and the Wellbutrin for the ADD, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Abilify made, remember the cramps I was having all over my body?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the cramps have gotten better since you stopped?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was like the worst.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, I associated your foot movements with the cramps, so I was, uh, and so even at small doses the Abilify didn't sit well with you and it sounds as though, let's take a look at Lamictal because I had been thinking of that too, as like an alternate mood stabilizer to the Lithium.  Let me take a look if the Lamictal can have any of those weird side effects.  So you were sensitive to the Abilify?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was like having Charlie horses all over my body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I couldn't even walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So those did resolve, that's good to know.  Yeah, I'm sorry, I associated that with the foot situation.  Okay, so I'm going to make a big note about that.  DC of Abilify led to relief from muscle cramping, but not the toe movements.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Toe flexion still exists, all right, did you ever take more Lamictal than you're taking now?  Did you ever work, did you work your way up to the once a day yet or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so you're still doing the starter pack and it's still, I know I started you off on a very slow, uh, introduction to it which is good because you're not having a rash which is fabulous.  All right, so let me just take a quick look, but there's still promise there for maybe being able to cross taper with that Lithium.  Cross taper meaning you go down gradually on the Lithium and we let the packet of Lamictal work its way up.  Okay, 1449, okay, and as you know, one of the major things we look for with Lamictal is rash and the good news, no appearance of rash and usually starting low, going slow, working your way up, usually there's the least risk of rash with that, so I'm going to see if there's anything about eyes.  Usually Lamictal is fairly weight neutral as well, which is another plus in terms of looking at the long term.  Okay, has your neck pain gotten any worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's low to medium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, um, and the, um, pains like muscle pain or joint pain, is that pretty similar to before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, here's one I have never heard in association with Lamictal but I have to say it to you, amnesia, you said your memory—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Isn't very good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that is worrisome, it is really worrisome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Short term, it's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like [NAME OTHER] will say, he'll tell me when he's coming home from work and then a couple hours later I'm like, what time you coming home from work?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He thought I was kidding, like the couple times I had to have him repeat something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Some people can experience hot flashes or flushing with the, uh, Lamictal, um, let me see if I can find anything about the eyes.  Arthritis, leg cramps, twitching, confusion, apathy—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm trying to find anything about the eyes, they don't have a lot in here about the eyes.  There can be light sensitivity, photophobia, there can be, actually here's a few, difficulty with producing tears, so if you have dry eyes, uh, again, eye movements, irritation around the eyes, there's no medication that's totally benign is there.  All right, does your Lithium come in a capsule or a tablet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, a tablet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It comes in a tablet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about dividing a tablet in half, we're going to cut your dose in half and you'll take half a tablet in the morning, half at bedtime, so in other words, you're spreading out the one dose a day that you're getting, instead of taking 2 doses and see if any of those effects lessen.  I would stay with the Lamictal for now.  If reducing the Lithium doesn't give any relief at all, it kind of starts to point the finger toward the Lamictal.  I will look for a plan B to replace the Lithium because I think the Lithium served its purpose, you know, it helped you during the hospitalization, getting out of the hospital, there may still be a role for a small amount but I think taking the 600 of extended release a day has had some effects that have been frustrating—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, you're beautiful, if you felt better about yourself, you know, you would be more interested in going out and I think with everything that's going on and not feeling all that confident about your eyesight, um, you know, across the board, none of those things are going to help with feeling better about getting out.  Um, we don't want to discontinue anything abruptly because your system is used to having the Lithium but cutting the dose in half, spreading it out, that's not going to hurt, um, I know you need the Adderall and the Wellbutrin for the ADD and the Provigil back up, we can stay with that, um, and I think it makes sense to, you know, and the Lamictal, it's built in that you gradually work your way up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So how am I going to get my memory, like what's that about?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It may be that it improves with less Lithium.  Um, if not and if the memory is still a really prominent problem—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll keep the Lithium where it is at half and half, we'll set up another visit soon, we'll look at, okay, are we going to forget the Lamictal, by the time we get together again, you'll probably have cut down the Lithium and you'll be on the part of the packet that says take the Lamictal every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you take the Lamictal every day and say it's even worse, I can't remember anything and, you know, I have these weird visual stuff going on, call me and what we'll do is we'll have you cut the dose in half, half again and be off in a couple of days and, um, we can talk about alternatives for mood stabilizers as well.  Um, let me look back, I know that Abilify has been tried, Risperdal has been tried, we're not going to go there again.  Um, did you and I ever discuss Geodon before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, if the Lamictal doesn't pan out, Geodon may be something that makes sense.  It belongs to the group of medicines in general that include Risperdal, Abilify, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Invega, that's a new one, um, but out of them it's the one that's got the least likely to aggravate weight and I have seen that in my practice.  It is the one that's preferred by the American Diabetic Association not to aggravate weight as much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, it sometimes takes some times to find the right mood stabilizing dose for someone but it may be the thing that could step in instead of the Lithium.  Um, the other option is possibly to consider other, um, anticonvulsant agents.  Depakote may not be the best choice for you because it also can sometimes lead to some weight gain but, um, Depakote has some cousins, Lamictal is one, although that may not be what you opt to stay with, Tegretol, there's some research that supports that, um, a lot of the anticonvulsant medicines also help with migraines and I know that headaches are prominent.  Um, there's another one too that I'm thinking about with your particular situation, with the chronic pain, the anxiety, the difficulty sleeping, um, and some mood shifts, it's called Gabapentin or Neurontin, um, and the nice thing about it is it can be adjusted in small increments, it comes in 100 mg capsules and to just put it in perspective, some people take 3600 mg a day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's cheap and generic, we like that, um, and it may offer enough support for the anxiety, the mood, the depression and chronic pain, maybe that's something we could look at even, uh, if it looks like we're going to, uh, phase out the Lamictal too, um, but I just want you to have something that can go in place of the Lithium, you know, since its days may be numbered or we may end up taking it down to just a small dose, it kind of supports keeping depression under control and I just think at the doses you've been taking, it's hard to sustain over the long run, you know, um, so there's a couple of ideas out there, you know, we have things that we could use instead of both the Lithium and the Lamictal, we just don't want to make, you know, sudden big changes or anything, so how does that sound.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So we'll cut the dose of the Lithium in half, spread that out.  Do you want me to write this down so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Please.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're not more confused.  Um, we'll continue with the Lamictal dose pack as it's written but if you run into any trouble with it, call me right away, you know, I check my voice mail very regularly and then we'll talk about having you come down gradually off that, we'll set our next appointment today so we're ready to talk about plan B if we need a plan B.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How is your Adderall supply, do you need me to write you another hard copy script?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, its always good to have that on hand, I think it's been a little while since I did so I mailed you some last time.  Okay and you brought back samples and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I just grabbed all the bottles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, do you want the samples, I should have brought them, I didn't even think of that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it doesn't matter, yeah, oh yeah, you brought the bottles so you could show me, yeah, I'm going to give this back to you, the Vistaril.  The Vistaril can still be handy if you do have itching, irritability, even if you have trouble sleeping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes this helps, yeah, exactly, um, and then the Cogentin, hang on to it, the Benztropine is the generic, if we ever do try the Geodon, once in a while people have those muscle side effects—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just good to have on hand in case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay and then you had a letter you need me to write, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I brang all the paperwork.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good, I'll take a look at that and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The first thing I've got to tell you is [NAME OTHER] was my, um, counselor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For, for the, um, you know, um, after you go IOP, intensive outpatient counseling—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You go to single counseling and [NAME OTHER] was my therapist or however—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, he, he had, we had a difference of opinion about bipolar, he started telling me about stories of his clients who have been off the medicine and how they were, you know, they're cured and he didn't believe in medicine at all, he kept references to somebody who got off the medicine and they were fine but he didn't think I needed the medicine, like it's all in my head, so it was okay once we, if we didn't talk about that, I liked him as a counselor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But as soon as that came up, I felt like he really didn't know at all what I was feeling or I can't have a counselor that doesn't believe in my problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have to agree with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If effects my sobriety and all that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This was, I don't even know what happened, I forget what happened—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Between him and I and I get this letter in the mail—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's take a look.  Dear [PATIENT NAME], again, I'm sorry for the inappropriate remark I made to you about trying to keep you in the OPC program and intreatment, though it's true but unnecessary of me to say that.  I'm puzzled over why you're not returning the several calls I made to you.  This does not give you the confidence to deal with the issues that we discussed in our last session.  I'm discharging you from the OPC program and referring you back to IOP.  Considering the legal issues you're facing, I'm giving you the opportunity to come back to IOP and complete your treatment program.  Outpatient once a week is out of the question.  Another option for you is to connect with a drug and alcohol program in [DEIDENTIFIED] and complete your treatment there.  I will be glad to write a letter stating that [DEIDENTIFIED] was too much for you and a transfer was approved by me.  Your $35 payment last time was put into your OPC account, instead of $25 going to the missed session account, so you have a $25 credit.  If you decide to enter the IOP program, then you will have to pay the $50 on admission.  If you decide to enter a program in, and then he says [DEIDENTIFIED] but I think he means [DEIDENTIFIED], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You will have to pay the balance due for a letter to be issued to you approving the transfer.  Either way, I'm looking forward to hearing from you and wishing you the very best, sincerely [NAME OTHER], certified addiction counselor from [DEIDENTIFIED] and the letter is dated [DATE].  Inappropriate remark, do you have any idea what he's referring to?  Inappropriate remark?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, maybe the bipolar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't even remember.  When I got this letter, I knew we were having a problem because when I'm down in my, you know, down and out in bed, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't just pop up and go to counseling, I don't do anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what he doesn't understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He's telling me you just have to do it, you know, get over yourself and do it, it's not like a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like a switch which I wish it was.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And even if there's a question about a diagnosis, I mean I would say right now, the main things you're grappling with are the attention deficit, that's a leading diagnosis, um, a lot of the symptoms of depression, you have had mood swings, how much that was related to the substances or not, it's not 100% sure, we still need to consider bipolar as a possibility—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Although the depression is by far the most prominent and it may turn out to be major depression, you know, aggravated by the presence of substances and so forth, but it doesn't help for someone to be saying you shouldn't be taking medicine, you know, if you want to be in recovery, you shouldn't be taking any medicine, I mean how is he going to suggest that you deal with the ADD, you know, was he going to start—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was all in my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All of this?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe that's the comment he was, um, talking about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, I need to address that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could you address that in the letter?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You bet.  Let's talk about what do you think would help you the most in terms of staying with your sobriety, which you've been doing, it's been quite a while, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How long have you been clean and sober now, it's been—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Over a year, yeah, which is fantastic.  Um, do you feel as though there's a setting in which if you had support for maintaining sobriety and then understanding about psychiatric issues that would be ideal or intensive outpatient where they're able to delve more into trying to parse out the psychiatric, you know, I could work with whatever mental health professionals they have there, I'm just very surprised that [DEIDENTIFIED] would refer someone to a therapist or counselor who questions the assistance of psychiatric, you know, conditions.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My other patient got, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And good for them, God bless them, you know, maybe they had Lyme disease or something—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That got treated, I mean a lot of diseases can have psychiatric symptoms but that doesn't mean that's true for everybody.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We wish it were true for everybody but, you know, and, you know, sometimes diagnoses are murky, you know, nonetheless—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What you're feeling is very real and the point is to get you relief.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, whatever that takes, whatever areas we need to look in, so it sounds as though, this letter says, even if you don't come back to me, [NAME OTHER] certified addiction counselor, you need to go someplace else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh and I did call to set that up—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the lady either, I never got the, I can't do the messages—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, because I can't take the number but I forget that we have message, you know, the voice mail—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, I didn't check that, she might have called—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I called again and they were, there's a question about what paperwork because I'm an open cause—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was just there and I was going to be, you know, transferred—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they had a problem or something about that, so I haven't really been attentive to signing up for a counselor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it may have something to do with what he's referring to, that you actually have some credit balance but if you decided to go to the IOP program there would be an additional balance of $50 to pay.  If you saw a counselor there, $25 would go toward that session, so maybe they were bogged down in the finances but what do you think would serve your needs the best, I mean if you could see a counselor like [NAME OTHER] but who acknowledges mental health issues and could offer some support, would that be ideal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because you may not need the intensity of an intensive outpatient if you've maintained sobriety for over a year.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, every time I used or drank, it was because of my emotions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The bipolar overwhelming me, like I'd be up one minute and down the other.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was all just my relief, that's how I dealt with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't crave drugs or I don't do pot, I don't drink anything—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have no urges to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since I've been on the medicine that I've been on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you think it would work better for you to see someone in [DEIDENTIFIED] closer to where you live or go back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and one of the counselors there who's not [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think here, is there any here at [DEIDENTIFIED]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is a good question.  I know [DEIDENTIFIED] does work, you have Keystone Health Plan East.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to give you the name of somebody that, um, one of my patients who is bipolar is working with and this is a knowledgeable person that I trust, he's very experienced, his name is [NAME OTHER].  He is in the [DEIDENTIFIED] system and he and I work closely together with these, uh, kinds of concerns, so maybe contacting him, finding out about his availability.  In the letter that I write for your legal situation, I'm going to write that I made a referral, um, and then, you know, we'll just make it clear how you've been keeping up with ongoing treatment with me—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There was a difference of opinion with [DEIDENTIFIED].  We're working on disposition, you know, this way you have a referral and, um, it may be that you need to call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office, let them know what your insurance coverage is, if it's not covered there, they may have someone that they can recommend but at least I know he's someone who's very knowledgeable about mental health and recovery issues and he's not going to be balking at someone needing to be on several medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because other patients that we work with, he tends to do a good job working with people with multiple medications and even issues like memory issues and so forth, so let me jot down his name for you, yeah, he's very good.  Yeah, because I'm going to make an extra copy of this letter from [NAME OTHER], one for your chart and one for you because this is an odd letter, you know, and the inappropriate remark and his admission there's an inappropriate remark, it suggest to me that you shouldn't return to working with him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean there may be a way to have a resolution, you know, write him a letter and say I appreciate your efforts on my behalf, you know, I've gotten a good referral and so forth and rest assured, um, you can even ask for the refund of the $25 probably.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, so, let me jot down [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], he's a psychologist, he's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he works at a couple of different offices so maybe there's one that's more convenient, [DEIDENTIFIED], okay, while I'm writing on the back of this appointment card, let's you and I set another time.  What time of day tends to be best for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, like 12 or 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Around 12 or 1, let me take a look.  I would have [DATE] at 1, so that's about 5 or 6 weeks from now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that okay?  Yeah and definitely you can call me before then.  I'm going to be out the last two weeks of August but, um, I will have someone helping to cover for me and I can be reached also, so—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, next appointment with [PHYSICIAN NAME], [DATE] at 1 p.m.  I'll jot down my voice mail, okay, now the other thing that I would suggest regarding your eyes, you did mention that you may need bifocals, um, I'm wearing progressive bifocals, my two eyes are very different as well and it's also transitions lenses and they're great because you don't ever have to worry about putting on sunglasses, you've got instant sunglasses when you go outside, they can blur the line with the bifocals so nobody ever knows you're wearing them and you've got them when you need them and then with your regular vision, if one eye is off and the other one is normal, you know, the upper part of the glasses, they can be adjusted to compensate for that and they're not all that expensive now so that might be something that helps to suit your needs, especially in terms of if you ever need sunglasses and the bifocals are hidden so no one is looking at you saying look at that woman wearing bifocals, half the time they're looking like sunglasses anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So and you can get a cute fashion because I know sometimes you like it as a fashion accessory.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can read this now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fabulous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I haven't been able to, I would have to do this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Put it far away and I just read this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I brought this because [NAME OTHER], my lawyers—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kept this information.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh good, okay, so that's where it needs to be sent.  All right, and then a progress note and the last ones you have are from last year, the [DEIDENTIFIED], all right, when is your next appearance in court?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well let me go ahead and, you know, do a new summary, um, and also response with, um, you know, addressing what's going on with this letter from [NAME OTHER], okay, and is there any other paperwork that you need me to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I was just worried about the therapy thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no, I actually think today's meeting was great because seeing this letter from [NAME OTHER], helps me understand you're kind of high and dry in a sense—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean I agree that he's probably not the counselor to continue with if there's issues about inappropriate remarks and who knows what, you have been maintaining sobriety, it doesn't sound like intensive outpatient is needed, um, a savvy therapist is needed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and then with, uh, your attorney, today you'd like me to write a letter just summarizing, you know, where his last records left off, um, that you're continuing with sobriety, that you've been consistent with your, um, with your appointments with me—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can you address it to this, to this guy?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER], okay and then I could have a copy go to [NAME OTHER], how about that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, that would be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, well how about, do you want me to go ahead and write that right now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, maybe I will and then I can copy it, I can give you a copy, we can get this mailed, um, and I could even fax a copy to your attorney—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That would be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just so everybody is on the same page.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, well what I think we're going to do, you know, just while I'm working on the written part is, um, I'll turn off the recorder and thank you very much for the communication part, um, so I'm going to switch that off and then you and I will collaborate on the letter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

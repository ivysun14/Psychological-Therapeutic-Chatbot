<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It keeps me happy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did you guys, did you guys ever get that, uh, court stuff all straightened out?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we're still waiting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The results of the evaluation that was done [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Okay.  Well I'll see what I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Seems like a long time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does seem like a long time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause he's still under house arrest—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He is?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So were have, he's been—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he has to answer the phone 24/7.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which makes it easy to answer phone calls, and I'm supposed to be the first one answering it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We just got to either carry it with him, remember to carry it with him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or if it rains, he's got to make a mad dash.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the old house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we painted and [INAUDIBLE] more phones.  We have to.  Our house is too big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, how big a house is it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it's different—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three stories.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Levels, the problem, that's the problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We didn't have any phone upstairs, so—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When he went to bed at night, there was no way he could make it downstairs to get to the phone.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's two stories in the house—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause it's basic kitchen which has, which has stairs going down in—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which apparently goes halfway down, basically makes one little room.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like a half a room—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One half down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then there's the upstairs rooms going up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's rooms all over the place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] steps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] permission to talk to DSS, or S, or whatever it is [INAUDIBLE] person, and, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, her number's [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gotcha.  All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I talk to her a lot.  If we leave, we have to call before we leave—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then when we come back, we have to call her, and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When I talked to her before we left, I asked if she had heard anything.  She said she hadn't.  She goes, she was going to try and check to see what's going on, 'cause this has been since before Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It has been, it's going on 6 months.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's [INAUDIBLE] for the whole family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We can't do anything.  We can't go anywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, exactly, exactly.  [PATIENT NAME], how, you feeling okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Pretty much?  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing going, going on except mining the game.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mining the game?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I keep digging for treasure in the game—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I can't do it in the real life at the moment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At the moment, yeah, I guess not.  You're sort of stuck in the house.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's the closest thing to going out mining [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, that certainly, that certainly knocks out your social life, I'll tell ya that.  Um, what are you, what, um, what do you do most of the day, just doing that or other things or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm either watching TV, finding a way to bug my brother—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's probably number 1 on the list.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Anyways, so besides watching TV, bugging my brother, it's hanging out with my dad or playing, um, [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, gotcha, gotcha.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We've spend a small fortune on books lately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, betcha.  Who, who do you play Dungeons and Dragons with?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, it's not really Dungeons and Dragons, it's called [INAUDIBLE].  It's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh it is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, except my dad knows how to play it, and my brother knows how to play it, so they taught me.  Now we can play.  They always how [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You do it on the computer or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's like Dungeons and Dragons, it's an actual game.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a role playing game.  That's pretty much it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not much else going on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just either worry about that, bug my brother, watching TV—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool, gotcha.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And possibly following the dog around the [INAUDIBLE] waiting for a chance when it just stays still so I can pet him basically—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I like to pay attention to the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any, no problems with the medicines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Tell me, no it is not exactly?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I don't know.  I just think they're not exactly.  Sometimes I get like a couple minutes late taking—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No big deal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's the only problem, but not exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A couple days late I worry about it.  If you're a little of time, no big deal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, then it's going perfectly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sleeps okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He sleeps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I sleep more than I walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You sleep more than you walk?  That's a bummer.  Um, what about, um, you look, you, you look like you feel good, and I don't see any, any, any irritability or anything like that.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He has a touch of it, wanting to stay up late at night though—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then he'll fall asleep in the afternoon, and when he falls asleep, trying to wake him up is like almost impossible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is so hard to wake up once he falls, actually falls asleep.  He'll go down on the chair or sofa, you know, like eleven o'clock—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In the morning, and he goes to school at four, and sometimes it's all we can do to get him up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What school does he go to?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The home bound version.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But yeah, that's all in [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's home bound plus it's a school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How are, how's your grades going, how's it going?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They don't do grades.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh?  They don't do grades?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's not on a, he's on a, it's not a diploma, it's a certificate program.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's got 1 more year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.  What's he going to do after that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No idea.  Your practicing that now, getting pretty professional.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's the goal she's given me, and I have practiced a couple times in case I need to use it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cool.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of those, one of the [INAUDIBLE] I picked up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	At least you can laugh about it now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pretty much.  Not much to laugh about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have no idea what [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  He's got plenty of meds.  He's taking those too.  Taking the Abilify 15 two at bedtime, and you're taking Trileptal 300 one in the morning and 3 at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's 3 of them, yeah, 3 in the morning, 3 at night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, 3 in the morning.  I, you know, I mean 900 in the morning and 900 in the evening.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right, and Geodon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE]  Geodon 80, um, 1 in the morning and 1 at bedtime.  Okay?  Anything else?  That's it, and it looks like you're doing well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I'm listening.  You don't have to tap.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I, I saw that.  That's all right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I can [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

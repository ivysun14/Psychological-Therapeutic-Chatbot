<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With client number 1429-110, March 4, 1971, interview number 16, client 1429-110, March 4, 1971.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Got to get the Social Service directory (inaudible at 0:00:23.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not like we're listed on it, but [I have it] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think they revised it (inaudible at 0:00:30.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have, like, this yellow (inaudible at 0:00:34.3) revised at all. But I don't think we're numbered.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that the way you get into this thing is by numbers?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You pay, just paying some money. The rest of the world...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know that that - I just thought they listed everything (inaudible at 0:00:53.4) in New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-uh, you have to join the Welfare Council that's out in New York. It's probably not very expensive, I know, but you do have to pay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't know that. That's why a lot of the little (inaudible at 0:01:12.2) courses are not listed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, my guess is it costs, you know, a hundred dollars a year or something like that. 0:01:22.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:01:24.2). Some of the places (inaudible at 0:01:26.7). Because I know they don't list any of the - you know, like, the free clinics or anything in there like that. Oh, wow, (inaudible at 0:01:43.7). I was talking with a friend of mine last night. He's in the - he's in individual therapy too. So we were talking about therapists, (inaudible at 0:02:12.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:02:13.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, kind of, yeah. And he - see, he's got a thing, he thinks one of the things - while originally it was, like, really kind of Freudian (inaudible at 0:02:27.2). He'd question me a lot sexually and things like that. And one of the things he always said was, like, "What I ever did because I didn't have a father, and what I did." He said, he says, "You know, you probably should have had some real anger about that or some real..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is your friend talking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I never felt, like, anger being there because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We talked about that, though, too a little bit, didn't we?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We mentioned it, yeah. We mentioned it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That your father died too early?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think the way we mentioned it was when I said my mother - who would my mother be mad at because my father died early? And then I did do things, like, when I went back home I tried to find out, you know, what he was like. But I never thought about, like, when I was little, you know, that I would have had anger. When he first would mention it, like, maybe a year ago, I never even - I just shrugged it off. Anyhow, we were talking about therapists. And I said, "I guess before I ever went to therapy, I was looking, like, for this older distinguished kind of a - like a father figure. 0:03:58.3</p>

<p>Like the person you go to, to solve your problems, you know, or to ask advice. All these kinds of things, which I didn't - I kind of, you know, like - when I see a picture of Freud, you know, this is what I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you had in mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess like a father. I guess that's, like, a father is somebody in authority who tells you, you know, this is the way it is or says, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And, you know, that's - I guess I hate to admit it, but I really would, you know, want you to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Still?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I really would. I never thought about it this much before, but I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be nice, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Comfortable, comforting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You don't fit into that, though. See, you come in as a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, but it would be nice to - you know, to have somebody else take care of you that way, tell you what to do, what's right, what's wrong? Think it would work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's - yeah, other than a mother, you know. A mother - I don't like to go to a mother and ask her advice. Although I get it all the time, but, like, a father is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody you could listen to because you'd have to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think because I'd really want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have to obey?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think I'd want to. I'd want to listen to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you never had a chance to do that before.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, you don't, you don't fit. See, because you're - you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it can't be me is what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you don't fit my image of - you know, like, this gray haired man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not old enough, not distinguished enough, don't dress in a pinstriped suit. 0:05:49.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, you don't have to dress in a pinstripe suit, but, you know, see, you (inaudible at 0:06:01.3). You won't tell me things, you know, you won't tell me things about myself is what I think I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, that you think I know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You have to grasp certain things, you know. I mean, you can't - all right, I understand the damn therapy I think, you know. And I know that for my own good, it's not good for somebody to tell me what to do. But on the other hand, I would like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wish that would work like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that it would be good for you? I mean, you wish that it would be good. You wish it would work like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like - well, it's, like, you don't zap me, you know, except once in a while, and usually only when I lead up to it that I get zapped. So maybe I'm leading up to getting zapped, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does zap mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Zap means, like - well, here's an example of being zapped, okay. Last Friday night I took out this girl that I haven't seen for a year and a half, and who I dated a year and a half. And we were sitting talking, you know, over at my place. And I thought she looked a little down in the dumps. So I mentioned something that - about, you know, "You look a little down in the dumps and how come?"</p>

<p>And she says, "Well, I didn't want to say anything," I says, "It's really bad?" She says, "Yeah," and her face was just, you know, like this. And then she said, "I'm two months pregnant." And I'm sure my whole face must have just fell through the floor because all I did - I just put up my hands like that and my face got all - I mean, I just felt like a pile of shit and then I said - I says, "Do you know the guy?" You know, that was my first reaction, "Do you know the guy?" But that is what I mean by... 0:08:10.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it really hits you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, that just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Emotionally?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it just...</p>

<p>COUSELOR: Do you know (inaudible at 0:08:24.3) an abortion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then she was kidding me. That's (inaudible at 0:08:27.1). See, and then, you know, after she saw that I was convinced she felt bad, you know - well, not really bad, but then I remembered she pulled that once before on me in a church of all places. And I was - I was - I really almost paddled her. I was, you know, just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's what zapped means?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hit hard emotionally?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess it's kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Only in that particular case, you were zapped about somebody else, not about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well - yeah, yeah, that's - I guess that's what it was, yeah, or it was because it reminded me of the time when this girl told me, you know, that she was pregnant and really was. And maybe that's why I reacted that way because I couldn't really laugh it off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you were the father that time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that ended up in an abortion thing. And, you know, so the time in the church she had just missed her period a little bit. But we hadn't even been screwing, so how the hell can you get pregnant when you're not screwing? And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With somebody else, that's how you can get pregnant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At that time I don't think she would have. Maybe, but I doubt it. This time I didn't know because I hadn't seen her for a year and a half, so I figured, given her emotional peculiarities and her abilities in bed, I would say she would be, you know, would be a possibility. Anyhow, that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's zapping?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now back to last night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, he said, like, in his therapy thing, he says - and he's, you know, it doesn't matter what he's like. But he said, you know - he said he kind of pictures his therapist in the same way. And he's got this guy that's almost his age, you know, thought the same way. But I guess the big point was, like, you know, what - see, you're somebody I tell things about. And I think I've almost, like, really blocked asking, like, for advice except, you know, the way I talk. 0:11:11.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there is - you know, like, there is a curiosity, which I'm leery about asking, you know, I'm not sure why. But, like, it's, like, you know, you can really see me the way I can't see myself, but you won't tell me. So why won't you tell me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think I can see you in a way that you don't see yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, you know, like, number one, you had experience so you say, right? I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:12:08.7) my resume.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, okay, maybe - maybe that's it, you know. Because I still know, you know - I'm still looking for this old time father figure and, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I can't, you know, change that part of me. I can't gain 30 years for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, you avoided the question anyhow. I mean, like (inaudible at 0:12:54.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why I don't give you advice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I don't think it will do you any good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it will become, like, mother gives advice. I think I could give you advice until I was blue in the face and it wouldn't mean anything unless you were convinced that it was right. So you can make up your own mind about things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, but wouldn't, if you did give me advice...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wouldn't I then - you know, wouldn't I then either have to, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, you want to be in therapy with me for the rest of your life? When are you going to learn to make up your own mind about things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, but I think - well, okay, I think I'd want to start right now. But I would think first of all, what I'd have to do - you know, if you say something, like, I don't know if giving - giving advice is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the point? Does this guy's therapist give him advice or are you jealous?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, we didn't talk that much - we didn't talk that much about it. It's like, though - it got me thinking as to how I think of you. And the way I - you know, the things I first of all, conjured up, you know, this father figure kind of thing. You know, and by that I just mean somebody who gives me advice, who is in authority, who is able to see through me, I think that's it, to see what I'm really saying. Okay, well, what do I get? You know, I don't know, it's damned Rogerian stuff. I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, but I guess one of my problems is I'm not sure that I believe that people can really see through people. They may have ideas. And I guess it seems to you like that's happened with you quite a number of times, but always with women. 0:14:51.3</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what I'm saying is that I'm not sure that it's really that possible to see through a person and be able to understand him that well. Like, I really believe that you can understand - you have the potential to understand yourself a hundred times better than I could possibly understand you. But it also seems to me that you believe that people can see through other people. And in your experience, that's happened to you on several occasions, but they've always been women who've seen through you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never men.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never men when it's happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, like Sylvio, the bitch. And for a change you'd like it, you know, to be a man because that's what you're looking for, a father figure. Is that what you're saying? F - - these women who act like men, I want a man to act like a man and not a woman who acts like a man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I know this even though I don't like to admit it. I'm really susceptible to what other - you know, what other people say just on almost - almost every point. Like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to help you get rid of that. And I won't help you get rid of that by making you susceptible to what I have to say. 0:17:07.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, you don't pull...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why should I act like everybody else? Why should I act like your friends do? If you want somebody to give you advice, so you can go to your friends. If you want to give yourself advice, you come to me, that's the way I look at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then - I mean, I - you know, I can't relate to you, like, as - I've been using you like a sounding board, you know, which I don't really like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because I don't think - okay, maybe - I guess I do because that leaves me do what I usually do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How old are you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thirty-one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, and we've seen each other 16 times (inaudible at 0:17:59.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, 31 years you expect to change with 16 hours of therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, these God damn idiots that start those things say - they told me when I came in here that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, then do something if you want to get finished in 20 hours. You only have...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what I can do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have four hours left.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is that a tactic or, you know, like, is it - they told me when I came in, they said, what would happen, you know, (inaudible at 0:18:33.6). What would happen in longer periods of therapy will probably happen in, like, 20 - 20 periods. And I know the last two periods, although I think the period when I mentioned about be a good boy and take your beating (ph). That one - ever since then, I kind of, you know, like - up until today back at home, I haven't really thought much about going to therapy. I've just been - you know, I haven't been paying much attention to myself. I've just been going along. 0:19:12.2</p>

<p>And then yesterday and today, it's, like, a thing starts - things start churning again and I'm starting to think, like, about myself more again. I don't know if I had to pull back before or what it was. But I can't see - well, I can try to force myself but then I think I'm faking it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Force yourself to what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To whatever is supposed to happen in 20 sessions. And I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're trying to see some change but you don't want to fool yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I get all - I don't know, I get - yeah, I'm very leery of when - I don't know, maybe because I'm really reading this stuff on conscious stuff. I get leery when I think I see something, you know, I can say, now that looks almost like it's a pattern. It almost looks like that's the way I am. I put most of my main - you know, like if I see myself getting zapped, or if I see, like, a - something where, either I have a musk - like a physical change, then I think that is coming close to me. You know, and then I think about those things, but I distrust what I think about those things because to me it's, like, always split, you know.</p>

<p>There's an emotional side of me, which I really don't know. And I can see parts of it, you know, with my mind. But then when I think about them with my mind and I talk about them with my mouth, I don't know that that's really, you know, what's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you make any sense out of that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you? 0:21:22.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, then say it again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, and I'm thinking, see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I'm thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:21:37.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, when I'm thinking, I don't trust this, this part of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And somehow, I must fear, like, anything more than, you know, a superficial emotion. That's - now when I say that, I can say that with my mind and that's all intellect stuff. And what gets me kind of pissed with myself in the progress I make is that what I say with my mind, you know, is, like, on a platform, and underneath, without touching this is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't believe what you say with your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, that's not - I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't hit what you're really feel inside, it's just the top surface.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like to think that it's as close as I right now can come to it. But it's, like, what's underneath is just - only comes out, like, when I'm zapped. And although I can keep talking about it here, I'm very calm down here. Unless I'm covering this up down here so effectively that I'm unaware of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so you really need to be hit emotionally in order to be able to get to the real stuff?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's almost like I have to be put on the spot - I have to be confronted. I have to be - well, put on the spot is the best thing, where I can't run and hide. You know, where I can't - like, I almost think I'm playing word games, except I don't know what else to do, which, you know, leads me almost to the place where I began. There are some times, you know, when I can feel things, then I don't know how to act (inaudible at 0:25:05.7) when that happens. 0:25:08.0</p>

<p>Like, last night - does this do any good, you know, like if I describe something - when I describe something, I'm not regaining the experience, you know. But what I do when I describe it is, like, describe what I did but it doesn't lead to me to understand very much why I did it, nor does it change it next time it happens, except I'm a little more aware of what's going on. I guess what I'm asking, you know, like, what's the value of therapy?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If that's the only gain, and it doesn't seem like much of a gain if you're just a little more aware the next time it happens.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But now I want to run to the defense and say it's much better than what I don't even know intellectually.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, at least you have some idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, I grasp...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even though you may not be able to stop it from happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I'm kind of happy sometimes when I do get sad. It's, like, this dumb thing what I said, you know, if somebody slaps me, then I think I'm being - that's what's - then I'm a good boy. Like, strange things are starting to happen again, like, it's, like, I see in so many ways where I've just been afraid to throw myself into something again. You know, when I stop to think about it, I have never thrown myself into something, worked hard at something. You know, just for long periods of time given things up, you know, for the sake of really becoming competent at something. 0:28:08.8</p>

<p>And yet, you know, when I write out these damn notes to myself, you know, I set things up, I schedule things. I want to learn all about psychology, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've never sacrificed something to gain anything, is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've sacrificed but only when it's almost been part of somebody else's decision. But, like, when I say I want to lose - like, I'm trying to lose 20 pounds, then I'm never going to go on a damn diet, I'm going to stay there, you know. Okay. Like, what did I do for lunch? You know, I started to get hungry, and I knew everybody wanted to go out, so, you know, I just said, you know, "Anybody going out?" Of course, they were going out and they were going where I wanted to go, so I went along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of staying back and not eating?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And it's, like, I can not eat for maybe two or three days, you know. And the only time I found when I really could effectively diet - like, I've lost maybe about six or seven pounds off, but it was when this girl zapped me and I felt so shitty for a month, that I had - you know, I had various stores of energy within myself not to eat. And it's, like, see, if you would - you know, if you would hit me with something and say, you know, "Well, you know, I see you this way and, you know, you really are out of it in a certain area," two bets, I could correct that area. 0:29:52.5</p>

<p>Now I'm not saying do that, but I'm saying I bet I would because somebody had told me to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's assuming that I'm correct.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, but let's say, you know, you said something, like, "You're not all that bad a singer, you know, why don't you get yourself into some lessons? Take some voice lessons." You know, something like that, which is one of the things I real - I got a whole psychology on singing that's weird. But I bet I would do it, but I would do it probably because it was somebody else, either seeing there's a possibility there that I can do something. And then, you know, giving me encouragement to do that. But that I wouldn't - out of the clear blue wouldn't make that decision and believe in it, you know. I doubt if I would do that. It's like that kind of thing.</p>

<p>And, you know, it's that way in almost everything. I see myself, like, even mechanics, car mechanics, I'm a complete dummy at putting a car together and taking it apart. And why, you know, [I mean is] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but why should you know anything about putting a car together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Most men in America know something about putting cars together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, do you know anything about putting cars together?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not a thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you a man in America?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why don't you know anything about putting cars together?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it doesn't interest me. I'd rather pay somebody else to do it. 0:31:48.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it interests me because I've always wanted to be able to, you know, to do something with my hands. You know, to create something and to know how something works.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you knit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've done that, you know, I've knit but I didn't knit very well either. I only did it a couple of times when I was little. I think part of it, you know, like with the car deal, I don't know, see, we never had a car. And I always shied away from that. But I've always shied away from anything like, you know, whatever the so called manly kinds of things to do are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you want to do them at the same time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's, like, a conflict, you know, because I think a guy's an idiot if he's, you know, like - I always thought a guy was an idiot, you know, like, if he was this real manly kind of person who, you know, knew all about mechanics, knew all about - you know, was very good in sports. Well, you know, I play sports but it's another thing, you know. Like, when I play basketball, you know, I'm big, I could use my weight and I do now. I get mad, you know, I've fouled just for the hell of it. But I never used to be that way.</p>

<p>And even today, you know, I'm 6'3 and I play guard. In other words, I stay outside and shoot, you know, from outside. I don't drive. I can remember driving maybe three times this whole year. And driving, you know, you drive down there and you're going to get killed, so I stay outside where it's nice and safe and I can shoot from outside. 0:33:35.1</p>

<p>Unless I'm angry - when I lose control, then I go inside, then I just want to - you know, then I want to get somebody. But rarely, you know, will that (inaudible at 0:33:51.3). And I always try to get control of myself and say, you know - and it just occurred to me, I started reading a book on death too. I don't know how that (inaudible at 0:34:18.5). Like, I've lived half my life if I'm lucky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lucky.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always thought I was going to die young.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how come you don't sing or knit anymore?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I sing, I sing at the Downtown Club. Oh, with that - now there, that's an example of being zapped. Because we just sang this concert and honest, I mean, you should see my face there. I mean, really that's old, trembling Alector right in the - because it - I never sang till I was 20 years old. And I always thought I had a frog voice, and I felt self-conscious. And, I mean, I'd sit away from people in chapel. And, you know, I come from a tradition where you sing all the time. Never sang at Christmas time.</p>

<p>And finally I had to go to a church choir where I learned how to sing. And then I went nuts over it. But I'm not a trained singer. And I know I have some guts because I applied - I've sung the One Pico in California, and then I sang in some churches and then I sang here, and I had to go down and audition, which is really shit easy, you know, nothing flat, nothing sharp, you just go up and down. 0:35:33.9</p>

<p>And I memorized - I got there early, there were 12 people ahead and I memorized the eight little tunes. I got up there and I already knew them in my head. Which says that maybe I got some guts, but it also says that I don't know what I'm doing with a hunk of music, you know, compared...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:35:50.2)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, oh God, yes, well, now (inaudible at 0:35:53.1), you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you do know what to do with a hunk of music because you were able to memorize those eight tunes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and I was fighting panic the whole time. Well, like, the One Pico I know, but now we got a thing, it's a Jewish thing called, "The Shabbat Service." And it's by a modern composer and it is really, I mean, you sing the - what you sing what would usually be the right notes are the wrong notes. You got to sing, you know, like (inaudible at 0:36:22.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sharps and flats?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and dissonant stuff, just - you know, I listened to it and I can't believe that that is the right note because I'll, you know - and every time he says, you know, somebody in the bass section is off, you know, I'm sure I light up like a top (ph). I light up like a top (ph). And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're the only untrained singer there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, except I sat by a guy in this one concert who was two beats behind. He was an old guy, I don't think he could hear very well. So I knew that I wasn't the only one that had to be missing. But I always feel...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's me, it's got to be me. And so the next time through I'll sing that note lightly, you know, I won't - but what it does is make me pull back like when we're in a concert, I'm not sure, I'm not certain. And in that kind of situation, I drop back. And yet, you know, if I wanted to be good, I could take voice lessons, or I could get on a piano and just memorize jumps and things like that.</p>

<p>I mean, because that's the way, you know, I could learn. And yet I don't. It's, like, I don't come into work - I mean, I come into work, you know, but I will purpose like - like last Friday, I had an appointment with a kid at ten o'clock. I knew I had to leave at nine o'clock. I also knew I had to go to the bank. I didn't get down at the bank until 9:30. It took me until 10:30 to get there, you know. And the kid, you know, makes a little comment, "Mr. Alector, you have an alarm clock?" You know, (inaudible at 0:38:06.6) a little, you know - and I almost blew this appointment, you know. 0:38:10.4</p>

<p>This is really important for this kid. As it worked out, you know, the guy at the place we had to go to was busy with other things. But, you know, it's, like, I plan things off so that I automatically will feel guilty or I also, I have to hustle, you know, to make up for lost time, when I have the time that I could, you know, be using to get ahead, I don't. It's almost like I sabotage my life. And I can't understand why - you know, why I continue - I think about it, you know, like, especially coming late. You know, when my mom would get me up, I'd get up and I'd always - I never was late for class until my senior year (inaudible at 0:39:06.5).</p>

<p>Never was late once. Well, that's a little over - I must have been late sometimes. But, you know, it was, like, that was a sin to be late almost. And now it's, like, nobody is telling me, I know I can get away with it. We don't have checks at our office. Other people do it, but I'm sure underneath I feel bad about it. You know, when I do pull in late. In fact, the other day I was early and I told my super, hey, you know, what time it is because I was two minutes early, first time it's ever happened in about two months.</p>

<p>You know, I do that in - see, that's where I had (inaudible at 0:40:04.2). I can see that's what I do. And I think the reason I do is because nobody is telling me what to do. And it's easier, you know. But then there's another part of me that - it's, like, spanks me when I am that way. When I don't - so why do you think that is? (Inaudible at 0:40:42.7), God, I mean, you won't tell me. No ideas. I mean, you have to feel something about that, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:40:54.5). No, you must - you have to feel something about that, as to why I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About why you screw yourself, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I don't end it there, and you should be able to say something about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About why you screw yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think I should be able to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, now see, you're not answering my question, though. You're not saying why - you know, why I do that, why I do all the things I say I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's more like the typical American male to blunder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now is that what you really believe or is that what you're just throwing out there to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're afraid people will think unless you are a blundering person, you're too good and conscientious and work too carefully, and don't play basketball and don't take singing lessons. And you should be able to fix up that car. If you don't do those things, they'll think you're gay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, because people who sing - men who sing are kind of sissy-like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How about men who play basketball?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're not. Maybe that's why you do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How about men who fix cars?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not usually gay, that's why you want to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, then I couldn't win either way I go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what I just suggested is that that's why you want these things, people won't think you're gay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Gay, and why would people think I was gay?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you don't do manly enough - if you didn't play basketball, if you didn't blunder, they would think that you were kind of sissy-like or something. See where this is getting us, no place, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, no, because, you see, there's something there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that zap you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It started to, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually, I really think there's something - there's something in there with all that stuff, except that you force me to really stereotype it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because - no, but I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way which I really wouldn't have done otherwise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not following - you know, I didn't follow all the words. The word that would have struck me would have been "gay."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, that's why you make out with so many women, you know, to prove to yourself that you're not gay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know - yeah, I've only - okay, well, I know there's a gay bar up on my - well, not a gay bar, a gay restaurant. And if I go in there, sometimes I go in real late at night, you know, once in a while. Well, last night I had a date and when I stopped I had a hamburger. But I think somebody was in there in drag because I know what drag means. 0:45:31.4</p>

<p>But I feel uneasy around, you know, somebody who I think is homosexual or gay or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, but you go into the restaurant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I go - maybe it's a better indicator is I rarely go in there. (Inaudible at 0:45:55.4) to go, I go in there for breakfast. But at night, usually, like, if you're drinking, when I come back to my house, it's on the corner. It's the only point why I'm justifying, you know, (inaudible at 0:46:06.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's the only what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the only one open from where this bar is to my home 24 hours. Usually when the bars close it's two. But I don't know that, you know, that - I know I shy away from talking about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How many homosexual experiences have you had?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I was real little, I can remember two. One was when we were real little, we took - was another guy and me. And we took a little - a neighborhood kid and (inaudible at 0:47:09.0). But I remember, you know, like, when you said that, that popped - two things popped into my brain. And we took him out in the field. And I remember we opened his zipper, but the damn zipper got stuck. And this little kid wouldn't shut up and he got up and he started crying, and he walked down the road yelling, "I'm going to tell my mommy." 0:47:31.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did he?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I never went near their house again. That's the only one I can remember from when I was little. But I really feel uneasy talking about that. You know, there must be something. And, like, if you take a lot of girls out trying to prove you're a man - well, maybe (inaudible at 0:48:17.8). It's like I've got to do everything to prove something. And I've got to be good at everything to prove something, and yet I don't, you know, I don't do that.</p>

<p>And the other thing, what was that? I was in senior college in my fourth year, I was playing basketball. And this friend of mine - there was a little boy walking around. And all of a sudden I didn't see the little boy. I didn't pay any attention. But then all of a sudden, this guy - there were about ten of us and we had just been breaking, you know. And I didn't see him either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your friend?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, it was a guy who played on the tennis team. And - but at the time we were playing basketball in gym. And all of a sudden I heard this crying coming from the site, so I walked around. And here this guy had this little boy in a back room, and the little boy was saying - you know, was crying and I remember, I knew what was going on. But I just told the guy, you know, "Why don't you let him out of there, you know, it's a dark room." And that's all he did and I didn't mention him, but I'm sure - I tried to tell my roommate about that and I couldn't. 0:49:44.6</p>

<p>Because the thought that this guy had been doing something to the kid - you know, I had to block that thought out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really unnerved you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really did, and ever since, when I see that guy, I remember that incident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to make some changes in our schedule. Can you come next week on Tuesday instead of Thursday? And the following week I won't be available at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, let me - Tuesday, what is today, Friday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today's Thursday or else Wednesday at...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think Tuesday is okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Give you Tuesday at five or I could see you Wednesday at seven.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday's good at five. Oh hell no, I got a damn class on Tuesday. I got class until 5:30. I don't know if that (inaudible at 0:51:14.3).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tuesday you have a class until 5:30?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Three-thirty to 5:30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I knew there was some...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, do you want to make it Wednesday at seven?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. 0:51:48.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, see you Wednesday at seven.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:52:02.1), partially zapped. I'll have to see, that might be the - okay, I'll see you, bye-bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can leave that open.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And thank you very much for being part of this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's 11 what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DATE].  Election Day.  [LAUGHING].  Have you had a chance to get out and vote yet?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I was out at 7:00 actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's good to go early I think.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Beat the crowd.  [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Thank you, [PATIENT NAME].  I really appreciate it.  Try to provide better—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] got it.  I was bipolar no way, no way 'cause it strikes even now with some of the, with the medicine, it, it can strike at anytime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you don't, you don't know when it's going to strike.  You have no idea when it's going to strike.  It could strike—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A number of ways.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me if the situation with the attention and concentration issues existed before the bipolar or since the bipolar came on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What was that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Remember when we were talking about attention deficit and, uh, you had a trial.  I think it was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  The [INAUDIBLE] more bipolar?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I, I think his mother would probably say that there were always some attention issues when he was younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, not diagnosed, but always something.  He, he was never the best student in school; had, had trouble focusing on things in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, it was definitely after the accident that it became much more pronounced because of the, the, um, traumatic brain—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Injury that occurred then.  So, uh, and, and the bipolar certainly takes his focus away—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, from other things and puts them in other places.  So, so it's, it's hard to say because there's so many things that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the 2 things often co—exist.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And so figuring out what's coming from what—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And what I've told him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] very tricky to figure out here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, but I'm, I'm, I'm concerned on several levels right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, which is why I rearranged my schedule and ran down here.  Um, he, he just recently got new glasses which he said were fine and now he says he can't see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's going like this constantly—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And so I'm frightened to let him drive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, and even when he's like, he's cutting his meat.  [INAUDIBLE].  So just a very bizarre sort of way and I said to him last night, what's the matter with your glasses and he said I could see through them at first, but now I can't.  So I, I don't know what's going on there, there, but there is something to be concerned about, to check into and see what's going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you having any situation where you're seeing spots or blurry lines or blackouts or flashes of light?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's just that your glasses were good for a while and now they're—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were good for, I just got them last—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Week, 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So and at, at the place it was fine.  At the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Eye doctor's.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eye doctor's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How are you doing with reading?  Are you able to read words on the page pretty well or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, on the computer I can go up and down, [LAUGHING], it's awful.  It's awful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's horrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he, he, he's been sleeping so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's just like constantly sleeping.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] more or less, more or less [INAUDIBLE] the pain's outside right now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They, they told me this pain would start to diminish and it hasn't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I think that's because of the infection and I don't know other things going on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have they said if they know what the infection is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was a, it was a staple, a staple.  They got it out.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Granulated—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's been out.  It's been out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  It was a staple, not a fiber suture?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They said it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Was a granulated suture—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, that they were able to remove and they've been treating the exterior, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	With silver nitrate.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] with silver nitrate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, and watching to make sure it doesn't go inward.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What about antibiotics?  Are you taking any antibiotics?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	They did not put him on any antibiotics which I thought was rather strange that he's not on an antibiotic.  Um, because [PATIENT NAME]'s prone to infection.  We've talked about this before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very prone to infection—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And so it seems to me he should be on some sort of antibiotic, um, but as we mentioned on Saturday, I think they're looking at just the one section of [PATIENT NAME]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But we need a more holistic approach—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To things because I think there's more than just this one section—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Which is [INAUDIBLE] that they're concerned with, um, and they don't seem to be concerned with too much rest of it, of him.  Uh, although I [INAUDIBLE] I'm a little concerned about the last couple of days.  He, he's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] the doctors [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I could be wrong, I just, I have this Indian nose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have some Native American?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pocahontas, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause my, my, my great, great, great, great grandmother, [NAME OTHER], was a [INAUDIBLE] Pocahontas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What a wonderful name.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, so I've got this Indian sense of smell.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you have Texas earrings.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it from—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Was just from when we went to, to Texas for my residency a couple of years ago and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, how great.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the only thing I got out to do was to pick up some earrings at a hotel 'cause I was in classes the entire time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Where did you do your residency?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, it was in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  I went, I trained at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was my, I went to medical school at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was a wonderful place to train.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have so much respect for that whole medical center—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, it's great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know?  It's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It, it was a, it was a pretty quick trip.  Um, it was just 3 day residency.  I was required to take part in.  I mostly just saw the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] where the classes were held and there wasn't much else we did get to, but we got to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I love [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  We didn't get too much else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, but he got to hang out [INAUDIBLE].  That was nice.  [INAUDIBLE].  Um, but, yeah, so—but so we've got all these things going on and I, I truly, I don't know where, what to do right now.  It seems like we continue to battle against this and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is this stuff.  I mean it plays on your mind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's got to be aggravating and, and exacerbating.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To never, never get to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm never awake.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And see it's her too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not just me.  It's her and the family too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The pain's been so severe for so long.  [PATIENT NAME], tell me, is anything happening with your skin?  Rashes?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, sores?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Aches and pains in the joints?  Sore throat?  Ears?  Teeth?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything like that?  I've been doing some research.  I want to ask you about some symptoms, okay?  I have the list here with me.  Um, since I was talking to [NAME OTHER] a little bit about—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some things about your medical history that were, um, you know, areas that I had not inquired as much into as I would have liked to.  Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's a long list.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, you were in the military for a time.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, tell me more about that.  Where did you serve?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was, I was National Guard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], uh, [INAUDIBLE] for a little while and I went through, uh, South Carolina, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, then I, yeah, then when I served, I had what 4 or 5 floods [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I was busy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you had vaccines you continued during your service?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm pretty sure we did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They won't let you in unless you do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You ever remember getting sick after any of the vaccines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, we had to always watch for spinal meningitis in Missouri.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause they really were, were really up on that.  They got some [INAUDIBLE] they didn't want to chance it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Did you ever have meningitis?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you know anybody that did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean it, no, no.  No, they, they were so up on it, they, they, they were very up on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So they were pretty careful?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're very careful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me read you a list of symptoms and just get a sense if you're been experiencing these and, um, for how long if you have.  Um, the first one is fatigue.  Clearly that's very, very prominent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE] years, all my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  And this kind of fatigue is where a person will sometimes get very agitated as opposed to just so exhausted that they can't be the, really the active things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait a minute now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm just asking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, no.  Until this bipolar hit—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was pretty active.  I wasn't fatigued.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, but after—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] after the bipolar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, um, would you say the bipolar hit around the time of the car accident?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before the accident?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Three or 4 years before.  Maybe even longer than that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What really, it really got bad the year before his car accident.  '99 was your really bad year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, that was the year he was hospitalized [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was the year—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He really had the shock treatments—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the mental breakdown.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was really in '99.  He was just getting back on his feet when he had the car accident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was devastating.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, yeah.  He, he had just, just turned a corner and was doing pretty well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me again about what happened with the car accident.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was late and I saw the light turn red, uh, green and I started through.  I heard something coming and next thing I know, that was it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was somebody else running a red light or a stop sign?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Big truck.  A truck.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A, oh, my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he got me broadside.  I mean he knocked me from there to the other side of the seat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was wide awake though.  I got out, I got out of the car—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.  I can't believe you got out of the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And stood up and I said whoa.  [LAUGHING].  I had to get back in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, uh, the paramedics were there very quickly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Thank goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was awake.  We went, we went from [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In about 6 minutes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was [LAUGHING]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They were flying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They were smart.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was wide, and I was wide awake enough to tell them who to call and, you know, what people to call and but, but by the time I got to, to the hospital, I actually saw [INAUDIBLE] and from, I knew from then on—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I knew from them on it was, something's not, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like being in an, an ER.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  With part of feeling ill, do you find that you're experiencing slight fevers during the day?  Low—grade fevers?  Like especially in the morning or late afternoon feeling like you kind of got the flu or a virus?  Anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it's more like a—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He gets—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over wellness I guess of like [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Over me and then, and then I get tired.  Tired and I have to—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like the—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Lay down.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like you were saying that the fatigue, it's like it just goes, it washes over him and you can see it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You can see his face get drawn and pale and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can go for a while, but then—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All of a sudden I got to go upstairs.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that's when he'll either lay on the couch or he'll go upstairs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I mean it's just, it's like once it gets to him, but he's also had a lot of, um, nausea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, but he's not having the vomiting—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he's complaining of nausea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, so, yeah, so I, I can see in that the [INAUDIBLE] just like all of a sudden it's just too much and it's hard to get him [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Do you sometimes find yourself breaking out in sweats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No sweats.  No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Except at night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Night sweats?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he's, he's [INAUDIBLE] under the covers all of the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How about headaches?  You mentioned something about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Headaches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm afraid [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I don't know.  I mean he says he doesn't have headaches and yet frequently he's going like this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't have headaches.  I do that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I feel for fever.  I feel for fever when I do that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you do feel warm when you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I just—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But he's, but he's doing this, he does this a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people describe it's the front of the top of the head.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He'll sit here a lot of times just like, I don't think he even knows he's doing it all the time.  We'll be sitting watching TV and he'll be like this or we'll be at dinner and he'll be like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he does that an awful lot and when I say do you have headache, no, I don't have a headache [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, when I say, I don't know if I've ever told you about being warn out—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And mental, mental, mental draining.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, exactly.  Some people call it a brain fog.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A lot of people don't know [INAUDIBLE] even my therapist really doesn't know what I'm talking about.  How much wear, wear I have through this and how much mental drainage—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mental draining of it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, probably [INAUDIBLE] the, it's hard to explain.  It goes away a little bit and then it'll come, and then it'll come right back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me read you some eye symptoms and tell me if any of these describe what's been happening with your vision.  There could be episodes of blurred vision, red or dry eyes, problems with depth perception like worrying if there's like a, um, a dent in the floor or problems with steps.  Um, sensitivity to light.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	None of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	None of those?  Is it more, um, problems with vision and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Focus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.  Do you ever have ringing in your ears or trouble hearing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I have a—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].  He has trouble—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] when they get tested, my ears are fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't understand that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, he only hears half of what I say—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he's always going, like I'll say something and he'll go, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He does that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I get tested—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now some people describe ringing in their ears or music.  Thinking they're hearing a telephone when they're isn't one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a stuffiness, like, um, like, like, um, when you're going up a mountain or something like that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like your ears [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, so like a pressure in your ears?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.  [INAUDIBLE] sometimes I feel that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get sore throats?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So not so much that.  How about any swollen glands around your neck?  Under your arms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't know that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not that I know about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, panic attacks or severe anxiety?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, you know what, you know I had it back in March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You, you knew I had that back in March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So far, so far—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The, so far the meds have been pretty good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That has been helpful I think.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Haven't had a bipolar attack since, since I've been on my meds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How about episodes of confusion or being disoriented—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Losing your way?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the time.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some say it's almost like seizures sometimes.  It comes on very suddenly and it's very intense.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm laughing because [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I forgot what I was going to say [INAUDIBLE] where I was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll be going to get something and I'll say what am I getting?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have any trouble when you're ready to go to bed?  Falling sleep?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes you do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, pretty much every night.  And having fantasies.  That's [INAUDIBLE].  Some of them are good; some of them bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What kinds of fantasies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	New, a new car, a new car or my mom having trouble with the house.  My dad kind of left her holding the bag a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Working too much and stuff like that and, uh, just a lot of other ones I can't think of right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Do you have any pain or stiffness in any of your joints or limbs?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I get it in my elbow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How long has that been going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about pain in your actual muscles?  Elsewhere in your body like calves or arms?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Here.  Last night I had it in here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Sometimes when he walks he shuffles.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I mean he walks like he's stiff.  I don't know if he feels stiff when he walks, but he [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I'm pretty bad right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I can tell.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] very bad.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He is pretty bad right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you experience any like, um, feelings that your nerves are shooting pains or tingling or numb?  Hands or feet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Nerves are shot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anyplace [INAUDIBLE].  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].  [INAUDIBLE] are shot.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] nerves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, like actual like electrical sensations or numbness or waking up feeling like your arms or legs are asleep?  You know, that expression my leg's asleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, every time once in a while my fingers, um, that's when I, 'cause I fell one time and never really recovered [INAUDIBLE].  My fingers—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I've been wondering if some of his pain is happening is not nerves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, me too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] those nerve endings—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, because the way he describes the pain is being like these hot flashes almost speaks to me of nerve damage.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, but, you know, I'm not a medical doctor.  I'm just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you're the expert at living with [PATIENT NAME]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're the expert at living with [PATIENT NAME], huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, no, that's wrong because it's kind of a, kind of a steady pain.  It's pretty steady.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes it's, it's 9—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes and it goes higher.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You said heat.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's like you said the other, the other week you said it was like heat in your stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's changed.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That, that has changed from that.  It's, um, a pretty steady pain.  Just a steady pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It does not let up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you get any tremors or twitching in your muscles?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, he'll do like this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like this.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Do you have any pain on the soles of your feet or around your feet especially in the morning?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, you complain about your feet a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  Is it painful to walk?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  When your feet are bothering you, how are they bothering you?  Do they swell up or tingle?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hmm?  What?  Are you thinking?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This hasn't happened in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Any heart palpitations or strange chest pains?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Only when he's in the hospital—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then they also go heart attack.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because his heart does these strange, uh, I'm not sure that it bothers him that he feels it, but the heart monitor will show these erratic arrhythmia, um, and back in, back in June, we had the, the first infection.  He was, it was tachy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hmm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, so there was a great deal of concern, but anytime he's been hospitalized in the last couple of years, he's always had this strange heart [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now they, they to, they said years ago that there was some scarring on his heart that looked, that he might have had a heart attack at some point in time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and we just never knew what it was or perhaps he thought was a panic attack.  I don't know.  Um, but that's what one of the echoes had shown—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] some scarring on the heart, but every time he's been in the hospital in the last couple of years, the [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What's going on with the heart.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Have you ever had, um, imaging done of your brain like a CT scan or an MRI?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Does it show anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had a, had a neurological test.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Back in, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	About 4 years ago, a neurological test done at [DEIDENTIFIED] and, um, I do, I can tell you what the doctor told us that there was evidence and I don't know what that means.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There was evidence that a couple of [PATIENT NAME] [INAUDIBLE] function were, um, compromised—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And that would [INAUDIBLE] ability to [INAUDIBLE] and the ability to take in new information—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Where area [INAUDIBLE] seemed to not be functioning.  Now how they knew that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  I was—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And we had to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] which is a neurological place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] redo—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Re, redo, relearn things from the accident.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had to relearn how to do things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Did they take any pictures of your brain whether it was MRI or CT scan?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Um, MRI—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm sure they have.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the other one that shows the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, so they were done at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did they find anything do you know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I, I, I never saw them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, what I was told was that the results that they felt like there were these couple of areas had been damaged from the car accident—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I mean if you're, if we're talking tumors, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nothing such as that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it'll be a result like diffuse white matter changes—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hard to interpret.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't, I don't think that I ever heard it was anything like that, but, you know, I'm sure we could come up with all those films if we needed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Do you have any kind of a rash at all, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have anything around your ankles like old scars or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you mind if I take a look under your socks?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not bad at all.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you know what that is, [PATIENT NAME]?  That looks like a little tiny scar right there.  Does that look familiar at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about on the other side?  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's something there.  I don't know what that is.  A bruise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little tiny scar.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] scar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about the other side?  Yeah, I'm not seeing much over there.  That's pretty darn [INAUDIBLE] if there is anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I'm getting this foot thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It feels like a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tingling thing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tingling, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	On the front of your shin, is it sensitive?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Like if you were to push on it right now, would it be tender at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you mind if I push?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Tell me if it feels tender at all.  Around here?  Not really?  Not there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you ever feel like you have acid reflux like repeating your, your acid coming up from  your stomach into your throat?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's having nausea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Uh, not nausea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That, that could be what he's describing like the acid reflux.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause he'll, he'll be, he'll be eating perfectly happily and then all of a sudden [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's got to be painful.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Any bumps in your skin or, uh, anything that looks like spider veins or varicose veins?  Anything like that?  Any bumps or lumps?  Things you might have thought were warts or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything like that?  Okay.  Will you ever be going along and all of a sudden you'll be short of breath?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if I walk a while, if  I walk a period of time.  I mean short walks, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Long walks, if I go down the river, if I go down to the river, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He doesn't, he doesn't have a lot of stamina.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The older [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I, I always thought it was because of the diaphragm being crushed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In the accident, but he never really regained that lung capacity of the ability to go, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He usually doesn't have that anymore.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, lungs [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And so he, he doesn't have the stamina—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That he used to have.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I, I, I've never actually seen him like hyperventilate or be short of breath.  Just the, the kind of lack of stamina.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], do you remember at anytime having a bug bite that was really irritating?  Like you got bit and it was just really itchy and red and wouldn't go away for a while or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wasp on my ear one time when I was a kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And you've al, you've always had dogs, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Huh?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Dogs?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has your dog ever had fleas or ticks or anything like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, sure, yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have any of them ever gotten on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  I get them off, I see them and get them off real quick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and you've had them on you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We had a real bad spell.  Four years ago, we had a neighbor watching our dog and we were away right after [NAME OTHER] got married—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we had a real, we came home to a house full of fleas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fleas, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he'd been bringing his dog in and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then both the dogs out and we had to fumigate the house and so, yeah, took, took a while to get rid of all the fleas, but we came home to a pretty bad infestation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, boy, it can be really difficult to clear up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That was hard.  It was awful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember about that time 4 years ago or so any change in your condition for better or worse or does nothing really stand out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.  No, I, I can't remember.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Nothing.  It was, it was, [NAME OTHER] had just gotten married and he was pretty upset about her getting married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, so let me see.  Was that, that would have been 2 years ago.  So that would have been, throw myself back here in time.  So that would have been 2005.  Um, actually, yeah, he was, he was not, he was not a happy camper, um, that year.  We were, we were actually seeing a, we were seeing a counselor down at, down there on [DEIDENTIFIED].  I can't remember the name of the place.  I'll think of it in a moment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  We were seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and, um, he yelled at her and so she wouldn't see him anymore.  Um, I know because [INAUDIBLE] but he, he yelled at her about something and he was being very uncooperative.  Yeah, you was kind of being a mess.  He was not [INAUDIBLE] time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I know you were very frustrated at one point because you felt like people just weren't getting it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's understandable.  I mean sometimes seems like the only option is to speak louder and maybe they'll understand a little bit better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I remember him yelling at her and, and I, I think I don't know who his psychiatrist was at that point in time, but that person said you, you need to apologize and see if she'll take you back, but she wouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But she wouldn't.  She wouldn't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I did a little bit of research also into, um, some of the vaccines especially that were being used in the military 10, 15 years ago or so and let me tell you what I was able to find out about that.  I want to be sure I quote it to you properly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is what starts, I'm starting to happen right now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	About the stomach and it's starting to act up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And my eyes like start to blinky, blinky, blinky—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Blinky, and, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He'll squint like this all the time—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And now he's having a difficult time seeing and he'll do this all the time.  It's kind of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm more, it's more when it's, my pain starts a little better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are the lights seeming very bright right now?  Would you like me to turn them down?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's okay?  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it's, it's the, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sort of everything wrapped up together.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] 3 hours last night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, bless your heart.  I know you've been working so hard.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, yeah, you think I'll finish?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, I know you will.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I sure hope so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  So, [PATIENT NAME], I've been thinking about what's been doing on physically for a long time and I xeroxed some information you can take home with you and think about.  Uh, I think there's a pretty good chance that back in time, uh, you may have had several instances where you were exposed to something that's infectious and it could have taken root inside you and through the years, kind of hidden itself away in joints and, uh, muscle, brain, and illnesses that do that travel together with lyme disease and lyme disease most people think of as coming from ticks and having a bulls eye rash and that kind of—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thing.  However, it's now looking as though it can travel with other kinds of insects and there's often other illnesses that travel along with it.  You have some symptoms of lyme disease and what's tricky is that there are other bacteria that can have very, very similar symptoms.  One is mycoplasma, some of the things I was asking about.  That did contaminate some of the [INAUDIBLE] vaccines especially in the '90s.  There's been some research now that suggests it's implicated in so called balfour syndrome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wait—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Would a—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Something I, uh, military would have been back in the '70s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the '70s.  So this was quite a ways back when you would have—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Had those vaccines and so forth?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Even when you were in, still in the National Guard after we got married, that would have been—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'76.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah, late '70s.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So when you were in the '90s down south with the National—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Guard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This was earlier than that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	National Guard, it was always around here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Always around here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, your training was down south.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, the, the m—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	In the '70s [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The [DEIDENTIFIED], the [DEIDENTIFIED] I went there; um, there was a couple other, um, floods that were local.  I mean pretty, pretty local.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Floods would be full of contamination though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, when was the last time you had active duty with the National Guard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'77.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It was '77?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'76, '77.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause you went back in again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I went back in '78, you're right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, wait a minute.  [NAME OTHER] was born in [DATE].  You went back in again for maybe another 3 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I went back [INAUDIBLE] one more year.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, are you sure?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  So, so maybe '78.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe '79.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So, yeah, I, I think it was before [NAME OTHER] was born—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You were out [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think you were out again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that far back I'm not quite sure—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whether there were concerns about contamination.  I can do some more research into that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, they might not have been as aware of the contaminants—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's possible to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Back then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But, but what, but what's your current thinking?  You're saying lyme disease which we've known people that have had lyme disease—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it's just kind of done all sorts of horrendous things [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Here's what I'm saying.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Our oldest son at one point in time, they thought he had lyme disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It turned out to be, uh, shingles—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That he suffered from and he still has some, uh, neuralgia here—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That if, if he gets stressed out, it will start to throb and really bother him—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	A lot.  So we're, we're passively familiar with some of the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] disease of lyme disease and how complicated it is to—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Really take care of.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What do we have to do to find out whet, whether I do have it or not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll just, I'll tell you a little bit more and then we'll, we'll talk about that.  Um, have you ever heard of bartonella infection?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That actually is even—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	More common than lyme disease—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially in this area.  It's a really tricky bacteria.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's the thing that you said, [PATIENT NAME] said to me.  She said it might be something with a B.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've been wondering about that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What kind of serious lyme disease is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a tough call and I'll tell you why.  That big long list of symptoms I just read you, those are pretty typical for bartonella.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now they have a lot in common with other illnesses that travel with lyme and with lyme disease, but there are some pretty specific things with bartonella as well, vision's a big one.  Gastrointestinal is another big one.  But here's the tricky thing about bartonella.  It's a master of disguise.  It gets into your blood stream and it tones down your immune system.  It's really tricky.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now this is what I have totally been thinking that somewhere along the way his immune system has been compromised—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because he cannot heal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He, he has had—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This, this inci, this surgery took place in May.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The wound is still this deep.  I mean it's healing very, very slowly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	His ability to fight off infection is, it's terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He will—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Get any infection that comes down the street.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He will, it will walk right into his body.  So afterward, we had our conversation on Saturday, I started thinking about the possibility that at some point in time, his immune system, his ability to fight off infection—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Had been compromised—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he was no longer able to garner up the resources—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like the rest of us can to get our blood cells fighting—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To, to get rid of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So what you're saying makes total sense to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I also took Advair for a little while—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And from what Advair can do, that can, it said right on there that, uh, that can, um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Advair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Advair 'cause, tends to stop your healing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it the steroid type?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You mean with—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What you're taking right now.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What I take?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I take it for my asthma.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I took it for a little while—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it said, I saw on TV, [LAUGHING], [INAUDIBLE] after I took it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think you took—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That after though.  I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think that whatever happened, 'cause you took that after the car accident.  I think whatever might have compromised your system, you had before that 'cause now that I'm thinking about the, and you, you weren't on it that long.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It was because he was having difficulty catching his breath—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, that we thought it was because of the lung capacity being diminished at one point in time.  The doctor had prescribed him Advair—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That he was on too with [INAUDIBLE] Albuterol which I'm also on was another sort of inhaler—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That he had, but it didn't seem like it really, it didn't seem like it made a different to him one way or the other—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it didn't seem like it was worth him continuing—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause it didn't seem like it was improving anything or doing any damage.  It just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It just didn't, it was nothing.  It really was like it wasn't helping him in any way or doing anything to him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we sort of discontinued using that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's often what's a clue to doctors that you're treating someone for something and they're not having the reactions you'd expect—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, not feeling as much better—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	As one would expect even with the psychiatric medications over time there've been—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ups and downs.  I do think this is the best combination that you've had for a while, but I'm still hearing the pain and the problems with the tension and concentration and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, just really being, uh, so prominent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the lack of healing is [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the surgeons up there don't, they don't realize, they just don't give you any compassion for the pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, they're, they're looking at the one part of you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they're not looking at all of you.  They're just looking at this—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They can send me home [INAUDIBLE].  You know, they say everything's going fine; the wound looks fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Although they say, oh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it's been a long time; it should be healed by now, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But he told me—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That could be the reason.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He told me about 6 weeks ago it should be healing.  The pain should be diminished in about 3, in about 3 weeks, 3 or 4 weeks—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, and we got into, we got some infections in and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So tell us about, it's called bartonella?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Tell us about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Could be, bartonella could be co—existing with lyme disease—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because sometimes lyme disease can form cysts and hide really from the antibiotic treatment in your heart muscle, in your brain.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So it's like bacteria that infiltrates your system—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it can be in your joints and your blood—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Precisely, brain.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And, and it's not really showing up in any blood tests or things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mostly it shows up in blood tests—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If it's actively reproducing at the time, but it's very, very good at—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hiding especially if you've had some antibiotics—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It'll hide.  And, of course, you've had some—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I'm just not so sure that it's been—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He had a massive—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Targeted—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Amount of them back in June—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, after he had the infection after the surgery.  I mean he was on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean he was on massive amounts—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Of it.  Just, and we thought that's what initially caused the nausea because that's when he started having the nausea—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Was from these massive doses of antibiotics and then he started getting sick to his stomach—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we've never really lost that nausea [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And here's something too that's very tricky with treating these illnesses.  Sometimes at first you feel worse on the antibiotics because the bacteria's releasing their toxins.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Often times [INAUDIBLE] will stay with it for a while.  That will eventually get less and less and it can get killed off.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Actually, he did feel at, you felt awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, oh, my God.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When, when I was in the hospital—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You were miserable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I was in the hospital it was on the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the IV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	On the, on the second time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They, they gave me—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Talk about feeling crappy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He was awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was awful.  I mean that, I just feel like—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He really was.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, like a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He felt like a [INAUDIBLE] dishrag and he looked terrible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Absolutely [INAUDIBLE].  Couldn't eat anything; he threw up everything that they gave him.  It was awful.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They gave me salad and [LAUGHING].  You've got to be kidding.  [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].  They said, they told me it was all antibiotics and said don't worry about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now you're right on target in terms of knowing that the tests are not very reliable.  Some doctors in the area will treat on the basis of a clinical history.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I happen to have quite a few patients who have had exposures like this and I'm at least able to get them started with some oral antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There are some people even in the [DEIDENTIFIED] system like [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who has some experience with giving longer—term IV antibiotics.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So if it ever came to that or even if you wanted to consult him, but consulting somebody who's knowledgeable about these illnesses is key because there are quite a few doctors who find it difficult to get the most up—to—date information who may think the blood tests are reliable, they do the blood test.  If it doesn't show up, as far as they're concerned, end of story.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, but with the kind of a medical course that you've had and the hospitalizations—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The intensive antibiotics, you're bacteria could be hiding and creating some havoc there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm still taking, he's still hitting and missing even, even, even somebody that knows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right, sometimes, sometimes.  What ends up needing to be done is to look at that individual person; what seems to be going on with them; and what they need.  Now there's one very simple thing that I'm definitely going to recommend you start ASAP.  It's not going to interfere with anything you're taking and only good can come from it and that's magnesium supplements.  You can buy them inexpensively over the counter at the drugstore.  I'm going to give you some information.  Magnesium deficiency is implicated with difficulties healing, chronic pain, and so forth.  The magnesium supplementation is also important because some of the antibiotics especially that can treat bartonella try to deplete magnesium.  So that's a thought.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So this depleting the magnesium and that makes him feel achy—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, even worse.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Because it's taking the magnesium out of his blood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like a vicious cycle.  Yeah, the infection does it and some, some choices of antibiotics do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I have a friend who has fibromyalgia—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I, I know that that's very difficult to diagnose as well and some doctors will say, oh, well, you, you know, you're just being a baby about it.  So, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you some information about that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too.  There's some doctors who—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	To—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Think chronic fatigue syndrome—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fibromyalgia—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are often implicated with these chronic infections that are hard to detect.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But sometimes when someone starts to get treated for those, they can have a significant improvement.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now can this bartonella, can it cause like, I think at this point in time, we have to say [PATIENT NAME] is a chronic pain sufferer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's been in pain such a long time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Can it be implicated—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With incidents of the chronic pain?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  Especially abdominal.  So what I'm thinking is you've had surgeries and surgeries and surgeries.  I actually have another patient who's been avoiding—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the pain, the pain, the pain—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's going through something similar.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After every surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And the inability to heal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Every time in the last 5 years that he's had [INAUDIBLE], that he's had a hernia surgery or a repair, he's had, the healing has been worse than the surgery—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he ends up with an open—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He ends up with an open wound—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That we, he needs to come home with—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh, because it just doesn't heal properly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you end up packing it, the wet to dry dressings?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you doing that now even?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, it's being packed in now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Shoo.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Like the hole is like this big, but this deep now.  So [INAUDIBLE] and this has been going on since—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is there a lot of irritation and itching around the wound?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too much?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The irritation—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Just the fluid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It hurts.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I mean he's always, you can see—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He always has his hand here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Always.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's like [NAME OTHER], he's always got his hand here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, I can see right now.  I don't—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Blame you.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You know, he's always in pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I understand it.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So I mean I hope we're not grasping at straws, but it does make sense to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The course that I think could be reasonable and I can write you the prescriptions if you would like is to consider starting doxycycline now.  That's a tetracycline antibiotic.  It's effective against lyme.  It could help with some of the skin, you know, the pain around the wound and so forth.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can go ahead and take it with the magnesium supplements.  No problem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And it wouldn't interfere with any of his bipolar medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  It wouldn't.  It's pretty safe and well tolerated.  The one thing that can happen with doxycycline though, upset stomach.  So if you need to take it with food, take it with food.  Better to avoid milk though because milk gets in the way of absorption, but anything else oatmeal, you know, whatever, helps medicine stay down for you.  So that could be a place to start.  There are 2 medicines that are very effective against bartonella and I'll give you some information about it.  One is called Levaquin.  That's actually a pretty common antibiotic for urinary tract infections, sometimes—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For pneumonia, uh, but that's the one that tends to deplete magnesium.  So you want to start your magnesium supplements before you consider starting that.  That can be taken with doxycycline.  Levaquin is not compatible with most antibiotics, but doxycycline's okay.  Also, um, an alternative to Levaquin is called Rifampin.  That's an old—fashioned one, but it's a good one.  It's often used with TB, tuberculosis; it helps to break up the bacteria and, uh, and get at the source.  Um, and that too is something that can be taken with the doxycycline.  That one doesn't tend to deplete the magnesium as much.  It can interfere sometimes with some pain medicine stuff.  So that's—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm taking no medicine 'cause they don't work.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing works.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're already behind the eight ball with that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take Lyrica which is supposed to be one of the best—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It hasn't been helping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Mixed results.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Um, well, I know I've put a lot of information out there and it can be, it can seem a little bit mind boggling, but I also sometimes think, gosh, these medicines are very inexpensive, they're generic.  Sometimes it's a question of taking them long enough.  You know, if you want a reality check, talk with your other doctors, see what they think.  You know, some are very anti—thinking outside of the box with regard to lyme disease and co—infections.  You know, some are led to believe that the tests are more reliable than they are.  Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You said you had some—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll give you some printed information.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um, 'cause I think that would be helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I, I think—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Definitely.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	From my point of view, I certainly see no harm in starting the magnesium.  It's just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] a vitamin.  It's not going to hurt anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's just magnesium and I, I would think that some, some sort of antibiotic—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I can give you the prescriptions and you can research a bit more.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] would make great sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I think the other things I might like to check into a little bit more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And talk to the other doctors about that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we can decide if we want to go with the Levaquin, what was the other?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, Rifampin.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Rifampin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can you write them down?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's an oldie.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I sure will.  In fact, I'll give something, uh—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Xeroxed about it.  Also, uh, the doctors' names on the articles—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], they are all publishing very, very recent data and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is in [DEIDENTIFIED].  So he see some of what we see—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.  Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, in a similar geographical area.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's good information online.  You'll start to get a sense of why there are divisions within the profession about—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who's publishing about what.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, I like to be up to date—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see what people are doing.  I believe that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] even has an online consult—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the initial consult's free.  So again, you know, getting, if you go to doctors here and I'll give you the name of one locally who I know tends to be pretty proactive in treating [INAUDIBLE] illness, um, you know, if that's someone you might like to make an appointment with or point, counterpoint, but if you go to your first couple of doctors that are ones that you're familiar with and say, uh, ridiculous, you know, don't even go down that path unless they don't have another explanation—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Or something to try.  You know, you might want to consider second, third, fourth, fifth opinions.  It's very reasonable.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Can you, uh, give, uh, my therapist a heads up on this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  And, in fact, if you want to copy the information for her, yeah.  But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I'd rather fax it if you could.  Fax it to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I probably could, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That way, that way she could have it on—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Do you have her fax number handy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you have it.  I know you do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me see.  I bet I do.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet I do.  Yes, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, I have her telephone number.  I can call and I can get her fax also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that would be fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, 'cause that'll be good to have—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To have her know that I, this, this could be that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Yeah, and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I know you see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who recommended Lyrica.  I'm not sure what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] would make of all of this, but, you know, again it's worth talking about.  My understanding also is that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who's the head of the family medicine department here has a developing interest in these.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's seeing more also.  Um, we've actually sent these articles back and forth to each other.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, I, speak, speaking for myself, you know, I'd like to try anything that has a potential to help and not harm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that isn't going to have [INAUDIBLE] side effects we're going to have to deal with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's something that's going to provide him with any type of relief, that would be good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think that surgeons are drawing at straws right now.  I really do.  I'm going to go up there tomorrow and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Same, same answers.  We'll go up there and waste an hour/hour and a half to go up there.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, we'll, we'll send a copy of this up to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And we'll just [INAUDIBLE] decide to do, but I'm thinking, you know, why not, why not do the antibiotic, why not do the magnesium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	There's no harm in either one of them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  It's worth asking the questions and thinking it over.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I think you need an antibiotic anyway.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a possibility.  I mean it concerns me there's a wound that's not healing and maybe they feel as though well, you know, we've, we've done all the antibiotics we can think of, but there's always more.  There's always more possibilities.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's hard to believe the little [INAUDIBLE] that's causing all this pain.  It's hard to believe that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Then maybe there's more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Only, only that big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And I think that's what the doctors are hearing too.  It's not that it's, it's a small hole.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My nurses say the same thing.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you know, we—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We've taken care—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, very small.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Of the hernia, we've repaired things; why are you still in pain.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's why I think we need to be asking what haven't we considered.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know?  Is there a more, are there more possibilities because I'm hearing, you know, you've been, you've been in swamps helping to clear out nat, natural disasters; um, you've had an infestation of fleas in your house.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, probably, you know, possibly more than one.  You know, you've had, dogs are fantastic, you've had them in your life and for people with normal, healthy immune systems, no problem.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We don't, we've had dogs growing up too.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We always had dogs and you always had dogs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This isn't very pleasant news about lyme disease.  No way.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And we don't know for sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not, I'm not, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There may be—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This is a way—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] than her saying I have no idea what's wrong with you; go away.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	True.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] pinpoint all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Certainly, um, they could test.  If it comes up positive, you know, then you've got something, you know, really [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They can [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes.  The test isn't always reliable.  It's more a situation if your test happens to come up positive, pretty clear you have it, but if your test doesn't show it, it doesn't mean you don't have it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's what I mean 'cause they're good at hiding.  The bacteria can hide in cysts—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And in joint capsules.  They can even change their form.  They are sneaky.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know how.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They are really smart.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING], you know?  And that's a tough thing.  So, but, you know, there are people starting to, to figure it out, you know, how to, how to get around that.  So, you know, I'm just going to Xerox, I have some of this, uh, for you already and then I'm going to xerox some of the information about magnesium and, uh, also about, uh, treatments.  So and some of these books are very good.  You know, they talk about the healthiest diet to have and so forth.  Uh, and that can be helpful too.  So I will start you off with, this packet has several articles and if you want to divide and concor, you know, if you want to glance at them while I xerox the other—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You can.  Um, and I'll get that info about the magnesium and also some information about the, um, the treatments we would use.  So—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, you never gave me an answer on, uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Are they, is that, is that part [INAUDIBLE] or not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It definitely can be because when your mind starts to rev up—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If it is, I never fought that before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have never fought that before.  I don't know how to handle it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, I don't know how to, like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be an evolution of bipolar; could have to do with attention deficit where it's distracting from the things that you're trying to concentrate on almost like daydreaming; could even be related to chronic infection even if you're getting little fevers during the day.  That can sometimes speed up your imagination [INAUDIBLE]—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So we don't know whether it's bipolar or not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not 100% clear, but it's not unheard of.  You know, when someone starts to get a little bit more on the manic side and rev up, their thoughts start going faster and sometimes they can—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Are, are you saying—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That all of this then if it's bartonella that that could be causing the psychiatric problems as well?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can definitely aggravate them.  It's hard to say whether it could be causing all, but there is a surprising amount of psychiatric symptoms that go with these and I think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's one of the, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] speaks to that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And sometimes medical doctors are not used to that concept.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, I did the fantasies to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe she could enlighten me [INAUDIBLE] I don't, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Definitely.  And what's interesting too is when you think about the way that these bacteria keep themselves going, they want their host, you and me, to be kind of warn out, to be kind of, you know, burning ourselves out, not kill us, but keep us going just enough to keep them alive, you know what I mean?  It's, it's tricky stuff.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it [INAUDIBLE] succeeding at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Well, I think we can beat them.  I'm serous.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	'Cause I'm really worn out.  I'm worn out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're exhausted and we've worked together for a couple of years and I know you have been fighting and fighting and fighting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She has and I know she has too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We've changed every medicine—</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 7. This is the seventh interview.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does everyone [kiss in] (ph) therapy? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) you get along pretty well with your parents (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) sometimes it's good that I'm a social worker and sometimes it's kind of (inaudible). And I guess sometimes I ask for some help (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know-I just king of imagine some (inaudible) child with glasses and a briefcase asking for help (inaudible). I think that's just [one of those places] (ph) (inaudible at 0:54).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was going to buy my little son one of those little tiny wooden chairs. But it will probably fall apart (inaudible). And back to him-something happened the other day that kind of got both of us. A little girl - we were in the hospital - my sister's in the hospital, so we were visiting her. And this little girl came she just kicked him right in the chest and he fell flat on his back and he started to cry and (inaudible at 1:27). And he started to make friends with her - and the little girl thought that he was going to steal her candy. She had a piece of candy there, and she kicked him. </p>

<p>And his mother came down with her. And she was kind of saying to him - she was real - very wild and energetic looking. And I think-I don't know, in her own way, kind of violent, you know, within herself. And she was kind of getting into why they were in the hospital. Her husband-the little girl's daddy-was in the hospital. She didn't say why or anything, but she said she was having a hard time functioning without him, you know? But I thought this little girl had some kind of a problem, you know? She was just really terrible and would just sit there and everything. </p>

<p>And then later, they went to another room and my little boy followed, and the little girl tried to do it again-kick him in the chest. But he was too far away, so she lunged forward and scratched the whole side of his face. And the mother was turned around again and she didn't see it. (inaudible at 2:29) The little girl was pretty violent and she said she's never done [anything like this] (ph) before. (inaudible) But then the next time my little boy tried to make friends (ph) with someone, he would stay away now. I think he remembers. So I just wanted to give him a couple days so he'll forget about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you feel like it's bad for him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I thought, you know, that [a whole lot after] (ph) [we kind of limited him] (ph) and wanted to make friends again. [3:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They must be waiting to get (inaudible at 3:04).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was kind of torn on what I should do because I realize it's been a - you know, have to get used to taking things when he gets old and everything. But on the other hand, I didn't want to see him battered up. It's like I really didn't know what to do when I was thinking about it later. You know, I always wish it could just - everything could be nice [for him] (ph). And then he went after people who would always be nice to him.</p>

<p>But (inaudible) you know, little tears on his face. He's got, you know, this precious little face and it was really a shame because he's always so friendly to everybody. (inaudible) he looked at me, you know - [he was silly] (ph) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe because he just didn't know what to do. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I just comforted him, but still. But getting back to what we were talking about last week, I was just wondering if I could kind of toughen him up, you know, as far as being a boy. You know, that kind of thing (inaudible at 4:02) there's just like his dad being around all the time. I don't want to get into that again. I just feel like I've been repeating the same things over and over to everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like-it seems to be like boys are really different in some ways. They're mysterious, too -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just really - I just feel like when he gets to grade school, that maybe he should be able to protect and defend himself, because he's going to have to when he gets older, you know? So maybe I shouldn't baby him about every little scratch he gets. Sometimes I don't. I say, "Are you okay? Stop crying."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I feel like sort of beneath all these worries, though, it seems to me like a lot of times you're saying, "Well he's just so different." He's going to be so different from you. He's a boy and what do you do with boys anyway? They can come out (inaudible at 4:55).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I kind of (inaudible). Because you know how you always read these stories and stuff? (inaudible at 5:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like when you think of him growing up, you just imagine him getting more and more foreign to you in some ways. He gets more and more like [a boy] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really think of it as foreign; I just don't - you know, I don't want to see him beat up a lot. But on the other hand, I don't want him to be like a super fighter all the time. Like some football guy who's ready to [box someone's ears] (ph). I mean, that's just (inaudible). But I don't think I'm going to bother (ph) with that (inaudible). [6:00]</p>

<p>I feel so like full of energy today and everything. But like it just came on all of a sudden. I (inaudible at 6:10). I feel like my friends are really down on him. I've got this thing in my mind that I just think they're so selfish all of a sudden-really self-centered. And I'm just trying to [take my mind] (ph) (inaudible). I don't know. When I stop and think about it, I realize that it's (inaudible at 6:36) over concerned and everything. So I just have this (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're really not getting (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know. I just feel like they're telling me all these different things about them. You know-which they told me before and everything. And like just doing all these things that - I'll give them money and my time and everything and then I just want to say something about anything. You know, I feel like I'm cut off. And I'm (inaudible at 7:10) why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel like they're not really interested in what you have going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like this one girl, like she's so hung up on everything she does. And I think it's (inaudible) she doesn't do too much. But she's just carried away with doing her thing, as she says. And I don't think she's doing anything. It's probably Joe - he'll stay with me. But she doesn't realize that everything she's telling me she's told me before - like she was kind of getting upset with me for. But I felt she was doing the same thing. I just let [her message] (ph) and we just cooled off a little. But it seems like from everything else she says that she's just really interested in herself right now. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's no room for you?.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well she just wants it to be herself and her boyfriend. And I don't really mind that she wants to - you know, just the two of - herself with her boyfriend and everything. But it's just that like - you know like when she comes around and she wants things from me then [she's never] (ph) thankful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So she just sort of takes and she never give you any -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (inaudible at 8:28). I'm just feeling like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What were you saying before? That you see her doing certain kinds of things that you've seen yourself do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I mean like just talking about - you know, talking about your boyfriend or talking about what you're doing-you know, if it's anything creative or anything like that. And just saying what you're doing basically. Nothing really-we're just chatting. [8:58]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you say before that that's something that she used to accuse you? [9:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she said so over the phone. Like every time I talk to her, she said that I was telling - well I was on this one subject. I wasn't saying the same thing over and over again. I was just telling her - you know, talking about this certain subject. It was kind of like psychology and - you know, therapy. And just like, you know, like, "Lately I've learned so much from therapy," or things connected with it and everything. </p>

<p>And I just feel like that's what I'm talking about all the time to my friends. Because my sister asked me about therapy and psychoanalysis and all that type of thing. So I just feel like I'm really just talking about therapy to everybody. But in a way, they start asking me questions, you know? And then I start talking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you're saying maybe you're boring them, but it's really on your mind or something? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not so much boring them; I think I'm boring myself. They all want to know about certain things and I just feel like I'm repeating things (ph). But like to this girl that I was talking about, she was a psychology major in college, so I was asking her a few questions. You know, she's always gung-ho on all these different theories and stuff. </p>

<p>And I guess she was just tired of it because she kind of centers around - her work is centered around that all day and stuff. I guess a lot of her friends are in therapy, too, so they're like always asking her things, too and comparing (ph). But when I remember back - or when she was right into it or when she wanted to know what procedure I went through to get into it, she'd always talk about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like you hear yourself talking over and over again about something they're really not into?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well the thing about it - or even worse than just hearing myself talk about it - you know, this little sentence-you know, "I thought she was so self-centered," just popped right in my mind. It was like it was written across a blackboard in my forehead. You know, she was just (inaudible at 11:15). So I just decided not to talk to her for a couple of days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You sort of hope she (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know, just let her, you know, go through her (inaudible) and see what she (inaudible). Usually I don't mind doing things for people, you know? I even like it or get pleasure out of it, you know. I see someone-you know, they're happier now that (inaudible at 11:36). Like I guess maybe all these things happened all at once, because then the next night another girlfriend of mine called and she wanted me to do this little task of running out and getting her some income tax forms they need for - you know, in another state and all that junk. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels like everybody wants you to do something for them, and nobody's doing anything for you? [12:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, she comes to me with her troubles, too, you know? And she wants to ask me something about her love life or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you must feel a lot of times like you have at least the (inaudible at 12:13) troubles that they do, and they ought to be willing to listen to you, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I just really don't want to talk to them about my troubles, because - you know-[the thing] (ph) of talking to them about it - you know, like when I have something-well just when I feel like talking to them or something, then I usually - I don't know if I really tell them all my troubles. I mean I usually find out what they were doing and then tell them what I'm doing and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's sort of like sometimes you have something you want to talk about and you just can't count on them to be there for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like they're there, but they don't - you know, they'll just be there for a few minutes or say they'll call back later or something. You know, they're probably busy. Because I've done the same thing to them, too, I think. I don't know-I just (inaudible at 13:13) like three or four people I just felt that my friends are all self-centered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of, in a way, they'll sort of do things for you sometimes, but like you can't count on them to see you through if you need them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. Another (inaudible at 13:36) example (ph), they aren't willing to sell me all these things, you know? One of the girls was moving. The other one-she was also moving, too, but like I was thinking of renting her apartment or subleasing it-whatever. And she's got these louver doors in there, and she said that the woman who had them before she had them made her pay for them. </p>

<p>She told them to actually - she want to - I wanted to buy them, too, and everything. And she called me out of the clear blue sky. They [asked me] (ph) that. And then when I wanted to ask her something about the lease or something, I called and she said she'd call back later. And she called back a couple of days later or something, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just felt like she wanted to know if would buy a (inaudible). I get this feeling, personally, that she's money-hungry, you know? Because she's always giving me all her plans for saving money-how she can quit work and have all this money saved up and that type of thing. Or she's telling how she's budgeting something so she can buy a stereo set or make payments on her cars and everything. [14:51]</p>

<p>And how she's - you know like, she'll say she can't spend money to go out to eat or something; where if I'm with her, she'll say, "Well can you pay for it this time and I'll pay you back?" or something. And she makes a good salary, you know? But she's always talking like she's in the poorhouse. You know how I feel about money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you really (inaudible at 15:17) you have to think about it, I guess. But with her, you're forced to always be watching (inaudible) so you can -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I lived with her for six months, I mean. She always handled the bills and everything. And she'd sit on her bed and figure out like the telephone bill. She'd figure it out to the exact penny or something. You know, she used to figure out if everything about it was right, you know, with the phone company. </p>

<p>And I don't know-it just reminds me of my parents, because my dad's like that, you know? And he's real fussy about the phone-(inaudible) talking for a long time and everything.. And I don't know, I told me friend that she was real fussy about money. And at the time, it amused me, you know? Because here she'd take such pains to figure everything out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not as funny now when she's (inaudible at 16:07) enough (ph) to get yours?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now like everything that I talk about, she's talking about money and stuff. And she just asked me if I have all these used cards for airplanes, because she's going to California with her boyfriend. And she wants to see well what's the simplest. I don't blame her-I'd do the same thing, you know? Just every time I talk to her, she's got all these money plans going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Apparently she's not that interested in anything that's on your mind (inaudible) the things you just learned (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I get that impression a lot. Or else she'll call me and she'll ask me-you know, she'll ask me something about her relationship with her boyfriend. Or you know, (inaudible at 16:52). And I don't mind talking to her, but I don't feel like an authority on it, but I was (inaudible) and stuff and I really hate getting on (inaudible) stable answers (ph). I don't know-that kind of annoys me, too, when she talks about - you know, because I always answer it for her, you know? And she kind of thinks I can.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like she's asking you to give her something that you really can't (inaudible at 17:24) give her-that you have had (ph) to give. [17:30] </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, you know, sort of have all these, you know, techniques in my mind to try and change my thoughts. (inaudible) a couple people that (ph) totally know that I should think of myself before others, you know, just about everything. But I don't know. Like a lot of times, I feel (inaudible) I need to-as far as that goes-(inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess you really don't like to think of yourself as - it's really unnatural for you to be selfish. You really like to be free and open with everybody, and then you look around and you realize that they (inaudible at 18:20) and then you feel like you have to be more selfish and you don't like it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well a lot of times, I think what I do is just - you know, like I'll realize that some things that [I need] like I want money or something and I guess just thinking about it, but kind of ignore the situation with them, really. And I don't think I really [have minded all that] (ph), you know? Unless it really got bad. My girlfriend, she's just the type-she's very-you know, forceful and aggressive about things. And I think I yelled at her once because she took something of mine, you know? And it really bothered me. </p>

<p>And I said, "Well my sisters don't even borrow things like that," and stuff. And like she knew she shouldn't have done it and everything; and she was just like a little lost child or something, you know? It really got me because here, you know, she's always the complete opposite-just very forceful about things. I don't know. I just wonder - every time I see her-I think I told you-I get the impression that she's really nuts-that she's really going - getting further away. She's really changed so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've been thinking a lot about putting yourself first?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I haven't. I haven't really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that uncomfortable for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, I kind of feel bad. Like I did it with my mother the other day, and I felt bad afterwards because she just-you know, just so passive about things. But on the other hand, when I do it to someone who's very outgoing and aggressive, that they know they fight back. And then I need to get [with them] (ph) when I (inaudible) them. [20:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like either way, you end up feeling bad afterwards. How was that bad feeling that you had after you did it to your mother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, you know, like the thing with my mother-you know, she's real passive. I feel bad because I yelled at her. (inaudible) You know, she felt that. She felt - I don't know, she relayed the feeling on the phone that I had done something wrong, and she was real meek and everything and she had to go and stuff like that. And like I didn't want to hurt her, because she's really a good person. But I don't know-with someone who is different, I don't - I don't know, I just - I think I feel worse than they would because I really hate fighting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what kind of a bad feeling is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like a mental-type thing, you know? Like when I realize like I shouldn't have yelled or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like you did the wrong thing afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well not - yeah, probably wrong. But I should have - like so often I just say things, you know, to people, and I realized afterwards I just should have kept my mouth shut, you know? It would have been easier - well, it wouldn't have been easier, it would have been better. You know like, if you take the extra step to control yourself, you can, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I just didn't do it; and I don't know why I didn't do it. But you know, like it was the first thing that came to my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel you're out of control but then you always feel so bad afterwards.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I should have been more patient.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it better if you don't do it? I mean, what's the bad-what kind of a bad is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I don't control myself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah-afterwards when you have that bad feeling with your mom.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - you know, like I feel sorry, you know? Well I guess in the thinking part of my brain or something, I feel sorry, you know, I did it to the person. And then in the second place I feel bad because I should have controlled myself-or I wish I had. And I think-you know, if I had, I would have realized the thing wouldn't have been so bad in the first place, you know? I shouldn't have even bothered to say anything about it-if I had controlled myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that something you really believe in? Like it's always better to control yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well in the times that I have, yeah. Because like you forget about it then, you know, right away. [23:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't have to feel any bad feelings after. The other way [they would have it] (ph) living with it for a long time afterwards. You keep remembering how bad you felt after.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, only for a couple days or something. Or you know, back in your memory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you've been a bad person afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With my mom I do. Because - I don't know, maybe she does it to me. Or maybe I just think that she is so good and everything, and she doesn't need another person to yell at her or something. I've been doing that with Adrian a lot. I've been yelling at him lately. Even when I look at him and I realize he's just a little kid, you know? And if I had been more patient, it wouldn't have been so bad. </p>

<p>Like, well part of yelling at him is frustration [with him] (ph) and I realize that. I just - you know like I feel that I've been with him too much or I just - you know, I feel like he's barging in on my time for myself and stuff like that. So it's more easy for me to see things with Adrian, you know like [they to] (ph) my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's like you can really see how you could be angry with him because he takes so much of freedom away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but he's such a - you know, like a little baby. He's a little baby and he deserves it more, you know? But I think I feel worse about that. And then I forget about him - you know, I forget about the situation [or something easier] (ph), too. Because I keep saying, "Well the next time, I won't do it (inaudible at 25:07) well even though (inaudible) hold him in my arms and work and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that must be part of the bad feeling you get afterwards-that you're sort doubly in debt-owe whoever it was (inaudible at 25:20) you. You have to remember to make it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't usually tie - you know, like there [should have been] (ph) people I don't really see put it all together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't mean that. I meant like if you [don't accept them] (ph) afterwards, you feel bad. And part of that is sort of feeling you're obligated-like you have to make up for it or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [The human way.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It seems like, in a way, it's always a dilemma for you if you get angry with somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And they usually turn it up to be (25:59).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are no simple solutions, really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I kind of have the - I don't know, I just have anger distorted. I felt this I think from when I was little. And like now, when I get angry with someone, I think that - you know, I just relate it. I mean, I do-I associate it with bad. (inaudible at 26:22) a dilemma.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you sort on it as long as you can, and it finally comes out and you feel doubly bad. [26:30]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or just, you know, like things that have been going on all day, and then I just naturally blow up. I don't know if I really keep it within me for a couple of days. Like you said, things that - just-and it just finally comes out. I don't know-it might be like that. I can see it on a day, like in a series of things happening, but I don't think I hold it over a couple of days like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Usually do you feel like eventually it gets the upper hand and it gets out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, during the day. Or anyways, say the next day like if it's with Robert or something, it would be - I think if I held it for the day, some time during the next day it would come out (inaudible at 27:17) and just drop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems to be possible that sometimes if you just ignore it, it will go away. That's your optimal solution.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've said the times that I have ignored it, I've forgotten about it (inaudible at 27:43). You know, then (inaudible) the fact that it was really nothing-you know, that I should have carried out (ph) and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard for you to imagine a time when you're angry and you had the right to (inaudible at 28:00).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I know - well, at least I think I was. I was more liable to blow up when I was at home. For some reason, I do yell much more at my parents than other people I know. Or I have - you know, I know that in most cases, they've never yelled back at me. You know? Because I guess my father's kind of taken by surprise; but he also has this feeling - he thinks I have a temperament sort of like him. And I admit I used to more than I have now. But I don't think that I yell as much as he does. </p>

<p>But like with him, he's kind of - I don't know if it's a please (ph) type thing or if he's proud or - he's either surprised or glad that somebody is saying something. But you know, like I told you the situation with [my mother] (ph). I guess everybody yells more at home than they do (inaudible at 29:09). They know they're a family and everybody gets along.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) would be more, too, if you felt like there was more things to do-your dad and -</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times - I've learned about myself that a lot of times if I make a statement with somebody, I can just say something much more effective or something even nastier than just yelling at the person. It's true - [29:37]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do feel afterwards?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I realize that I've really gotten to the person who - I guess - and a lot of times I feel proud of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't get that bad feeling?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not that often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that it's -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because like say it's like to my mom, I apologize and say, "I was just kidding." But like if it's to a stranger or even if it's just to my friends, I say, "They deserved it," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like it's okay to be angry as long as you're (inaudible at 30:12). You can do anything else to get [them back] (ph) (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's (inaudible at 30:17). I just - I kind of associate yelling and everything with kind of being weak really (ph), too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it like being so much like your dad, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I kind of think about that a lot. Because I always hated him screaming, and it was really - you know, to say the least, unattractive. But I just hated the screaming, and that's in my mind somewhat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's the one way you really don't want to be like him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I just - I really hate people that yell a lot over petty things. Because right away, I associate that from my parents (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it make you feel when he told you you're just like him (inaudible at 31:01)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I kind of disagree with him, but I don't really emphasize it, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel inside (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I say in my mind that it's really not true. Then I kind of think, "Well I guess it is a little bit." But I've gotten to the point of where I think that I can control it much better than my father.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you can accept yourself being a little bit like him, just as long as it's not going to get out of hand?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because that - well like I said, I don't know really think that through. You know? So it kind of - (inaudible at 31:42) say what he [wants though] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that right? That you can sort of accept a little bit of that in yourself? Or would you like to [get rid of] (ph) (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be like my father in that respect? I don't know. I kind of - I think I like the mixture of being patient at times and able to yell once in a while. Because I keep thinking that there may be something, you know, like unnatural about a person who can control themselves all the time and stuff. Not unnatural, but just kind of - I don't know, maybe dull in a way. So that type of thing. So I don't really either wish to be either (inaudible) either one extreme. [32:34]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like it's all right to be angry sometimes, just so long as it doesn't just take you over and turn into a scene [and everything] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's kind of like I think, you know, in everything I like to be kind of in the middle, or you know, which is a little of both. Like nowadays, there's just so much emphasis on people being middle-of-the-road and that. I kind of associate it with that. And like I told you before, everything turns out either one extreme or the other for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like those are the only things that are real for you-are the extremes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But like I'd like to be - like say, as far as being reasonably talented or not very well talented; or just being down the middle with most things. But I always find myself at one end or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think there's something about that middle that's sort of - doesn't have enough - or it's not real enough or something. Like when you look at the extremes of things, at least you can see them or something. But when you think of just being a mixture of things, it's sort of like being nobody (ph) or (inaudible at 33:48).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know, maybe like what I think it is, is it really (inaudible) when I think of the middle, I just think of being able to do things - like just having a little of both in me, you know what I mean? A little of both sides. And like everybody is really conditioned nowadays that it's really bad to be in the middle and that type of thing. </p>

<p>But I don't know-I just think - you know, like they all say it's - and they're all in one (inaudible at 34:36) and everything, you know? Like to be in the middle - it's, you know, just - you're just there, and then you'll kind of see both sides, but you never really end up being great or, you know, fair (ph)-you just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 34:57) a lot of times talking (inaudible)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I see the middle as getting to all sides - you know, to both ends. But what everybody says about being in the middle nowadays-it's not like you're stuck there; you never really get to get out, you know, and reach all sides.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of saying that, in a way, the middle for you is where you want to be to be able to be all the things you are a little bit? [35:26]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. To see all sides and all points or whatever. That's how I see it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel sort of like other are saying, "If you don't do something more extreme, then you're just sort of nowhere at all-you're just locked into sort of nowhere"?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I kind of have my little (inaudible) little where I'll just - I'll (inaudible at 35:52).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess the whole thing that's troublesome about that was really that sort of quality of being locked into one (ph) (inaudible at 36:02). where nothing is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then what happens is, like I just told you, I find myself always at one end or the other. That's like, for me - I guess-I think, you know, what I call "middle" would be ideal for me, or least in my mind it would be, right? But everything I've ever done is always putting at one end or the other-one extreme or the other.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that really different from the middle? The middle is really being able to go out to all the ends, isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like you get pushed out to the ends too much and can't get back?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know-just feel like I'm always at one end and never in the middle and my -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which end are you always at?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just know that I'm always at that end, and I never get to the middle or to the other side.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are there some feelings that you'd like to have that you associate with the middle that you don't have when you're (inaudible at 37:05)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just - yeah, I guess I would be able to be just - I guess more versatile as far as (inaudible) you know, anything that's tangible or anything that you could just know something about, you know what I mean? Say to be able - like as far as the arts go, that would be I guess - you know, say that would be one end or something; and then science (ph) - you know, just - you want to know about it. I don't know if I [want to be really good] (ph), but just to be good in both or more equally - know as much about one as the other. You understand what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So it's a little bit like saying being at this end if sort of like there are more things you'd like to have going on inside (inaudible) [38:19]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think there's more things that I just would like to know about and be good at.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of feels like you're always in the same old ballpark (ph) or something? Like all these other good things out there, but there always -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Or I even get to those other things; and when I'm there, I just have to go on to something else. And it seems like I never even give it enough time and - you know what I mean? It's like I passed over it kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to get into (inaudible at 38:52). What are some of those things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Like - well just things like-say you're reading or learning about books and (inaudible) and - you know, just I guess sewing and cooking-whatever you want it to be-music - anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really it sounds like you're saying [sort of like] (ph) be involved in one of these things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what happens if sometimes I do, but I don't know, like I just either give it up because I lose interest, or give it up because I always say to myself like, "I know I'll be able to do it, so why should I even bother to try and do it? To show that I know how to do it-you know what I mean? Which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard, but that's what I do a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you have two (inaudible at 39:36) reasons for wanting to go try all those things. One is for the fun of it, and the other is show you can do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Kind of - in high school - I never did it in college, but in high school I did. Sometimes I wouldn't do my homework, and I wouldn't you know like write a paper or something like that or read something because like I always knew I could do it. Say in English-you know, writing English - because I always knew I'd get a good grade, and that was my best subject. So like I never did it. And then afterwards, I'd always use the same rationale. You know, why should I do it if I know I can do it and I know I'd be able to do a good job on it? So I didn't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like a lot of times the only reason you can think of to try something is to see if you can do it or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or maybe I really do have an interest in it. But I mean, like there's a lot of things I'm really crummy at, too, so. I don't know, but like (inaudible at 40:46) but I, "Oh gee, I wish I could do it better," you know, and not find (ph) something else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like it sort of gets mixed up, right? You start out wanting to do something because it looks interesting-like sewing or something-and then all of a sudden, you're asking yourself if you're any good at it. And then no matter what the answer to that question is, that's a reason to not do it anymore. You know? [41:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like sewing, like I can sew. That's one thing I know I can - I just - I don't do it because I know I can do it. And it was really nice all along to do something that makes me (inaudible at 41:22), but I just don't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that like-that feeling inside you that you have to kind of - whether you're good at something or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think it's more that I'd like to be good at it, you know? I think that's what I feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it would really make you happy to be good at something like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah-or I'd really get enjoyment out of doing (inaudible at 41:49). Again, I never really wanted to compete with people; I've always ended up competing with myself. It's not (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's a real high evaluation for yourself (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think - sometimes I don't. I think I'm pretty honest - like if I know I can't do something right-you know, I know I can't do it, I won't do it, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if you're not good at something, then you don't feel like you should go ahead and do it (inaudible at 42:20)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess I (inaudible) like see-it's no (ph) I can't see some (inaudible). I mean, I know it, but I don't think I want to try it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that like-that feeling to be good at something [so you do it] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. I haven't thought about that. I guess I kind of wish that I could do it, but I think I say a lot of times, "Well there's other things you can try."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you'd be better at?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. If the thing isn't really important to me or I'm not really crazy about doing it-I mean, if I was, I'd say, "Gee, I really wish I could do that." That's one thing I really wish I could do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you still wouldn't do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably-if I knew I couldn't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're demanding on yourself [about that] (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't think there's any - I wouldn't say to myself-like if there was something I knew I couldn't do, I wouldn't say, "Try it and persevere at it." Because like I think I know in mind what I can and can't do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying in a way that there's no pleasure in doing something that you can't do well? [43:48]</p>

<p>PATIENT: There's no pleasure in doing something I can't do well? Well I think there is-you know, when I think about it. I think there is, but like I guess it's, whatever it was, if it was so much fun, that even if I didn't do it well, I'd like it and I'd do it anyways. But it's something that I'd really want to be good in, and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that happen with most things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What-the second one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you really want to be good in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd say half and half maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what I have trouble getting a feel for really (inaudible at 44:34) and when you talk about (inaudible) even when you know you're good at something, you really don't do it. What's stopping you from doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just the single thought in my mind-that I know I can do it, so why should I even bother?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like the whole - (overlapping voices)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm testing (ph) myself? Is that what (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like the little (ph) fun of it is seeing - isn't being able to give yourself (inaudible at 45:03) for it sort of-there's no fun beyond that or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I just - really when I think about this, it's like I'm having a race with myself, which I'm testing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think a lot of people test themselves like that. It seems like you were saying earlier, well there are all these things you'd like to sort of get into, and something stops you. And it sort of sounds to me like what stops you is the way you test yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does-a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then that's the end of it somehow (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't even know how I got into it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. It's sort of like you don't test yourself and then go do it; you sort of test yourself and then stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe it's a way of not doing it [at all]. Like in my house, my older sister - you know, when I was younger, right, it's still with me in a lot of ways. My older sister was always able to do everything, and she did it really well and everything like that. And I don't know-I kind of - I don't know if I was competing with her or not, but I just didn't want to do anything that she did then. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she sort of did everything well? [46:24]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah I guess. Or everything that she tried, she did well anyways. And I kind of admire the fact that she did it well, but like I - well now, I see it much more. I see what happens to her-why she was doing it. And you know, what goes on while she was really like an A person. I mean, I see her-she's living with me today and everything, and I realize it's really tough, you know? I don't know if she even knows it's tough on her; but it's tough on me to see it. It's really bad-she way she lives (ph) and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does she (inaudible at 47:12) herself for (inaudible)? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, where she's so finicky, or she follows everything-everything she does-to a T. You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of having to be perfect all the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Everything she does is perfect-it's so perfect. It's really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But her perfectness seems to have something to do with why you can't do things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if my - my parents have compared us in school and everything, you know? But kind of when I think about things to do now, I always - in my mind, I always say, "Oh, she could do that pretty well if she tried," and everything. So in a way, I think it bothers me, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems like if she can do everything so much better, there's no reason why you should even try.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I think she can, you know? Like I think she kind of - I don't know if she's really able to, but like I always think she can, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then when you think she can do it better, then you figure you shouldn't do it at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well if I really want to try it, I will. But I guess usually I just say, "No, that's - " For some reason, she, more than my other two sisters, always - I'm left (ph) with this impression about (ph) how she does things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's left two very different impressions-one that you really admire and how great she is and - so you don't want to do it. And then that she's so perfect, it's intolerable and you don't want to do it that way, either.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like in reality, I don't want to be her or really do the things the way she does them, but I'm - you know, like in my mind, I really that she does everything so well-or at least I think she does. [49:00]</p>

<p>Like the other day, we were out in her car and Adrian was there, and she - I think we stopped at McDonald's or something, and I got French fries-got Adrian these French fries, and we both had Cokes and stuff. And so he was eating, you know-and he's just a little baby, and he dropped one on her floor - of the car, and she-got grease on the leather-and she was getting really, you know, crazy about it. She took the food away from him and she said, "You've had enough. You can't have anymore." I mean, she really got upset because her car was getting dirty and everything. I mean, like to take the food away from the baby when he was hungry-it kind of got me. </p>

<p>And I just realized that she wants everything clean and perfect and that type of thing. And I kind of - I'm able to laugh at her more and more, because I didn't notice things like that when I was younger. But she just does things - I don't know, I just think are really weird. She doesn't function (ph). The other night we were driving back from my parents' house. We were there for Passover, and (inaudible at 50:12) was driving her car and everything, and we were - Adrian and I were in the back. And (inaudible) so fast. </p>

<p>And all these - she was talking about something that really got me. She was talking about this - we stopped at this stop sign, and there was this girl standing next to a bar or something. Well I guess my sister wondered if she was a street walker or something. So she asked her husband if he thought she was attractive and everything, you know? And she was so concerned that - what type of girl she was and everything. And I guess her husband said, "She'll serve the purpose," you know? And my sister was just - it really got me the way she was so worried about what type of person she was and like her morals and what she was doing there and everything. Just everything she talked about on the way back was so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like in a fight for right and virtue (inaudible at 51:16)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or just doing everything right-I guess she (inaudible) the girl wasn't even looking or doing anything. You know, doing (inaudible) and stuff. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like now you can look at that and see that you really don't do things the way she does them, but it seems like it's still sort of a leftover thing that keeps you from doing things - [51:44]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'm just blind or something, but I still don't see, after being the way she is-which everyone I talk to thinks she's pretty rigid and everything. I just don't see how after that, she does everything so well and right and everything. And I realize - well like I was in an art class with her last summer, and like I just realized she got - I guess she got an A on her project-and it was nice and everything. </p>

<p>And I just - I was watching her in class and everything, and she followed every rule that the teacher laid down to a T. And you know, it was fine-she could do it. And then I was looking at my project and my stuff, and I was thinking, "Why couldn't I just listen to the teacher and follow everything," you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like there's something inside of you that wants to be able to just - be just as perfect as she is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess - well I don't know. I just want (ph) to do things well and everything, but I still can't see why I couldn't just follow the rules to a T. I mean, the teacher was saying them (inaudible at 52:49) and I wasn't doing it-and I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It must have been that there was something inside of you that didn't want to, too (ph).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Well forget that, I just - like I was just thinking, "It's so easy to do it," and I just couldn't even do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of makes you feel like she really does things better because she can follow the rules and you're just not as good as she is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. Well I used to feel that, but like now, I know I was - in the class I didn't feel so bad because like I was asking the teacher if I could kind of go off and - to a more (ph) (inaudible at 53:26) on the project. And she said that was a good idea, and I wanted to do it and everything. But it was funny, because everybody else in the class was sort of following the directions, too (inaudible) and their projects didn't turn out as well or as nice and everything. </p>

<p>And I keep thinking and going over what happened. And I realize my sister was right there in the front desk and listening and writing everything down. And I thought everybody else was, too; but I guess their minds were kind of wandering, and they didn't - but it was funny. And I could see like the teacher takes a course - she's a teacher, by the way. And I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like there's still something inside of you that's real strong that wants to be just perfect and be able to follow all the rules and get all As and have everybody say you're just perfect. And then there's all these other things inside of you that want to do it your way. And like you're always being pulled between your way and being perfect - [54:34]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see like, it's not really my way; it's just what I do, you know? And I never will think about it as being my way. It's just - you know, what happens to me in a way. And it's never that I'm really controlling things, you know? And if I'm doing these things and I - I'm not really calling it "my way" or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It seems like, in a way, you're saying that there's only really one real way, which is the perfect way with all the rules. And then there's just these haphazard actions. And if you could believe that your haphazard actions were another real way, then you wouldn't have to keep telling yourself you should be perfect or something. But it doesn't feel like your way is really a real way; it's just sort of (inaudible at 55:15). So that that strict way, when you follow the rules, is always pulling you back. Because it seems like it's the way it's supposed to be or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of-but like I'm really-I told you before-it's really - it's [your last] (ph) uptight anymore, you know? It's a loosening up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it still seems like, for you, what you do doesn't feel it has maybe a (inaudible at 55:41). It's just sort of what you do? And it's hard to stick with it when everybody else is getting anxious (ph) (inaudible at 55:48) and stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or even getting As for going off their own way. Because it's like - that's another thing that I can't - you know, get.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like saying if you could just be sure that what you were doing was really good, then maybe it would be easier to have the courage to break [some of these rules] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I've always had - I don't know if it's courage, but I've always been able to break rules. But it's probably more - you know, just rationalizing to myself, you know? That's my situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You figure that just shows how weak you are or something? That you couldn't follow the rules?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess sometimes it does. Sometimes like I know I don't want to, you know? But I guess it's a combination of both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How about when you really don't want to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's when I rationalize more and say, "Well if I do it this way - I really want to do it this way, and what is wrong with really wanting to do it that way?" It's just a whole (inaudible at 56:50) things that [I want to do] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of seems like the more sure you are of your way, the worse trouble you get into. The more you have to defend it or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. A lot of times I guess I do end up defending it. Like you know, why can't I just do it because I really want to or something? Which is what I say - I guess I say to myself in my mind, but to other people I don't. You know, like to say to someone who really follows the rules and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like it's a good enough argument for doing it your way-just that you want to. [57:26]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) But recently, I really hate myself because I feel like I've gone over this so many times with you - and like I feel like I'm boring you and myself, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you bored now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm bored with what I'm saying. Well like, I'm getting to see a few things in myself that - like I'm bored with what I'm saying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you bored with what you're seeing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm seeing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, not really. I guess I'm always kind of interested in people (ph). Like there's real (ph) things there (inaudible at 58:13) try them. That's how I see it, you know? It's kind of a puzzle. But I don't know. Maybe I didn't get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't heard most of this stuff before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah? Maybe I've been saying it in my mind or just somewhere else. I feel like I've told it to about ten people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you have been saying it to other people or to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, as I've gotten older, like my memory, or whatever it is, is not as good. Like in high school, even - just a stupid little test, sometimes you think of what you've worn back like the whole week to school because you don't want to wear the same thing the next day, you know? And like I could remember what I wore the past five days to school. But like now, I can't remember at all what I've worn the past five days, or I can't remember what I've told certain people or anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess there's a lot going on in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if that's it or what, but I just feel like my memory isn't as good as it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what I was thinking of - that maybe that sense of boredom that you have now with the stuff you were talking about was like - it goes down into all this stuff, and there you were again. You were on a track and, "Oh God, [not again] (ph)."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've been really into stories. Yeah, that's probably it, too. I just feel that way with all my friends (inaudible at 59:52). I feel like I'm telling them now what I told them two years ago or something like that. I know I haven't. Maybe like two weeks ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like it's hard for you to get into what's going on with you now or something. [1:00:07]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Like all of a sudden, [tied in with] (ph) I feel so wrapped up in psychology now. I just - I don't know, I just feel like everything is stemming around the therapy. I guess it's mostly because everybody's been talking about it and stuff. And I don't know-maybe that's what's boring me (ph)-that I've been talking about it so much to people-you know, the psychology. It's really interesting, though. Like I said, I'd like to learn more about it, but I feel so bogged down in it lately.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not visiting you, I mean-that's different. But just talking about it, I think-to everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that like saying sort of like instead of talking about where you really are then, but talking about this theory out there somewhere? And that you're getting a lot of (inaudible 1:01:05) in here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no-it's just like talking about me. And like just the whole field of psychology-the therapy - you know, the different things in it. Like id, ego-that type of thing. I just feel like bogged down in it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like bogged down in trying to make sense out of your (inaudible 1:01:27)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like just with the words in psychology-talking (ph). You know, like just impressions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See I mean, I could see how maybe you would feel bogged down, because id and ego and stuff are sort of things that are out there. And they're not really something that you're really in. I mean, you're not in it. It's like talking about some book or something. Or maybe you feel bogged down because you just keep thinking about yourself all the time and you keep going over the same stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like with myself and then just - I guess telling people what therapy is like, you know? That type of thing - that - you know, just talking about myself and the whole thing with you, which is - well that's the feeling I have this week. I didn't really have it last week or any of the times before. It's just this week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like maybe during the week, you're sort of having discussions with yourself about yourself or something. So when you get in here, it's sort of like having it for second time around.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or what I - you know, what I talk about in therapy, you know like when there's something - like a point or something, that leads me to think about it more. I just feel really bogged down by it-that it's been in my mind all week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's so (inaudible) you don't get anywhere with it; you just keep thinking the same thing about it? [1:03:02]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no. Like I feel like I'm getting somewhere with it, but - because of certain statements linked to the other things. But it's just that I'm talking about psychology-the whole chunk-everything in it. Like (inaudible) [telling my friends] (ph). That's what I mean. Do you understand?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so. Let me try [in the beginning] (ph). Is it sort of like it all gets crystallized and sort of dead for you in a way-because you sort of make a thing out of it or something. And then you talk about that thing or something over and over again. Only it's not changing the way you're changing it. And it's like it's not really you anymore. It's just sort of this thing that you froze. You know, just -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah, in a way. But it's like-I'm in therapy. You know, like I'm coming to the sessions and everything. And even talking about that is a big drag for me. I'm telling people I can't just talk -</p>

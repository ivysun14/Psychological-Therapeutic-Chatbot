<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>(silence until 00:00:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you look kind of blank or are you having thoughts go through your head that just don't seem relevant or important or is there something else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) So I still haven't finished these wedding invitations and I needed to get it done last week and last night I completely screwed up 50 cards and I only had 250 cards which gave me ten percent margin of error but I used up 50 of them and I needed 225. So I called the paper shop and they said that they didn't have any of the paper I needed yesterday but they would be getting a shipment in this morning and they would call me when they got the shipment in so I could go over and pick it up and they never called me. I'm kind of irritated because I was waiting all morning for them to call. The afternoon rolled around and they didn't call and then I got distracted doing everything so I'm just going to go after I'm done here. Hopefully by then their morning shipment will have arrived. (chuckle) I don't know. I'm mostly just irked that the call got dropped on the floor. I'm also slightly hung-over. [00:01:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Slightly hung-over?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have the wedding invitations been a lot of work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they have. (pause) So yesterday I was working in the print shop. I went straight there from here, paused to get lunch, worked some more, started making bone headed mistakes and after the third such mistake I was like, "Do you know what? Maybe I should clean up and leave and get some food and then reevaluate whether I can come back after dinner and get useful work done." And so I met up with some friends for dinner and they encouraged me to put it aside for the entire evening because I had already been working seven hours by that point. And I was making bone headed mistakes and I shouldn't. So we had a couple beers, went to a bar, had another couple of drinks, stumbled home, yeah. Failed to drink enough water. [00:03:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Did you have a good time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) There's a huge party this weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Annual event?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's an annual thing. It's a very big deal for kind of students and alumni.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it at a dorm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the dorms are kind of divided into two dorms in terms of campus subculture. So like the building stuff and setting things on fire and real genius type stereotypes, that's all east campus. And the in the library, head in the books, studying 24/7 stereotypes, that's all west campus. Roughly speaking that's like painting with very broad strokes. But yeah it's not just one collection of dorms that are all shared social circles. [00:04:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is dorm thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and a number of my friends are here from out of town to come to this. I'm not planning on going. I've never enjoyed it but I certainly enjoy having all my friends who moved back in town for the weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was good to meet up with some of my friends last night, hang out, catch up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I guess I'm wondering (pause) what it is that sort of contributes to your having more things to talk about some days and less others. I mean yesterday, it was quite a morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) (inaudible) ...to talk about there. But I wonder if there's something consistent about days when you kind of have less to say or...what's going through your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) [00:06:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My hunch is, although correct me if I'm wrong, is that you kind of, I'm not sure which, consciously or unconsciously reject things that you might say because it doesn't feel like they're sort of meaningful or important or interesting or useful enough or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot of people might agree with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I could just imagine that being the sort of thing you might do. (pause) And I guess related to that having some worry about their being judged, probably more by you than by me, I think. After you talked about them as being kind of worthless or stupid or something like that. (pause) I guess I could also imagine you might be waiting for me to say something. [After that point] (ph) you said yesterday in which there was clearly a lot. [00:08:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I don't know. What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) It occurs to me the last several sessions time ran out while you were kind of mid thought or mid conversation and I'm curious if you see anything important from any of those to pick back up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) I mean, truthfully, I tend to work or do this in this sort of weird way. I mean, it's not weird for this kind of work. There are lots of people who work this way but we are compared to the rest of real life where as you know I don't (pause)...usually it's more like there's something that you'll say or that I'll think of that will kind of cue me to remember more so than I come back and think, "Oh that was important. We better pick right back up there again." (pause) [00:10:08]</p>

<p>Yeah. (pause) Some of which is, I don't know who all this motivates, but like there's a few reasons for that which I can explain if that would be helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of them is — this may sound like sort of a vague way of talking about it — but you can't really recreate a moment or a feeling in the room or something like that in the way that it sort of evolves spontaneously. So in other words you never would have picked back up when we were talking at the end yesterday about the family stuff and the stuff with your sisters and so forth. It's not that I never do things like that but generally not because there's a certain sort of way that that's a part of the whole conversation and the whole sort of feel in the room and moment, associating with the rest of what we've been talking about. It's a little bit like you watch a movie, an hour and ten minutes or an hour and a half, you watch the whole thing and then take five minutes from it and play it. It's not the same. [00:12:14]</p>

<p>So there's some of that and (pause) I know this sounds...that's not to say you shouldn't talk about it if that's what's on your mind. If that's what's in your mind it's time to bring it out and you won't feel quite the same as when we were talking about it yesterday, probably, but who knows where it will go from there and what will unfold. I guess I generally don't bring up things like because I don't know sort of if that's where you're at. I mean there are some times for some reason that I will but usually not. Usually it takes me a few minutes to see where you're at and settle in with what seems to be on your mind and where you are in relation to the issue we've been talking about, which (pause) is sort of obstructed by my kind of reintroducing something. [00:13:38]</p>

<p>I guess those would be the two reasons really. One is (pause) we're not quite in the same moment we were in and another is it could obstruct, kind of get in the way of figuring out where you happen to be at today about whatever you happen to be there about. That said, if something terrible happens or...it's not like I'm going to come back the next day and be like I've forgotten or not come back to it or you know. There are times at the end of the hour where it clearly makes sense to both of us to start right there next time. That's what we'd do. But as a general rule, it's sort of about (pause) spontaneity and surprise and (inaudible) I guess in part because that's what kind of tends to reveal (pause) more unconscious aspects and patterns of experience than more structure or explicitly prioritizing or analytical, like if there's a problem [or something] (ph) approaches which tend to obscure those things. In other words it's often easier to learn things that neither of us knows yet that way. (pause) That's long winded but there you go. [00:15:51]</p>

<p>Before I step down from the soap box let me say one more thing. I think for you feeling blank or obstructed or inhibited is right at the heart of some of the things that you struggle with, in being like the blank piece of paper or blank canvas problem you had talked about I guess a little while ago where you're worried about being criticized or sort of jumped all over in a critical way to the extent that it can be hard to sort of feel freer. And (pause) I'll help with that if that really gets sort of unbearable or unmanageable. I don't have the impression that it generally is, although it's difficult.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:17:10] to 00:17:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do have a thought of any of that, or reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes sense, different than from what I'm used to but not a bad thing. By the time I stopped seeing Chrissy I started dreading our sessions because I knew that the first thing I did when I came in she would invariable comment on my clothing which I had told her multiple times made me uncomfortable. And then she would ask me how school went and whether I got my work done and it started to feel like she was yet another task master and it was just not pleasant. (pause) So I can kind of see your point where having an agenda going in can kind of obscure some other things. But there is still a part of me contrarily thinks this would be so much easier if I came in and you had a list of questions to ask instead of just asking me to free form talk. (chuckle) [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I definitely believe that would make it easier in an important way. I'm just not convinced it would be easier [to your] (ph) benefit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) She would comment on your clothes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would she say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, "That's a really nice sweater. That's a lovely color on you." And I don't know, when I first started seeing her I was still in the blah, boring, I'm just going to wear jeans and black t shirts, just solid black t shirts every day. And around that time my mother-in-law and my friend Brenda both decided they were going to make me their project. (chuckle) Like my mother-in-law just started buying and sending me clothes and Brenda would encourage me to go shopping with her and they tried to get me into colors and something more interesting than a square t shirt. And Chrissy would comment on that. And so at one point I said, "You know, my mother-in-law is trying to make...getting me into some color for a project." So for the next two and a half years every time I wore something even remotely brightly colored or interesting Chrissy would ask if my mother-in-law picked it out for me. And for the first six months it was true. It was in fact something my mother-in-law picked out but then I started developing my own taste and it just got very frustrating that there's an assumption that like... [00:20:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also around that time...no not around that time. A year ago maybe, last May in fact, I decided to do an experiment with reclaiming femininity, because I've never really identified as very feminine. As a kid I was pegged as a tom boy. And then the social circle I was in in college was very much a "we're women in a male dominated environment. We're going to cope with that by trying to be one of the guys." And so it was almost a catch phrase. You could hear almost all of the women I knew say several times a week, "I'm not cute. Don't call me cute." Like there's just complete rejection of any aspect of beauty or femininity or appearance or anything. [00:21:44]</p>

<p>And so I read (pause)...oh I can't remember the name of the author of the book. It's a really famous work on transgender issues and trans-women and transmasogeny and why am I blanking on the name? I've recommended this to a dozen people. But anyway the book is essentially about the scapegoating of femininity and feminine circles and that was some food for thought and I chewed on it for a while.</p>

<p>So it was come last year I just bought a bunch of really frilly, feminine, girly clothes because I knew that was a safe space where there weren't going to be a bunch of male engineers, for example, just waiting to think ill of me for being too girly to think. There's always that undercurrent, like all the professional or academic spaces I've inhabited but when I was working in South Carolina some men would say explicitly, "Women shouldn't be here. Women aren't smart enough to do this job." It was... [00:22:50]</p>

<p>So this convention is a feminist convention and unlike most science fiction conventions it's 90 percent female. So I figured if anywhere that's a safe place to experiment with that and I don't know, I felt like I was in drag the whole time. I felt remarkably uncomfortable even though people gave me compliments on my outfits, said I looked really good, asked me where I got my clothes. There was lots of positive feedback but I still just hated it.</p>

<p>So I was trying to come to terms with my reactions so that for most of last summer and a couple of times I mentioned this to Chrissy, that I felt really uncomfortable having all that attention directed to the way I was presenting because it felt really fake to me and she just...I don't know. At one point she said, "Well obviously you're a woman. Just look at your figure. Anyone looking at you can tell you're a woman." I was like, "Well how other people read you is different from how you identify and also physiological signifiers are different from psychological signifiers. Also there's a lot more to how you present than just your shape. There's how you dress yourself, how you accessorize, how you carry yourself." And it was just totally lost on her. I told her I was really uncomfortable having that much focus on my clothes and I also told her explicitly, "I also feel really uncomfortable when you comment on my clothes." And she didn't stop (chuckle) commenting on my outfits. I was just really... [00:24:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it feel to you, when she commented, similarly to how it felt when people at the convention commented? Was it that kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because for one I didn't feel like I was in costume when I went to sessions with her. I was wearing my regular wardrobe. It did feel kind of icky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like as in icky as in creepy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I didn't mean creepy, just like...that was a really vague use of language.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's a hard feeling to pin down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well certainly part of it was frustrated because our sessions were limited in length and the first four to seven minutes or however long was me explaining where I got this outfit and trying to brush aside and her saying, "No, no. It looks really good." Okay, can we talk about other stuff now? And there's this whole big thing and I always felt very impatient like my time was being wasted. (pause) [00:25:48]</p>

<p>And also after I had explicitly told her that I didn't like it and she kept going there was very much a sense of like, "Are you stupid? Are you just inconsiderate?" (chuckle) What's going on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) She, I guess, she was sort of hijacking the beginning of the session in a way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I'm sure she thought she was being complimentary because you know... (pause) I don't know, I feel like (pause) talking about image and body image especially is horribly fraught for women in our society in general so on various occasions over the course of three and a half years I was seeing her I would say, "I'm really frustrated because I know I should be going to the gym and I know felt good about going to the gym and I can't go." And she would say, "Well you know, you don't have to go to the gym to lose weight. You can change your eating habits or diet and you could go for a run." And you know, the number of times I tried to explain that no it's not about weight. It's about fitness and capacity to do things and also I don't like running. I like lifting weights and for that you kind of need a gym once you're beyond the point of barbells that can fit in a tiny apartment. [00:27:41]</p>

<p>But she flat out said that she didn't believe me, that she didn't see how it was possible for a woman in our society to not be concerned about weight. And so I felt like every time we talked about my appearance there was an undercurrent of "you should lose weight." And she did explicitly say on a couple of occasions that you know, "Maybe you would feel better if you lost some weight."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like...no go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, it was just very frustrating. Because I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to be skinny. But (pause) I don't know. I worked really hard to reject all of those social messages around thin being best. And I think I might have mentioned last week that even when I was working out and eating exclusively from my (inaudible) like whole foods, fresh vegetables, I was still fat! (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did mention, yeah. [00:28:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dieting is just so physically and emotionally destructive for so many people and I just really resented the push to diet and exercise for the purpose of losing weight. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could see how those things are not at all incompatible. One thing on one hand to be skinny but being very troubled by and frustrated with cultural messages of which there seems to be very many about dieting and exercise. I don't know how much this is part of you, you haven't mentioned it yet, but it seems counter (ph) to a bunch of the things you're saying about what she said, did you feel like (pause) she was imposing values of her own? [00:29:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah it definitely felt like that on several occasions. But it's about weight and exercise and also about sex and sexuality. She made it very clear that she did not approve of my romantic and sexual decisions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? (inaudible) what she disapproved of and why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She doesn't approve of polyamory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. I think you had said (ph) that to me before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's...she came of age during the 60s and several of her friends were extremely emotionally damaged by the free love movement and people who participated unethically to put it politely and euphemistically. And so she doesn't see anything of value outside of the monogamous life partner model which doesn't work for me. (pause) It doesn't work for a lot of people. (pause) [00:31:03]</p>

<p>Yeah at one point she said that — this was actually the tipping point that caused me to seek a new therapist — she said that I was too man-ish in my approach to relationships and romance and she viewed this as something that needed to be treated in therapy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:31:30] to 00:31:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so I could go with that from the angel of why I think that was problematic of her to say as your therapist (chuckle) but I'm going to put that aside at the moment but I want to get clear that I think that because part of what I'm interested in is how that was hurtful to you. You know what I mean? And again, of course it was, but I'm wondering how so?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't...I don't recall feeling hurt by it. I recall feeling offended by it. (pause) And I don't want to be prejudiced but you know, part of me in that moment said, "I should have expected this, second wave feminist, bleh." Which is really unfair of me because I know plenty of women in her generation who don't suck in that particular manner but (pause) we had a number of conversations about gender and some of these specific emotional perils you face as a woman in a male dominated field and I kind of felt we were on the same page with that and then all of a sudden she busts out with this highly gender essentialist and offensive statement. And I was just gob smacked! [00:33:33]</p>

<p>(pause) I also find this idea that all men are, by default, callous about relationships and unfeeling and incapable of the deep emotional commitment that women are. That's profoundly retrograde and sexist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) So yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) So was it the offense you took that tipped the scales or was it feeling like (pause) you clearly were not going to be able to relate about these sorts of things in a helpful way? Do you know what I mean? Was it because she pissed you off or was it because you felt like you weren't really going to be able to talk to her usefully about these kinds of things? [00:34:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I mean, I was pissed off, of course but after I went home that afternoon I realized that there had been several things that I had been wanting to discuss in therapy but I had censored because I was afraid her reaction would be dumb. And then I realized I just didn't trust her judgment anymore. She was very helpful for a long while but it got to the point where not only was I dreading the feeling of task master with, "How has your school work been going? Did you get your homework done?" But there was also the fact that I didn't trust her judgment on issues around gender and sexuality and I was afraid she'd say something dumb and offensive. (chuckle) (pause) Dumb might not be the word I want. She's not a dumb woman. She's very smart. But offensive and incompatible were my ethics maybe, I'm not sure. [00:36:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Did you guys talk about the task master thing much? I mean I guess (pause) [the way that] (ph) I can see it was a problem how she went about it and how it (pause) in a way, frustrated and I don't know, intimidated you — I'm not sure — but something along those lines maybe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not intimidated, maybe not even annoyed, more overwhelmed with guilt for not having got my work done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get there's a piece of that that seems...where I'm going is there's a piece of that to me that seems characteristic of things that happened to you and so that I could imagine that coming up in a way that could have been workable and helpful but it doesn't sound like it became that. [00:37:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A big part of why I got into therapy in the first place was because I just couldn't get work done. I was immensely frustrated with it. And like the first year I saw her we focused on cognital (ph) behavior therapy techniques for getting out of the computer game addiction and being able to focus and not procrastinate and that was really helpful and then that started losing effectiveness. I almost liken that to if you take the same drug day after day after day eventually it stops being effective. So there's a great deal — the second year I was seeing her — there was a great deal of trying new techniques, trying to do an interim (ph) around the part of my brain that was sabotaging me. And I think she even characterized it as there's a rebel inside your brain and personified it a little bit and trying to do an interim (ph) around that.</p>

<p>And that's how we got into the asking me every week how I was doing on my work. It started just as a check in to see how I was feeling about it and how the techniques were working and then over time it slowly morphed into this thing that was kind of not what it started out as. [00:38:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did it feel like you were each sort of in that sense, inhabiting kind of different roles in your conflict where she was task master and there was a part of you that was sort of rebellious yet shamed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) But it sounds like (pause) that felt much more just kind of acted out in a very painful and unchanging way than sort of worked through in a way that was helpful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) sometimes having, or often times actually in one way or another this kind of happens in therapy where at least to one person if not to both it starts to feel like you kind of take positions on an issue, an issue you're struggling with. And sometimes just one person feels that way, the patient (inaudible) and sometimes it's clear to both people. And then there can be a lot of benefit I think in talking about it and working it out, like you say, "Fuck! I hate...you feel like a fucking task master. I'm sitting here with my goddamn father and blah blah blah blah blah," and she says, "Holy shit! Geez!" Either she says, "Holy shit! I got it. I was just trying to check in so we could keep on top of it. How is that I'm making you feel that way? Let's look at that and see what's going on here." Or she says, "Yeah, you know, somehow I am turning into that. (chuckle) Let's figure out how the dynamic between us is leading to us getting stuck in these positions and what does this drag up for you so we can further work this out in a way that helps." Do you know what I mean? [00:41:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think if she had just done that I would have been willing to work it out but it was...yeah. There was all the other stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sure! And how clear to me that...so there's this sort of enactment of the dynamic and then there's the — and I'll just sort of work through the dynamic. I'm hearing a lot about the first, I don't know if there was the other part or whether it was more just being played out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was just being played out and the feeling like she was a task master was a relatively recent thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there might have been opportunity. It's kind of hard to tell. I mean, there's something obviously (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I mean, at one point I was talking about feeling insecure and awkward at a square dance — several friends of mine square dance — and it's a very regimented thing where you have a caller calling out patterns and you have to know the moves and I didn't know them and I was very intimidated about going even though the friend of mine who has been dancing for 15 years told me they totally will help you out if you're a beginner and show you the moves. And we were kind of talking through my whole fear of negative evaluation and fear of not knowing things and really I have no reason to know them. And she made this comment about how her nephew does this same style of folk dancing and he was in town and maybe if I saw him I would want to sleep with him because he's a good looking person of color and she knows that I don't sleep with white people. It's like, that's totally inappropriate and it also felt like she was being kind of snide and judgy about my choices about who I sleep with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now. We'll talk more. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You too. [00:43:19]</p>

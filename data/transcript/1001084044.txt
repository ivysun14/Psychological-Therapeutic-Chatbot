<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what happened to you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I had this terrible cough that's been going on off and on for over a month.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, every time it seems to be going away, I get ready to make an appointment and it seems to be going away for a few days, then it flares up again and it's been flaring up the last few days to the extent that I actually didn't go to a performance last night because I didn't want to disturb people with my coughing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And is it asthmatic?  Let me hear it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Actually now I'm not coughing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Try.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I hear a wheeze</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Breath out.  Are you allergic?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I know of, I am asthmatic but in the morning, you know, for years I've been on Guaifenesin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because I, you know, was having phlegm.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Brings up the.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So it doesn't do much but usually I bring up something in the morning, it's usually sort of beige, you know, the stuff that's down at the bottom, then it clears for the rest of the day.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Gross.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is gross but it seems to get worse in the evening and it's just not productive, maybe one time in ten am I able to bring anything up.  You know, like I'm worry myself, my stomach is sore and I get pumped up with gas and it feels like this ticklish spot in my throat that my post nasal drip just drips on and redrips, so I haven't been sleeping well.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That keeps you up at night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It wakes me up in the night with a coughing fit.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You wake up by cough, that's significant to be woken by a cough.  How many pills do you sleep on?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Two and a wedge to boot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right and is it especially when you're flat that you wake up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not flat, I'm on the wedge.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right but if you roll of it, is that what wakes you up?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I'm aware of.  I seem to be in the same position when I wake up that I was when I went to bed.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have a fever?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've got no fever and I talked, I [INAUDIBLE] I know 3 people who've got a hacking cough right now.  I did go to a concert Saturday and I'd say 10% of the audience had the same thing.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But it's been going on long enough that I feel that I should go see the doctor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think so too.  Well, it sounds like you don't need a chest x-ray. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A couple nights I've taken a whole Xanax instead of a half.  I'm taking cough syrup.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you think it helped at all?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe I slept longer before I woke up coughing.  I usually wake up once or twice during the night to pee anyway, but it's different waking up to pee and waking up with a horrible coughing fit.  What happened a few nights is I would go to sleep then within a half and hour or an hour, I would wake up coughing and then wide awake and would end up sitting up, you know, getting to read</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For how long?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, till I wore myself out, sometimes half an hour or an hour, never more than an hour.  So other than that</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long has it been altogether?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I wish I knew, it seems to be about 6 weeks from what I thought was a cold.  I had 3 really bad days, 1 day where I sneezed non stop, another day where I coughed non stop, and another day where I blew my nose non stop.  I don't remember in which order but that went away and maybe a few weeks later the cough came back, marginal, and as I said every time I get ready to do something about it, it would seem to improve for a few days but the last week has definitely been bad. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw you June 25th.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> About 2 weeks after my foot surgery.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so the foot surgery, the computer problems, you know, that wasn't a good moment in your life, you know, it seems to be one thing after another with the prostate, the </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's called life.  Oh that's good news, I had my latest prostate test and it was still 0.8.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The same as it was 6 months ago.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> 0.8 is nice and low, you must have no testosterone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Remember we met through the testosterone clinic</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, that's probably what's crossing my mind.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you do have low testosterone but now we can never give it to you because your prostate issues.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I've been less [INAUDIBLE] and masturbating less often.  I've been on line less often.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you're losing the juice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Basically I don't miss it.  Half of me is sort of hoping to put it behind me and just</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You mean put sexuality behind you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sexual desire or compulsive desire or whatever.  You know, I'd settle for a massage now and then if I need to be touched.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When I saw you in June your mood was fine, you weren't anxious or irritable, your appetite was fine, you were having fitful sleep, your energy was low, you had some cognitive dysfunction and you were not suicidal, hopeless, or helpless, your self esteem was not great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We decided to switch, to try the Cymbalta.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, so we went to Cymbalta and we pulled back a touch on the Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well the Cymbalta was a total disaster.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> By day 5 I was a zombie so I never even filled the prescription, I stopped.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So even the 30 mg, the small dose I gave you, it was too sedating?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I felt like a zombie so I went back to Wellbutrin.  You mentioned a couple of times, to see what happened if I do without.  I gradually cut back, I cut down to 300 for several weeks, then I cut down to 150.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For a few weeks, then I cut down to 150 every other day for another week and it's 10 weeks, ten days or 2 weeks that I've been off of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you okay?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't noticed any difference.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you didn't need it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Unfortunately, that's the only way to find out.  Maybe I don't need it now.  I'm sure at some point</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's right, correct, either your depressive illness is chronic where the antidepressant works every day or it's what we call paroxysmal like a seizure or like a migraine that you percolate along fine and then boom you get hit with 1.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like a migraine.  If it's going to be paroxysmal, then without antidepressants you're more vulnerable to going into 1 when the migraine or seizure or, you know, when the event hits you're more vulnerable but I think it's worth testing it, you know, seeing what happens as you percolate along.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The only thing I haven't cut out is the Alprazolam.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What about the Dexedrine?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't taken that 1 in ages.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Once in a blue moon when I got a bad nights sleep or something and have to perform that day, I'll take 1.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And how much Alprazolam, how much Xanax are you taking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm taking a half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Every night?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Once in a blue moon I'll take a whole instead of a half if for some reason I think it's going to be a bad night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How's your, how do you feel most of the time?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Your mood is okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I put on 10 pounds since my surgery.  I finally got back to the - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you eating too much?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, there was no exercise, I just cut off my [INAUDIBLE] such as it was.  I'm sure I eat too much also sometimes</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you crave sweets or carbohydrates?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have a terrible sweet tooth.  I like food, I like it a lot.  Sometimes it's - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not exercising at all now?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's a craving.  Well, I went back once about 10 days ago and I haven't been back.  My feet, my foot, the specific area where I had the surgery, the bunion is gone, you'd never know it had been there.  The hammertoe is gone, the toe is still a bit numb and the foot is still a bit swollen.  Every time I see him he says it'll be next month, now he says it could be several more months before the swelling goes down.  I have no pain in that area but there are days when both feet hurt when I'm walking.  It's like hour by hour, like right now I'm fine.  Usually if I sit for a couple hours and then get up and start walking, they'll hurt.  Sometimes it'll walk itself out.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have swelling in your lower extremities?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not that I'm aware of.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> In your calves?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No that's [INAUDIBLE], it's sort of where I was a year ago, there's no specific pain, it's a generalized pain, it comes and goes.  I don't [INAUDIBLE], I'm walking.  I think I'm at a point of lower expectations.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lower expectations</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Of living with it and not agonizing over it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Getting old ain't fun.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What's the saying, getting old ain't for sissies.  I think it was [NAME OTHER], I'm not sure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I've got 2 major traumas coming, my 50th birthday at the end of the year and my reunion in June.  My college roommate, he's going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where did you go to college?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Harvard.  Now I admit the 25th reunion was sort of fun up to a point, [INAUDIBLE] but they figured it out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you make a pass at anyone?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No but it's nice, the gay group has a dinner at the [INAUDIBLE] the night before graduation and the dorm just like instant reversion.  I have to write an essay for the 50th anniversary, what have I accomplished in the last 5 years since the last one.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They had 1, 5 years ago</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, but they put out a book</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I only went to the 25th and I have to have a picture taken and that's something, it bothers me but not that much.  I feel I've definitely aged a lot in the last 6 months.  It works out because say oh you've lost weight.  What are you talking about, I've put on weight.  I realized my cheeks have started to sink.  I'm at that stage in life where that happens. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That happens.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It makes me look older.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well the sagging starts early in life, it's just a slow gradual process.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not just sagging, it's sunken.  I mean my cheeks were puffier and now they're [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't see it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To honest, I've known you since '97, 10 years, and you look about the same as you always did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> When the 50th person says you've lost weight when I've put on weight, I finally figured it out.  I have to have picture taken so that so much fun now.  Really nothing is getting to me too much which is sort of getting to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You have kind of a cool calm attitude about everything.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Labor Day weekend I got a hospital bill for almost $5000 from 2 years ago for an endoscopy which turned out to be a mistake, thank God.  Little things like that can eat me alive, big things I can handle but, you know, I did have a thought, you know, when you have a life threatening illness you say I'm so glad I'm alive and I'll change my behavior.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like for 2 seconds maybe.  I'm right back to doing the same things I did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You aren't doing such bad things.  It's not like you're, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think I've been less compulsive lately and spending less time on [INAUDIBLE].  Maybe it's just because I've been busy but I've arranged to be busy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Busy doing what?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Classes started this week.  I'm co-leading a course on documentary films and the first class was yesterday.  [INAUDIBLE] and I'm taking 2 courses in the program.   </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're co-leading meaning you have to come up with.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Design the curriculum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And it's a tag team, you talk about some things and then you're - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're alternating sessions, that seems to work best.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh so you take a whole session.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this is the third time I've done it and that way works best.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was this your session.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> First of all, [INAUDIBLE].  This was my session.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And so what did you talk about?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The first 1.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have to introduce, you have to.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well they had a film assigned to walk, [INAUDIBLE].  Here comes the cough.  There's a little bit of phlegm but it won't quite come up.  But it's a documentary film, I had free associating, wrote words on the board and then my partner wrote them down and will give them back to them at the end of the session, at the last session.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How many people in the class?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Forty-seven.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I enjoy it and I'm taking a class on the fairy tale, on human origins, [INAUDIBLE].  This is part, all the program I'm in, [INAUDIBLE].  They're only paying $270 to take a new school course on the novel now, like I've had 2 sessions of that so far.  I loved the first novel, hated the second novel but it's going to be a lot of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> What was the novel?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was really, it's a novel that starts on 9/11.  A couple in Manhattan who were in the midst of a horrible divorce, the husband thinks the wife is on the plane from Newark and the wife knows that the husband works in the south tower, but at the end of the day, he's sort of sorry to see the other, that's the beginning.  It's called Before It's [INAUDIBLE] of a Country, [NAME OTHER], it's like [INAUDIBLE], so it's called [INAUDIBLE] by [NAME OTHER], nobody over 35 should be forced to read it.  So I'm dropping out of reading group for the term.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know how you get.  You have a  week to read the novel for this course?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Plus do the reading for 2 other courses, plus every other week prepare a lesson.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll be busy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not having a sex drive is really good for your brain.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I think that's [NAME OTHER], remember the [NAME OTHER] where [NAME OTHER]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> The contest?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, he had to turn his sex drive, if he turned off his sex drive he became brilliant or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Did you see the show, tell me you love me?  It's a new show on cable about 4 couples and their therapist who is Gene Alexander who you last see going down on her husband, it's 1 sex scene after another.  I mean, I'm not easily shocked but</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Let me get back to some of my questions.  You're sleeping decent except for this damn cough, correct?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Normally I get up once or twice during the night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just to go to the bathroom.  No suicidal thinking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You don't feel hopeless or helpless?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you suspect that your memory and concentration are better now that you're off the Wellbutrin?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I would like to think so but I don't see any evidence of it.  There have been a couple days lately where I've been tripping over words and that was 1 of the symptoms that I blamed on the Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I assume once it's out of your system it's gone.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's gone in a day.  So now it's just what we call benign senile, benign forgetfulness of aging, not the senile type.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, it's not even the forgetfulness, it's having trouble getting the words out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Word finding or word expression?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Word expression, stumbling over words, getting criss crossed.  There's forgetfulness too but that's a different issue.  I seem to have a little more trouble retrieving a word or a name like what actor was in that movie, I can't think of it and 5 minutes later it'll pop into my head.  My circuits are slower. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Xanax you're taking is really just for sleep, it's not for anxiety.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not anxious at all, correct?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not usually.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you're not sad and you're not irritable.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm always irritable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you, are you crotchety?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's forever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you angry at something?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't take much. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do suspect you're angry about something specific?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I get angry at people's, at what I perceive as people's stupidity.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like people standing the doorway</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can't tolerate people walking in front of you too slowly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, things like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Just kind of general intolerance?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that has increased with age?  You've always been like that?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe a little but I think my suppression of it has improved; I don't fly off the handle.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, all right, so Cymbalta was a total bust and Wellbutrin is gone just because we didn't know what it was doing and you come to me now about the same as you've always been on or off meds, right, and we've done this before, right?  It is funny, I mean just looking at the date, July 16 '97 is when you came here first but I knew you before then from the hospital.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right, the testosterone [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So we're, we're, we're together for more than a decade.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] relationships.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I remember in the beginning, that was the [NAME OTHER] saga, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, the [NAME OTHER] saga.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The [NAME OTHER] saga, right, I mean the [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] saga with, yeah, I still have that; you might want to see some of these letters because I still have them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Burn them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is he still</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's sort of sad.  His mother must have had a mini stroke, suddenly called him one day crying, she was going to drive to the library and she could remember where it was, for about a month or 6 weeks now it's been an issue.  In fact, in my suggesting, the [INAUDIBLE] is having a [INAUDIBLE] on taking care of your older parents.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's an increasingly common issue.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it's, apparently he doctors have been horrible, a total lack of sympathy, really very little information.  I keep urging him to go, to find a gerontologist or something who can really size her up and make adjustments</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where is she?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She lives in [INAUDIBLE] and she has a place in Florida in the winter like all the other Jews.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Up at Columbia we have a very good evaluation service for memory, people with memory problems.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Meanwhile, she plays bridge, she goes to lunch with friends, so I don't know how much of it is real and how much is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So there's a wonderful assisted living place, they're called [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So they, he went to see, I think his sister came down from Boston and took her to see.  They both agreed it's lovely but she doesn't feel she's ready to go and they very cleverly arranged for them to pick her up 1 day and bring her over for lunch and a bridge game and they couldn't get a bridge game together and she said she was the youngest 1 there which is 81, I somehow doubt but this has been weighing heavily on him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, does he have a partner these days?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's going with [NAME OTHER] who I.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Don't like?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I try, I really try.  It's not that I dislike him, it's just like he's from another planet.  We have like 2% common interest.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what does he see in him?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For [NAME OTHER], that's a step up.  I mean his last relationship was with a Puerto Rican short order cook, this guy is at least a professional.  He's not an engineer but he does some kind of job as a contractor and he's no dummy.  He's a diamond in the rough, he's part Welsh, part Jamaican, part Chinese, part, he's a mongrel.  He doesn't look white, if you see him you think he's properly Hispanic. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> He's got a tint.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's got very wavy hair and apparently he is prodigiously endowed which I'm sure has nothing whatever to do with [NAME OTHER]'s interest. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  All right, so what do we do about your treatment?  You're not into psychotherapy, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've been there, done that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And even this, I mean not being on meds and not having much of a treatable</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Unless there's some new medication</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I've given you everything.  I've given you everything there is.  Actually, the 1 thing we haven't used is this patch, [INAUDIBLE] patch.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've never heard of it.  I'm coping, maybe that's the best I can hope for.  I'm not sad.  I can work myself up into being sad.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I really try.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have a low grade, I guess it always was about the flatness or, you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well there have been deep valleys too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right but we haven't seen that for a while but that may have been because we had you on meds.  You won't know about the deep valley, whether you're out of that or -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I could just be between valleys</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Or between paroxysms, you know, like a migraine or a seizure.  We don't know, we have to just watch.  The key thing for you to know is my phone number.  If things go downhill, call me right away.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think [INAUDIBLE] Wellbutrin sitting here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think Wellbutrin is going to, if you fall into a deep 1, I don't think Wellbutrin is going to pack the punch.  I think you're in remission now.  You're in a decent place and if you stay this way for a while, that's fine.  As you know, I always love seeing you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Me too.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you don't have to come, now that you're off meds you don't have to come.  Stay in touch and you certainly can make an appointment, just almost like going to the regular doctor every 6 months or - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What about the Alprazolam, is it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll give you as much as you want, that's fine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But no harm just taking it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No I don't know why but for me that's my security blanket, that's the 1 I'm afraid to give up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, don't.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Because without a good nights sleep like last night</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> For someone like you, that's fine.  I mean a lot of people are on Ambien.  I like it</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I like Xanax better, it's clean, it's in and out at night so you're not groggy at all in the morning.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.  You could toy with backing off on it and see how that goes but you don't have to, you don't have to.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That I'm running low on, that's the only prescription.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, so let me write that out for you and then, you know, stay in touch and come back at your leisure or at your convenience.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It will be good to know that the option is there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm always here.  If things go the wrong way, no problem, even a medical thing, you know, just feel free anytime. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I haven't coughed once. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well you did once.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Only once.   It's [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Microwaves in the air, because that happens right before the phone rings a lot so that much be the way the computer reacts, so someone else must have called somewhere.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Happy New Year by the way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], what did you do for Ros Hashana?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I went to my nieces, that's another story.  [NAME OTHER] sister who just got separated.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's not the most cheerful.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The Xanax I give you 0.5, 0.5?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I break it in half.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So maybe you break the 1 in half.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe that's it.  I think it's orange and it's like diamond shaped.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well I have in your chart somewhere between 0.5 and 1, so I think I gave the 1's.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think you give me the 1's and I break them.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you break them in half.  You can have the [INAUDIBLE] but I need you to sign these 2, where the 2 X's are.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So try this instead of the </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can have the pen, that's</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh this is </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> My token of appreciation.  All right, Xanax 1 mg, I'll write that you take 5 a day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I don't think I've ever written for that much but</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I think you did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Either 3 or 4.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's a big difference.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's why they last for like a year.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, well these will have to because I won't be seeing you much and these we can't call in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We can't refill so if they start running out, just give me a call.  All right, so 5 p.o. q. day, 150</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> At the end of the year or at least 10 years, it's hard to believe.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well remember, I will never ever abandon you.  I'm here no matter what.  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Listen, happy birthday, when is your birthday?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> December 28th.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Happy birthday, Christmas time, all the best.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you know</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was an easy fast, [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's been a pleasure.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's been a pleasure.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You may not have seen the last of me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll see you again.  Bye bye now.</p>

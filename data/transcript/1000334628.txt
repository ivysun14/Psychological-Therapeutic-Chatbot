<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I was thinking, well, several different things again.  But, (clears throat) uhm, part of it was how I felt yesterday at the end of, ah, the time and the fact that it took me so long to get my things on.  My reaction was not quite the same as the other time when you'd had to wait for me.  And I don't think I was feeling, this time, that there was something that I was doing that was intimate and that you were watching but that I just, because I couldn't get things on quickly, I felt very clumsy and then annoyed at myself and in a hurry, anyway, as I always do.  But it was more just feeling awkward or clumsy and it didn't seem to be quite the same as the first time.  And for some reason when I left I just thought, the next time I have a lot to put on, I'm just going to pick it all up and put it on outside because I don't like feeling that way and I don't see any reason why I should.  But I'd never thought of that before.  Or I'd never thought that I could do it before.  Because I can't believe I never thought of it but if I did, I must have rejected it as something I couldn't do. (Pause)</p>

<p>But it was almost like what (clears throat) I said I did the first time, that I made myself, that I thought I should make myself stay here and go through it until I did it enough times so that I didn't feel that way anymore.  Which is an attitude I have about other things.  I think I mentioned that I felt, I feel sort of that way about going to this dance of my sister's and I felt that way about doing other things too.  (Pause) And I can't think of anything specific right now but in connection with this attitude, I know that there are times when I am very inflexible about what I could be doing.  And I will make myself go through with something that is unpleasant and that there is no reason that it has to be unpleasant, that I could change it if I wanted to make it a different way.  I, and I, as I say, I can't think of anything specific but I know I've had this feeling.  And then somebody else might come along and I would think of them in my same position and that they should be doing things the way I did.  And they may not like it that way and, and they'll just change it.  And I'm always surprised if they do, that some, some reason I just thought, I think of things in a very inflexible way. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I, connected with this is something that I either thought yesterday evening or else during yesterday's time here or some other time here, but of my mother and how inflexible she is about a lot of things (clears throat).  (Pause) And I was just doing something I've done a lot with my parents.  It's really kind of strange, uhm, and I don't really like to think what it probably means about me.  But my sister who is in PYKK now is getting married soon.  And my parents are going over for a week to see her, (clears throat) be there at the wedding ceremony.  And for some reason I just began to think of what if something happened and they were killed in a plane crash and they didn't come — in any case, they didn't come back.  And then, how would I feel.  And I've done this a lot.  And then just trying to imagine how I'd feel.  And I'm always trying to imagine that I'll feel quite upset.  And in a way it's almost as if I'm trying to make myself not need them and that by doing this I'm trying to see how upset I'd be so that then I can convince myself that I really don't need them.</p>

<p>(3-minute silence) I don't know whether it's thinking of that that made me feel this way, but I, I feel sort of that I can't really settle on anything today, anyway.  But thinking of my parents in that I way, I could tell that my mind was just kind of going away from it and I'd start thinking about the day and just almost anything.  And I began to get a sort of an unpleasant feeling in my stomach.  And then it just would make me feel angry.  And if I could get angry at anything in particular, I would.  And I was thinking of the fact that I had been sort of annoyed with my assistant this morning, mainly because I was feeling a similar type of feeling in me as I've been feeling many days lately.  And it was sort of being angry at myself that made me be annoyed at her.  But it also made me think of the fact that sometimes when MSCZ and I are having trouble and (clears throat) and we might even be talking about it and trying to get at whatever it is, although I can see now we probably won't be able to just by our talking about it.  But I'll begin to feel very uncomfortable, practically s—, a stomachache.  I don't know how else to explain it.  And then I'll just get annoyed and very restless and nervous and I'll probably start a fight if we aren't already having one because it just somehow takes my mind off whatever is disturbing me.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And you get over your stomachache?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I do that?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I, I suppose I do for a while because then I just think about the fight that we're having.  And, in, in a way, it's a release of — I mean, it's sort of a destructive way to release my feelings, whatever they are.  Because I, because when I feel this way and I'm not really feeling it very strongly now — but sometimes when I do, I just feel so tight.  And I just want to break things and hit things or whoever is around (laughs) that I feel I could get away hitting.  And I just feel very destructive, then. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was thinking, too, that sometimes when I'm feeling angry for whatever reason, probably usually it's connected when I'm feeling unhappy with myself, but then there is some, some one thing to set off my anger, I am afraid often of what I will do if I do let myself go and physically strike something or somebody.  And I thought of well, last night one of our cats kept getting at something that she wasn't supposed to.  And usually I don't do too much to them but if I do hit her, the cat, then sometimes I can't stop.  I, you know, I do stop but I have this feeling, almost, as if I'm not going to stop.  And it made me think, too, of the time, one time when I was angry at my brother and, again, I just get going and I'm almost unaware that I'm still doing whatever I'm doing to him.  Or was unaware of whatever I was doing to him.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Is that the time you took the trip?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.  But then there was another time too, I think, when I — I think I mentioned this too — when I said I wanted to kill him and then I got very upset afterwards.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You were hitting him then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so, I don't know if I ever, — I probably did hit him.  And that one I can't remember if I actually hit him — I think I had a stick or something.  I don't know, it gets kind of confused.  Because then I know there was a time when he had something and was hitting me, so I, I don't remember if on the time I threatened to kill him I was able to stop myself before I started to do anything to him.  I think right after I said that I was so horrified that I'd said it aloud or that I even felt it, that I stopped.  (Pause) And I think I used to be that way when I'd fight FYC, too.  So that (clears throat) even though she was bigger than me eventually I was able to beat her, or make her cry or make her feel that she'd had enough.  Because I wouldn't even feel what she was doing to me. (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Something else that (clears throat) has come to my mind again and I, it came to my mind once before but I selected to say something else that also I was thinking about.  And I think I must just be avoiding saying it.  I find it very hard to talk about.  But, uhm, it's the feeling I have toward my touching my vagina or having MSCZ or having anything there.  And also I th—, I don't know whether having that accident had anything to do with it, but I've always felt that I must be very ugly and scarred and I used to, when I was first old enough to even think about using tampax I was very afraid to because I thought something would happen.  I'm sure I thought I'd open up whatever the cut had been.  And even now, if I use it I feel very uncomfortable at times.  And I think whatever the feeling is, is I have about it often makes me resist any intercourse because I'm associating the same thing there, too, whatever it is.</p>

<p>ANALYST: When you say, "Whatever it is,"  you mean you find it hard to describe the feeling at your vagina?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well, something to do with it, just it must look ugly and it must feel ugly.  And if I'm using tampax I don't like the feeling when I'm having to put it in.  And when we were first married I was fitted to a diaphragm and I found that very unpleasant putting that in.  And I just don't like to touch myself at all down there and I haven't liked MSCZ to, either.  But be—, beyond that, I can't believe that he would like to because I keep thinking it must be very unpleasant for some reason.  (Pause) And I think I was so curious to know that one time on the pretense that I was trying to know more about using tampax, I tried to look, using a mirror.  And it re—, wasn't too much I could see but whatever I could see I just thought was very ugly.  And I didn't want to ever look again.  And I can't, couldn't imagine anybody else wanting to look.  And it's always made, any times I've gone to the doctor to be checked, I've always found, just to have a physical, I've found that very hard.  But I would suppose any woman would.  And this, actually, this thought of actually having a baby and the position you're in has bothered me terribly.  And, again, wondering how can anybody who's not under any kind of drug or anesthetic or anything stand being in that position and knowing other people can look at her.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What is there about the position?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, right when you're giving birth, when your legs are apart.  And (pause) and that's actually the point when MSCZ wants to have intercourse that I find hardest.  If I can just get beyond putting my legs apart then I'm often all right.  But I can't often do that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you feel now, as you tell me these things that were so hard to say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a minute ago I was thinking more of, almost the feeling of repulsion, that I was feeling it right now as I do at times like when MSCZ might want to touch me or when he's asking to have intercourse or when I have touched myself.  It's, it, it, I don't know, it doesn't bother me so much once I've said it as, as far as feeling embarrassed or —</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't sound especially embarrassed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I must do something, too, about when the time is up, sort of shutting off what I've said to myself so that I don't have to think of it if I'm looking at you, just say goodbye.  And I've also often thought that I want, I've wanted to be sure that I do look at you when I say goodbye and it's probably obvious.  But I'm, I've been afraid that if I don't, then I'll get so embarrassed I won't be able to.  Except there've been times when I thought I'd feel embarrassed to look at you and I haven't.  So I don't know, it's, it's worse getting ready to say it than it is after you've said it, I guess.  (Pause) Although I think sometimes telling about intimate things between me and MSCZ bothers me still.  And I think the things that I have to say about myself that bother me the most are ones where I'm afraid of it will make me look like when I say them and that I'm sort of afraid of my own image, I suppose in your eyes. (Pause)</p>

<p>And sometimes I think — maybe I'm using this one as an excuse not to say things — but I'm afraid I won't know what words to use.  And I know I'm afraid of making a mistake and therefore appearing ridiculous again; it's the same thing.  But it is almost, that part is almost like what I'll do when I'm in another type of situation and I feel particularly unhappy about it or uncomfortable, uhm, even it's just a social situation.  And I try to think of the right way things should be or the right way I should act.  And this would be my trying to know the right word so that I do the right thing too. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I know I do have this feeling about just about everything unless I'm, I'm so much in control of the situation that I can judge it better but that there is only one right way to do things.  And if I'm to be acceptable to anyone, whoever is involved, that I should do it the right way or else I won't be acceptable.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You notice that your thoughts go from feeling, eh, repulsion that you were describing when you think of your vagina and touching yourself, to the much more general feeling of, you're not acceptable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) The thing that occurs to me now is in a way I've always known that this is how I think.  (Pause) Although it's stronger.  I haven't thought that I was unacceptable.  I've believed that I was unacceptable.  And that was, or is why I guess I want to withdraw from things so much sometimes, or from people or from situations.  Because the tension that I feel trying to judge what is the right thing or to guess or feel what is the right thing gets so much that I just get worn out from doing it and then I have to withdraw more to kind of restore myself or, I don't know, just break the tension for a while.  And doing that just often makes me feel, after a while, very angry at myself or discontent with myself and then I'll sort of push myself out again.  It just makes me think again on how the last few days I've been feeling just about my teaching and at school and how unhappy I've been (clears throat) with the way things are going and the way I've been feeling toward my class.  And, I don't know, I've just generally felt sort of hectic and confused about what it is I'm doing and uncertain that I am doing anything or that I'm doing what I should be.  And I've been aware of the fact that so often on the spur of the moment some idea will strike me.  And then, when I try to think of it again, I can't get it at all.  And, I don't know, it just makes me feel like I'm going nowhere.  And what I'd like to do right now (laughs), I think, is just withdraw from teaching for a while. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was thinking too about some of the pressures that (clears throat) I know I'm feeling right now to make me feel this way.  Except for maybe thoughts I'm contending with that come from being here, they're sort of distracting me from teaching.  And they're all things, but other than that they're all things that involve doing something that on my conferences.  And I have to write something for my course I'm doing.  And it happens to be something of fairly personal nature, which I find particularly hard when it's course work.  And then this dance with my sister.  And they're all coming at about the same time.  And they're all things that I have to try to assess what the other person expects and, or for the dance, what other people are going to be doing and this fear I have that I'll be different. (Pause)</p>

<p>And, and, the thing I have to do for my course, which probably makes me most nervous about it, is that I have to go beyond things we've been doing and things I've been reading to other ideas I might have.  And so that in a way it's depending upon my creative thinking or my ability to relate one idea to many others.  And again, I suppose in a way, I, I don't have any confidence in my ability to do this.  And I'm afraid that what I do do when I get way off from books and reports and things other people have thought, I'm just afraid that what I write will look ridiculous or silly, that it won't really be anything worth putting down.  And I know with the conference reports I'm afraid of not just getting at the central things that were discussed.  Because it isn't my habit to weed out from all the other things what was centrally involved.  I put everything in so that I'm sure to cover it.  And, and I know that my supervisor doesn't want that, she wants it very concise.  (Silence) It's funny.  I was just noticing again — I've noticed this a lot before — but when I look at the walls very often some of the flecks and the markings make a face for me.  And I never can find the same face again after I've — I mean I can find it again the same day but I never can find it again another day.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What's the face look like today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It looks like a boy with 1 eye closed and 1 eye open, sort of a sad mouth.  Sometimes it's just an animal.  But I was just looking for some of the others and they just aren't there at all.  (Pause) I always feel very silly when I mention something like that, too.  And I think it must be — well I don't know exactly why — but just from the little bit I've read about psychology, I know that sometimes you can tell something about people from what they see in just a pattern.  And so I always feel as if I'm making it up.  Or, I don't know, it just makes me feel uncomfortable, anyway, to say it. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking of the, something else that, at school I might be inclined to read too much into some of the things the boys draw but (clears throat) one boy drew himself with his father and (clears throat) this is a boy whose parents have separated.  And he drew the father in great detail and then he didn't do anything to the boy.  And, and he didn't put any face on the boy.  And so I thought of this as being very significant.  And then another boy, when he was drawing his family, drew all the different members of the family except for his father.  And then he just had this head and it was a huge head with the mouth wide open, looking just awful and sh—, obviously shouting.  And it was (laughs) just sort of floating over everybody.  And it made me laugh because it just seems like if, if I had been completely honest and I were his age, able to be drawing like that, that's what I would have done, too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

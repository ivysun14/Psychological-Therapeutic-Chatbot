<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, let's see. I think my life is being taken over by homework (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And work. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's really frustrating because like Jeremy will go to bed and I'm doing work, and I feel bad because</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, I ideally if—you know, if I knew how to do the homework, or—you know, it's just really hard. And you know, even the simp—and because I work alone, because it's hard to work with students at school at my disposal because often they finish at wee hours of the night -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and the bus does—stops running at 1:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So—so a lot of the times, I'm doing these problems by myself. I did figure out—I've been going to class like more and getting more engaged, and actually things are like making more sense. So that I do like about it. The homework is super hard, but I just—it's really tough for me, because I got—I don't feel like I'm a person because I don't have time to dote on Jeremy -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —like I used to. And I feel bad because I feel like, you know, like—yeah, I see him over breakfast. [00:01:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see him, you know, at least for an hour at dinner, which I guess is—you know, I guess that's what the sort of modern—I mean, people get busy and it's hard for me to like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is he unhappy with the amount of time you guys have together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm unhappy and I feel bad because like—I mean, I guess he was just joking, but he said, "Suse, do you love me?" And I said, "Yes." I was like, "Why did you ask that?" He's like—he's like, "I don't know." He's like, "I just meant it to be sort of funny."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Well, are you sure?" And he's like, "No, I just wanted to be sort of funny." I mean, it was after, you know, we were—made dinner together and sat down. And so I guess maybe that's the thing is that—like, I guess, maybe just my focus hasn't been on him. Like I guess, maybe I was almost too preoccupied with everything. Like—like down to what I should wear, what I should -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —think or even eat for lunch. And now like I'm just sort of like—you know, I'm getting by with—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I guess I'm sort of starting to sneak my own habits in. Like, you know like if I—maybe I'll stay up really late because I would prefer to finish the homework assignment than not have it, not have anything to turn in or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know—or like just—I'm eating lunches that are like smaller, and I found out that having a smaller lunch, but maybe eating like a snack later is better to prevent my food coma. [00:03:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I would just sack out and like I—I can't be doing that. And I also found like in the morning I just—I go back to bed really easily and like, you know, I've been working at home because it's kind of—it's convenient but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I'm going to try sort of—because I went to ballet this morning and I haven't taken a nap. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I sort of see that maybe I just need to go—get up and get moving before I go back to bed. And like I don't fall asleep and a stay a little—and I stay much more alert and I don't have to have this looming, "Maybe I'll go to dance tonight," -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"maybe I won't." You know? So I mean, it's hard because school doesn't offer their dance classes in the morning. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just do it at weird—either really late at night, like 7:30 to 9:00. Or like 4:00 in the afternoon and that's really kind of a -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's inconvenient for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—it's actually inconvenient for a lot of people -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it seems because that class is not very occupied. And so that's one thing. And the other thing that's been—I didn't go to ballet classes this week because I just didn't want to put up with the drama of it. Like I mean, I just realize like I look—I realized last Friday when I took the morning class, that you know, the steps—I had once known them, but because I don't practice the more advanced steps, I sort of forget them. And with the current intermediate class, I just—I mean, it just makes me so mad how—I mean, I used to not think about it and it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: —sort of just brought people together of all different levels in that intermediate; people that have been in beginning for a while or people that have done dance for a long time, but maybe aren't professional quality. And it's just really sort of—it just—it's frustrating. It's frustrating in two parts. On Tuesday, the class tends to be a little slow and the teacher is cold, and—cold personally. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I always feel like—like I was being punished by her -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and—because she was one of the people determining where people went -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in the levels. And the other thing is on Thursday, I like that they have guest teachers, but I get annoyed when the ballet girls come because like, first of all, the whole reason why they split us into distinct levels is because the ballet girls complained that their class was being slowed down -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —by people that aren't advanced. That's understandable. But then why are they taking an -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —intermediate class? You know, I just—I sort of feel like maybe—maybe I'm offending them. [00:06:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or you know, like I—I don't know what their deal is and it's very sort of emotionally exhausting. And here, you know, I—I go to the—I went—twice this week, I went to the Ballet Theatre, which is down the street. And like, you know, there's people in there—like there's on mon—on Monday and Wednesday nights, there's a guy who's—I guess he is now a female, but (laughs)—I mean, there's people like that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —who are just kind of sloshing around, and then there's people that are like really good. And somehow, you know, regardless of what our levels are, the teacher seems to bring us all together. And so we can smile and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, have fun. And I really—you know, I enjoy that and I sort of see that—you know, for a while, I was really motivated because I thought, "Oh, you know, I'm going to get recognized for improving."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And they're going to move me up." And that never happened. And then I just sort of—just grew frustrated -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —with just sort of—the rigidity of the structure and also the subtle—the—it seems like a double standard on their part that the Harvard ballet girls -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —not only do they get advanced classes, they can take the intermediate classes, with the guest teachers, and they have rehearsals for, you know, special dance opportunities with their company. And it just seems like all the resources are pointed towards them -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and not for me. And now I actually can see why people get upset or like, you know, can say, "Tax the rich." [00:07:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, maybe it's a sort of simpler thing (laughs) you know, I sort of—I sort of feel like—I—I just get very—it's like a very loaded subject -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and just this week I just didn't have the mental energy for it, and it's kind of a shame because their classes are cheap, but you know, if you're not having fun or improving -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, you know or—or learning new things, I mean, maybe I am—improving slowly, but I wasn't really learning any new thing. And the studio's very small. And so, I mean, I don't know what to do with that. And they have a feedback -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and they're like, "Oh, tell us how you feel," or, "Tell us what you think." And I'm just holding off on that because I'm just so enraged, but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —Jeremy said he would read my response because you know, I keep on—I would even—like originally, like maybe a month ago, I would say, "Oh, the teachers are good." [00:08:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, in the one sense, the—no, the teachers aren't very good. They're not very—I mean, actually, one of the guest teachers was really nice and interactive and he brought all of us together. But then that was the—where the ballet girls were in. And then he brought in someone else -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to be—because he was actually doing performances now, so he can't make it. But the other lady, she was always sort all—she's always been sort of cold. I was like I—I don't know whether it's—I don't know how to effectively put in everything that I want to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because, you know, normally you have to do like constructive criticism. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know, you sandwich your criticism in between two -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, all I could say like is just I really like how it was run in the—before. Or I really like the teacher that we had that brought many different levels together -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and where we learned new steps and—or reviewed more advanced steps and now we just don't do that. And I don't like this sort of double standard that they have, but—so anyway, I think those have been—oh, I—actually, I gave two really good presentations recently. One for my class. I actually—I made one mistake in the beginning for my class presentation, but after that though, I mean, it went—it went much better than the last time I gave a class presentation. [00:10:29] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there was a perfectionist working with us. There wasn't that time. And like we really did—we really did a good presentation. I was happy and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was better about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for one, in terms of like I was prepared for people's questions. Like I really knew—I really knew like the relevant details and it was—it was nice because like the—when I first met with the teaching assistant, like I didn't know what was the—really was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I gave really good insight on like—you know, really, you know, even though these two papers that you're present—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —you guys are presenting are different, they're really the same. They're based upon this certain protocol. And you know, it was really nice to have—he was a really good sort of clarifier. [00:11:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And from there, I sort of—you know, I was able to—and of course I did worry quite a bit about it, because there's always little details that people ask.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was actually good that I did prepare for that because there were little details that people did ask -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and the professor even laughed when—he was like, "I don't understand why the phase gate—why is it any different than the CNOT gate." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like, "Well, this experimental group really is pedantic about citing their—or like, you know, using their phase gate," like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —"or like talking and differentiating it from the CNOT gate". And the professor laughed, because he's like, "Well, you know, it isn't something to shrug off." But it was funny because like I just—you know, I felt like I actually learned something. I didn't feel that sort of like, "Oh, why didn't I read it?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, because I did spend a long time reading the paper over, reading it over, reading other things over. I mean, there was one thing, the one thing that I messed up in the beginning was something I just overlooked and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —misunderstood the teaching assistant or teaching—teaching fellow. But—and—and I also gave a good—or I mean—yeah, I gave two group presentations recently. I can't remember when I last saw you whether I gave—but I basically—I had worked really hard to do a—oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I—I did tell you about that, the molecular stretching one. [00:12:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That went well. But I gave a recent just sort of results summary, and it took a long time, but my advisor got really excited about my results. And he's like, "Well, we should work on publishing that soon."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I got—I got really excited, because I was just like—you know, it was just one graphic -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that I wasn't showing that, you know, just sort of—and I guess I cleaned up my other ones. But it was just really weird how—I don't feel like I've been like applying myself to my research because like I've been working on homework, and trying -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —to keep up with lectures (laughs), which is sad, but I guess when I—I mean, you know, having that sort of space to you know run calculations in the background and—I mean, I guess I do do research if—if I gave two presentations within two weeks. [00:13:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two hour—hour long, hour and a half presentations, so—so I do have stuff. It just—you know, it's just—it's just—it's sort of like never ending (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's hard because like I sort of feel like—Jeremy is like, "Well, I'm going to bed." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have infinite amounts of work to do still?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like—it—I mean, I actually feel like a student now, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, like I'm not—I don't have really time to do my hair and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and sometimes when homework's due, I don't shower for a couple of days, because I don't know. And like it's so like—these are like stupid things. I don't know why I don't like—why I'm so confused. I mean, that shouldn't take me so long. And then I get upset, but then -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I just—I realize, "Well, ok, I'm trying the best I can." [00:14:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I also see that—you know, there's also books that probably could have helped me. And I checked out a couple of books.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I think it's important for you to keep in mind that this is not a class in your area.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're branching out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I thought I was—yeah. Yeah. That's exactly like—I mean, everyone—yeah. Most people in that class do quantum information. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know why—you know, it's like an introduction for -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —maybe they've done information theory or—I don't know. I don't know why they need the introduction. I would need a bigger introduction in—something a little more pedantic. Or not pedantic. Much more pedagogical -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —where there's like a—you know, a set—I mean, there's no—there's topics, but a lot of it—I mean, there's no textbook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's—there's no like problems or examples.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just—so—but it really—I mean, now I actually do know what's going on. I mean, it really is doing a good job at getting me entrenched into the literature. [00:15:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in that sense, like I think -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're learning, though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I am learning a lot. I mean, like things—I mean, like even little silly things like things that I had forgotten from undergrad, like what's the classical electric field, what's the intensity, and you know, then compare it to like quantum mechanics. And so like it's really, you know—yeah, I am learning a lot—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I think that sort of—like academically, I feel like it's definitely not stagnant (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I am learning a lot and—and I think sort of relationship-wise, I feel like in the other sense like it—there's not time to nurture that. Like I'm still—like I'm cooking Jeremy dinner tonight, we're going to go to the opera.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so I—I don't know. And we're going to a fancy dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know how like—I mean, you know, from the outside in, I see that, you know, we're probably doing more than just watching T.V. -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and not going out or seeing—you know, traveling. I mean, I guess we are doing a lot. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And holding Thanksgiving together and I got napkins—linen hand-stitched napkins with a J embroidered on it, so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I mean, obviously, I guess I do care a lot (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like it. So—but it doesn't feel that way? You said from the outside in, it looks like you're doing a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But from the inside out -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —you worry that you're not -</p>

<p>CLIENT: —well, I guess because I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —nurturing enough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it feels kind of like my heart—my heart—my heart is in to it, but not as much as like my focus, my like what—what am I doing on the bus? You know, I'm reading homework -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or I'm reading stuff, and just, you know—I'm just not—I'm trying—you know, I try to look presentable these days, but I don't look like, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I always do my hair or (laughs) always—you know, sometimes I just don't leave the house and I'm still in my pajamas and I feel a little self-conscious (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has anybody noted that that's problematic? [00:18:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and actually I think that's what Jeremy—since his brother—his boss is on vacation, I think Jeremy worked from home in his pajamas (laughs). Yeah, I—yeah, I guess—yeah, I don't think—yeah, I guess he's just worried about me sleeping enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, I get about 7—I mean, there's just—I try and I'll stay up until 2:00 and I set my alarm clock for 6:00. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just don't wake up—and so I wake up at -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Four hours is not enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I know that's not enough. So I'll just wake up at 8:00. And 6—yeah, I mean—so I think he worries about what I say that I'm going to do -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I actually don't do it, because I just can't stay up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—yeah, some of these—that's one thing that's also sort of dawning upon me is that I have—I am getting old. I mean, not—I mean, I'm still quite young.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm 27, and, you know, just like my—I feel like my bones or—or like my joints -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in terms of dance, they're just—they're not as limber. [00:19:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like so -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a big difference between old and old for a dancer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). That is true. Most dancers do retire at 27. And you know, it—it's just interesting because it—I don't see myself as an adult but -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —in a sense, that's sort of what I am—it is—it's really sort of a -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In what ways are you not an adult?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess at this point, I really am an adult. I mean—but it just feels like—I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah—it's hard to explain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I still—I guess I still feel slightly like a kid because I'm going to school—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I'm not going to bed always on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess, you know, in terms of other than that, I'm over 18.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:20:22]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—could have a job if I wanted, if I was out of school. And pretty much now I'm up to making my own decisions, so that's good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But instead—I guess, you know, it just hasn't hit me that I'm an adult. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, when I—I guess, you know, I'm around students all the time and—college students, and like, yeah, I seem older than them. But I seem more like a big sister—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or like a—nothing—or like you know even around G1s who are, my goodness, they're like 22 (laughs). They're five years younger than me, but I see them as like—you know, they're just students. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that I'm not used to being around—I—I still—I feel like I'm in like the purgatory of adulthood. [00:21:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. My sort of conception of adulthood is like 30 (laughs), where you can no longer wear hemlines past your fingertips or—no, I mean, that's not true. But—but—yeah, I mean it—I guess—yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's—it's kind of—I—I—I don't really know how to explain it but I still—I guess I still feel young, because there's like people—my teachers, and like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but I mean, in terms of like my sister, I sort of see how she like deals with things. Oh, yeah, and my sister made up with my mom. She told -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She told my mom that, you know, she eventually had to—because she had a dance student of my mom's that she was working with, and you know, after she gets her surgery, she's going to be on crutches for three months -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —so she's not going to be able to like even drive to this girl's house. And so my mom—my sister wanted to make up with my mom so that mom could continue the work that Tammy—that she was doing. And so she—they talked, and you know, she explained about what was really going on was the hip intingement, which is when your hip bone is too big for your joint and it was ripping -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: —that's what was causing the rips. And you know, my mom actually remembered that her own mother had shoulder intingement, so that—you know, so it sort of—it made sense, that, you know, these hip injuries were not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —made up. [00:23:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and it was really good because I realized, "Oh, maybe it's going to be a happy Christmas after all."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it change your dynamic with your mom and with your sister when they are warring versus -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —at peace?</p>

<p>CLIENT: —it's much easier. In one sense, like my mom's not as like excited to just talk—to talk to me, because I think—you know, she was probably excited to talk to me because she wanted to cling on to something that she did have -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —not—you know, and so, it would be really weird because like I couldn't interrelate, you know, or just like, "Oh, Tammy said this." Or like it was just—I just feel weird when people separate -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —each other. Like it's just sort of like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Puts you in the middle of having to remember and be careful of who said what and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and interrelate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, and like—I mean, and that's—yeah, so that's basically—I'm glad they actually—they made up, so then like—yeah, I don't have to worry. I mean, there is stress involved when people like—someone's not coming to Christmas. [00:24:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I mean, it's just sort of like an elephant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, it's supposed to be a holiday to bring people together and it seems like a big elephant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I am—I told Jeremy that it would be nice for him to come down and visit in Florida, because I'm normally gone for like two—two, three weeks and—and you know, he's like, "I'll look into it." But—but then I was thinking, "Well, what happens if my mom starts pressuring him?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "I don't want to put him in an uncomfortable place." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and—but you know, in—in the other sense I think it's—he's an adult and my mom's an adult and they can resolve things on their own matters (laughs). You know, it's just—I guess it's kind of too much to ask to have people just coexist -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and not like be pressuring each other or warring each other, or I don't know, maybe it's just too much to ask, or -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have to see what happens if your family can't control what they do. [00:25:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can certainly wish for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. Pray. Yeah, and I guess that's why I remember Jeremy was—he used to try and control me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —when I was in situations with his family because he was nervous about how his -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —family was going to react and you know, and he wanted only positive things, you know. And, you know, I just sort of saw that, well, you know, there's only so much that you can control or—you know, people are going to catch you off guard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't plan out every interaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I even noticed that with Jeremy's mom, like she kept on saying, "Oh, you know, can we have a day that we can sew? Can you—can we have a day that we can sew?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She kept on talking—talking about this. And it was like, "I don't even have enough time to like do my homework or sew my own stuff." [00:26:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was like and—you know, I didn't tell her this, but I just didn't answer the e-mail and like, you know, was just sort of like telling her realistically -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —like "These weekends have been really busy. You know, I'd like to have this opportunity, but right now I don't see any clear dates."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that's sort of what I eventually was able to convey, but, you know, I just realized that there's only so much I can stage myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's one thing I do like about being is that there's only so much that I can think and premeditate—or—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —premeditate, that sounds wrong (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But plan out like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —every—like protect every move. And like I just sort of see that, you know, you can try your best, and you know, sort of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —I guess the—I'm sort of seeing there's kind of a fun to life to sort of like—trying to like—you know, when you try your best, it's not your best -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —but then you've got to make it into something that is presentable or like you know, somehow -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —resolve it, or learning how to deal with maybe something you didn't handle correctly -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —because you can't be correct all the time. [00:27:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you can't. And I think, you know, when you were saying, you know, is it too much to ask, you know, for people to get along all time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can—you know, we said you could wish. You can ask, but you're diff—the difference between what you can want and what you can expect to happen -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —so yeah, you can certainly—it makes sense for you to want for your mom and your sister to get along, for—you know, for Jeremy to be able to be easy going about the amount of time you have for him or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What can you expect? That might be—you know, there may be different levels of that. And getting ready to be—to be able to accept what people can actually provide or give to you, different from what you might wish for or want from them. [00:28:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I actually told my sister that, you know, like I got up—really upset when she said she was never communicating with mom -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and then she was like, "No, no, I—I don't have to talk to you either." I was like, "Well, no." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like—you know, because I've been excommunicated before -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —and I don't -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a horrible feeling for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and you know—and I told her that, you know—well, I was like, "I can understand that you need to do what's healthy." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "But I want, you know, eventually for our family to all be happy." And she said, "You know, I want that, too." And it's interesting, because that sort of made me feel better when she wasn't talking to mom that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you knew what her ideal wish would be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which wasn't that she wouldn't be able to talk to your mother.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that she wasn't going to talk to her under those circumstances.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). I mean, at least it made me like feel better about the -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —intention, like where it was going.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, knowing the intention can often make a big difference. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think my mom knows Jeremy's intention is to eventually marry me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess that's why I get—I get scared because I'm like, "I haven't been a good significant other. Maybe he's not going to marry me." [00:29:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess that's a (inaudible)—just a normal fear.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and I think, you know, a piece of that is what your expectations are of yourself. Sometimes the expectations you set are pretty high.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if—you said he—he made—he's made some comments—he's noticed that you're a little bit less available -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —then you were in the past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it sounds like you made some changes when you moved in in an attempt to be really pleasing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And realized that those changes aren't necessarily working best for you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —and so you—it sounds like you've kind of stepped back on some of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not being a good girlfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A good significant other. Maybe the definition of what's a good girlfriend needs to be a little bit more realistic in order for you to be able to maintain it. [00:30:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's interesting, because I actually—yeah, I mean, I realized like in the beginning like we were having like dinner together every night. And like, you know, sitting at the table for two hours, and then eventually like we started to get very irritated with each other -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —or like—and you know, I just sort of sense like, "Ok, I think we just need some time to do our own thing."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that's a little bit too much intensity to keep up for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a special time when you first moved in together, and it—and that—that habit at that—at the time might have really worked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that kind of intensity -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —might not work forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that makes really—that makes a lot of sense because it—and you know, he even said the other night, he's like, "You know"—I was like—he was like, "I miss you went you're not home for dinner, but I like, you know, having a night alone to relax, to, you know, do my own thing." He's like, "It's—it's nice, you know?" And of course, like if I come home really late -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —he'll be like, "Oh, I'll cook you up something for dinner." [00:31:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And—so—and I guess—you know, and he told me how proud he was of me working -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —doing all my work. He was like, "I know it's not fun, but" -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, "You—I believe in you, you're going to get through it," and you know, so that's really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I guess he does—I guess he does understand, and I guess I need to stop feeling so bad and if I do feel bad, I guess I could spend those extra energy—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —that extra mental energy and like just do something nice. (pause) Or just—or just learn how to deal with—it's ok. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But—but one thing's for sure, I've definitely stepped—I was like—before like—I guess before the semester started, or you know last year, I was obsessed with going on e-mail and Facebook, and now like I'll (coughs) excuse me—I'll have like 12 e-mails piled up. [00:32:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm like, "Yo, what's the deal?" And (laughs) I was like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —you know, it's—it's actually kind of a nice feeling to sort of—it's kind of nice, but also kind of bombarding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's just like, "I just want to sit down and read a book."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Can you people just stop e-mailing me?" And you know, it's just interesting. I sort of—I feel now much more in jive with what it is to like work and work as a student. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I kind of fell out of that rhythm for the past two years.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Without taking classes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs). I just—it's amazing how just not taking classes can just really like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's hard not to have some external thing giving you structure. [00:33:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think (machine beeps)—working on—running low on battery—working on your research is—it's hard to maintain a focus and a structure because there's so much flexibility and freedom about when you work and where you work, and the pace. And having a class when you have set meeting times, and set assignments and deadlines helps to give you that structure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It takes up a lot of time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —but it does help to give you that focus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have learned a lot, so I—I mean I can say that I hope I get a B in this class (machine beeps) I mean, which in graduate school is equivalent to like a C or (laughs) but you know. I have learned a lot. [00:33:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And as long as I get that B, I will feel like I really earned—I earned that B (laughs). I mean, I just (coughs)—I just worked as hard as my little -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you have been working (machine beeps).</p>

<p>CLIENT: But -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It should stop beeping I guess. Oh, I've run out of space.</p>

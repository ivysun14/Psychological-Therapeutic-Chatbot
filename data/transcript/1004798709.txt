<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was reflecting on our conversation last week on Wednesday and I just wanted to make sure that I had gotten your analysis, your evaluation, what I call your read, appropriately. What I heard was that you were struck at some point by my sense of the immediacy of the emotional response rather than the 10,000 feet analysis, and this was striking to you because, Philrally speaking, my tendency seems to have been to be to shy away from this even when the emotional response is what we're looking for very deliberately. [00:01:16] The inability to access it is clearly problematic. My thought, in response, was that this rang a bell, seemed right, and my sense was that I just don't have access to that analysis, which is the most immediate reason why I can't write, and that sounds right to you. I was reflecting on that kind of clear and persuasive, concise and persuasive assessment of what's been going on in the last month and a half or so, just on a practical level, and the first thing that occurred to me was that it really means that we have to be at least a bit thoughtful about where this sense that I'm being reactive and kind of—I'm fumbling with words uncharacteristically, I think—I'm not saying "no". [00:02:50] I feel kind of vindicated, frankly, by this whole analysis. It's not about me and I've been contending this for about 38 years or so. I'm not rejecting anything. I genuinely don't have access to it. There is some kind of dichotomization of the function of analysis in all of its incarnations from the age of three or whatever to the age of 41, which really doesn't allow me access when I'm upset. I can see that there is a causal relationship that's kind of analogous to say "no" in the sense that one of the things that frequently might make me upset is if I feel underappreciated and kind of angry and pissed off and frustrated and all that, but it's not like—the whole presentation of my reaction as refusing to do something in response to being angry frankly has never computed for me. [00:04:11] I don't know. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but if we expect that there's something of the sort that we were talking about on Wednesday, then I think it has to be reevaluated a little bit and maybe the most significant thing that I could say at this juncture is it feels really meaningful to me to be able to talk about that. (chuckles) I really hate it. I've always hated it. It has been a consistent feature of everybody's analysis from A to Z, and it's so frustrating to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's always feels like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It feels like the function of analysis has fled. I want it back. I've always wanted it back. I've always felt terrible that I haven't had it. I'm not that immature. Weirdly, I kind of never have been. It's never been about, "Well, I'm going to stamp my foot," and there's some little child inside me that really just never got integrated. That's not what's going on. I like this analysis for this reason. (chuckles) Maybe one should be wary of analyses one likes too much, but I have to say I've been very, very skeptical about this assessment. It's one that has been delivered to me in various forms, including the therapeutic interaction for years and years. If it was going to be implementable, then it would have been implemented. My proposal is that we look at what we were talking about on Wednesday. I'm much more amenable to thinking about it. [00:06:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know what to do about it. It sounds a little baroque, frankly, but I would like to understand it a bit more and I feel a bit more hopeful that going down that avenue would be more productive than thinking about this little toddler who is just saying "no."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was my request. So I feel such frustration and anger at that analysis, I can't even tell you. From day one that was always the implication—that I was just being ornery. (pause) [00:07:21] It doesn't feel ornery. It feels like I'm incapacitated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think it's in part that that assessment of you is part of what shuts you down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) That's kind of a metaphysical question. Who created the creator, right? How did it start? Whatever but, yes, I do feel at this point you can imagine every time I shut down I'm like, "Oh, my God. Is this it?" (pause) [00:08:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what I'm seeing as closer at hand or clearer, it's part of what's so frustrating and feels so shameful, I think, about shutting down, is that you anticipate—and often correctly—being viewed as being oppositional or stubborn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oppositional. Yeah. I do. It's said. It's said to me openly by people that I'm in . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I'm saying—"anticipate often correctly" that that's how you're going to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sighs) Yeah. Sure. There's a feedback loop, obviously. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: All I'm saying is that it's something that kind of adds insult to injury. [00:09:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. It does. I've said so in conversation. It adds insult to injury. That's exactly what it does. And it's kind of an unwinnable argument because the response of somebody of who's pursuing this analysis is, "You're evading responsibility. If you'd only take . . ." It's just a total "no win" situation and (sighs) I don't know. I don't know. I want to fix it. I've always wanted to fix it. I've never wanted to live in a room that's just a pile of mess. Can you imagine? I hated it. It was crazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think that's diminished. I think you still do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Apparently my parents' response, as in all things, was dichotomized. My mother was like, "Just let him work it out," and my father was like, "No, we need to intervene." From the age of five onward they were having this argument. What am I going to do? I don't know how to solve it. I don't know how to solve it 35 years on, 40 years on. (sighs) Neither response is helpful to me. (long pause) [00:12:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one other feature of this then is that when you shut down in this way that you've described, when you're intellect or whatever you want to call it shuts down when you're upset in this way—and sometimes everybody else's does, too (chuckles)—nobody gets it, nobody can be of any help, people have often made it worse; but you're in a way not just robbed of your own capacity to think, but of the possibility that others can actually help you. [00:13:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. If they would listen to me, it would be easier. Even you. It took you a long time and it took this very dramatic episode to illustrate to you what was going on. You were heading in that direction, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I remember expressing great frustration over it. (sighs) I don't know. I'm not blaming. I'm just illustrating the fact that it's hard for people to understand this. It's an odd phenomenon, you know? (laughs) It's been clear to me for a long time that it wasn't just this oppositional defiant whatever. That's not it. That's not the right pattern. I don't know about people's intellect shutting down, but it's been difficult to describe this in a way that they understood. The kind of oppositional, defiant model is easier. It's a real cognitive interference. It's about settling. It's not about oppositional defiance. [00:14:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The model I have in mind at the moment, and I'm mentioning it mostly so that you correct how I have it wrong or whatever, is kind of like a short-circuit model where when upsetting things of particular sorts occur, your faculties kind of short-circuit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not events, necessarily. It's relationships.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fair enough. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tuesday, I'm in the office and I couldn't do a damn thing all day, even though I knew that I had to do things and I basically knew what I had to do, because I felt like I didn't feel integrated. I didn't feel like I was in good interactions. When Phil suddenly announced that he was leaving and he was sticking me with this program and this project that is of dubious viability to begin with, and whose salary is committed to me—meaning that I couldn't hire anybody to help—this happened. It was about the relationship. It wasn't about an event. [00:16:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's much better said and I sort of feel like you're preaching to the choir on that one. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. You've got it. (pause) It's basically a problem of social interaction. It's not like I'm angry in particular. It's not even really that I'm angry at someone in particular, although that might be a parallel phenomenon. It's more that I just don't know what I'm doing there or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you characterize the sorts of social interaction that bring this about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel disconnected, so expecting a message from somebody, having sent a message from somebody or reached out in some way and not feeling it back. That can be on a moment-to-moment level in a lecture, another kind of interaction, or even a more longitudinal way, in a workplace, what have you. It makes it very difficult for me to get good work done in an office environment because, again, as you correctly pointed out, this kind of feedback loop might hear of this and my sense of being disconnected in that I'm not being productive. [00:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is more like a panic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I guess so. I guess so. It's like a panic, except that it can compound itself over the long haul. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess that's one thing that seems panic-like about it. We're not talking about panic disorder, but for people who do have panic disorder, one of the things that can spur panic attacks is worries about getting them. So you have panic attacks when you ride the subway, so then when you go near the subway station you start to get panicky because you're worried you're going to have a panic attack. [00:18:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've only had two panic attacks in my life, so you're right that it's not. It's not like a recurring thing. I got you. What I was trying to say is that I know what you mean. Yes, and that does sound analogous in some way, except that a panic attack is a crisis that is compressed, and this is something else. This is days or weeks or months. Can you imagine having a panic attack over three months? Every day. And clearly there is some acceleration of my basic functions in the sense that it interferes with my sleep. There are certain physiological processes that are really disruptive. I think if you took my blood pressure it would be very elevated. [00:19:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's sort of a whole state of being. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a state of being and it's very consistent. It's like a consistent state of being. It's not random. It's like there are certain processes that we could probably identify—you hook me up to whatever—are consistently interfered with. (pause) (sigh) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess there's something kind of dissociative about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Clearly. We know that. I'm totally on board with that. There's something very distinctly dissociative about it. (long pause) (sigh) [00:22:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Often, disassociation relates to trauma, though that's not something you mentioned or we talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've touched on it. I don't know. There are lots of ways of thinking about trauma and there are lots of different kinds of trauma. My supposition has been that there was some kind of trauma early, but I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is your thought or fantasy about what it was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fantasy?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I'm not saying that necessarily reflects what happened, but . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's something about attachment that's clearly a trigger and that suggests to me, or at least my fantasy in relation to that strong sense, is that the way that child care was handled in this collective environment was probably very, very upsetting to me as a kid. The first childhood memory that I have—and this is completely unremarkable for a kid this age so it's not evidence, it's just whatever—is of freaking out when my parents left and just being absolutely furious with them when they came back, in a way that somehow resonates with, for example, how upset I got when Phil told me he was leaving. What I know about the way that they handled my child care is that they basically handed me out to everybody. It was like the collective underwear drawer. Somebody had child care one day and my mother would come pick me up and she would find me under the truck that the guy who ran the auto repair shop in the collective was working on. There was very little control over my immediate environment, so it totally freaked my mother out. My fantasy is that it was very upsetting to me. It was also very upsetting to my mother and both of those just . . . [00:24:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was upsetting to her was that there was so little control, so in other words . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: My dad was just saying, "This is the way it has to be in a collective," and she was like, "No. I'm not okay with this." But she would say, "Okay. Fine. I'm with the program," so this didn't end until I was 2½ when somebody decided they didn't like giving the antibiotics for an ear infection without telling my mother and gave me some homeopathic remedy leading to a massive ear infection, at which point my mother said, "I'm out." But at 2½, that's a lot of time for a child, from 0 to 2½. So in the traumatic model of this phenomenon which involves a kind of repeated sense of reality of abandonment, that's what's going on. None of what I know about is consistent with whatever physical or emotional abuse. If that is what you would be asking about in terms of trauma, I'm not aware of anything like that. That sounds unlikely to me, but you know. Different people were taking care of me and there's not much control over the environment in the places where they're taking care of me, so it could happen. But I think it's between 0 and 2½. That's my suspicion. I think this was ["baked"] (ph) by then. All my recollections are consistent with this already being a phenomenon at a very early age—the room in particular. (pause) [00:27:02] But we'll never know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's probably but not necessarily true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (sighs) (pause) [00:28:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I gather from that, one thing that's very consistent with that sort of model is the loss of connection to things or people and so, for example, we haven't talking about it this way in a while, but when you would come in and have no recollection of what had happened in the previous hour that we had met or the week or something like that and sort of try to make clear to me, which it took me awhile to get ahold of, that this wasn't just a bit of depression. It wasn't like it was just sort of foggy or you knew it was there but couldn't quite remember what it was in the sense that you might know there's a chair in a dark room. You can't see it but you kind of know it's there. This is like the room felt empty; and that is suggestive of an experience at an early enough age where you could really feel like when your mother walked away, she was gone. [00:30:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think that's right. I think the other piece that I would add is that during the same period my dad moved us six times something that, again, totally freaked my mother out and presumably totally freaked me out in ways that I think are invoked when I have to move. And yet, for a long time, I was just preserving that state of being and constantly being upset by it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Clearly these are things you've been living out a lot in your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that's the other piece, the other kind of disconnection. One of them has to do with how other people are responding to me and the other has to do with how the places around me are sometimes in concert, stable or unstable. [00:31:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I can't quite remember the chronology to this, he moved you around six times in your very early life?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We were in this squat of an abandoned nursing home. I think I was born there. I think that's the one I was born in—not born in it. I was born in a hospital. San Diego at the time was very depressed economically, which is why a lot of hippies were heading over there and this was something they would do. Then I think before I was one he moved us to a house. My mother gave me the chronology at some point of all the places, but this was a very recurring theme. My father would, for one reason or another, become uncomfortable and would move to another location. My mother was somebody who had a strong sense of need for a home, and so this was a very difficult tension in their marriage. She always said, "Yes." He would say, "I want to move out to the country, an hour and fifteen minutes away from the city by ferry boat and car," and she would say, "No. I don't want to do this. I want to live here, near the university," and then she would cave. Or he would say, "We have to move back to the city area," and she would say, "No. I don't want to do that," and then she would cave. The ace in the hole became, "Galen's not happy," so we talked about this. [00:33:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. How does that fit with living with the collective? Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) Yeah. The squat was a collective house. The houseboat was not a collective house, so there were some collective houses and some non-collective houses; and my intuition is that my mother wasn't crazy about the collective house and so my father would, kind of as a concession, move out and then be uncomfortable because it wasn't a collective house. They were all kind of in a relatively small geographical area but just had different social characteristics, I guess you could say. I don't know all that was going on. I probably could plunk my mother down in here and interview her and get a good more of a sense of that, but I don't know how important it is. [00:34:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't think it's a particular . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Six places. That's the figure that I have in my head. That's what was in my fifth-grade essay and I think I confirmed that with my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Six places in about three years?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I assume, yeah. We moved partly as a result of the blow out over this ear infection thing. We moved first to an apartment over by a restaurant and that was a rental. Then we bought a house, I think, when I was about three and stayed there through the time when my father left the collective after the weathermen chased him out and up until the time we moved to this area about two years later. My sister was born there. [00:36:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, in this house. We moved here about a year later. (pause) (sighs) [00:37:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's coming to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very random things. Our outstanding balance is what's coming to mind. I was thinking to myself, "I also have an outstanding balance with Ryan in San Diego." I was thinking to myself, "The guy outside just burped." (laughs) I was thinking to myself some not direct thoughts about this. I was thinking to myself, "I'm breathing very hard." That was difficult and I was thinking to myself, "Jennie (ph) doesn't like it when I talk about my family, and yet there's a reason why I keep going back to it." Maybe that was the most relevant thought out of all of them. (pause) [00:38:25] It's hard to know sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs) Yep. I guess what seems clear, though, is that I and perhaps we are much more on track with the model that makes sense, although a very incomplete one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why can't we say "reject" or "I approve this model"? (both laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess so. I hope so. I want it to be so. It is more consistent.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it's much more consistent with how things have always felt for you and happily it also makes a lot of sense; although, again, there's clearly a lot we don't know; for example, why the [ ](inaudible at 00:40:43) involves such a dramatic—I was going to say kind of intellectual short-circuit. It's hard to understand how some of the things are ameliorated in that I guess what seems to happen is when there are disruptions with people, the related information goes out the window, too. In other words, if there is a disconnect, like you and I haven't seen each other for a few days, the things we talked about also go out the window. I guess I wonder if it's like that with work when you're feeling disconnected from the institution, all the information that's associated with the institution, which is to say your work, goes out the window, too. [00:42:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I'll think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should finish up for now. We'll talk some more on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. See you then.</p>

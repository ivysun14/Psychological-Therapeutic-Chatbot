<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dying. Is somebody like this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not like that, he was like, okay so what you want is text support? Can I call you? Can you call me later? (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's desperate, help. I'm like, "Okay. What can do?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did I walk by you outside a few minutes ago?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah I did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was walking outside and I was like ten steps past you and I was like, "That was Debra, I think."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a good chance. Sorry I'm focused on other things lately.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no. I understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yup. So I made it through the week in the launch. Which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Including ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine it was pretty hectic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was really hectic. Including, you know working a lot more hours in a row than I normally do, which is okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many did you work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God, not like ... I normally don't work Fridays and Saturdays.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I worked the last five days in a row but I haven't quite worked like full days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I don't even feel ... I feel really guilty, I mean when everybody else put in eleven-hour days and I like worked four and five - six hour days and it wasn't, you know? But at the same time you know I do that it is rare that I come home and go to sleep so obviously I ...</p>

<p>(00:01:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That doesn't mean everybody without rheumatoid arthritis can work an eleven-hour day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I sort of snapped on a Thursday night and yelled at my husband, which I really feel bad about. I've apologized a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was just ... basically there's roughly three times a year I really need him, maybe four to sort of just be very helpful and he wasn't. And for example basically that the thing is that you know normally I have to be up and I have to be at work at like four in the morning or something like that. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. On a launch day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On a launch day, yes. So I usually kind of like take it really easy and I try to go to sleep early, that kind of thing. And (pause) you know lately he's been basically (pause) he's been renting movies because he hasn't been feeling really well. This is as of Thursday, things have changed quite a bit since I flipped on him. And basically what happened was is he'd fall asleep and he was snoring. I couldn't sleep because I was really nervous and other stuff like that, you know going on in my head. And he starts snoring a lot and tried to keep waking him up. And almost never wakes me up snoring. It's like, "I need you to stop. I need you to stop." You know it was really, really loud. And then at one point he actually rolled over on to me and kicked me and I'm just like, "Okay. Now I'm yelling and like I'm in pain, this needs to come to an end." I'm like I even told him when I wake him up, "Not your fault."</p>

<p>(00:02:49)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: However, you know, you know (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying that you have limits to how much you can handle before you lose your temper like the rest of us?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well you know it's not his fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) that's totally irrelevant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But people don't yell at their children when they have colic and they cry at night and that's not their fault either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yes they do. I mean ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I mean you're not supposed to yell at children when they have colic and they (inaudible_00:03:19).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No when it's four in the morning and you've been up ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Four in the morning is too late. I already had to be at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When it's one in the morning and I haven't slept.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible_00:03:27) the parent would probably (inaudible_00:03:28). Four in the morning and you've been up, you know most of the night for three weeks running and your kid has colic again and will not stop crying (pause) you really don't intend anything ill for your child. But like you can only handle so much and it's totally irrelevant if it's not the child's fault. I mean you know in your head once you've calmed down that the kid didn't do anything wrong or your husband didn't do anything wrong.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't realize that most people actually do yell at their children. Now I did actually ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They lose it in one way or another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was called to come over to watch the baby so that the mom could go outside and have a crying fit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she had one in the shower.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you hadn't been there (laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was actually Bernard who is now thirteen who maybe coming to our house right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (cross talk) or yelled as somebody who didn't deserve it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That was a very amusing thing, she's like, "I wouldn't ask this but I need to have a meltdown and I need you to come over and watch the baby." And I'm like, "While I'm here why don't you get a shower?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Totally reasonable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So ... but you know what I mean, you're not really supposed to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh (pause) you know it's not going to bother a colicky infant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had study (cross talk) babies for my master's thesis and doctorial dissertation and like it's not going to bother a four month old colicky baby if you yell at it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Well that's true. That's not the point. The point is I feel like you shouldn't be yelling at and I'm apologetic ... I've been really apologetic with him. I probably should have just woken him up in a non-screaming way saying I need you to stop this now. I was trying to but I was like shaking him just enough to get him awake. Enough he would stop, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:05:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I was just like at that point which my hip was crushed and I was in pain and I had already like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: One of us might need convincing that you were overloaded and lost it in a reasonable way for someone who is overloaded as you. Not me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. The worst part was that I really ... I mean the big reason why it was fueled by that was because he was already in a ... he kept ... he was in a bad place before hand and he actually said, "I'm really grumpy." Which was actually like a new thing for him to actually say he's grumpy. I'm like, "Okay. Great. Well I understand that you're grumpy but I would really like it if you went out and ..." Because he was like, "I'm coming early to help you. I'm in a bad mood." And I'm, "No, no, no, no, no. If you're in a bad mood go somewhere else."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I need to like, you know make sure I have all my stuff together and I need you for, you know between the times of 6 a.m. and 1 p.m. I need to be perfect. It sounds awful but I need not be perfect but people go to the store on launch days it has nothing to do with the product at all. You can order it and it will be delivered to your home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People go there for the people. They go there for the service, they go there for everything. And they go there for the upbeat atmosphere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah like a party.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Pretty much, yeah it is a party. And so it is also is a lot of the people who campout in front of these things. People don't realize that they're not camping out really to guarantee their spot. They're going there because that's a social event. You see certain people you only see, you know during these times. And it really is a social event.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it is like, you know having not gotten enough sleep is not an option. I have a few days a year where even if I'm in a bad mood I have to fake being extremely happy. And so I needed that time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>(00:06:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know I needed to be there at four and I need to be like actually like on stage by six, so you know it's pretty bad. And so I kind of lost it and so we ended up talking for a bit about the whole thing and like I want you to understand that this is really and I think he almost believes me now. That it really isn't that you rolled over onto me and got me hurt. It was like that was the last straw that like made me lose my temper, you know? (pause) It's hard to explain but ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's ... go ahead.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very hard for me because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) But (pause) not only does he take it so badly (pause) he did yell back a little bit. But ... which is good kind of because he doesn't normally. But also on top of it though it just (pause) I was always raised to believe that for the most part that adults don't yell. There isn't ... I mean, you know and it was almost like they would say it in an offhanded amusing way like, you know maybe if you were right next to an airplane you would be yelling but you just don't yell. There's nothing that you can say that cannot be resolved, you know at 50 decibels that will be resolved at 70 decibels or whatever, you know? And so (pause) and it sounds like it sounds like a cheating way to say that I'm not allowed to get angry but that's not what it is, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way I'm hearing is that you have to maintain a certain degree of control.</p>

<p>(00:08:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily control as much as that, I mean you could be just as angry and you can yell just as much or not supposed to yell especially not in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is the matter at yelling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I live in Dartmouth. I have people live up stairs from me. I shouldn't be yelling at one in the morning.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean because you'll wake them up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean doesn't stuff happen sometimes?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean when was the last time you yelled?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my neighbors don't like it when they hear the alarm go off at ... you know before 5 a.m. too. They can hear that so they obviously heard the yell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Different like (pause) so like you're concerned about having woken up the neighbors, that's the thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that but I mean like it's the part where you get to the part where you get so angry that (sigh) ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I've got to think you don't like to be (pause) you are not completely out of control but out of control to the extent you were that you yelled which you don't like to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I can imagine that but maybe ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a lot of different things, I mean part of it ... I mean just ... I don't know. I guess I just don't entirely understand it. It's pretty complex but I just didn't want to ... I don't want to lose control. I didn't want to be at that point. I just didn't, you know if I could go back in time and just shake him awake earlier it would have been fine, but I didn't, you know? (pause) And so ...</p>

<p>(00:10:25)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So now what all is going on for you? You were I'm sure anxious about the launch day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Couldn't sleep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anxious about knowing that you're going to have to work Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Five days in a row. You couldn't sleep because you were anxious about all that stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mostly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also you know just other random stuff, but yeah. If I let myself go I can dig up something else to be worried about too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what else were you worrying about then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To be honest I don't remember because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I get to be that way, especially when I'm tired I don't really form long-term memories. To be honest like if you ask me to say what we said between each other I can tell you the jest, no idea. And so it just especially when I'm very tired. And I was just in a bad mood and it just felt like ... and maybe this is wrong, I don't know but this is like one of the ... maybe maximum four times a year I need you just to, you know for him to be you know a little bit ... if you're in a bad mood, fake it, you know? Or don't be home or something, you know? And I need you not to, you know be kind of a pain in the ass basically, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I guess, you know I just felt frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I told him about that and he was very, very apologetic and basically all weekend he did some nice things for me, so that was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like cleaning the house while I was gone. That's not ... that never happens. It's not that he doesn't want too, it's just that it never occurred to him. We've discussed this idea of having like a list things to do when you don't have anything else to do.</p>

<p>(00:12:12)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That never gets kicked in because he always goes into self-soothing mode, which is usually things that are bad for him well before I even, you know even before he gets to look at some list. So it's just not something he does. But I did come home and the house was pretty nice and he actually specifically did makeup the beds so when I came home I could go immediately to sleep, which was really nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He knew that that was something that I would immediately want to go to sleep. So ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I did get rides to work most of the week, which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't most of the time get rides home because I just ... it was too much of a pain in the ass to have him fight traffic to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And work. But so I mean overall it was really helpful. I just, I don't know. Felt like he didn't deserve to be treated that way. You know in terms of me being grumpy. Whether or not I should or should not have acted, he did not deserve to be treated that way. How about that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. We can agree on that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a mistake and not a mistake but it was something that beyond ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wasn't really his fault like you said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Yeah. It wasn't his fault. That's what I'm really trying to say.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'm not going to screw with you about that, at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So ... and so I just, you know (pause) I just don't like letting things go that long until I get that upset, so. That's pretty much the big thing from this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually when one of us has something important going on the other person sort of kicks into the mode of being support team.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So as soon as this done then we flip and I help him get ready for a presentation. And I feel like I usually holdup my end of the bargain on that. I can't always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But luckily he doesn't need me to fetch things for him usually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When that happens it's usually like, "Can you make sure that this ... you know the spell check didn't correct it with the wrong word or can you tell me if this looks okay? Or you know ... or even just like, "Hey these are 15 jpgs can you turn this into a video for me?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we've gotten for the most part for years until like things recently ... we had a really good rhythm where if somebody needed to have the other person ... not really put their life on hold but sort of focus on being supportive after the other person. We've always been really good switching off with it. And so (pause) it's weird not to have that happen, you know? And so to me I think that was even more distressing (pause) due to the fact that you know knowing that he wasn't very good at that that time, you know? So. (pause) So that's been, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How (pause) Do you mean because he yelled back that night? Is that what was distressing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. the fact that, you know that he wasn't really mentally prepared to be that support staff person, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Because he was in a bad mood?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Himself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad mood but usually the person who supports that thinks of ... if the person who thinks on terms like things that the other person wouldn't think of. Like okay so I'm going to think about, yeah what's easiest for dinner and you know I'm going to think about like obviously like making sure that things are just right so the, you know that the other person has clean clothes or the other person has this, you know or if one of us, and it's happened more than a few times where one of us has had to pull an all nighter making sure that the person has, you know, snacks and you know the things that need are charged or. You know it's usually we've got a really good rhythm of that person thinking about ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes (cross talk). Really good to each other that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really good to each other that way, you know? (pause) I mean not so much anymore but there used to be like making sure that I ... I have this really bad habit of breaking mechanical pencils and ... yeah. And so I actually have for when I was doing a lot of calculations I actually have a 1 mm lead pencil from Germany. Which by the way most lead pencils are half a millimeter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so he would make sure that before I had to do something for like a big project or something I'd be up all night for, he would swing by the only place in town that had 1 mm lead and make sure I had plenty of that and a giant eraser. Like that kind of stuff, you know?</p>

<p>(00:16:42)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it sort of ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's sweet.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's very sweet. And that's the kind of thing that I just ... and luckily I don't need that that much anymore but the point though is that, you know (pause) knowing that, you know that, you know that the other person is going to be focusing on the really important details so the other person sort of goes and deals with the little details, you know? Making sure that like we have the right amount of socks for this thing or even just like, you know where's the presentation remote? Does the presentation remote have batteries, you know? Does it work right now? You know, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like it's just stuff like that. Usually we do it for each other and so (pause) you know I (pause) kind of felt like I wasn't being helped with that kind of stuff that night, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean he did go out and grab something to eat; some takeout for us. But I sort of had to be like, "Okay so I am feeling very anemic right now, so let's go with red meat. What do we have immediately that's not too far away, okay? I'm going to call and call the hamburger shop and get them to get takeout."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that's usually not my job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'm just spoiled, you know? Where as I'm ... at the time like memorizing things and ... it's not that I need to know it but it just ... it gives me confidence. It's not said to me this is the white sheet on, you know the differences in resolution and how that relieves eyestrain. And you'd better know this by tomorrow morning. No, it's just that if I have all of this stuff, whether I need it or not, if I have the time to be able to talk to it on a level that this person will understand and this person will understand. I spend a lot of time organizing my metaphors, how I'm going to talk to somebody about how we do this and that and for setting things up. And so to me it's more ... it's a lot of prep work but it makes it so that it works very smoothly. And (pause) I think in certain ways it doesn't actually matter what any of the prep work is it's almost like it's (pause) it's almost like it's framing so that I can get myself from the point ... it's a confidence thing. If I actually like just in general just prepped by memorizing like digits of pie possibly or something like that. If I could convince myself that that might be helpful that would probably work.</p>

<p>(00:19:12)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Honestly it's all about like setting the stage for being confident and understanding it and it's not ... most of the time it possibly actually doesn't to do with you know the important things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But maybe, maybe not, you know?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I felt like there was some extent to which you each play a part in that process for the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words like, "Yes It's nice to have the extra millimeter pencil leads and erasers."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there's also just the sense of like knowing that you're being taken care of and the other person is also you know ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You can focus on the important stuff, all the peripherals will taken care of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Even if it's not usually your job, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (pause) you know ... that is ... yeah that's just what you do, you know?</p>

<p>(00:20:03)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it (pause) and like I said maybe I've gotten spoiled but it was really devastating to me not to have that happen. And it wasn't just for , I mean we've been like through years of school and ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like since the age of eighteen we've somehow fell into this habit of, "Okay well you need to do this, well I know. This is what the other person is going to do. And you know it's (pause) it's kind of sad that to be kind of upset it because there's not like a single person in the store who like had somebody that they loved who you know made sure that, you know who was making sure that, you know that you have all the right things you need to do before you get out the door. Or maybe there's someone make sure I get my lunch but that's about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know? And ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it a thing you guys can talk about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've talked about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We talked about it a lot and actually that's part of the reason why he's been acting super, like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Guilty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, but you know saying that you know that he feels sorry that he didn't do that. He doesn't know why which what ... I think the thing to me and I'm trying really hard not to make it worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I really feel like knowing why it happen that way is important because I don't want it to happen again. Like it's been in the past. I have no ability to go back in time to change it. Therefore finding out what happened?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know is it something that he did or I did or just, you know maybe we just need to set the, you know the expectations for it. You know we've got these like I said we've got this weird rhythm of things that you know ... is that I need to tell you, not maybe explicitly but saying you know, "You ready for launch day or something you know like that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have any thoughts about what it may have been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I really don't know what's going on in his head right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean you're describing something's he's been doing that are a bit different. I mean I guess mostly positive but ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly positive. Sometimes not. He's been going through a lot of behavioral changes that are weird. So (pause) one of which is that I can't get him to call a family member to know save my life right now. He's like, "Yeah, don't really feel like it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>(00:22:30)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which in the past hasn't really wanted too either but he's at least been better about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this a therapy thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I think so. He mentioned that I should probably at some point in the future that I'm going to come in to meet his therapist or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The new one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the new one. So ... but I don't know. So ... and I mean at least a little bit of that I think a little bit of, you know, I mean he's been depressed and sick. I did call him out on the fact that I'm certain that he's acting out and he's sort of hedged his bets and told me some things but I'm like you know what? Honestly at this point I just don't have the energy to get the real truth out you about this, the whole thing, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean does any of this (pause) reassuring to you even though he's acting this way again? Like (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know ... I don't have enough data at this point. I really don't get it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have to admit that for the past like five days I haven't paid attention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That much, all that that much at all. (pause) But the ... definitely there are negative things but there are (pause) I don't know to be honest. I have reason to believe he's still having a lot of trouble (pause) endocrinologically but I don't really ... this is point which, you know I've talked with people I know and throw up my hands because I feel like I call and say, "This is Mike's wife. I am just checking to make sure that he actually talked to you about this."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Or whatever, you know? It's not something that, you know I can do. I have no control over it. I mean I can be supportive as possible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I don't know. (pause) I do know that (pause) that, you know I think he's going through a lot of stuff right now and I do know that on some level I'm pretty darn certain like if anything else is going on because it (pause) there's lots of things going on ... it's hard to explain. But (pause) I know he's sleeping a lot more. (pause) But ... it's just ... (pause) This may make a bad person I feel like I don't want to have to keep tabs on him to know ... I mean instinctively there's some things that are wrong but I don't have enough like actual informational data to be able to say what it is, you know? (pause) Like I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think that might make you a bad person?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm joking about making a bad person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I just don't have the energy to keep up with like, "Okay so I'm pretty sure you're acting out and after like a half an hour interrogation you kind of admitted that maybe you have." But like the time to actually find out like when, where, why, you know whatever (pause) I don't really ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You just don't have it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only work twelve hours a week and I don't have the fucking time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know it's exhausting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:25:55)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And when all is said and done does it really even matter? Maybe. You know? And am I even prepared to find out what the answer is? Probably not, you know? The few times that I've gotten a really hard truth about it I've been horrified. So maybe it's probably for the best. I don't think I'm not doing it because I don't want know, it's because I would like to know. I'm one of those people my imagination is usually pretty worse than reality but I feel like, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that you're actually trying to take care of yourself as best you can here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound like making an effort not to know so much as not wanting to deal with making the effort to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I try not to sweat the small stuff. I mean it sounds like not small stuff but I mean it's like the stuff that I could get wrapped up in this and I've gotten many, many year ago ... even like probably two months ago at one point or another. I've gotten wrapped up in this a lot and it's a lot to deal with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I know you how many times of how it's going (inaudible_00:27:07) for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Sometimes it is. But usually not ... when I have ... sometimes it is it's constructive for me for like being able to figure why there are these massive ... I will spend a lot of time trying to figure out why doesn't work is and it's actually like, "Oh so the reason why we don't have the Internet anymore is because it's been throttled because we've been downloading like mass ... like I spent like a couple of hours going through things and trying to figure out what in the world is wrong that we can't like ... like taking me an enormous amount of time downloading my e-mail. And if I'd just known that he'd been acting out like crazy, like enough that like it kicked over to Comcast and Comcast like throttled the amount of Internet access we had like down to a very low normal it would have made a lot more sense. So there are real, you know utilities for this or like when I was trying to figure why in the world I can't backup his hard drive ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's filled with porn, I had no idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would have bought a bigger hard drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It I had known. Not that I really wanted to but you know what I mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know what you mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I really, really one of those people that's very pragmatic and I don't like to have to have occasionally when I'm trying to deal with like normal day to day things have this kind of crap come up to surprise me, you know? (pause) That's pretty much the big thing is that I want to try and keep my day going. I'm trying to do this and all of a sudden ... you know? (pause) And (pause) I just find it to be, you know more than a little bit frustrating. I mean hedging his time already, the little bit I do is a lot. Like (sigh) (pause) if he has an appointment at some point he gets nothing done. Like today he goes to see his therapist at 3:30. He went to work at noon. I asked him, "Can you just ... if you're going can you pickup my computer because I'm selling it and you just pick it up and put it in the trunk of the car? And he's like, "No problem." That was at one o'clock. I talked to him at 2:30, he was still at home. He was like, "Well I realized that I was going to be at ... you know I have to go to my therapist at 3:30 so might as well (pause) That's hours upon hours of stuff. And it's like I try to explain to him like, "Well (pause) you know you need to go back to work, you know? He has certain days where he doesn't see someone until 10 a.m. and so he doesn't get anything done until 10 a.m. And then by the time he gets out at eleven then he's home at three, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:29:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's frustrating. And although he claims that he's getting stuff done at home perhaps, I really have severe doubts as to how much is actually being done at home. And I can't checkup on him because one, I don't care that much. I just want things done. I don't care really ... honestly if he put in a solid thirty hours of research a week I really wouldn't care that much about anything. And I'm not talking about forty. I'm not talking about the sixty that I was raised to believe that that's what you do in your thirties, you know? I'm talking about thirty hours a week, you know? (pause) I really think I could probably even ... if the pornography didn't affect his life that much I think I could probably even be okay with it, sort of. I at least could squelch it down bad enough that I could function.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sort of sounds to me like you're bargaining here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine because you're just so upset about how things are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I'm really upset about it. (pause) But the thing is that, I mean I'm bargaining about it because of the fact that I've given these cues that and we'll be men, that's what they do. I'm like, "Not like this." And this is the point which it took me a longtime, like two or three years of really coming to terms with the fact that this an addiction is because there is no middle ground. This is it, this is like an alcoholic. Alcoholics don't, you know aren't usually able to casually drink afterwards, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know enough about it but that's at least what you always see on T.V.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's like that. I mean there is no middle ground but yet, you know (pause) I don't know. I really want to be just tolerant of kinds of things. It just (pause) it's massively affecting his life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. And so massively affecting your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:32:09)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it about ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: If you could implode without bothering me which this sounds like a tremendous egotistical, jerky thing to say. I think I would even almost okay with it if it didn't affect me so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it would certainly be much better to you than how things are now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I am bargaining.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it ... I mean I can imagine any number of reasons that (pause) his working so little would bother you. Which ones do you think are the most important? Or which ones do you think of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he's unhappy with what he does and therefore, I mean he's never going to move on and get out of there if ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Like it's holding you lives up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And quite frankly I think that he would feel less awkward and be able to standup for what he wants if he actually worked more so they felt he was there more often. If we could actually say things like, you know, what he wants and needs for his job. The biggest thing he's really unhappy about like he doesn't like to talk about but he isn't happy about is, that he isn't happy results, where is going, how slow it's going, how this is not doing this. You know, I would think that putting more time in it would be okay. And we talk, he's like, "Oh I'm still waiting for the thing to arrive. I'm still waiting for this thing to go." I'm like, you know, "I'm waiting for this particular, you know thing to come back from legal." I'm like great. In my world that means I read journals.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. I mean most (pause) I was back in the engineering or the sciences are working sixty-five hours a week. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm actually kind of bitter that he's convinced the world, including like other people that he is working that much. And when I bring attention to it to other people, people that should know (pause) they sometimes believe it but they believe it only for just ... and usually I have to get him to verify that this is true. They only believe in it long enough to like ... and then in like a couple of weeks they're like, "Oh yeah he must be back to normal." No, he's never put that much in work in his life. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're saying that one of the things that bothers you the most about it is that it ... I guess you're listing two things. One is that he's really unhappy then with his regular progress and two it means he won't get out of there anytime soon ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I see also means it kind of holds up your lives like financially, geographically, the kids.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And the thing that just blows my mind is the fact that I have never ... you know whenever I've been feeling very unhappy with my life a nice day of hard work in which I actually like said, "You know what? I may not of liked the results but I got this, this, this, and this done." Does wonders for me feeling good about myself. He hates himself. He feels like he's fraud. Well you know what, honestly? Get yourself meaningless, you know data in, you know? Or you don't like the fact that this things, this bubble thing isn't working right then throw away all the data and spend the day getting the whole system working so that it's down pat, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:35:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what you do. And you say, "You know what. Maybe this wasn't ... like this didn't mean anything to anybody ... to anybody else but I got it working right today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I put signs up saying, 'Talk to me before you touch it.' Because I've got this running right. You know this machine or whatever, you know? I just feel like (pause) honest, good hard work would make him feel better about himself. I feel like this whole thing is self propagating and then because he doesn't like it then he, you know he doesn't feel good about himself. He starts acting out and then he acts out which obviously makes it so he can't work and (pause) you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems like the most infantile thing I could think of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what does it start for you be watching him stuck in that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really frustrating because I can't ... I ... maybe one out of twenty times I would say something about it. Because I don't want to be the person that runs his life, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's so frustrating that ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I watch him do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You kind of almost have to try to do something about it? Like it's very hard to sort of sit on your hands it sounds like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of how frustrating it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the risk of sounding like an egotistical bastard, I feel like I could do his job right now better than he could. And he has a PhD.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably because I did a lot of the work for him to get his PhD.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To get him up to speed to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know nothing about ... the last time took an actually biology class I was thirteen. (pause) And I feel like I could be running these experiments better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and it sounds like that has hard as that might be it'll be a lot easier than sitting passively by getting so incredibly frustrated that you couldn't do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That actually sounds like it's much harder.</p>

<p>(00:37:11)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like just give me the auto pipette, I'll go out there, I'll run your gels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In theory I don't know anything else but I, you know I've got a good copy of 'Nature' right next to me and like I have, like your Perry's manual when I need to look up what a procedure looks like and that's it, you know? And I'm not trying to degrade a PhD. I'm not in anyway putting down, I defended it and did all this stuff, but yet at the same time (pause) sometimes you just sort of have to suck it up and just do something. Even if it doesn't mean anything, you know? And he's sad because somebody we went to school with, who graduated, well basically defended two months before he did has already been to, you know has already been to Antarctica once already. And then he actually ... almost everybody from his lab, from his grad student lab is here right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: On different schools. It's sort of like this running joke that accidentally everybody's scattered to different schools. And so when Ryan is doing his job talk right now to try and get himself a tenure track position. So the person two months before him defended so he invited everybody out there because that's the circle of people he trusts to tear him apart so that he can get this, you know to do this thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible_(00:38:30).</p>

<p>CLIENT: To do his job talk. And you know and that he's like, you know Mike was flattered because that's, you know great. But at the same time I get ... he hasn't said one word, but I'm convinced he's upset about it because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Of course he is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. And it's like Ryan, you know got to meet with, you know M.L. Lawrence in Switzerland. You know why? Ryan actually reads articles and when they asked to submit, you know a proposal he actually sent a proposal. You haven't even looked at a journal to see that somebody's actually looking for that, you know? But how can I say it? No. You know? And I've thought about talking to him because I do know Ryan well enough to say, "I need you to shake him and make him work." But (pause) I'm not sure if that's kind of like a bitchy, like (pause) manipulative wife thing to say, you know. Because Ryan knows him well too.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (pause) this is driving you nuts.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's driving me really freaking crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and I think you're frustrated and furious.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. And I hate to be like a jerk about the whole thing but ... and (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (inaudible_00:39:50). How much are you supposed to be able to tolerate, you know? Where you ... how hard (inaudible_00:39:56) live on it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the same time it's like I'm trying really hard to be like (pause) okay with this but I'm ... you know or at least be calm about it. But obviously it's not. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:40:14)</p>

<p>And it seems like the only appeals that, you know that really seem to fall on, like remotely (pause) interested ears are like things that are so silly. Like the other day when I was upset I'm like, "Okay. I want you to understand something, okay? I've gone from having low blood pressure to high blood pressure in six months. I have recently started getting gray hairs and you know this is not like I am physically being driven into the ground by this, okay? I need you to stop." And like that's like the only thing like ... like all these silly, shallow things about this is like the thing he listens to as opposed to like (pause) the rational explanation. You cry over getting gray hair and having blood pressure problems is ... you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pretty hard to be married to an addict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It's really hard. And if anybody ever like wanted to say that this is like a ...You know that this is not, you know an addiction because there aren't such addictions I really dare them to have to spend enough time in my world to tell me otherwise. Because when I get to talk to the person who's rational and normal and not being driven by like all this, like, you know self soothing type of thing (pause) he's great. And that's the part that everyone else sees. But when I get the, "Oh I ... Like this is a real story. I tripped and fell and I ... you know I got my pants muddy so I stayed home all day. Like on the way out the door. Like I slipped and fell. Now I understand the whole thing of, "I need to change my clothes." I want to make myself a cup of hot chocolate to make, you know get myself better. Or even I re-salted the sidewalk and I'm waiting for it to melt." But I spend all day home because I tore my pants?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(00:42:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And acted out. And the reason why I fell anyways is because I was acting out and therefore, like, (pause) my hand-eye coordination and my sense of focus is (pause) gone. Like ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish that I had like someway to kinetically like track this because he does not look where he is going and he falls, he tears things, he ... like it's ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's uncanny how different he is. He seemed altered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so ... sorry I've ... it really does upset me a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know seems like one of the ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm at the end of my rope.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things you're going to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We're going to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll be back in two days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay</p>

<p>CLIENT: More to whine about. Yeah. See you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you then. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks.</p>

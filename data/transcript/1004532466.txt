<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just pick up right where we were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I don't know just because it's a walk-in emergency clinic or something and they think it's not an emergency if you...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But are you having an - I guess that - so what we really need to determine is if when you call in and ask for an appointment, that's not really an emergency.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a walk-in clinic; you got to walk in and be distressed. So if it feels like that, I guess if you're out of place or it feels like that, then you can access that again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. It seems...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're in the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't know because I have a psychiatrist and that I'm not running out of medicine because that's what they asked. And no I'm not running out - I was like no I need to have my meds adjusted. But they were like oh well try to see your psychiatrist sooner. So because I'm on some medication...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have it still...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I have it still, and I have a psychiatrist who I'm seeing eventually, they would call it I guess not an emergency. So even if I were visibly in distress in that situation they'd still - I have a feeling I probably would've gotten the same answer if I had walked down there. This way I didn't actually have to walk down there. So, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How have those thoughts of self harm been, because that's another emergency situation, if you feel like you're not, if you're having thoughts of hurting yourself or committing suicide.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been having less of them so. More now it's just mostly having still having attacks and stuff. So then Tuesday morning that I was doing all of this because I think Wednesday I was mostly fine. But it's not an emergency situation if you're not actually planning on acting on these thoughts. [00:02:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you can stop your - if you don't feel like you have intent to follow through on the thoughts, then... if you felt like you're going to follow through on the thoughts and actually harm yourself, then you're talking commitment or at least meeting with someone immediately in safety planning. But that's something you can meet me for, that's not necessarily a med adjustment. And that's not something to fake to see somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wasn't planning on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because I just - I don't actually want to be committed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I don't think it would - I don't think it would be helpful for you in the long run. You know, being able to meet with your psychiatrist, see if there's other options, see if there's adjustments that can be made to your meds to give you a little bit more support at this time, those are things that can be helpful to you. But spending a day or two in the hospital will change things in the immediate future, maybe feel a relief from some of the responsibilities that you have but all those things - what's causing you a lot of distress is the pressure of job search and finding a job and that's going to be sitting right there outside of the hospital when you got released. It's not going to change that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. But if at the hospital I saw someone who could adjust my meds...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's true. That would be one thing that you would probably have evaluated if you went in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, which is pretty much the only reason I would be considering it in the first place. It's like, yes it would be an escape from my responsibilities but it would also be an escape from my support system and I wouldn't have anyone I could talk to and it would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, and you have some really good support outside of the hospital. [00:04:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yes. I'm not going to get myself committed. Not that they'd commit me. Actually the whole fear of getting committed was why I was also afraid to just walk down there to the clinic. That is in the same place as the place where people also can get committed and stuff. But I ended up finding they're not preventially (ph) inclined because I was really, really unclear navigating the website and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that can be hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Websites sometimes have just - you can totally design that better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're absolutely right. Some places have much better websites than others.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because this is where the problem was at - because especially because mental health clinic, so it's at the New Haven Hospital which is part of the Health Alliance and social services at the New Haven Hospital would take you and you would see mental health or whatever at this clinic. But then if you just looked at the Health Alliance in general, it would also take you to the same page under different things led to the same exact information and they're not sharing their (inaudible) or what they meant at all. I wish I could e-mail these therapists and see if they're taking appointments and I mean some of them probably do have e-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some of them probably do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just whether or not they check it right away and I still have to write the e-mail. I guess I'm also just afraid of seeing whoever I end up seeing and finding out that there isn't anything that can be done. Which of course I have no way of knowing but like... [00:06:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I understand your fear because you know you had a really negative reaction to SSRIs in the past. You're going to try to do that route again, and it does, it limits some options.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It limits a lot of options. All the anti-depressants except for Welbutrin or SSRIs are more compensory to it somehow and there are things I can't take unless they're the really scary ones like the MAOIs and I don't even know how those ones work but I know that they're weird and you have to not eat certain foods and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they're not weird. They're just an older generation of medication but they work great for some people. MAOIs have been around a longer time than SSRIs, there's a lot of research and evidence on them. Yes, there are some things that you need to avoid when you're on them but you have proven a great track record of being able to avoid certain foods. Choosing to keep Kosher is avoiding a lot of foods. You're good at remembering and following rules so that might be a good option for you. It might be worth exploring with a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, it depends on what the side effects they have and stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not everybody has every side effect. So it might be that that's - I'm not suggesting it but I know you feel very scared about being limited because of the serotonin reaction that you had but that's not the only option. And it might be that at this point in time maybe going to another class of medications is a good option. [00:08:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I suppose I don't really remember much about them. I definitely learned about them in my very basic freshman year of classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If that was the recommendation, I'm sure you could be provided with...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it wasn't a recommendation. It was these are the different drugs that are used to treat depression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, if you met with a psychiatrist and a psychiatrist felt that one of those medications would be a good choice for you, I'm sure that you can be provided with up-to-date information.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't research it now because it's a holiday for me so I can't do anything until Saturday night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't need to know right now. That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just really mind that all the medication is trial and error and stuff and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is some trial and error because nobody knows exactly how they're going to respond to something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seems like there's more trial and error for psych help, psychiatric medicine than there are in other areas of medicine. I don't know if that's a misconception or if I just....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think there, I think it's, you know, psychiatric medications, their response and the symptoms are subjective more so than in some areas of medicine. But you do have some of that same type of thing in medicine as well. Some people have reactions to some antibiotics and are allergic to some classes of antibiotics but not others, and you have that same kind of experimentation - here try this one, see what happens - sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. [00:10:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I don't think there's ever, like you have people who are allergic to antibiotics but you don't really have people who aren't allergic antibiotics take the antibiotics and then nothing happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not actually true. You have some infections that are resistant to certain type of antibiotics and oftentimes people will take a course of antibiotics and not have it work appropriately. It doesn't have the same dramatic effect that you had with the serotonin reaction, so it might be why you're not thinking of it. But that does happen for some people. When you break a bone, it's pretty clear cut what you have to do.</p>

<p>But I think there are some areas of medicine where there are experimentation and mental health is certainly one of those where you're dealing with very subjective emotional reactions to some medications to see if they work or not and there are also some side effects that are much more physiological. And not everybody has the same side effects to every medication, whether that be a psychotropic medication or another class of meds. I wish it was more clear-cut and that there seems to be easier answers for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like anyone has a good answer that would magically work without trying it and having it possibly fail first. Then it's like going to - you feel like if they are going to adjust my meds, then they'll be a series of having to go through different things and... [00:12:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be. It might be that you have to try several different things. It might be that the first thing works. That's what we don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that I don't think there are several different things that can be tried.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let the psychiatrist do that work. That's not your job. You don't have to take over that piece of doing the research, finding out what atypical medications there might be because there are some antidepressants that we call atypical antidepressants that work differently. And that's the psychiatrists job is to be up to date on all of that and know what all the different options are, which ones are available to you based on your history, which ones are too risky to try.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just wondering if there are psychiatrists who would hear about my - okay so I reacted badly to these three different SSRIs and decide to put me on a different SSRI, even if I tell them that I've had these bad reactions and I don't want them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you'll get to say yes or no. You get to listen - your job is to bring that in your symptoms and your history; their job is to come up with what they think would be the best course of action and then you get to say no I'm not willing to try that it's too scary, or yes I'm willing to try that, based on whatever evidence they share with you. No one's going to force you to do anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they don't actually have that power.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. Nobody can force you to take anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if they decide not to renew the subscriptions for the same set of crap I'm taking...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would they do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. If they did try to do that, then I'd probably find a different psychiatrist. I don't know. It's some process...[00:14:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not working perfectly but it is working so I think it would be unrealistic that somebody would refuse to prescribe something that is that is working to some degree for you. But it's not working perfectly and there might be something better. Or if you, I know you felt like you weren't sure if they could prescribe a higher dosage, but maybe, maybe they can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would be interesting sometimes because, I mean I don't know. Maybe they changed their outlook for the highest dosages...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, for a different, like there's a maximum dosage prescription for Prosac for depression. Just for example, I know Prozac's not a good choice for you, but if somebody is treating an obsessive-compulsive disorder the recommendations for the highest dosage possible are different because sometimes it's, the same medication could be used to treat more than one thing and the recommendations for the dosage levels are different depending upon what it's actually being used for. And a lot of medications have off-label uses or uses for different things. But that's why - I know you want to go to a psychiatrist rather than a PCP and that's why. It's because they have more specific knowledge.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what purpose is - like isn't there also like the reason for these maximum dosages is also like certain of them might cause bad things to happen, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that is true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...poisonous or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. But sometimes, depending on medication, there's something called an effective dose, a therapeutic dose, and a lethal dose. For some medications, the effective dose, the therapeutic dose and the lethal dose are all pretty close together without that much room for error. And in those cases it's very important that you not take more than is suggested or prescribed and they're not that lenient with what the prescription amounts are, the dosages are. [00:16:26]</p>

<p>Other medications, a lot of the anti-depressants being in that class, the effective dose is a wider range and the lethal dose is way, way, way out here. Very hard to over dose. If you don't have a sort of allergic reaction to any SSRIs it's really hard to over dose on them. So there's a lot more leniency in how much a person can be given that might be effective for them. That's a little bit different with I think the MAOIs. I believe that one of the reasons why if you can't take an SSRI, that they're often better tolerated is because there's a little bit more leniency with them. But that doesn't mean that they're not a good choice for somebody else.</p>

<p>So, you know, it depends on - for every medication has a different degree of latitude in what a safe dose is. And for a lot of medications that are prescribed today that lethal dose is way out and that's one of the great things and it gives you a little bit more leniency about what you can prescribe and what someone can take safely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really wish I just had this information, but I mean I could try when I finally get on the Internet and see whether or not it's there but probably not quite as accurate as someone who's actually trained in this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I think, let's see if we can find a way to get you in sooner. Would that be - I think about the easiest phone call will be to make is to call the clinic where the psychiatrist is and say I have this appointment; I've been really struggling. Can I get in to see anybody sooner? That might be the easiest phone call to make. Then you can ask somebody who's really trained in this stuff and has more knowledge than I do because you have good questions. [00:18:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of me thinks that maybe this is all in my head and the meds are just working fine and I'm just thinking there's something wrong when there isn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you're experiencing a lot more. You're experiencing more frequent panic, that's not made up. It's related to your head, absolutely, but it's really happening. You're experiencing more panic than you usually experience. You're having more frequent panic attacks in the past few weeks than you have been previously, and these thoughts of self-harm are things that come and go but they've been here more frequently recently than they were in the past. It's not that they've never come up before, they have. But they are really coming up. You're not imagining that. So those are signs that you're under a lot more stress than what you typically are. [00:19:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well does that mean that my meds aren't working or is it just that no meds would work with this amount of stress?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a combination. It's you are not coping with the amount of stress that you have in a way that is healthy for you. The way that I interpret panic attacks, thoughts of self-harm, you know, that feeling that you need to escape, I interpret that as a sign that you are not coping with the stress that you have. Would anybody be able to cope with the stress you have? That's hard to say. But our job as your treatment team, me and whichever psychiatrist you end up seeing, our job is to make sure that you can cope. [00:20:14]</p>

<p>Part of that is working on making sure that when your head starts jumping to the what ifs and jumping way out to the future, which actually creates more stress for you, and my job is to help you rein those thoughts in so that you feel better. Medication's job is to help take the edge off of that, to decrease some of the panic and anxiety symptoms so that you can access your other coping mechanisms. You're much more likely to have adaptive positive thoughts when you're feeling better. The medication helps you to access that coping mechanism. When you get really anxious and panicked, your thinking tends to exacerbate it.</p>

<p>So if we can get you on medication that helps to bring that down, you tend to think in ways that are actually healthier for you. You tend to be more easily able to get yourself to get up and go for a walk, which helps you feel better. So the medication can work together with the other types of things that help you feel better. Might be the medication that, the regiment that you were on before was enough for that kind of stress but it may not be enough for what you're feeling right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Things look - there's not anything immediately stressful going on, and yet every little thing sets me off. Sometimes one thing goes wrong, everything is going wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Things that normally you can handle are creating a bigger inventory than they have been in the past.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's like a lot of the stressful things. We cleaned the house for Passover. It's Passover now. There is no more cleaning. I mean I have to do some stuff on Saturday night but it's not like way too much or anything. And I think there's seriously guilt about not applying for jobs all the time and like...[00:22:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That guilt must weigh at you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't even know if that's still - you know I might still feel the guilt if I were applying for 10 jobs a day until I had a job. I wouldn't know that thorough but even if I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel pretty guilty about not having a job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you feel guilty about not having a job; you feel guilty about not applying for jobs. That guilt weighs pretty heavily on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like there were some that I could have applied for this week and never gotten around to doing and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What stopped you from getting around to doing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of it was being sick again and just not feeling in the mood to sit down and start writing cover letters. I was also thinking because part of me was also like being with Sydney and him being panicky too. Like he was going do his taxes and I was going to write cover letter/make cold calls to psychiatrists. Except that then he was feeling panicky about doing his taxes so he didn't end up going to his place so he could do his taxes. He ended up filing for an extension so - because he could do that online, I guess. So he'll probably do his taxes soon but I didn't have that time. And then I decided to dye yarn instead and...which might not have been the best idea when I'd been feeling sick.</p>

<p>There's no good reason why I didn't do it. There are only less good reasons. Plus I didn't feel like it which is not really a good reason not to do something. Sometime I need to have a certain amount of mental energy and focus in order to write something good. And otherwise I'll be like - and the problem is I haven't been feeling that as often and still like write all the cover letter as I might have used to do in - even though I know I'll feel better when I write them and send them out. [00:24:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes because they allow you to feel like you're taking active steps to actually do something to alleviate the guilt and the stress. And it's hard to motivate yourself to do something that I know feels at times sort of pointless. I know you've been very frustrated by the process, but avoiding the process doesn't help alleviate that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It' not like I have many other options. I'm still - I have been selling a lot of yarn but still enough it's not enough that it's like enough to not get a job. Like I don't think that will ever happen. Or if it does it won't be for a while and even if it did it wouldn't be reliable because it all depends on someone buying yarn that day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And spending time dying yarn and selling your yarn doesn't preclude you from also doing some cover letters. It doesn't have to be one or the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. Well I can't really do them at the same time per se but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't do them at the same time but there are plenty of hours in the day because you're not going to spend 10 hours writing cover letters. There's plenty of time left in the day if you were able to focus on doing it and sending a few out, there will be plenty of time left over to do some yarn.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And some of them might end up getting stopped because of the whole this has an application you have to fill out too. And I'm less likely to apply for something that has an application that I have to fill out. There is this one might get the water. [00:26:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you be that picky?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I mean if I start filling out the application and it gets really in the way and I stop feeling like doing it and don't have the motivation to do it by the full day. [inaudible at 00:26:59]. So I don't know. I guess because it's not like if I fill out that application then I will get that - I have more of a chance of getting that job but it's isn't guaranteeing that I'm getting the job either. So it's like just as pointless as writing cover letters is that it's even so more annoying that you have to fill out all this information that's also in your cover letter and resume.</p>

<p>I really, really, really, really, really hate application forms so much. The one I was actually trying for at least I could like fill it out on my computer, I didn't have to print it out and write it by hand and all that but it's - I sort of got tripped up with the length, started playing with employment history because it also has a different section about oh talk about your volunteer work. And then whether or not I'm currently employed if I'm currently working for the historical society but not getting paid. I wasn't sure how to say that and so I just sort of gave up there instead of continuing. And I mean I can't really go back to it. I'm not seven sure that if that job's still open now. It was posted on April 3rd. So over a week ago. [00:28:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it a job that would be interesting?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't like a super oh I love this, this is the perfect job ever, because if it were the perfect job I would totally fill out the application form however annoying it might be. It was something at the water works company, their additional archives or something along those lines I think. I read the job app once but it was a while ago so I don't quite remember what it entailed. I can't remember if it was part time or full time. I mean I don't think I saw anything on it about it being temporary at least but that doesn't mean anything either considering how many things I find out oh it's temporary without them actually telling you when you apply. Or one place where they post the job says it and the other places don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I didn't know there was that confusion with the one that you recently applied for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I haven't heard back from them either. Though I sent that letter out on Tuesday or Wednesday, so it hasn't been that late. I think it was Tuesday that I probably sent it out. But, yes, so it's only been a few days. Just - and, you know, it feels like sometimes I think they don't actually put that much effort into writing these job ads and putting them up and making sure that the information is accurate, which is really annoying because they'll disqualify you for the most primary mistake or something. [00:30:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have the power, right? You want the job. Or you want a job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Like right now there are more people who want jobs than jobs that need people. There's really nothing I can do about that. I don't know. Maybe I should just apply for every single job ever whether or not it's in the industry, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like - that's a big leap because it sounds like right now you're not applying for things that are actually in the industry. So maybe you should be applying for things that are in your industry, regardless of whether they have annoying application forms, rather than jumping and saying oh I'm going to apply for everything regardless of whether I'm interested in it. Maybe applying for everything that you're remotely interested in, even though they have some hurdles. Would it - I know, you have a routine of coming here every week at a certain time. Would it help to tag onto that? You know, we've got free wi-fi in the waiting room, to plan to come an hour early and fill out one form or one cover letter as part of that routine?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. Obviously that involves bringing the laptop with me because I can't really fill out, write cover letter and stuff on my smartphone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. It would mean kind of camping out in the waiting room with your - we've got a table, we've got chairs. You'd have to bring your laptop. We talked about the idea of kind of having structure and routine and this is one part of your week that has structure and routine. You can also tag it onto the structured routine of going in for your volunteer hours, but that sounds like that's a little less set. [00:32:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well volunteer now it's - I mean when I'm not sick I can - and I mean that's what I have been working things off of when I must get off it. But I've been sick. I mean today I was [inaudible at 00:32:18] but it was a holiday so it wasn't like I was going to apply for any jobs then. When I don't give up my [inaudible at 00:32:26] I could do it, that and I'm not staring at least five hours a week. But, yes. I don't know. I should just say it's a fact, I have to do it or it just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it would help you to feel better. A lot of times people experience a lot of anxiety when they're waiting for something they don't want to do. And I know you, you very much have a sense of dread about going though the process of writing the cover letters, filling out the applications, waiting to hear back, there's a lot of dread around that. And avoiding that usually intensifies the negative feelings. If we could find a way to have you head-on confront it and be more active with it, you might find that some of the guilt and some of the dread decreases, which would probably feel like a relief.</p>

<p>CLIENT: While I'm thinking about it I do remember that I think the job was something like 15 to 27 hours a week or something like that. It was like some brand of amount because I remember trying to figure out what - because they ask you expected salary and so deciding that I have to write it out hourly because it wasn't completely full-time so I couldn't me like oh $45,000 a year. So, it gives me much more information about what this job was doing but yes. [00:34:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your first goal is to get call backs and then to be able to ask more questions if somebody gives you an interview.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I find out when I don't get enough information, like with the whole ancestry.com job that I find out after it, theirs had an annoying application form too that I didn't fill out. I wrote their cover letter and all that stuff and then several months later they call me back about it and then they're like oh we're interested in you and then it's like oh by the way yes, all the work you're doing is all the way out in Westford. Oh it's only going to be a three-month job and it's $13.50 an hour. And it's 40 hours a week. So you don't even get the benefit of being part-time or something. So I was just - all those things added up.</p>

<p>But it's like after I had done all that work because they didn't tell me. They could've at least put, because they put contractor position but that could mean anything. It didn't necessarily mean temporary, you know, and they didn't put anything about a salary around there and, so. And I - the more - if I applied for more real three-year terms employment as archivist of X-rays or something like that, I know those jobs are going to be measly paid and all that stuff but also when I applied for three of those I never heard back from one of those because of all the experienced archivist who they actually want. And then there's me who's not as experienced. So I've never been - so I don't really think I'm going to get any archivist stuff any place jobs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you start someplace different. Maybe with a temporary position or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Temporary position that isn't all the way out in Westford or [inaudible], 40 hours a week for $13.50 an hour because that just added up to feed. [00:36:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that doesn't bear on you applying for other things. I know that that was disappointing to find that out about that position, but don't let that preclude you from applying for something else that might go differently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I mean I know applying sort of — I applied for two of the Business School and I believe they didn't think of me as lazy because I applied for the senior position and I just wrote I'd also be willing to be considered for the junior position. But I don't know. Someone once said that they in general the harder-like things are going through the system. I'm just so afraid of getting that same - you know, seeing that same recruiter, the one that interviewed me before, and have them come across my application from somebody else and be like oh I already interviewed that person for that position and she was totally inept at her interview and therefore any application now for Yale will be screened out based on that, following that previous interview.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know that, right? You don't know that that recruiter's going to remember your name or that it's the same person. There's probably lots of applications that come through Yale and there's probably lots of people that process things and there's probably lots of phone interviews. They may not remember your name. Don't let that scare you from applying for something you want if you see something that comes up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's just that it's so hard to lick those wounds especially. If I was applying to a job at U Mass or something and apply to another job at U Mass and never heard from them, then I've never heard back from them and that's actually less discouraging just because I want this interview and therefore they might have, you know, because they keep information on the candidates.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They might and they might not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You actually log in at Yale and you have an account for applying for jobs and stuff and so they know what other jobs you've applied for. [00:38:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's in the computer system.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So therefore...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that doesn't mean a person actually remembers or puts a face or a voice to the name.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, when they put the results of that interview would they like oh, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know that she thinks of it as totally bombed? You would think of it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, to her tone of voice and stuff and not reacting to things the way I would've expected someone who knew anything about the field at all to react because she didn't know anything about the field. And because I didn't like getting contacted further, I pretty certain that I did. Like, I'm pretty sure that she thinks of it that way too. Of course I have no way of knowing but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't help you to think of it that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm right. It would be like if you had a job interview and you think something that would objectively be bad and everyone would know it was bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't matter if you're right. It only matters if it's handicapping you in your process for applying for jobs. You can't get jobs that you don't apply for and if you are creating barriers for yourself by thinking of it that way and not applying for it, then there's no way that you can get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I'm streamlining the process by not applying for all the jobs that I wasn't going to get anyways because there's already this barrier there that's not created by me not applying so much as created by me ruining any chance of ever getting a job at Yale.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what have you just done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you just done in that exchange?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, fine I created a barrier but what if that barrier were really there?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I see that you did was you convinced yourself that you don't need to apply for anything at Yale. How is that helping you? [00:40:09]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because if I'm right, then I'm not spending time applying for things at Yale that I wasn't going to get anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you're wrong?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I might not have gotten those jobs anyway even if I did apply because I think I had so few interviews and stuff that - I don't know. I really don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So leave it at the don't know because that's probably your most accurate guess is that you don't really know and it's what actually what leaves you a little possibility. That doesn't matter to me if you apply. You're the one that wants a job and you're the one that feels badly right now for not having one. So let yourself make choices that allow you to feel better, not more trapped. Being more trapped doesn't actually make you feel better. We're both on the same side. You and both want you to feel better and to find a job that you like. Why don't we stop here for today and I'll see you on Monday.</p>

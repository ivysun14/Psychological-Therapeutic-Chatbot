<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's my spiel that I have to say, all right.  So how are you doing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you think of this medication so far?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, it's not really, like I don't really get like any side effects.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't really feel like it's helping.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?  You don't notice it helping in the way that you had noticed when you were on the Adderall?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's definitely more subtle, it's definitely more subtle, I, I think I showed you last time that, uh, if we were to look at a graph of you know, uh, this way is concentration and this way is time, if you take an Adderall, woo you know peaks quickly you notice it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then it does wear off within 4 to 6 hours.  And then typically people take another dose.  So for a long time they've had something called Adderall XR, which is slow release medicine, which they market to be used once in the morning and kind of simulate taking it 2 or 3 times a day.  And some people find that works great.  Some people don't like that one or they find it works okay if they take some in the morning and some in the afternoon.  Uh, so the Vyvanse is very similar to the Adderall XR and the company which makes all 3 of these medicines contend that it's even better.  In terms of maintaining it's level and by working all day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now the 1 wrinkle is that we gave you a pretty modest dose.  We gave you 30 mg a day and I always start people low cause we're just starting treatment so I always start people low, if I over shoot then you get all jittery and you know you lose your appetite and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's not good.  So I started low, as if you're taking 10 mg of Adderall a day, which is a small dose, so we can increase that.  But first, I wanted to see, I know that you had tried, on some occasions the Adderall but you've never been on it on a regular basis.  I figured let's try it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see.  So in a way so far, so good, it's not bothering you.  So I would say the next step would be to take 2 because it's a 30 mg pill and they talk about going up to a max of 70 mg.  So 2 would be 60.  And that, that would be pretty much you know similar—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And maybe at that level you'd notice it more probably.  It's not going to wear on and wear off the way the Adderall does it's going to be more subtle, it's not going to hit you rapidly, you know it's going to be a little more subtle and gentle.  And it's going to be there all day and a lot of you know moderate level and then it's going to kind of wind down in the evening so you can sleep.  So I think if we had you on a higher dose you'd see, you'd notice hey it really is doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah cause what's it called.  Classes are coming up soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right no and you need to be able to, have you tried to read or, uh, do any kind of thing like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a couple times, not really, I didn't really like click.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I, I thought like maybe once like, okay well not really um, um, feeling more concentrated but maybe I should pick up you know try to pick up a book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And see what happens, and it didn't really work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah all right, well I think that's a simple answer would be, let's increase it, uh, the good news is it's not bothering you because that's the key.  You know if it's not bothering we can always go up in dosage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I mean like I got like an upset stomach like once or twice but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh so there was a little something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Quickly, not like the uh Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Kind.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But you didn't mind?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just make sure I eat before I take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay that's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like eat a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that doesn't really bother me when I get an upset stomach.  Once in a while cause I always get upset stomachs no matter what anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what I think I'll do is uh you should have a few left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, let's go up to 2 and do you know what mg you had taken in the past?  Do you know how much it was?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  All right.  So let's go up to 2 and we'll get a feeling for that and based on how that hits you we can figure out what dosage you might land on.  But, uh, yeah, I'd like to follow through with this one, I think it's good.  How are you feeling otherwise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, pretty happy, well I'm happy cause I just won like, I went to the casino—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, that's cause I'm of age there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I won like $1,800.00 I was like, I came away with for my age that's pretty good.  I mean I was up $2,100.00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Aye, aye, aye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It started out with just $100.00 bill and then I hit like the $1,000.00 jackpot with one of the slot machines—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then the next day I played the same one and then hit another $500.00.  And then it just kept going on from there.  But then I had $2,100.00 and then I lost it because I was being too like greedy like the gamblers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All slot machines?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, um at the, the last day I played Black Jack, my dad doesn't really like playing tables.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He likes slot machines, I don't know why so I ended up playing that a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So your parents are kind of gamblers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Once a year, 2 times a year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Finally they brought us and I was finally of age to go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it was nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, in the U.S. you have to be [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, um, yeah I'm always bad at, we went years ago, we went to the Caribbean and they gave you $25.00 chip to play at a Black Jack table each night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I know how to play Black Jack it's not hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We lost every night.  O for 5 so we're not really lucky with that but, uh, that's pretty cool that you won that much money.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what are you going to do with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well I bought, I bought a new phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I thought okay I'm just going to buy like something, I bought the I Phone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I really wanted it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The G, the newest one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I got that which was only like 300 some and I think I'm going to wait until I get some more pay checks and wait until it kind of fills it up and maybe you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Believe me I thought about so many things I can get.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't just blow it.  Don't just blow it, that's good.  Um, did you already have AT&T um into the phone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the I phone's pretty cool?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cause it looks good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's all right, I'm still getting used to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Someone, someone had showed me one and it just seemed fun.  But, uh, when, cause when we first met, we were really talking about you both having depression and inattention.  And, I mean, obviously you feel good that you won the money, but how about otherwise, in terms of being back here, finishing school here, all these kind of things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I, I don't know, I can't really tell if, like I, I don't know.  I, hold on I'm trying to think.  I think that, like I still have like some depression but I don't know it's a lot of like the years and stuff.  So I don't know if that's like what it is or if or I don't know.  So I'm hoping, I'm hoping that with maybe like if, when this medication starts working and I start like the very beginning of school in a couple weeks hopefully I'll start to feel better about like what I'm doing there and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll be busy and stuff, so hopefully that will help, but if it doesn't well I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, we'll see how you do, so you feel if you can concentrate and you can do everything at school, you'll feel a lot better?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I, I don't' know, I don't really have a lot of confidence when it comes to school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right were there other things that you think were also contributing to you feeling depressed?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean just a lot, I don't know.  I can't really think of any, any one, some reasons I don't even know why you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah I just, I don't know why.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I think we should stay open to it because I, I do think that this medicine is going to help with your concentration if we find the right dose.  But and I do think that you'll feel better, you know if you could demonstrate how smart you are by doing better in school, I think that will, that'll really help you feel better.  But it may not solve everything, so if you continue to feel depressed even though things are kind of going okay for no apparent reason, then we should stay open to either you, you meeting with someone and or you know being on an antidepressant medicine.  If it's a little bit—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd have it, probably have you talk with someone.  If it's a lot then we might consider being on antidepressant medicine.  Cause there's a lot of other different ones other then Cymbalta.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'd like to see you [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah I mean if it was a first try and it happens a lot of times.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know I, actually I think I just like with the Cymbalta I think I freaked myself out more then I, like I needed to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was just like at night time, like before bed I would look up online like you know blogs and forums, like all these, all this stuff about what people say about it just to get their insight.  And like, and then I came across like so many things, I don't even know if they were true or not but, kind of just like you know like there's over like 150 side effects and how, and I'm like, oh my God.  And then it just made me more paranoid and then I have bad anxiety so that kicked in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It probably didn't make me fell better you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well there's a lot of, there is a lot of misinformation out there.  It's almost like, you ever go to Amazon and you look up like a CD or a book and people rate them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see the same CD people say best record ever, and someone else, the next person say, sucked I wasted my $10.00 you know and so the truth is probably somewhere in between.  And with all these blogs, you know everyone has a, people have an axe to grind you know who have some bad experience typing furiously into the computer.  People that kind of do okay or better they're busy, they're not doing that.  So you have to be careful I mean there are a lot of useful authorized sites like Web MD and, and what not that you know that if you google depression you'll see some, like the National Institute of Mental Health, these are real kind of medically backed scientific sites that have useful information.  There's other ones that are kind of blogs and everyone just types in their feelings and again you'll see somebody says Cymbalta saved my life, it was awesome I feel so much, I've never felt this well.  And you'll see another person said avoid this medicine it causes 12,000 side effects.  They all have potential side effects, no question, never going to have any really serious side effects cause if they did they wouldn't give us the approval and even if they got approved they figured out that they had a problem.  So you know whatever I gave you I try and give you the most common side effects, but if, but it could cause other ones that aren't unusual.  If you get those you just hold off and you call me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh I remember, one of the things that really like, I thought you made a mistake, I don't know what, it's like Cymbalta, I mean it said like Cymbalta is for like major depression disorder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was like, what do they mean by major and so I started thinking about that.  And I was like well I would think major would be like red flag like suicide level so maybe this medicine is for like people who like are thinking about killing themselves so it like, it triggers that kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Well they also caution that in young people, it's unusual, but it's possible for someone to actually feel a little worse.  You know uh, for example, uh people who take antihistamines usually get tired, or that sleeping medicine that's in Tylenol PM.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But occasionally someone will get like hyper and wired from it.  So it's the same with antidepressants, most of the time if they're going to do anything they're going to help.  Occasionally someone can feel worse.  So you know anything can cause anything.  But there's really only 2 kinds of depression, there's major depression and what is called, the other word for minor depression is dysphonia and it's really a continuum.  People who have more or less moderate symptoms, but very mild symptoms they don't come in for treatment.  People with moderate symptoms they call it dysphonia.  If they're more severe, they call it major depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But even among major depression, there's a wide continuum of people who are still going to work or school but they're somewhat miserable to people who are dangerously depressed.  So you know they, the medications actually get approved for major depression because it's considered more severe and it's inferred that they also work for the milder depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But when they, when they study them, they usually study them in moderately severe outpatients.  So that they can say, well if it can work in this person, if it's milder it will certainly work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's the story.  So we're going to go up on the Vyvanse to 60, which is a better dosage and you know we'll give it some time.  And we'll see where we land, what, what other questions do you have?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, nothing right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you been back to the uh the [NAME OTHER] situation?  Have you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who was that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh he was the psychologist who did the testing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have you been back there last week or 2?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like did I, I'm sorry, like the last time I came here did I already visit him 2 times or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think so yeah.  That was it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah that was it.  But they're going to use that info to see if you can get extended time on tests?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah he said that, he was even like, I forget what it's called 401K or something.  Okay whatever it's called, special programs in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But  I told him I, I don't' know, like I think those people who get that in my school are called special ed kids, I think I'm not sure they even have that because I've never seen a program like that in my school unless they're like special ed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah I don't' know.  It's not a 401K that's like a retirement program.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But he, he's probably saying there's a state law with some number or something that uh insists that if people need special attention they get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That would be my guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well then he said something like there are certain colleges that, like if you have a hard time like listening for a long period of time, then like they have these special programs where the college pays for a tutor to write down the notes for you, that's why I'm like all this stuff and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That, that's true, there are certain colleges that are more sensitive to kids with uh these kinds of things and, and either they have a note service or they might have a special program to help you organize your studying or uh give you more time on exams to finish, different things like that.  I'm sure, I mean, I think you're going to be doing better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I'm sure you know we'll figure it out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know I think he just really wanted me to do like this uh, he asked me to like do this thing like he asked my parents actually and me if I wanted to choose the non medication route and do this um computer simulation that's break through but it was like thousands of dollars.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, he was just like kept on insisting and finally my mom brought my dad in the next time and he didn't even mention it, because I think he knew that the only reason why she brought him in was because you know she felt uncomfortable like without him, like talking about that.  And she in the end didn't want to do it so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm not familiar with that, not to say that it might not be good but I really, I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just think that it's like, I don't know, it's, um, a lot of money and a lot of time.  And I already have no idea how I'd do that with work, school, clubs—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I've not heard about it but I, I could certainly ask him you know, maybe he could give me some more info on it.  All right so while we stop I'm going to you know, uh, let's bring your mom in okay—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me program this off.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PATIENT NAME], why do you think that you have ADHD?  [INAUDIBLE] read something about it and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My brother actually has it, and I don't know how prevalent it is in men, is it prevalent in men?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it is both men and women are equally affected.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  But I for the past—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But only problem, men have ADHD they can [INAUDIBLE] but ladies cannot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] ADHD they say, but I don't know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, and I don't think that I have the hyperactive part, but I have really bad, I cannot remember to do anything unless I write it down.  And it's been going on for a while.  And my doctor—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How was memory in middle school and high school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You had to go through school system with that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I've always had a problem like paying attention.  Like I get distracted very easily.  And like when I, I did okay in school but I would really have to, if I read something, I have to read it over and over and over again.  I can't remember it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So but you keep up with the, you know, other good grades and work related stuff compared to others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Do I what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You able to keep up the good grades you have to work extra than others?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, a lot, a lot extra.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And even with like when, you know, with my medications, with, like when I started with Takeda, um, and I got switched over to diabetes, they took 5 weeks of training and condensed it down into 2, and diabetes is very overwhelming.  I mean, it's just, it's so much, it's a lot to, I used to sell for overactive bladder and then, um, sleep medications.  And it was just so much, like the sleep disorders I caught on to pretty easily just because I'm familiar with those because, you know, I had a, I had insomnia for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was interested in it, so it was easy for me to catch on to, but this diabetes, I mean, I was really nervous about it because it was so much information in a little bit of time.  And I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, diabetes is a very wide subject.  There's an old saying if you know diabetes you know everything about medicine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I can believe it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's true.  That's actually every organ in the body.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  But, um, so years ago my doctor, you know, thought that maybe some of my forgetfulness, because I wasn't as bad then as it is now—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How many years ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, gosh, probably I would say maybe 7, 7 maybe 8.  But she put me on, I've been antidepressants, and it's not helping and I'm not, I don't feel depressed.  I mean, I'm not—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, why do you, you tell the doctor that you have trouble concentrating?  Why they give you the antidepressant?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, well, at the time I was going through a divorce.  And I was forgetting things, but not to the extent that I am right now.  But I was more depressed back then, but I'm not now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what medicine they gave you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, Wellbutrin XL.  I've been, I was on Zoloft before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now I've been on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg for several years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Um, Wellbutrin SR, XL came only 3 or 4 years.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's SR, yeah, I get the 2 mixed up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay, they are both same.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, whatever it's 150 mg one, it's the SR or XL.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's not much difference anyway I guess.  Well, XL they say is more long acting than SR is.  That is only difference.  And both are, both are generic now, so it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, um Wellbutrin is a good medicine and sometimes we use it for adult ADHD too in the beginning and see if it helps them or not.  But, so what happened when you take Wellbutrin?  How do we, did you see any change at all or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, it helped me as far as, you know, I mean, I think back then I was a little bit depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But as far as the forgetfulness, I mean, it's getting, it's getting worse and worse and it got to the point where I had to buy a journal to write everything down that I was doing for the day so I wouldn't forget.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lot of people are computer, um, they have to get everything on the computer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But even to the point like right now it's starting to affect my work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you mainly say are distractable and you cannot concentrate?  That's the main problem?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, and I'm forgetting things, all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, um, you know, if you cannot concentrate you can forget, you know.  For memory, first we have [INAUDIBLE] store it and they have to to recall it.  Those are the things that takes, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So most of the time, people, if they don't pay attention and they don't [INAUDIBLE].  If you don't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, and I'm trying.  I mean, I really try.  And it doesn't happen all the time, but I really try to pay attention but I can't all the time.  But this, you know, that's not what I'm worried about.  Like my forgetting things is getting, like for instance, um, when, was it summer, I think it was either winter, winter taxes, property taxes came out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I pay all my bills on time.  Well, I got a notice a while back that I didn't pay it.  And this was back in May.  And I had to pay it by a certain date or else I was going to get like extra charges on there.  So we had gone away for a couple of weeks and I thought that I paid it.  Well, I got another letter, probably about 6 weeks ago, saying that I didn't pay it and I got a letter from my mortgage company and this was the second time, and I was looking through my bank statements, I was looking through credit card bills to see if, because sometimes like I'll charge it and then pay it off because I get points.  Nothing.  I didn't pay it both times.  Either time I did not pay it.  And the second time I got it, I thought that, you know, I said something's going on because I paid this bill, and I didn't pay it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Call them and say you pay it but they said you didn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well, no, but I mean, because I'm very good about paying my bills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, most of us [INAUDIBLE] sometimes we will forget.  For instance I forgot to pay the phone bill sometimes too and then they call, I guess.  Here's what I don't know [INAUDIBLE] see the bill and file it away to pay later, but sometimes you forget when that happens.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that is normal though for some people I guess to not paying this.  I'm talking about when you are to watch a movie, you're able to concentrate until the end?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I watch a movie?  Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about when you're in class or something?  You cannot keep it for a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a harder time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a harder time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Most of the times the ADHD, in the beginning they concentrate, but they just drift away.  And you think about it all the time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, you have some things to think about?  Is something bothering you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think about work a lot.  No, I'm not bothered by anything, it's just that I think that like for me like with this—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you really about your conscious about your work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm very conscious about my work.  And that's why I'm worried now because we have, like when we leave samples for physicians, we have to write down the lot numbers on a card.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's normal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, if we get anything wrong on the sample form you get a letter and you have to correct it and you get points.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, I am getting a lot of points and I'm writing down the wrong lot numbers, like I'll write down like instead of a 4, 2, I'll write 2, 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Or instead of an A, I'll write a C.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is very typical of ADHD.  Those things.  You can write some now and then wrong numbers, but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But last, gosh, in the past—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that, you know, more often.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the past 2 weeks I got 3 more of these letters and I finally, I called my boss yesterday and I said, "[NAME OTHER]," I said, "I want to make you aware of something."  I said, "I am really good,"  [PHYSICIAN NAME], I will take the box and look at it, because I am very conscious, I do not want to get any more of these points because I don't want to have a disciplinary letter.  And when you get to a certain level—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] make sure that you're verify it I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Twice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean, even since—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How about you doing other things, you are very clean and neat, check your dose and all that?  Do you [INAUDIBLE] any of those things happen to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm really not very organized at home anymore.  And I don't know, it's got progressively worse, but I think I picked up on it, back in April when I moved over to diabetes I also switched territories, so I like work down in [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED], so I work far away from home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  So you live in [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I live in, I live here in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I live in the township.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I mean my day is really long and then by the time I get home it's like, you know, I plan on, you know, getting things done around the house, but I just don't because I'm just, I just don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  So it is going on for how many years, but it's maybe getting worse because you have changed a job assignment and have learned new things.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's gotten, it probably started getting worse probably about maybe a year and a half, 2 years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But not to the extent that it is right now.  I mean now it's getting really bad.  And there's been a couple of times that since June on my way home from work I'm having trouble staying awake.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take, I have Meniere's disease.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so I had surgery, but my doctor wanted to, he wanted to put me on [INAUDIBLE] and he wanted me to take valium every day and I was like nah, I just don't, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Valium, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What is that for, to calm you down or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it was, it helps with the, the, um, vertigo, but I don't have vertigo every day, so he said that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, usually they give an [INAUDIBLE] for vertigo [INAUDIBLE] valiums?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Well, I was, when I first was diagnosed with it and I was seeing, um, oh gosh, Doctor, uh, he's right here, he's an ENT, great guy, um, he prescribed me valium on a PRN basis, and it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It really didn't help me so I didn't, you know, when I would have the vertigo the valium didn't help me very much, so I just didn't take it, because I don't want to take something if I don't need it and it doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how often do you take your sleeping pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just take it, now I take it on a PRN basis, but I was taking it every night for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  So you saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] ago?  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it was probably, it was several, several years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?  What, he's the one that prescribed the Wellbutrin or what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] put me on the Zoloft.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  So you went there when you were going through what problems at that time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, at the time that's when I was married and I was in a verbally and physically abusive relationship.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wouldn't say, I mean, how do you define hyper?  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] school or not, you are going and you have a lot of friends and you kind of—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I had a lot of friends.  I was very outgoing, but I wasn't hyper I don't think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, outgoing is definitely hyper.  Some people have more energy than others, which is good I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people are a little more shy, they're not as, some people are more reserved than others.  That is all personality and all that stuff.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you were popular when you were in high school?  You play sports and all that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not so much anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if I can't like now I'm either dead tired that I can fall asleep no problem, or if I'm thinking about a lot of things then that's when I have a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  So you drink socially?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just socially.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nope.  Um, she did have, um, she had hypothyroid and then, then she was treated with hyperthyroid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually they treat the hyper and then it become hypo.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then maybe that's what it was.  It was, you're right, because I don't know, but she was eating a bunch and she wasn't gaining any weight and then all of a sudden she put it on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually when they're hyper, they burn [INAUDIBLE] thyroid and they're hypo [INAUDIBLE].  You are tested for thyroid problems?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Well, that's good though.  Oh, you have nice big eyes, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Everybody, you know, I have had physician ask me if I have thyroid problems because my eyes are so big.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that is usually notice as doctors.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So, you know, that's why I'm asking, because we have, usually have hyper though, hyper and usually eyes, you have beautiful eyes get bigger.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And also they have more energy and other stuff like that.  So [INAUDIBLE] if we are more energy get so many things, they are more distractable than others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is one of the things usually.  Want to make sure that you don't have.  Who's your family doctor, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Yeah, oh, she's very nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, she's very nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is her office now?  She used to be here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is over, um, is it, [DEIDENTIFIED].  It's a new road behind, um, Lowe's.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, is it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well she's changed offices so many times.  She's with the other lady doctor here—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], yeah.  They diverted now I guess so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're still together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] there too?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, yeah, it's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], I think there's a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in there, and then, um, there's somebody else in there too and I can't remember her name.  Very nice lady, I've met her before.  I can't remember her name though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Well, uh, looking at your symptoms, um, your brother has it, and, uh, usually it runs in the family and you have some symptoms, mainly distractable it is very common.  And symptoms rarely hyper now that usually happens when they are younger most of the time.  Not when they are—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Adult, and you're going to have hyperactive.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there's mainly problems, distractability and not able to concentrate due to [INAUDIBLE] other things, and, uh, I think it is good though you're taking Wellbutrin.  It is a good medicine, but it's, um, uh, usually we do that for intervening for some people, now we have better medicines, we are not doing that routine for.  There is no kind of a test or anything to do.  You know, a lot of people [INAUDIBLE] not very reliable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's not?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually mainly the symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is more we base on things.  So did you ever try any other medicines apart from Wellbutrin and Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yes.  Effexor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Effexor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  That different for, um, ADHD we usually use a different medicine now.  It is only much better than the ones that we used to use for, you know, like Ritalin, you know, other stuff, you know.  Other stimulants I guess.  So this medicine is produced by [INAUDIBLE] and it usually works very good for a lot of people.  So then usually you'll take it a month or something and then see any response to it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, that long?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, anything that's connected with the emotions takes longer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And anything that, you know, and also takes some time and also a lot of people will try to do what they call brain exercise.  You know, reading, reading more often, and read 1 chapter and close the book and try to memorize and see how can remember.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And like any time, you know, when you do exercise and you get more power in your hand and same thing brain exercise.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You try to remember things and sometimes very hard things, a number or something, if you do that regularly, then concentration will get.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	See, and that's what I thought too because I read, I've been reading about this for a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, well, the thing is that reading is a little different though.  We have a lot of students [INAUDIBLE] if you read a chapter and you know to close the book [INAUDIBLE] try to remember what you read.  Some people will go on reading, but by the time we close the book we don't know what we read.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And that's what happens to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is not good.  That is not good way of reading.  You read a book and, and then if you know you are going to think about it, then you concentrate more on what you're reading.  Otherwise, you know, you do it for reading sake I hope, 100 pages or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And all the light reading that you do for [INAUDIBLE] of course certain things we have to remember when textbooks or some other things, you have assignments to do and all that.  You know, then you have concentrate more and you have to sometimes you have to memorize it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then when you read and you close and try to think about it, then that will help you to, uh, to restore and retain in the mind much better then go back and see then you can remember better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you don't [INAUDIBLE] then we cannot, or some people, a lot of people, you are not student, when we are students, they discuss about it and some people, you know, everybody is different.  Some people are good.  When, you know, somebody reads they remember very well or some people can read to them, but some people when they hear they can remember very well, or some people pictures can see pictures, then they can remember too.  So it is, it really is about how our, you know, centers [INAUDIBLE] brain that concentration and visual things and hearing and things like that.  And people hear they cannot you know—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People read [INAUDIBLE].  Some people, you know, some, there are so many people especially in elementary and middle school and now that when you listen to the teacher they get [INAUDIBLE] they don't need to read it.  And they don't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because I'm more of a visual person.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So everybody's different.  Some people watch movie they can remember for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if they're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever.  Well, the medicine we usually use is Strattera.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, usually it doesn't make you feel usually tired in the beginning for a few days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It will make me tired?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's one of the side effects.  The medicine is working on your brain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you only take at nighttime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It might even help you sleep better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It won't make me tired, because I mean I've been having problems while I'm driving.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, usually we start with the low dose, 40 mg.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see the usually between we'll start 40 then usually if you are doing and get used to that, we go to 60.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why don't we try 40, maybe take, you know, today [INAUDIBLE] hopefully you don't need to drive tomorrow something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't need to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So take tonight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And see how you do and usually you may feel a little when you wake up a little lazy I guess, so you have your coffee and take your shower [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is not a sedative at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay, yeah, because I can, I mean, I have to get up at 5:00 every morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Also some people say it does, it change your appetite too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, good, that's a good thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people lose weight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, as long as I don't gain weight, we're good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	People lose weight on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That is okay with you I guess [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's, yeah, that's perfect.  Um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We'll only do it up to a, we can test then after a month or 2, then usually if you are taking it, we want to do the liver function test and make sure liver enzymes are right or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really, why?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, usually that is a [INAUDIBLE] for anything.  Anything that, uh, that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it's metabolized through the liver?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially if you are losing too much weight, then your liver enzymes may go up and most probably want to make sure that it is not, a lot of people don't have any problems at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm just telling what are the areas things we can, you want to know about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, I, so it's not going to affect me like next week when I have to work?  Getting up in the morning?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Should not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	These are not a tranquilizer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] most probably do that for only for a few days after [INAUDIBLE].</p>

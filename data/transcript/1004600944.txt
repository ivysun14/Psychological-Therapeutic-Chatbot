<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's push the button.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) came in for graduation. That was okay. That was fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay and fine. What does that really mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just okay. And fine means there weren't any fireworks, which I didn't expect there would be. What happened to your cactus?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It really died. I really had to give in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Okay. There's something missing, those dead patches.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was letting him hold on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like part of him was alive. I don't know. I just — (pause) I'm not sure that I can tell my dad the things I need to tell him at his age.</p>

<p>[01:18.3]</p>

<p>You know, he's — (pause) He's flawed like everyone, but I don't think he necessarily takes responsibility for things that he feels he's sufficiently dealt with. My mother raised all of us kids to be very conscientious, very thoughtful, and yet not very much of it seemed to rub off on him. (pause)</p>

<p>[02:33.2]</p>

<p>A lot is coming up just in the fact that he's moving, selling his place that he and my mother had and moving out of Maine entirely. I'm not sure I told you he's remarried, and he's now going to be spending instead of three months in Michigan, three months in Maine and six months in Texas, he'll be one month in Maine in some sort of cabin, and the rest in Michigan and Texas.</p>

<p>I completely understand it. There's no problem there at all. It's how he's handling dealing with the items that are still important to the rest of us. Yet he's making trips to Goodwill without consulting us.</p>

<p>[03:33.9]</p>

<p>My sister is probably more furious than I am. But it's just like, how can you — there's no urgency to sell the place. It hasn't been shown yet. It's been on the market for a month now. Anyway, that's all beside the point. He just doesn't think all the time about —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't think about how his choices or actions are affecting others, and that you guys might want a piece of what's in that house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. You know, it's the same story, just in a different way from 25 years ago, whenever it was. So, you know, I guess I don't know if he's evolved or is able to receive that information.</p>

<p>[04:29.6]</p>

<p>I mean, he's obviously still, you know, lacking the consideration for what his actions do. So I don't know what that means. I'm not dwelling on this a lot, but those things lead me to wonder if I can really communicate something like this to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would he really be able to understand what it is that you're trying to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, I mean, it's not that I want him to suddenly start thinking about other people's actions. I mean, I don't want him to not be who he is at 78. I just want him to know there are actions, I mean, there are consequences to his actions. So I don't know. I'm a little — (pause)</p>

<p>[05:28.1]</p>

<p>At the same time, I know I'm moving out of the country. In some ways, I don't want to leave it the way it is because right now, I don't think that I would probably call him very often. Or I would probably return his calls, but that's about it. That's the way it is now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often does that mean you speak with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Once every couple of weeks. (pause) If that. So, you know, that was on my mind during that time. (pause)</p>

<p>[06:28.5]</p>

<p>I don't know. At the same time, I wonder if I can draw on this current example as a way to point out how it's similar to — because he said "There were circumstances to this. I had to do things quickly." Whatever. But how do you explain that? It was such a long time ago. What were the circumstances there? And are you always clinging to circumstances in order to defend yourself?</p>

<p>So, I don't know. I've still got a lot of anger. (pause) And I'm not sure how it's affecting me. I don't like carrying it because when I think of him, I get angry. When I talk about him, I get angry. (pause)</p>

<p>[07:30.6]</p>

<p>And I don't know if dealing with this anger — well, if telling him about it will just kind of remove it from the center of my focus right now. Because it seems like — I don't know if for a long time, but for enough time, and I mean for enough time — my realization of the impact of his actions has been front and center.</p>

<p>It's not so much that I'm blaming every deficiency or lack of opportunity because of him. But I don't even want to have to think about it anymore. I just want to move on, basically.</p>

<p>[08:36.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Can you move on without sharing this with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I don't know. (pause) I don't know. (pause) I mean, if I do, I can't wait a long time. He's actually in really good health, but still. I'm still not sure about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you mentioned before wanting to do it before you moved because you'd be so far away.</p>

<p>[09:32.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I still have to do that. I'm also somewhat questioning — and not as a way to get out of it — just as really wondering. It's one thing to write it, but to actually deliver it to him and have that. (pause) I just don't want to use questioning its efficacy as an excuse not to do it.</p>

<p>But I've just decided I'm going to do it, like two seconds ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What pushed you to make a decision when you were just thinking about it?</p>

<p>[10:35.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I know difficult things are sometimes the best, often for the best. If I don't do it, it will never be right because I don't know how long I'll be gone and how long he's going to live. I don't want him dying with this still hanging over us, without him even knowing about it hanging over us. Basically hanging over me.</p>

<p>And if he can't handle it — I don't imagine that would be the case — but if he can't handle it, I've tried. I've basically told him what I want him to know. I haven't asked him to change. I haven't asked him for a grand apology.</p>

<p>[11:35.9]</p>

<p>I just want him to know that there were consequences that I can pin directly to this adolescence, the borders of which go beyond that incident. (pause) Maybe it will be good for his marriage, I don't know. (chuckles) I can't imagine he doesn't act the same way around his new wife.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, then really the purpose is for you to be able to let go of your anger. If there are benefits to him and to other relationships, that's a bonus. But the objective is really for him to be able to hear some things that you really want him to know.</p>

<p>[12:47.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's a way for you to be able to let go of the anger that affects you and affects your relationship with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean to me it's a way to set things right between him and me. Anything else is just bonus. So, yeah, that's that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did graduation itself mean for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's kind of odd. Actually I did talk about this briefly with my psychiatrist [up here] two weeks ago. You know, I leave it as a whole experience where I got more out of it than I would have just by attending classes, and considering nothing else. But there is a pattern here where I did extremely well, and yet I have no pride for it. I have no legitimate pride for it. Same thing with my past career in radio. I have no pride in it.</p>

<p>[14:48.1]</p>

<p>It doesn't mean I'm not aware that I did well in it, but she said "You don't have any pride in it" which I guess is true. She asked if I'd spoken to you about this, and I don't remember whether we had or not, but it seems like it's along the lines of things we have talked about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we've touched around that topic of just not being able to feel good about what you've accomplished. Not being able to see the good. And I wonder what stopped you from being able to take that in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's funny. It's like this twisted notion of this success where I don't want to take credit for it, but I want everybody to know about it. It's like I can't feel good about it, but I want other people to be impressed by it.</p>

<p>[15:53.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're aware that it looks good or sounds good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, whatever those things are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you won't believe it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) I don't know. I just seems like things ought to be harder than they are for them to be worth it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How hard does it have to be to be worth it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I guess I can't say I didn't struggle at times with my work or in school. But I don't know.</p>

<p>[16:53.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, having seen you along the way, I think you did work hard. You put a lot of time into languages and read a lot and wrote a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It's true. It's true. I ignore those things after the fact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like you forget or dismiss them after they happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And yet, yeah, you know. I mean, I think it was really just a matter of having enough time to do everything. It's not like everything was really challenging. But I guess that's part of what makes it difficult, I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[17:46.8]</p>

<p>I don't know what that's about. I mean, I can sort of attribute it to my low self-esteem, if that makes sense. I don't know. (pause) But I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's kind of like a chicken-and-the-egg type of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you could allow yourself to take in and recognize yourself, some of your accomplishments, maybe your esteem would be higher.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If my esteem were higher, maybe I could appreciate these things without too much effort.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you kind of have to let yourself start somewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[18:42.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there anything about which you can feel good? Anything you do that derives some pride?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Even my marriage is tainted because of what I've done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The whole thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's an indelible scar. I can't undo that. (pause) It's not that it's bad, it's just scarred. (pause)</p>

<p>[19:46.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With that said, can you allow yourself to feel pride in the things you're doing right in your marriage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Technically, I suppose I could. (pause) I just wonder how many things I do out of guilt. I don't drink because of (inaudible at 20:19.0). I don't — (pause) I guess I just wonder if I'm doing those things that are good for the marriage because of guilt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And therefore they don't count?</p>

<p>[20:45.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, they count but I guess we've been over this a few times. What is the quality of the motivation? Is it honorable or is it just kind of a reflex?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess as I look at it, some things have more than one motivation. So for example, deciding not to drink anymore. Partly that's motivated by guilt. Partly that's motivated by fear — "What would happen if I did drink?"</p>

<p>But there's also another piece of that motivation that maybe feels sort of positive to me, like "I want my wife to feel more comfortable. I want her not to worry." And that seems like a very positive motivation, making it easier for her. And that's not completely undone by the others.</p>

<p>[22:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah, that's true. But I guess I even wonder if I can even feel so good about not drinking anymore. I guess everything is put under this microscope of what are its components. Would I drink if she divorced me? I sometimes I think about that. Not because I want a drink, but I just wonder about it. I don't think I would actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what does that mean for you? That you would continue to stay away from alcohol even if it wasn't for the sake of the marriage?</p>

<p>[22:57.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. To me I seem to have had enough exposure to — I mean, I've had the chance to monitor my inability to handle alcohol for some 25 years. I think it's clear to me that I cannot handle it in a way that I would want to. (pause) I mean, it has implications on my marriage as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that then seems like a really healthy life choice for you, of which I would imagine it would make sense to feel proud.</p>

<p>[24:06.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But look at the alternative. Plenty of people chose the alternative, recognizing that alcohol creates problems in their lives, creates problems in their marriages or relationships, yet continue to drink. It seems that recognizing that it causes problems personally and inter-personally, and then choosing not to do it actually sounds like a really healthy choice. Healthy choices are something of which we can feel proud.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He says begrudgingly. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 24:48.3) I just can't —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't feel it for a lot of things. I don't know. I think it's just a bad day. (pause)</p>

<p>[25:17.5]</p>

<p>I guess I just wonder if my inability to feel pride in all sorts of things that I could conceivably feel proud about, contributes to the fact that things in my future I'm really anxious about because I have doubts. Unless I recognize the things, the accomplishments and successes I have had, that I will continue to have doubts about everything in the future.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if an easier way to maybe test the waters and let yourself begin to experience — pride is a really strong feeling — I wonder if starting with something smaller, recognition or acknowledgement for things you've done, for choices you've made, might be an easier way to start letting yourself sort of tiptoe into the idea of being proud of yourself.</p>

<p>[26:17.2]</p>

<p>Pride in oneself is different than feeling proud of a particular action or choice. It might be easier to start smaller. I think before pride comes, at least acknowledging that yeah, that was a good sensible sound decision, might be an easier place to let yourself in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I believe you. I guess beyond recognition, how do you express pride in a healthy way? I mean, besides just an inner glow, what does that look like?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is a feeling rather than necessarily something someone would notice on the outside.</p>

<p>[27:16.1]</p>

<p>I think someone who feels pride in themself might portray a sense of confidence, which others might experience as not needing to seek validation or seeking counsel from others. Not feeling like you need someone to sort of validate the choices you're making or help you make decisions about something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or give you feedback.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or give you feedback on things. But trusting yourself, I think — having pride in something you've done in the past might give you the confidence to do something in the future and trust yourself that you're going to be successful, that you can do something. But I think it really is an internal sense of "Yeah, I did good at that. I can conquer. I can meet that challenge. I can conquer that."</p>

<p>[28:24.7]</p>

<p>I often think back to my children or other kids that I've seen, because they express things in a much more transparent way than adults do. Developing confidence and pride is something that starts to happen at a pretty young age. I think of my littlest one who is almost three, and he very clearly expresses pride when he's trying something. Usually he's trying something I don't want him to do, like this week he figured out how to unlatch the gate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wonderful. Good for him. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Yeah, it was about 15 minutes after we moved into the house, as I heard him say "I did it!" with this glow, and his hands went up into the air like "ta-da." That's pride. He was very proud of himself for accomplishing this feat he had set out for himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though it was just 10 minutes before? (chuckles)</p>

<p>[29:19.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (chuckles) So I think that would partly translate into an adult feeling because it's not very often you see adults walking around like "I did it!" But that feeling that you want to do that and believing in yourself that you just did something pretty cool, whether that be graduate or meet a bar you set for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. I don't want to keep going back to my dad, but I know we've talked about this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a pretty important relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's how he was raised. His mother didn't praise him for his accomplishments, lest he get a big head, and that's how he raised us.</p>

<p>[30:22.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I do think there's a difference between being able to feel proud of oneself and being conceited, being a brat.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I do too. But I think for fear that pride would run amok is what the consideration was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so I think it would be very true that because your dad learned not to praise, not to highlight accomplishments for fear you wouldn't be able to distinguish that sense of accomplishment and in portraying an overly-developed ego to others, he didn't give you those experiences. So now you have a trickier job of figuring out where that line is for yourself, and not denying yourself that sense of accomplishment because you don't want to take it over the top.</p>

<p>[31:25.8]</p>

<p>There's a huge difference, to go back to that example, of my kid experiencing that sense of pride and accomplishment in himself and not necessarily saying "I'm a cooler kid than you because I can do that." That's the difference. It's perfectly okay feeling proud of yourself for accomplishing something. That's noteworthy. Getting your degree, being accomplished in a career, those are noteworthy things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I'm going to have to create some sort of medium to express that. I don't know how to do that. (pause) It's funny. As I said earlier, the will is there, but there's this clamp that's on it. I want people to know about it, and yet when people say stuff to me like "That is so great," I downplay it like "Yeah, I don't know."</p>

<p>[32:46.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright, so what could you say instead? Because when you say "Yeah, I don't know," you send a message to them and to yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I do it all the time with things that I know are good and impressive and meaningful to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's practice a new response.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) (pause) Ummm, "Thank you. I'm really excited to have completed this program."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds lovely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) It sounds so canned.</p>

<p>[33:42.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so say it again and have it sound a bit little more natural.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Ummm —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Same words, just let yourself feel what it actually feels like to feel that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) To feel pride?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you said you felt excited to have completed the program.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that was sort of — (chuckles) I mean, I am excited to be done with the work, but I don't know. It's like an illness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So this is a little bit of a method. Pretend you're doing method acting. Pretend you're excited. Make me believe.</p>

<p>[34:39.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I was doing that earlier, but I don't know how convincing I was to myself. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) Nope, didn't work. That's why you produce the show rather than being a guest of the show. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yes, yes, yes. I used to tell other people how to act and how to sound. (pause) It shouldn't be as hard as it is. (pause)</p>

<p>[35:42.2]</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'm excited about my future. I don't know what the past two years necessarily will contribute to my future, but I'm happy to be done with the program." That's kind of how I feel. (pause) It does seem kind of melancholy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if we cut some of that out, kept it true, and said something like "Thank you. I'm really glad to have completed the program." It's a little bit different than "I'm glad I'm done with it." I changed that a little bit, but it might still be true and allow you to take in some of the praise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah. (chuckles) I just don't think school is everything that it's cracked up to be, though everybody else still does. "Thank you. I'm happy to be — happy to have completed the program." Yeah.</p>

<p>[37:02.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does that sit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I'm reciting the prayers at church. (pause) I don't believe it. I just don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you recited it 1,000 times if you would start to believe it against your better judgment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 37:31.2)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The same way. I mean, the messages you did get over and over. Even though you didn't necessarily believe them, they did sink in.</p>

<p>[37:57.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, as I think you told me last time, in order to partly recognize the accomplishment, not just school but in the past two years everything (inaudible at 38:11.1), and that's what Dr. [anonymous] suggested as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I love it when we agree.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I don't know. I do want to do it. I will do it. (pause) I just — (pause) Yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you're a little scared to let yourself believe you've done something worthwhile, noteworthy things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Scared or just programmed.</p>

<p>[38:58.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But both can be changed. Part of choosing a message that's positive, even though it doesn't feel comfortable, but choosing a message that's positive and letting yourself hear it over and over again is kind of exposing you to a new program. Facing your fears is certainly one way to see whether they're worthwhile being afraid of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess though when I imagine a confident Bryce, I imagine somebody whose inability to recognize his accomplishments, to feel inferior, to feel insecure, he's not on the very top of my personality. I see somebody who is genuinely friendly, genuinely interested in what other people are doing.</p>

<p>[40:31.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those don't seem in conflict to me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, those aren't. But those are two things, they are the same thing to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, the confident and the genuinely interested don't seem in conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, no. But I mean, I just can't imagine not being riddled with insecurities and doubt. But when I imagine a confident Bryce, I just can't really imagine — I may have twisted it around when I said it before. I imagine somebody who doesn't need to talk about their accomplishments in order to fit in. Not that I do that anyway. I imagine somebody who just holds himself in confidence and humility at the same time. But I don't know. Should I just practice that? (chuckles)</p>

<p>[41:45.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And aim low, right? I mean, it doesn't have to be these two extremes of riddled with insecurities and totally confident. You can move just a little bit and be a little bit confident, a little bit less insecure, feeling a little bit more comfortable. I think aim to move a little bit in one direction rather than seeing this sort of complete 180.</p>

<p>You'll feel a difference when you're able to move into a slightly different category, rather than going into a completely different sphere. Would you label yourself differently? Maybe not. But I think it's clinically significant if you just feel a little bit better. That makes a big difference on what it would feel like to walk through your world, if you can move just a little bit in one direction.</p>

<p>[42:50.1]</p>

<p>Sometimes acting "as if", it's like choosing that message that you're going to say, even if it doesn't feel natural — hearing yourself say "thank you," hearing yourself take in that compliment or praise, it starts to affect you, and that happens over and over again. Acting as if you're confident and doing things you'd do when you're confident starts to seep in a little bit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really? It's clinically proven? (chuckles) Okay. Good. I'll try it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The things that we get exposed to over and over and over again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like violence on TV.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It works in a positive direction as well. We tend to study all these negative sides.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) I've been watching <i>Masterpiece Theatre</i>, so maybe that's why — it's still murder. But anyway, do we need to stop?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop, but we need to pick a time to meet again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Next week I'm out all week.</p>

<p>[43:47.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if we look at the week of the 18<sup>th</sup> —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's a good week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have time Monday afternoon, I have time Tuesday afternoon and Friday. A lot of possibilities.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't do Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. So I have a 2:30 or a 3:30 on —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, what do you have on Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Monday I could do 3:30 or 4:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How about 3:30?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so the 18<sup>th</sup> at 3:30. Do you want to look at the following week, the last week of June?</p>

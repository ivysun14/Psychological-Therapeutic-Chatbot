<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In their own light. (pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So where was I? (pause) So we went to the circus all weekend, there was a show.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Ian was doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There was a show Friday night, Saturday afternoon, Saturday night, and Sunday night, and I actually (pause) after the Saturday afternoon, I'm like, "You know, I'm just not feeling well. I don't know if I'll be at tonight's performance." I just blew off going Saturday night. But I went to all of the other three.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And some of the stuff is actually entertaining.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it all kids?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kids and adults. Like one of the things is tumbling, where little kids do tricks with their parents. Which Ian wants to do, but he's way too big for, you know. We were doing some of the stuff afterwards. There's this comedy routine that they do, and I couldn't hear it the first two shows but I finally heard it the last show and, "Oh, this is actually pretty funny." You know? But (pause) I'm not sure—I mean, I know he enjoys it, and he's probably going to do it for many years to come, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there's this thing called the Yo-Yo, which has two sticks with a string, and it spins on the string, it looks like a big yo-yo...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. I think I've seen that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So Jess bought him one of those, and that's one of the things—you know, some of these kids are really good, and a lot of kids do multiple skills and acts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They throw the thing up in the air and catch it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they do all of that. So he's getting into that. He wants still to do that at the same time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I saw him back there trying to do it, and he would drop it and pick it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) </p>

<p>CLIENT: So there was a program, and Jess took out an ad in the program. Which I thought was pretty—I was kind of pissed off about, and I'm trying to figure out why I'm pissed off, and I don't know if I'm just... I'm trying to justify my being pissed off at it. Why didn't she tell me I could advertise in it, or just... I think it's just the whole thing has me pissed off. </p>

<p>And she sent me an e-mail before I went to the championship about (pause) some of the accounts, when am I going to switch the accounts? And (pause) when am I going to start kicking some money over to her, paying some support. She's got all these expenses and what not. And I kind of put it off and put it off, and she was bothering me for it, bothering me for it. So on Saturday night I finally just wrote her an e-mail that said, "You know, I talked about what I'm going to do with the accounts. I've got money in them, I can't..." You know, the IOLA account she's still on. And I've got to figure out what to do with that. I guess I've got to open up new accounts, but she wants to use the personal account, our joint personal account, for paying just joint expenses like the taxes, and that I should get my own account to use for other... I mean, I have the USAA account, so I don't know why I can't use that. </p>

<p>But (pause) so, you know, I explained what was going on with the accounts, and then I was like, "You know, I think the extra money that you're getting for condo rent, the rent, my share of that is more than you're asking for." And I went in and I said, "If I make more money, I'd be more than happy to give more money to the kids, but you effectively—whether you intended to do it or not—you squeezed me out of the office. I have no office, I have no..." I don't remember exactly what I said. And I made it very clear that I was not happy about it, I said, "You ended the partnership, you squeezed me out of the office, and I'm not happy about it. And it's going to cost me money. I was making good money from that office, but now I'm not going to make." [00:05:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) I basically said that I don't want to argue about any of this. I just had more that I had to say. I said, "I'm really not doing well, health wise, and if my business comes back, I'll pay more money." And I got zero response. She didn't state something to me personally, or e-mail, or... it's the first time in our entire relationship that I've gotten the last word on anything. And I don't know if she just is finally just going to say, "Well, whatever, I disagree with him," or if she actually understood what I was trying to say. I'm like, "Yeah, I'm getting 1100 dollars more than he's getting in rent..." And originally that money was being put away for taxes and all these other things, and I ended up paying half the taxes anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been paying twice for them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she's been—had access to this extra source of funds that I have not. Plus, she's not paying a mortgage. So she's getting a whole 2600 dollars. I'm paying rent, so I get 1500 and I've gotta pay 1400. And I can't get my tenant to answer me that he's renewing or not, which kind of has me worried. Because he's the one that brought up the idea. I know they don't have the money to give first, last, and security, so I don't think they can move. But I just want him to respond, he's always been slow to respond. Just say, "Hey, yeah, I'm renewing." And that gives me at least until the closing to worry about making more money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it could be a pretty big deal, it seems to me, what you said to Jess. [00:07:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's true, though. In that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's part of why (laughing) I know it's a big deal, because I don't doubt that it's true. I mean, you don't lay it out for her like that very often, I don't think, and say, "You know, here's what I'm responsible for, here's how I'm doing my part, here's how it's going to be..." (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. You know, I want her to feel guilty about the whole office thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't think she is, and I don't think she gets it. For some reason, she wants her own practice, her own office. She just... I don't get it. It's like my success, the more money I make, the more money I could give to the kids. If she went in to get a support order, she would get the minimum, which is like 75 bucks a week. That's 300 dollars a month, so she's getting more than she would get if she went on a support order. She knows that. She totally knows that, and she knows that meant that the judge would look at the rent and say, "Well, looking at your expenses, and looking at his expenses, he's paying rent, you're not paying any housing expense, you're getting 2600 dollars scot free. Actually, you should be paying him some money." Which, if you look at it, half that money's mine. I'll give her half of the condo, and I'll take half of her income, if that's the way she wants to do it. And then I'll give her 500 dollars. She's doing much better than that right now. I'm struggling to get by. Part of it's my own fault because I'm buying coffees and sandwiches and stuff like that, but... I'm just dying of hunger, I'm so hungry all the time. And beer. I love beer. [00:09:40]</p>

<p>I don't buy the cheap beer. Which I should, but there's more alcohol in the beer and like... I figure I'm actually drinking less beer by drinking the more expensive beer. So in the long run, it's cheaper. And I found out one of my favorite musicians, is opening for another favorite. And they're playing at the Music Theater, and I know that Jess's brother likes both of them. I've gone to see them with him, I know he's a fan. He loves that chick rock. I really shouldn't have sent the e-mail because the tickets are like 42 bucks, and then whatever charges they throw on top of that, I could have asked him if he wanted to go. So I don't know, I don't know where I'd get the money to buy them. (pause) [00:10:47]</p>

<p>There's a festival in September I want to go to, it's three days for 40, the same amount of money. It's an unbelievable price, how cheap the festival is</p>

<p>and how expensive, you know... (pause)</p>

<p>I did get a response about the titles Ted sent me, 900 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he probably sent it to the old suite, and it wasn't there yesterday, and it's going to be an extra two days before I get it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. But it will forward. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It'll forward, but—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand the wait's a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've sent several e-mails, I just don't get it. I don't know how... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ask why he never said anything, or he just sent you 900 bucks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He said, you know, I'm sending you 900 for these files, which probably have closed because he pointed out one of them that didn't close that he wasn't paying me on. They're just not paying me as they close. Some they are, some they aren't. They've gotten in the habit of paying less and have been paying more than not instead of less than not. I really need it because I ended up paying my—I also pay Jess's car insurance, which is 150 bucks a month. We were two months behind on that, so I paid that. So now I've got to somehow figure out how to pay my rent to keep—not fall behind further in rent. But I need that 900 bucks to come in so I can do that. Just so pissed—my phone bill, just all kinds of crap. Some of these closings have to close this month, or I'm in trouble. (pause) They kind of—when I extended my lease, they weren't completely forthright with what was happening, they lowered my rent to 500 dollars.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, they did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, from 550. You know, my rent on the other office. But there's a caveat, that I have to pay by the first. So if I'm late, I have to pay 550 plus interest. So it's kind of swarmy the way they did that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I get a call—they are putting in executive suites where my old office suite was, they're basically doing what they were doing before. They basically squeezed out the guy so they could do it. I got a call, they want to see if I'm interested. I'm just like, you know, I can't do it now, I've already committed to phone service and all kinds of... I can't do it. And (pause) I don't know. [00:14:40]</p>

<p>The psycho pharm lady is switching me from the Trileptal, the Oxycarbopynine (sic) or whatever, to Lamictal. I'll let you know. I didn't ask her, but I assume she just likes Lamictal better, or give me better results on it, I don't know why. First she was bringing, weaning me down, and now she's in—while weaning me down, she's weaning me up on Lamictal. It says that it makes you drowsy, so it's not like it's going to make me less tired, maybe it will. Maybe I can take less Lamictal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I rarely see people on Lamictal who are not drowsy from it. So it may be a side effect, but it's not always.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So maybe that's her rationale. That she just seems to (pause) have people who have good results with it. And ultimately, I think she's going to wean me off the Nortryptyline. She says that the—one of them, I don't even know what medication it is, one of the medications counteracts the Nortryptyline more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She sounds more active and engaged than Candy. Do you want to stay with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of do, but (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, there should be one consideration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she's going to take me off the Nortryptyline and put me on Prozac. Which I kind of feel like is given a raw deal on the SSRIs, because the problem was they were working really well, I was just getting nauseous. And she's like, "Well, you're supposed to take food. And then you won't get nauseous." I'm like, "Why does no one tell me that?" So </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that really helped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She wants to do, I'm not going to really tell her what to do but I think, even Jess said a switch was flipped. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. With which one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think the first one I took was Celexa, maybe? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it worked really well. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good. Yeah, sounds like you should stay with her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's good friends with Candy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine, don't worry about it. That's not something they're going to be bitter with each other over. It just happens. (pause) [00:18:26]</p>

<p>CLIENT: My back's been driving me crazy. (pause) Problem is, is I keep (pause) I'm riding my bike, carrying my bike up and down the stairs, playing the handball, just... It's just stiffness. Once I get on my bike and ride it and get off my bike, it feels fine. Quite ultimate it feels fine, just need to warm up. I don't know if I'm going to make it through two days of tournament if it doesn't get better. (pause) I'm going to maybe start going to lay down to the floor, get my spine and everything to flat out. Might help it. (pause) Probably should have a chiropractor, but... (pause) I don't know if that's going to help in two weeks. Not this weekend but the next weekend is the big tournament. I've got aches and pains all over, the season's wearing on me. Getting old. (pause) Kind of think it tends to happen.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Got the pictures back from the trip and in one of them I'm like, "Hey, I'm fucking fat. Great." I don't know. I think there's just more to why Barbara didn't want to go out with me, that just complexity that she sees I'm old, balding and fat. I really don't know, thought because there's nothing that you can—it's true. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're getting older, that one's true, anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm bald. [00:20:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What does that look like to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not like what, you know, metaphorically does it look like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand. Fluffy clouds, or... </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't stop eating. It's like I—you know I have vegetables, I figure maybe if I have a little protein or whatever. So the other night I made a sandwich, getting tomatoes from the farm, subbing tomato and cheese sandwiches, just peanut butter, and it's like I'm still fucking starving. Just starving. And I don't go and get one sandwich, I go and get two sandwiches. (pause) I mean, I lost a lot of weight since last summer but I just can't get rid of this extra, you know?</p>

<p>I've got these exercises I want to do, but I feel like they aggravate my back. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a hard life. I hate to tell you this, but I think some of it with the hunger is maybe the medication or just the way your metabolism works, I don't know. But my impression -</p>

<p>CLIENT: She even said that once I go off the Nortryptyline, I'll lose weight. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she might have said that. Or maybe the other said that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, sometimes that stuff really does make a difference. I guess (pause) we see it's like (pause) in the ways you—how am I trying to say this? There's something that seems to me similar between the hunger for food, your loneliness, lack of money, the kind of feelings I notice of some longing that go on all those things? (pause) It's a real lack of care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lack of care?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A feeling of being taken care of, in the world. [00:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can barely take care of myself. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think it's sort of (pause) morphed into being hungry for food. That's probably not the whole story. (pause) But I think that's part of it. (pause) Here's what I'm saying is, I think there's a part that's emotional, (pause) and I think it's extremely painful to (pause) not (pause) through the end, feel just kind of more cared for in general. And yeah, you've been hurt a long time for the last couple of years, but you've been hurt a long time. (pause) [00:26:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Lucille was kind of driving me crazy this weekend because she runs off at the circus, and Jess's like, "Can you go chase her down?" So I just follow her and she turns around and sees that it's me, and just starts crying. (pause) Though on Friday, Friday night Jess and Lucille came with me for the first half or whatever, and when I first got there, Lucille points to me and goes, "Dad!" So that was nice. She said bye to me and she waved bye. But she cannot still just (pause) I don't know if it's just something genetic or, it's hard to say that... you know, with Ian I thought it was that he wasn't getting socialized. You just kind of need to have his mom around. But Lucille's been in day care a good while now, that she should be used to other people. It's probably just genetic that she's attached to her mama. When she's a teenager she's going to hate her mom. (chuckles) (pause) [00:28:35]</p>

<p>I wish the fall would get here. I look forward because of the tournament, but once the tournament comes I just want cooler weather and I like the fall. It's one of my favorite times. I like fall handball. It does get a little cold at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just nice because it's not so hot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's the apartment, which is partly air conditioned but the shower part isn't, so it's like I get out the shower and I'm sweating. It's like, why'd I even bother taking a shower? I'm just covered in sweat now. My car, the AC... I went through it last summer. At this point I might as well just suck it up and go the rest of the summer without AC but it works for a little bit and then it stops working. (pause) Football comes in the fall. (pause)</p>

<p>My dad's coming at the end of the month. He's in rough shape. He has his spine fused or whatever is fused. Basically we're going to have to go to the hotel and take the kids to the hotel, and hang out at the hotel. Which, they've got a swimming pool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which will be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where's he staying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the place right down here. I don't think Lucille's been in a pool, so that will be nice to get her floating around. At her age, Ian had been all over swimming. Ian was in swimming lessons at her age. But I think it's funny because (pause) I think the lessons, things from the lessons would come out. Like he used to love to jump in the pool, and jumped in the pool and got water up his nose, so he no longer wanted to jump in the pool. He didn't like putting his face under water, even in the bath. He's taken tons of swimming lessons and just doesn't have the confidence to swim on his own, even though he could. No problem. So he likes to have the security of a noodle under his armpits. But I have a feeling we'll be doing a lot of that. It's a nice pool there, it's indoor and they can open up the top. And the last time they ordered down when my mom was in town they showed a movie on Saturday night in the pool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which they're still doing that, that would be cool.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. The kids will love that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And of course, we'll eat all our meals at the Mall, California Pizza Kitchen, there's a Cheesecake Factory there as well. Probably can get my dad to go, even with the children, it's required. It's the best place to take the kids. They have alcohol, and (pause) I don't know, the food's not super great, but I think it just tastes so much better when your kids are over there playing, and you're drinking a beer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could have some idea what you're eating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I like to get the steak. I try not to eat a lot of red meat, but when I go there I like to get the steak because they don't give you a huge, ungodly piece of meat, you know? It's a normal-sized piece of meat that's on an arugula salad, which I love arugula. I've got to get a little while board for my fridge to put what kind of vegetables I have, because I don't have any lettuce but I could use arugula instead. An arugula salad. (pause) Really spicy arugula, I like it. (pause) [00:33:49]</p>

<p>I'm meeting with the life insurance lady from E&G Group, she's having condo problems and (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Condo problems? Condominium? There's a group of them who are not happy with what the management company and the trustee are doing. So (pause) to a large degree, there's not much... first of all, there's in the condo docs rule, apparently there's an 80/20 rule where only 20 percent of the units are allowed to be rental units. And they've broken that. And I'm not really sure what can be done about it, unless someone can show damages such as they were denied a loan, or they were unable to sell the unit, or (pause) Oh, this is crazy. (mumbles) My fault. Call fucking, don't call me. There's an all-in-one machine that she wanted me to take, which I took (pause) and unplugged it from the phone and from the machine, and plugged it into the wall. That's all I did. My sister replied I sabotaged her Internet. She went to the humor in that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) </p>

<p>CLIENT: But... Oh, at least I think I'll be able to (pause) make these people, give these people a voice in their condominium, if we have to file a breach of fiduciary duty, get it in the court to work out some sort of settlement. And I don't know how, I'm going to do the research, maybe there is something. Never mind. Maybe there is something I can do about the rental units. But you know, you can't just kick people out of there if they have valid leases. The problem is that these people should be fined, is what should happen. That's your main control of the condo. But these people aren't the trustees. So they can't come up and fine. They can't, they're just a group in a large condo association that's disgruntled. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they don't have the power to fine. But they have, they could say, "Listen, you trustees, you're not doing your job, you allowed this to happen. You're not following the trust agreement, and we're going to have you removed." And so it's going to involve some letter writing, and some research. They're willing to hire me soon.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not normally willing to do a lot of condo stuff, but gotta do something. [00:37:32]</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the Prozac would make me feel less lonely (pause) and sad. She says I'm on an awful lot of Wellbutrin, which if I am, it ain't working. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much of that have you been feeling? </p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sad and lonely?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When mostly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At night, yesterday was a Monday, and I always feel fucking awful on a Monday, I have a lot of anxieties on a Monday, so just facing the work I've got to do and answer shit, just... I'm somewhat distracted during the day doing work so I don't think about it as much during the day. But at night I think about it, driving in the car I think about it. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think about? [00:38:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just, you know, I'm lonely, what am I going to do about that? (pause) My job sucks, I hate my job. There's nothing I can do about that. (pause) You know, my daughter barely knows me. (pause). Her calling me "Dada" would be the same as if she called me "Cameron", that's just who I am, just a normal person. She has no concept of parents. Ian never—he would say, "I want my mommy," but never cry because I came over... so that's frustrating. (pause) She wouldn't give me a hug on Sunday to say goodbye. I think she was a little tired, but... (pause) [00:40:44]</p>

<p>I woke up yesterday and realized that a title I was supposed to do was due on Friday, and I hadn't even started it. I know it's going to be downtown and it only goes back to 1974, and typically you do a 50-year search, and... "A check came for me, where would you like me to leave it?" A check? From who? </p>

<p>But it was a big condominium, it has a lot of units, and when a lot of titles have been run, you want to take it back to the developer, the attorney, so the office doesn't mind you participating. So the developer was 1979, and I really think I'm going to have to go into the registry. Their computers are a bastard there, not so quick, so... That kind of tripped up my whole day. And I wasn't going to go into the office, but then I had the check, I had the rent check I had to put in so the money was available today just in case I needed it. If my health insurance checks clear I'm going to be in the red, so I'm going to need some money to move over until that 900 bucks come in. Why would they send me money? It can't be the 900 dollar check. Why would they send it to that address? I can't think of anyone else who owes me money. (pause) I don't know. [00:42:48]</p>

<p>I hate when they run out of the large tops and they've got to use the dome. It bothers me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What don't you like about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of full, and it's not all secure in there. I don't know, just doesn't feel right. People look at it and think I have whipped cream or something like that. (pause) </p>

<p>I don't see the psycho pharm until Monday, because she's on vacation this week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: For our date, actually, I have next Friday. (pause) Thursday and Friday of next week. It's the beginning of the hour. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you want to reschedule it the seventeenth?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: First days of school? Just wondering what you're out with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why I'm out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Vacation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. (pause) Must be nice. (pause) Barbara's going on vacation, don't know whether she's going with friends or relatives. I have no concept... "The 900 dollar check you sent to the wrong address." So... you're not going to be around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see, I have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Let me take a look at Wednesday and send you an e-mail. Is that okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. All right. </p>

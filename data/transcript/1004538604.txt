<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could do later in the day on Friday if that works, or I could look for something else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a closing so it depends what time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two closings so close together I don't know what to do with myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My goodness. When's the other one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh the one I just had.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. I didn't know you just had one.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it was like a week or two ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Does that mean —</p>

<p>CLIENT: They finally closed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. Okay, so I could do 12:30. [00:01:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's 1:00.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could do — oh, you know what I could do? How about 10:15?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten-fifteen. That probably would work. (pause) Do you want a dog? [00:02:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can't imagine why you'd ask.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Every time I put him in the cage he pees, so I'm constantly cleaning pee out of the cage. There's like a tray at the bottom. And two days ago I put him in the cage and he literally, as soon as I closed the door and stood up, just squatted and peed right in front of me. I should have killed him right then and there. But I have to drag him over and lift him up and put him in. I'm sure he's not comfortable, but if I put anything in there he's going to pee on it. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>And it's kind of short. He can't stand up with his head all the way. But I don't know what else I can do. Now I've got to either try and put newspaper or pee pads or something in the tray so it's easy to clean up. I'm getting sick of sopping it up. It sucks. (pause) So Jess is taking over the IRS paperwork. We got some letter from the DOR, and she's like, "When are you going to do this?" I'm like, "Why don't you just do it?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This includes the paperwork for that hardship thing? [00:04:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And she has to — Monday is the day that they release the funds to the IRS so I'm like — I've got to get her everything, and I don't know that I'm going to be able to do it today. Maybe tonight. I don't know. I've just got so many fucking stupid things to do. I just — I thought stuff was in Plymouth yesterday and it was up in Pembroke. I drove up to Pembroke to work on something that literally I've had for almost a month that I should have done a lot earlier, and they sent me an e-mail saying that the client went to another lawyer because it took a month. So it's like I totally wasted all this time in the car and just — Jess like cleaned everything up from the office and put all my stuff in one box. [00:05:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From the office in Plymouth?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know. It's just frustrating. I'm living out of boxes. I don't know where anything is. (pause) Everything just seems to be — it's like I was doing this rush title that's due today. I'm at the registry yesterday. The guy who owns it is dead so it's in the estate, but I couldn't find the estate on the computer, so I e-mailed the law office saying, "Do you have a docket number?" They haven't gotten back to me. And then there's another — there's three probates involved in this chain of title, and one of the probates is 8/1987, which I have to get through storage, so I got to go back at noon today and get the file, and I still don't have the fucking docket number for the current estate. I mean I'm putting it in right. I've run the guy's name. I've run the executor's name. She comes up on other estates. I don't know. [00:06:15]</p>

<p>It just sucks. I got a lot of just real little things to do, like no big, huge projects. Some closings to open up the files and — I don't know. I had Handball last night so I'm exhausted. One of the dads on my soccer team had me come to a friend-raiser they called it, trying to get people to get on the board of (inaudible). There were actually a couple lawyers there. I don't know. They're like going around the room and I'm like one of the last people to go, and I just didn't really have much to say. [00:07:09]</p>

<p>I spoke individually with a couple of people who were on the board but — I just want to get involved to — I've got to do some networking in Plymouth. I'm getting zero business. This is a connection to all the new businesses in Plymouth and kind of new people in Plymouth, so it'd be nice if I could get on the board, or some committee, or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>I was talking with this one woman who was on the board and it turns out that she knows Ian and Lucille because her kids go to the same school. You try and talk about yourself and the things you're doing, and she's like, "Oh, you're so busy. You've got so many things on your plate." You know, it's like, "Yeah, but I don't have too much time for this." (pause) It just sucks how much effort I have to put in, not knowing what I get out of it. [00:08:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether it's going to pay off or — yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Still haven't joined the Plymouth Chamber. I just don't have the money. I'm like three months, four months behind in rent. (pause) I have no TV. I had a little digital box from Comcast and he came — my landlord came up and got it because Comcast was supposed to go on Saturday, and I'm just too ashamed to bring it up. I feel like I shouldn't be complaining about any of the things in my unit when I haven't paid rent in forever. [00:09:13]</p>

<p>I think my medications fuck with me when I play Handball. I'm getting like — seeing spots and lightheaded. I don't know if it's because I'm just not in shape, but this has never really happened before. You look up and you see all the lights and then you see these black spots, and so you see white spots and black spots and just — it kind of went away but I was worried. I just can only assume it's the medicine that's doing it. [00:10:10]</p>

<p>I have yet to go out to (inaudible) practice. They've been practicing for a couple weeks. I just — I have something every night, you know. Like tonight I've got the community advisory board for the bank. It's only an hour, but the guy who's in charge of it is going to be there, so it's like meet him and then I could call him or e-mail him about doing closings [for him] (ph) or at least putting me in touch with — I mean I don't know what goes on in these meetings. Apparently they give you money for just coming out, like 100 bucks. [00:11:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So at least they did when it was the bank. I don't know if they're still doing that, but — I don't know. I'm just — just worn out. (pause) I was all stressed out yesterday, and I was just really kind of pissed off at Jess that she just kind of put all my shit in one box, and so I'm angry, and she's like, "Don't talk to me like that." I'm just getting sick of her telling me not to talk to her when I'm angry or frustrated or mad, you know. I'm just getting sick of her in general. [00:12:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More so than before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just — it's like on Sunday I was like, "So what are you guys doing today?" I had some titles to get done but I wanted to see the kids. And she was like, "Oh we're at the Museum, but we have a birthday party. Do you want to take the kids to the birthday party?" I'm like, "No, I don't want to take the kids to the birthday party." It's like, "Well come over beforehand."</p>

<p>So it's like I get over there and Lucille is asleep and pretty much slept the entire time I was there, and I just — I don't know what it is but I don't — like with Ian I'm like, "Do you want to go to the park and kick a ball around?" [When we play cards] (ph) and I just — I don't know. I don't know if it's proper to say we're not connecting, but just — I don't know what it is. [00:13:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much of it is that he takes a lot of work, which you may not be feeling up to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean I just — he doesn't want to do anything. He doesn't want to eat anything. It's like he does. "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Do you want this?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you want this?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you want this?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm bored."</p>

<p>"Do you want to do this?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you want to do this?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>It's like the only thing he wants to do is go to the Museum. And (pause) that's a commitment because you can't get him out of there once you get him in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:14:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was running low on Klonopin (ph) so I started — I didn't kind of realize it until Friday night. I don't know why I thought that they would give me a couple of days' supply, because it's a controlled substance so they didn't. Because I was going from taking two at a time to taking one or two a day just to — I don't know if that was the reason I was lightheaded or what.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That could be actually. You may want to get on that. I've heard — I mean obviously I'm not the expert, but I have heard other people taking Klonopin who had some trouble when they've decreased or gone off it because they ran out or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, they called it in yesterday and so I went out — after the pub I went to the pharmacy and got the bottle so I'd have it, so I'm back on. [00:15:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, but that could be —</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was kind of what I was thinking. It's the reason I went to the pharmacy, to make sure I have it in the morning. (sigh) I don't know. (pause) I'm really out of shape. I haven't — because I didn't play Handball last week because of the moving and all that crap. I've just been eating a lot, so I've been putting on weight. My back hurts. [00:16:07]</p>

<p>I could try and push it and go to Handball, but I don't know if we're going to have practice today. The field is probably going to be too wet. I don't think — I put "no" that I wasn't coming, so — we use Google Spreadsheet to keep track of attendance. (pause) [00:16:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it's really hard when you're so maxed out to take on anything that you know could help, especially — well, yeah, I mean whether it's the tax stuff, or getting in shape, or the bank thing, or the Chamber. Yeah, it just seems to me like you're (inaudible at 00:17:41) stuck in this situation where it's like (pause) there are places that it feels like it would help to be able to get to, but you're always out of gas.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Just so many things seem broken and not going right. It's just like I was just so confused when I was in the office. Just confused at what I needed to do. It was part that I was just kind of so pissed off and — I didn't put everything back in the box, even though Jess asked me to, which was just how confused I was. I was just like, "Fuck, I got to get to Pembroke," and then I get up there and I get the e-mail, "Never mind on that title." It's just like — and they're apologizing to me, "Sorry for the inconvenience," and I feel like I should be the one apologizing. I don't know. [00:18:55]</p>

<p>It's pretty stupid on my part. I shouldn't — I need these four or five $175 checks. I seem to have a few more closings in the pipeline.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I've got one guy who's been looking forever, and we're supposed to do P&S but he's found all these inspection issues, and he's like really careful would be the word I guess, so I don't know if they're going to come to terms before Wednesday, or today, or I don't know. I just wish he would just fucking get under agreement. Not close until June, but that'd be nice to have a closing for June. [00:20:17]</p>

<p>I've got these other clients who've asked for their deposit back, but they can't go looking for something new until they get their money back. (sigh) (long pause) [00:21:46]</p>

<p>I don't know what to do. I feel like giving up but it's not really an option. (pause) [00:22:17]</p>

<p>I need to get my fax line up and running, and I made the mistake — there's this woman who's joining E&G (ph), and she calls me on Friday to give a quote. She's with this company, and it's like, "How long does it take to get a quote? Fucking call me right back." And I don't have her phone number, and I keep forgetting to send her an e-mail. It's like I just need to call Verizon or whoever and get them to come out and put a fucking phone line in, before someone else gets my number. I don't know — (pause) [00:23:10]</p>

<p>So I've just got so many things that I'm juggling and spinning around in my head, and I can't get organized. I can't think straight. I'm either stressed out, or frustrated, or angry. It's like I'm going to leave here, I'm going to go home, I'm going to have to clean the piss out of the dog cage again, which I just cleaned out before I came, from last night, you know. Try and fucking get the docket number for that estate. (pause) I don't know how these things become such a rush if you don't even have the basic information. [00:24:01] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you feel like you're just at the mercy of all this stuff. Like you're kind of — suddenly (ph) you've got this huge tide, and it doesn't matter what you try or what you think you can do about it. You're kind of helpless. Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much. I've got nowhere to turn, I've got — I'm in this situation where I've got to deal with Jess who's just — she's just becoming impossible to deal with. [00:25:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (inaudible) I think she puts more on you. Like she gives you things to do, or she wants things from you, and (pause) she doesn't really take things off of you or give you the things that you want, like help or support or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, she doesn't. There's no — I'm always filling in for her, taking the kids here, picking the kids up there, because she needs to do this, or she needs to do that. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>Just out of complete fucking frustration of her pestering me about the fucking IRS stuff, I'm like, "Just do it yourself. You do it." Which, you know, I don't know if I would have done it by now, but it seems like it's getting a little late in the ball game to get that money released, which totally sucks. Because she's not going to — she doesn't see any way that that's part her money, that she's responsible for part of that. You know, if the IRS had gone and done that to her bank account, I'd be the first place she'd look, saying, "Hey, you've got to give me some money here to help cover this." [00:27:05] (long pause) [00:27:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think this is the central thing that you're struggling with right now is that the only way you can see to make things better is to sort of step up in various ways, that you just already feel so overwhelmed and overburdened it's very hard to do. I think that kind of plays itself out with Jess, as well as elsewhere, in that she's always giving you stuff to do. I mean you're already feeling totally overwhelmed by the things that you're responsible for, and she's trying to make you responsible for more stuff, or trying to make things better involves sort of trying to take care of more stuff, and you're already trying to take (inaudible) really maxed out by. [00:28:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like I'm losing with her, because when I lose my cool or I get upset, I give her the opportunity to "Don't talk to me like that," you know. I feel like I'm losing, that somehow—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's another thing that you're supposed to be responsible for, is how you feel and how you react and how you talk to her, that she's going to hone in on and you're going to feel sort of too overwhelmed to — I don't know, deal with her, make judgments about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She always would say, "Do you talk to other people like this?" And I've always wanted to say, "No one treats me like you treat me." But she's always like, "Don't try and blame me for this. I didn't do anything." She thinks that she just has complete immunity and has done nothing wrong. Even — there's been rare moments where she's admitted that maybe she's done something wrong or gone overboard or something, but it doesn't last very long. [00:30:06]</p>

<p>So it's like I'm resigned to the fact that I'm out on my own, but I can't fucking support myself. I can't do it. And the question of even having money for her and the kids is — it's like I don't have money for myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and it's — obviously it's pretty bad news to not be able to support yourself. [00:30:56] (pause) I think you feel completely shitty about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'm at a loss too. I'm like, "Why is this happening?" [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm telling you part of it has to do with things that you can't control, but part of it has to do with your being so overwhelmed that you can't step up to deal with some things that you, in theory, could control. [00:32:24] (long pause) [00:34:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fucking Pavlov's dog. (pause) Someone tried to fax something to me but they couldn't get through. Something I already knew, canceling title work for a deal I know is dead. [00:34:31] (long pause) [00:37:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind, Jay? (sp?)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm just ruminating about my day, the different things I have to do, e-mails I have to respond to. Getting it from all angles. Our tenants want to sublet. First they just wanted out of the lease. "Can we get out of the lease?" Now they want to sublet. I've got this one condo I've got to get — they want certain information before they'll give me the money. Got my old dragging-out condo case where they're just — they just don't read the fucking e-mails I send them. And then they get all pissed off because — [00:38:55]</p>

<p>You explain to people that litigation is a long drawn out process, and as much as you try and prepare people for it, they get all pissed off. I can't stop the court from continuing a hearing if they want to continue the hearing, you know. If the other side asks for it, I'm not assenting to it, but the court can say, "Yeah, we'll continue it." It's beyond my control. These people are frustrated, but — [00:39:43] (long pause) [00:40:30]</p>

<p>That's probably Jess. It's like when I said, "You go ahead and do the IRS stuff," I threw the paperwork down on the thing, and she's asking me for it. I'm like, "I left it on the kitchen table." No, Facebook. I've been invited to a preschool yard sale. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>Everybody wants something from you, you know. (pause) And then people say to you, "Hey, if you ever need anything from me..." It's like, "Can I have $20,000?" (pause) I'm going to take Ian to the game on Sunday. It's going to be expensive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With parking and hot dog or whatever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, just all the food. [We'll take the T.] (ph) He'll have fun. I don't know if he'll finally figure out that there's actually a game going on. [00:42:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) He hasn't got that far before?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not really. I don't think he — we have bleacher seats so it's like — I think he thinks the pitchers warming up is the game.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see how long he wants to stay out there for. I don't know what the weather is supposed to be like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are they playing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're playing a bad team so they should win. Jess'll probably want me to put bug spray on him, and just do all these crazy, fucking things to him. Psycho mom.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bug spray for a ball game? [00:42:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the kind of shit she does though. She's just — she's like constantly running these kids into urgent care. Like on Saturday, Lucille was crying and they said she was pulling at her ear at daycare, so they rush her into urgent care because she's got an ear infection. And I just suggested — I go, "Maybe you should take her to a kid chiropractic." She's like, "I don't believe in that chiropractic." It's like, "Do you have to be such a fucking bitch when you say that kind of stuff to me?" It's like, "No I don't want to do that. I don't think it'll work," you know, would be a normal response. [But I had snapped] (ph) back when something like that — I went to a chiropractor for years and it helped me, and she went twice and it didn't help her because she never gave it the time to let it help her. She doesn't believe in it. She believes in all this other fucking, crazy, wacko shit, but you know —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not that. [You can] (ph) stop for now, but we'll talk more on Friday at 10:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. [Stay dry.] (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. [00:44:30]</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ***</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. So we're on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes we are. Same time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. (inaudible at 00:19). I have no keys—it's at the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're not on here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I remember taking them off, using them in the door, and then I couldn't get them out of the door, so Deborah took them out of the door and Deborah must've kept them, along with her set of keys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, good thing is you know where to find her. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, hopefully. I tell you. Yeah, to use a ride more than once in a day, it's a no-no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you were saying that, so if you have multiple appointments you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I have an appointment at two o'clock this afternoon, to see the hand surgeon over in (inaudible at 01:15) the mall and I have to come up with ten dollars for my cousin. (inaudible at 01:29) over Saturday night and of course, I was already in bed watching TV when she calls to say she's outside. I said OK. So in the bed she comes with me to watch TV.</p>

<p>So of course there was a show on at nine o'clock that I had missed when it first came on and lovely (ph) Deborah was recording it supposedly, but instead she recorded another show. So I went in to watch the new show, premiere of Law & Order Special Victims. So it was last Saturday night, so she's yacking away and yacking away and yacking away. Finally, nine o'clock I told her to shut the fuck up (inaudible at 02:19) watch my show (inaudible at 02:21). I says, "Yeah and keep it that way." But yet you still miss the fucking show. (laughter) I think I got most of it right.</p>

<p>So I say to her now, "Don't forget, I need the ride Monday afternoon." "Oh, do you have the ten dollars?" Well guess what, she's taking ten dollars in pennies. Because I had to give Deborah money to take the bus tomorrow, because she has to go over to meet her new psychologist tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, where is she going?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. So, that's all right. So, I have to go to see Genevieve. So I got the door-to-door service. Deborah's going to have to take the bus, which she knows how to take the bus. I don't, you know. It's been so long since I've taken a bus I wouldn't know where the hell I was going or how much it is or how much it isn't. I said, "Well, why do you only have a five dollar bill?" Deborah says, "Well you'll lose out. You have to have the exact amount." I said, "Oh, all right. Fine (inaudible at 03:54)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe pennies are working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) So, (inaudible at 04:01), you know. I was saying to myself, "I don't fucking believe this one, Mary."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The ten dollars?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That only gets you 22 miles for ten dollars of gas, you know. So, I say, "Yeah, OK." So then she says to me that the lady that she is living with, Mary, Mary offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for Mary, if Mary would like that. And Mary says, "No, that's all right Mary, you don't have to cook us dinner because Leece (sp?) eats dinner home at his father's house, and I go to my cousin's house," which, you know, is fucking me. I say, maybe I should, "Well, why don't you just save your ten dollars and get me there for Thanksgiving dinner?" But, you know, I says, I just, you know, let's shit on cousin Louise some more. I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, kind of how did you get in this position, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 05:27) I think that's a good idea that she wanted you to, you know, stay home for Thanksgiving dinner and have Jodie. I said, "I think you should do it." She says, "Why, where are you going?" I says, "I'm not going anywhere." "Well, aren't you having Thanksgiving dinner?" I says, "Yeah I am." "Well, that means I'm coming over here, doesn't it?" What am I supposed to say, fucking no, you know? I says, "Yeah, I guess you are Mary."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think what you're getting at, the whole feeling of, "Well, all right, Mary I've been giving and giving and giving, but where's the reciprocation? Where is the out of return?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tell you, and then her eating habits are so atrocious that I, I mean, I can remember from years back, I never want to go in a restaurant with her. What was it, Monday last week she was over and Deborah had made supper and Mary was there. Well she sits with her head down the whole time during the meal. Here's her plate and here's her head—almost right in it. And she just shovels it in and shovels. I'm surprised she doesn't choke to fucking death. And then not only does she eat one helping, she had another helping and Deborah had made I think there was only, like, four slices left of garlic bread. Mary took one and then she covered it with more butter, which, you know, no need for. And then, I'm not much of a bread eater anymore because it feels me up too soon, so I think I might've taken two bites out of my garlic bread. Mary took the rest of that. And then Deborah had a piece. [00:07:35]</p>

<p>So there was one more piece left. Mary cut it in half because she was taking the other half, and she left the other half. But Deborah didn't want it, so Mary ate three slices of garlic bread, three helpings of macaroni and sausages. And I mean, as I say, she just—Deborah was all done with hers, I was all done with mines. Mary's the only one sitting still at the table. I says, "Mary, does that say anything to you?" She says, "Yeah, you and Deborah eat too fast." I said, "Oh, OK. It's not because you're on your third helping or anything like that." "Well, I never know when I'm going to eat again." OK. So, just like my brother, (inaudible at 08:31) say that, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, "And you're going to feed me." Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I just want to scream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah. I think too that, you know, it seems like any time that you ask for something from somebody, there's always this sort of sense of like, "Well, you're going to have to pay for it." You'll never be a burden to other people. You won't kind of imposition other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I mean, every time I get invited anywhere, I always bring something with me. Mary brings herself, oh and now she's drinking beer with shots of vodka—Smirnoffs, the flavored one. I say to Deborah, "She must've picked up that habit from Mark," because that was Mark's, you know, beer, the shot—yeah, favorite thing. And, I mean, supposedly she's a recovering alcoholic. I says, oh yeah, she's really doing good, huh? Drinking beer and, you know. But yet she's still going to meetings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, she's really following (inaudible at 09:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I say, "Mary anything more than a drink for an alcoholic and you've gone back into it." "Ah no, I can stop any time I want." I said, "Every time I see you you're drinking." You know, it's not once out of a month—it's every night out of the month, you know. Friday night with this friend of hers, Adam. And he took her to different bars in Walden. Of course, he's paying for the drinks though. Oh, she had two coolers and mud slides and then they went to another bar and she had three more different drinks. And then they went to another bar and she had maybe four drinks there. And I'm saying to myself, well that's eight drinks right there and, you know. So then I said, "Yeah, you're really doing good Mary, you know, really. Glad you're not my counselor, my sponsorer." Because she sponsors people. [00:11:08]</p>

<p>And her mind is going. Let's see, she stayed over my house last Monday. Supposedly, she had lost her wallet, but yet the wallet was out in the parking lot and the money that she thought she had in the wallet was in her purse. So then Tuesday, I didn't see her. She lost her wallet again at the bank. And then Wednesday, I had seen her car over this friend's house that she was at, and she lost her wallet again. The only places that she could've lost her wallet was she was with her son Jodie and it was missing. It was over at her friend house that it was missing. [00:12:07]</p>

<p>Well, put two and two together, the next day she got a phone call or something and someone returned her wallet to them. And I said, "Mary, it was over at your friend's house, because they knew just what doctor you were seeing so that they called and that's how they found your number." I said, "she knew that information." I said, "So, you know, Eliza and her boyfriend probably stole it, took the money out of it and then bought it down to this place and said that they found it," you know. I said, "So come on Mary."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, now who's Eliza?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a friend of hers that she sponsors.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she lives a couple of streets away from me, you know. But, like, you know, Mary, we're going to have to stick it to your fucking forehead, you know, so you don't lose it. But I mean, you know, she carries this big humungous purse that a full grown horse could put around its neck and eat it's hay from—that's how big the purse is, you know. I said, (inaudible at 13:24) you know it's there, have your money in your jeans, you know, and not in your purse. (inaudible at 13:35) the big bag, you can put your beer cans in and your nips (ph) so that when you go home to Mary's house and Mary's still awake she doesn't know you have them in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 13:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. Oh, I tell you, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: These are the folks that you're trying to lean on in hard times?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Boy, not a lot of help there, is there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, but plus (inaudible at 14:10) says I'm only to worry about Mary and Deborah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stay out of...</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Devon came by my house Friday night, finally, because I wanted my CPAP machine back. I told him the doctor said I needed it again, so of course...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did he have it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, because he had asked to borrow it if I wasn't using it, because he has sleep apnea. I says, "Well, what about your insurance plan? Supposed to be covered Devon, you've got good insurance, you know." "I didn't think of that." I says, "Yeah, OK fine." So for two months I've been asking for it back. "Oh, I'll be by with it Saturday and I'll have James with me. I'll be by Friday night," you know, and then I'll message him and he'll write back, "Oh, I'm at a birthday party." Every fucking weekend they're at a birthday party, you know. So I says, "Yeah, OK, fine." But yeah, he finally brought it back over Friday night. Stayed for like an half hour.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was James with him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. He had come from work. But he had pictures on his camera of James. James has learned sign language at preschool. so I says, "Yeah, he's probably going like this and then going like that, hi Mommy," you know. I got a picture of my James. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Tie them up] (ph) and then the fingers start. First two.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, he says, "I learn in French now. Bon appétit." (laughter) I says, "Oh, he's so cute." (laughter) All right, so then Ashley (sp?) mentioned how I thought to start him over, so I made beautiful (inaudible at 16:11). She got me out at Indianapolis—is it Indianapolis? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, in Indiana?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No no no. (inaudible at 16:23) base, I mean, Marine base.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Annapolis?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I said, "I hope she made a beautiful bride and everything. Yeah, Devon goes, "Yeah..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She married a Navy man?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he said Marine. He could be Navy, I'm not sure. But Ginger never went.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ginger didn't go, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ashley (sp?) had bought her plane ticket. Ashley (sp?) had gotten them a nice hotel room. She decided she didn't want to go at the last moment. So, that was the end of that. Ashley (sp?) went, but no Ginger.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry, it's Ginger's daughter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, Ashley's (sp?) daughter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's Devon's daughter, OK. Yeah, from Devon's first...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, wife. So of course, all of Devon's family was there. You come from a family of, like, ten kids. You know, everybody was there. They might have hated Ginger before, but now they really hate Ginger. So, this week Devon is going to somewhere else because his son is being deployed. He's got a meeting down on some place on, like, a Tuesday and then he's going to drive down to where his son is that's being deployed, because he gets deployed on Saturday. So they could spend—Ginger said to Devon, "Well, I think I'd like to go down and see Alex before he deploys." And Devon said, "No, that's all right. He's going to be fine, don't worry." Devon said I'm not (inaudible at 18:19) for her to come down and then she never shows, you know. He says, "I've had it with her." I said, "you sleeping in the big bed yet?" He says, "No. (inaudible at 18:31)."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he have anything to say about, you know, you and Ginger and Jackie and the kids and that whole situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says that James asks for me all the time and that when he went to church, he was looking for me singing and wanted to know where was Louise. I said, "Oh, did Jackie (sp?) tell him that, you know, she didn't want me interrupting in her life or, you know, her children's life?" He says, "Oh, was that what this is all about?" I says, "Oh yeah. Jackie (sp?) called me and told me to stay the fuck out of her life and all her children's life." He says, "So that's what it's all about." I said, "Oh." He says, "Well, we're going to have to see how we can (inaudible at 19:22)." I said, "Oh yeah." I said, "You're so fucking pussy whipped, it's unreal."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think he'll do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I (inaudible at 19:30) I can see you. I said, "Here you are, slipping (ph) down the cellar and then falling." Ginger's (pause)—well, she might (inaudible at 19:43) she's OK. Jackie's brother sold his house up there. Beautiful house, heated driveway and everything. Sold his house up there and he's moving to Florida to be with his girlfriend that he's had for, like, 30 years. And his wife Kelly, she's moving to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Dave is still married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And Kelly is moving to Kentucky, because she bought a four-bedroom condo, brand new, you know, in Kentucky for dirt pay, you know. So, Gina, who was supposedly still living in the house with them, well, she's living at Ginger's house. So she's sleeping in Ted's room, because Teds back at college. Jodie (ph) said to Ginger, "Well, when is she leaving? I don't remember inviting her here." And Ginger says, "Well, she's my cousin. I invited her." He says, "Oh, so it's a different story if I want to invite my cousin down? They can stay here too?" And I see (inaudible at 21:21)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see it too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, Ginger just didn't say anything. And I said, "Well, Devon, you know, you don't speak up." He says, "I do and then she threatens to call the cops on me again." I said, Hey, what can I tell you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah, and that seems to be part of the situation here and the family is this sense that, like, anybody speaks up what happens is it raises more conflict, more hate and anger within people. And it's more—it's kind of like you were saying with not going back to church because of Jackie (sp?), it's almost like, "Well, god I don't know what I'd say to her and I don't know what she'd say to me," and it would be a scene. It wouldn't be something that would end well. When people are angered or upset with each other, things get worse when they bring it up, not better. Things get explosive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know I wouldn't say anything to Jackie. First thing I'd do was punch her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to punch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. [I wouldn't even say] (ph) I want to punch—I want to beat the fuck out of her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to beat the fuck out of her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not one that won't—I don't walk away from anything, and that's the way I've—either I shut my mouth or I let my temper go. And if I let my temper go (pause), yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there's exactly right. There's, like, kind of one of two paths. It's like, I hear you say I'm either going to shut that off in myself and no go into that part of my temper where that can lead to, and I have this feeling like you're sort of saying, like, if I let my temper go, I don't want to stop it. I want to let it just go. Let, like, all the feelings out or something like that. [00:23:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I can remember back in the sixth grade, my best friend aggravated me? I took her head and smashed it up against the wall. She got a concussion. And that was back in the sixth grade. And I've done it other times too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really fighting, physical fights, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. You know, I don't care if I take a beer bottle and smash it, I'll go after you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A beer bottle?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A beer bottle, oh OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was in a—well, I got into a brawl at the bar one time. and the girl was aggravating my friend, and the girl had a knife in her boot. She went after her. I took the beer bottle, went after the girl. She wound up going to the hospital. Nothing happened to me. Police didn't even bother when they saw it was me. So, I mean, it's like, you know, I know what I'm capable of. And, you know, I've even beat the shit out of guys, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does happen? What do you notice about that? What do you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just let it (pause)—it just gets to the point—I mean, I can put up with aggravation (inaudible at 24:56) long and then all of sudden, it's like, (inaudible at 25:00). I mean, my kids will tell you to this day, this guy I was dating, I pushed him out of my car and ran over his legs. My kids, "Remember the time you took that guy and pushed him out of the car and ran over his legs, Ma?" I says, "Well yeah, he aggravated your mother." (inaudible at 25:22) he was drunk and I threw him out of my fucking car. It wasn't my fault he didn't move his legs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so you did this (inaudible at 25:31) you hit the boiling point (ph) and then it still...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Still soft.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's soft—yeah, the brakes are off, so to speak.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I [would have] (ph) let that happen, in a long, long time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess you sort of feel the still potential within you. Was that why you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's what I'm afraid of, that if I do start I won't stop. If I hit Jackie (sp?), I don't think one hit will satisfy me. I would have to keep going, you know. I can see it now, "Woman beats cousin in church."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's interesting, right, because you'll say sometimes leaving here—I don't know if you—I mean, I'm sure you notice. You'll say things like, you know, "Maybe you'll see me in the papers."</p>

<p>CLIENT: You don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know. Maybe...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You might see me on the news. [00:26:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I might see you next week, I might not. I don't know if I can, you know, I don't know if I'll hit that boiling point and let it all go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I find it hard to listen. Either your room's crooked or this thing is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's—I think it's probably crooked.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 26:55)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, why? Did you want to turn that on or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it was just bothering me (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just bothering you, there you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hey, I'm here. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh they have a roof?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know [where the hell] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh you just see it on the...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I was waving to that apartment across the way, you know. OK, it's me. You're [still committing] (ph) me, don't worry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're committing you, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had called up good old Genevieve and I said—because I don't see her until tomorrow. I says, "You've got to go increase my (inaudible at 27:29). Something has to be done." I said, "I'm like a fucking raving maniac." [00:27:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you notice? What were...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just so—I have so much rage, you know, especially when I see that fucking asshole up the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I still don't trust my Deborah to think that she wouldn't call him and go smoke somewhere with him, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No matter how much it hurts you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't trust her. It's an awful thing to say, but I don't trust her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey, pot's going to beat you every time. Pot's going to beat you every time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I can see her picture and her calling Mark and saying, "Do you have any roaches? I'll meet you up the street," you know. I can see it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and talk about enraging, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess the phone rings—her cell phone will ring, she'll go out and talk. I says, "Oh, what was that, Mark? I couldn't hear what you"—"Yeah, you know, (inaudible at 28:50) Mark." I don't know, I don't trust her, you know. She would definitely...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, she did it before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she would definitely meet him up the corner and go smoke with him, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does she like to have, like, a smoke buddy? Is that the appeal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know, you know. She just, you know, if she doesn't have pot and I haven't bought it for her and I don't ever want to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so he might have some.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got you (ph), I got you (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's why she calls him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, and he'll call her and see if she's got some?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, what the hell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's so much rage in this side, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then it's (pause)—I don't go out of my house now. I sit in that house all day long. Won't go out front and sit, you know. Don't even go out in the back and sit. I just stay in the fucking house. I don't want to fucking see people. I don't want to talk to people. It's just that. So, it's also, like, 24 hours a day I'm in my bedroom, you know. Don't faze me. [00:30:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, is it part a response, a reaction to how much rage you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Rage, and then I just don't want to, you know, like I said, I don't want to be bothered by other people, you know. Of course, Deborah's no one to talk to, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it like when I called you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, that time I didn't talk to you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just couldn't talk. It was just so (pause)—I don't want to bring up the things that he had said, Mark, because it would only hurt all the more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was just everything you do to kind of keep that feeling away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Away, yeah. And it's only been two fucking weeks this Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Only two weeks this Wednesday. It feels pretty wrong, I imagine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. It sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of hurt, I think (ph) there's a lot of hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who's (inaudible at 31:43), you know, a [real lot] (ph). But hey, shit happens.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I think in a way, you know, whether it's Mark, who did it in a major league way... (phone rings)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it's Mary. You want me to read what it says? From Deborah, hi. Donald (ph) kisses. She's sending you kisses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) That's all she wrote?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, because she thinks you're hot. [That's what that is] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right? Deborah thinks I'm hot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what that's about. I could write back, "No, give Mark (inaudible at 32:50)." (laughter) Donald (inaudible at 32:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Donald kisses?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, she's sending you kisses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's me, see, I'm crazy, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, what's crazy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well you know, I get these messages. Fucking pig (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I guess I got the message.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, so I had Genevieve increase my (inaudible at 33:27) 20 milligrams, three times a day. Hopefully that will help me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're trying to get some relief from all this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I was thinking that, yeah, like, in some way, whether it was me calling you I guess to a lesser degree now you're not, you know, you're definitely in a different place than you were when I called, but it's kind of like going out of your place is also bringing up feelings. People talking to you, being out and talking about it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, them saying to me, "Oh, I saw Stevie (ph) up at the store playing his numbers or buying scratch tickets. Oh, I saw Stevie here and, you know, here and, you know." I don't want to hear it, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I was thinking, like, you know, just like you were talking about with me calling you, not wanting to go back into that and like you were talking about with the rage, maybe in an unending sense of pain about and it really hurt. And not knowing when it's going to stop. [00:34:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I should say, it's been two weeks. It's only been two weeks. It's not long at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, you know. I can't say I don't have feelings for him—I do. I can't say there are times—there are times when I want to call him on the phone, but I won't, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel like when you do want to call him? What do you (pause)—what do you want to say to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want to say to him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's not that I want to apologize to him, because I have to apologize to him about. And, you know, I know I'll never get an apology from him, so, you know. Oh you know, I'll get the—if and when he does decide to come back, I'll get, you know, "I'm sorry. I missed you," you know, the whole fucking shit all over again. But I don't know, I don't know if I can let it go this time. I really don't know, you know. I want to be able to say no but I don't know if I'm, you know, strong enough to. [00:36:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yeah—strong enough, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, the days are so fucking boring without Mark there. I mean, he always at least would bring a laugh with him. I don't know, you know. His bottle of vodka is still in the His beer is still in the can (ph), you know. Makes sense. If you sit outside on the benches, all you can do is look, like, straight up at his house. You can see him walking down the street with the dog. And then right when he gets to where my street begins, he walks the other way. Why not just go—you're closer to go this way. By his house, you only have to go one house up and that's the main street. Why walk all the ways down and then across and then up all the ways again. [00:37:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, so he's doing what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's closer to the store for him to go and get alcohol and scratch tickets, but if he goes down heading towards my house, he's further away from the store. But yet he does it all the fucking time so that you see him walking and talking the turn, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As if it's intentional.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think he's communicating? I mean, maybe unconsciously, but what is it—what do you feel like he's saying by doing that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Look at me, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look at me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, it's like, you know—so what he did the other day when I was sitting outside waiting for the ride, he stood at the end and he picked up his phone and dialed it and was talking to someone. And (inaudible at 38:22) is that a hint, like, maybe I should pick up my phone and fucking call him, you know? I don't know, you know. [00:38:32]</p>

<p>And no matter what, one way or another I'm bound to bump into him, you know. So, Saturday my girlfriend took me out shopping and to pay some bills, and of course, don't we bump into him and—well, him and Deborah were getting in the car today, while Mark was out walking the dog, you know. I said so no matter what, I'm going to, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, when you passed by his place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah, it's inevitable for you to bump into him. Yeah, I mean, it's got that feeling of, like, he's not going to really go away. He's not really going to go away. He's going to come back and as you say, you kind of open yourself up to both things in some, I don't know, some different degrees. But one thing being the pain that he can put you through and on the other hand, the companionship, the intimacy that you do have with him, the pleasure that you have with him. As you say, it's not—it's something that you really, really want to, you know. It's mixed with a lot of pain (pause) and a lot of giving of yourself, giving up of yourself in some areas (ph). But to get something really important for yourself, to... [00:40:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Mary says, "Oh, we have to go out and go to the bars. That's the only way." I say, "Mary, I don't want to go into a bar. I don't drink." I says, "And then pick up some other alcoholic." I said, "No Mary, I don't like that," you know. It just isn't, you know—what the hell you want me to go to a fucking bar for?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, invite a lot more trouble.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, you know. I said, "What am I going to do? Sit up at the bar, have a glass of water and twiddle my thumbs, you know, while some slosh next to me is, you know, so drunk that he don't know what the hell he's doing?" No, I don't need that Mary. But hey, what the hell. And when Devon (ph) was here Friday. I said, you know, this will be the first year I won't be there for James's birthday, you know. I always have a theme for him and everything. [00:41:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When is it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's this month. I forget what day. I think it's the 22nd. So Devon goes, "Oh, well maybe I can bring him by." I Said, "What's the theme this year?" He says, "Oh, he's into everything army." I said, "Oh, OK."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's almost as if it's presumed that there's no way to work this stuff out with Ginger and (pause)—wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think I want to [work it out] (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't think you want to work it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no use for Ginger being on my (inaudible at 42:18). She's a poor (inaudible at 42:21). She'll never get awarded the motherhood award from me, believe me. She needs one of those t-shirts that says whistleblower that was banned by (inaudible at 42:39) didn't think it was nice because, you know, if there was a crime committed in the area, you were supposed to call up and, you know, tell you who did the crime? Yeah, that was whistle blowing. That's what Ginger needs, because all she does is call the cops, you know. You know, like, next week she probably won't talk to her mother, or in a couple of weeks she won't talk to the father, you know. It's like, OK, fine. I said, "Mary, did you know your cousin Dave moved to Florida?" "No, when did he go there?" I said, "Last week. He finally moved in with the girlfriend." "Oh. Where's Granny?" I said, "Oh no, she's down in Kentucky." I said, "I don't know what the hell—she doesn't know a soul in Kentucky. Does not know a soul." But according to Devon, that's becoming the place to move to, Kentucky, because everything is cheap, real cheap up there, and it's, you know, with all the country and western things and, oh yeah. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're into that stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess Kelly is. I says, "Oh, the little Italian girl, huh? She got the money good from him."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She got the money from...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dave. Oh yeah, as long as she didn't bring up the girlfriend?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So and then Dave's going down to be with his girlfriend in Florida and they're going their own ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think Kelly got most of her money out of that deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did they divorce or no?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They're just—some arrangement (inaudible at 44:30)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. She's not going to let go of that money. (laughter) Oh yeah, she's too smart for that. Their son's a lawyer. (inaudible at 44:44) as Janice. I says, OK. Can we know if he's going to make sure that his mother gets some money? What the hell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does Mary think about...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 44:57)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does Mary think about all this Ginger business, by the way? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, (pause) Ginger was always her favorite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:11) kids. And the oldest one, Mimm, was always my favorite, you know, but—I says, "Well, let me tell you what your little bitch did." Do I have to go home? Yeah, my ride's picking me up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We were just restarting, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was just getting to the good part. Did I tell you that I was pregnant? Oh, all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how you're going to leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) Is this being taped? All right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see you Monday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess so, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 45:54)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

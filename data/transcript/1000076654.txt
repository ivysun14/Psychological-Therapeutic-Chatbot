<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is March 8, 1971, and this Carrie's 11th session with Tyler.</p>

<p>(Exhales)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Exhales)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So where are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see. Like I'm - it's hard for me - like I'm really angry that I had to wait sort of, you know, today. Like it was just like I was feeling like you're not taking me seriously either. And then like I just realized it'd be really hard for me to express that I was angry to you, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's hard because like I really like you and people I really like I find it very hard to express negative things to. I'm pissed off.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, let's do something with that. That's good. Now if we can only get you to do it, all right. How can I do that? I don't know. Last time we did this I got hurt. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to throw anything. No, I don't feel like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you feel like? Where - what kind of anger? What is that anger?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just sort of like - it's almost like apathetic sort of. Like, I just feel like, oh shit, I don't care anymore, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another one, hopeless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, like well - 0:01:59.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's part of it. It's not all hopeless. There's more in that anger than hopeless.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am - I'm just like sort of, you know, really angry because like I just don't think that you think, you know, like - I don't think you take me seriously. You know, I don't think anybody does. </p>

<p>Like, I don't think that you think like that. I mean, like, if you didn't come here on time, I would you know commit suicide or something waiting to tell you something. And I could. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shit. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're saying something else though. Something like, "come on, take me seriously," is what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like what I have to say and stuff like - I mean, I just felt like if you're a pupil, you would take me seriously, and I just don't feel you are. I mean I don't feel, you know, anybody does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's part of it. There's more though. Come on. I don't take you serious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess like part, you know, taking it seriously is, like, also like then that shows that you care sort of what happens to me. You know, and I don't think I guess anybody cares.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do to your knee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you do to your knee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I fell off my f***ing bike.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You should've seen it before. It was horrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm sorry. I really am. 0:04:03.8</p>

<p>I'm sorry, you know, you had to wait. I think given the situation, though, I would have done the same thing over again. Okay? I mean, your anger feels right at me, and I'm sorry about that and I'm not, okay. Mainly I am. </p>

<p>And I wasn't late because I don't take you seriously. It's because I got swamped by emergency calls this morning. Emergency calls, people at kind of critical points. I would have done the same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's good to hear that you take me seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No, I take you seriously.</p>

<p>I had a group from - I'm going to make some excuses. I'm going to do some excuses, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was in Ontario yesterday, and I got back just in time to do a group last night from 8 o'clock till 3 - or 2 or something. I was doing - I was working Sunday morning in Ontario starting at about 9, and I got to bed last night about 4. Before I got to bed, I got two emergency calls that had to be dealt with this morning. Something like - and then just as I was leaving, I got a third one.</p>

<p>Yeah. So how did that make you feel? 0:06:09.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No - yeah, but your point - nevertheless all your points are valid. And I think that anger is good, all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just really - I cannot express it very well, you know, at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In fact, I had talked - I wasn't even going to say anything. Like I said well, it doesn't really make any difference. You know, I said, you know, it really does, it's like sort of denying what does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but we have to get you into a group. I was thinking about that yesterday and last night in this other group. I want to put together a group of eight people, which is different from that other thing we talked about. That would be more of a training group; this will be a little different. Although I could build both of them put it in at the same place. I'll start that.</p>

<p>In fact, maybe I'll get that - the only thing - two things that's holding me up. One, I don't have any time. But mainly - also I don't have any time to organize it. But if I can put them together I'm going to invite you. I'll put you first on my list. </p>

<p>That'd be a very good group, I think. I thought of the people I'm going to invite next.</p>

<p>Okay, what happened? Where have you been the last week? What's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What, the last meeting?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where are you now? Let me ask it that way. Seems like I haven't seen you in a hundred years.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) Oh, I don't know. I'm just sort of all around down. Is that what happened, that all around down? </p>

<p>Everything just seems too confusing. I almost couldn't get out of bed this morning, like I just sort of had - I don't know, I've got too much shit to do. I don't know. I don't know. I have to make all these horrible decisions about next year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what do you mean, all these horrible - that's like - let's take some of these one at a time, okay? Okay? What about all these decisions you have to make for next year. What's one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm going to do. You know, if I'm going to teach, where I'm going to teach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Will you be finished with the program this year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In August.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you have to go out into the world, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm out in the world now. Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the world.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, all right. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I have to decide - I don't know, I have to do it all by myself, you know (laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're scared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't want to make the decisions either.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course not. Yeah, doesn't make any sense. You're not too good at that one, right, that decision making stuff. That's not your long suit, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know. I understand that.</p>

<p>Okay. We have to work on that then, right? 0:10:01.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you want to do next year?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't really want to do anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, why don't you do that then? That should be easy to arrange. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right? That doesn't sound like it makes (inaudible at 0:10:25.5)? So if you think about other things, what you might do, and if nothing else works out, you get what you want. Right? Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, there's all - like I always have to push on to something else. That - like whatever I want to do, I want to do for a year. I decide then I'll go on and get something else. You know, like I - real illusions of grandeur or something, like I would never be satisfied really with teaching. I have to go on and get another degree. </p>

<p>And I don't - I mean what really sort of - you know, yet when I'm in school, I'm always saying, shit, you really never have time sort of to sort out ideas and really do things you want to do. And yet I push myself back into it. So the only way I'm worth anything is with a whole bunch of degrees by my name. That's my, you know - I know this sort of from my family and stuff. </p>

<p>And then I just - the having this (inaudible 0:11:55.1) teachers that are going into two black intercity schools, and I went over there and had these interviews for it. And I couldn't believe I was doing it to myself. And I said what -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, man, I've got to stand up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) What is pushing me over there to do them? I mean, like, I really try to massacre myself as much as I can. (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Overlapping voices at 0:12:28.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, but you see - and I knew better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, what are the other thoughts you're having? What else? Now let's be serious about what you're going to do next year. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'll go back to Jersey.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who lives in New Jersey?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, but your parents do as well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, they live outside - I have friends in Jersey.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you don't have any fantasies of going and living with them, do you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With my family?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh Christ.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just checking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even New Jersey could be too close.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, it wouldn't be. </p>

<p>No, I mean, because I never go home anyways, kind of. Do you know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's not too bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I just think in terms of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's other possibilities (audio interruption at 0:13:56.2)</p>

<p>Yes, well then, now it's down to like what you're talking about is you want to go there. Okay, that sounds good. That feels very good to me, like, if I have friends there, I don't have to be aggravated with my parents, but they're there if I want to be. (Laughs.) </p>

<p>Okay. That's okay. And, you can do skiing. You can get into that and you like that, right?</p>

<p>So you're talking about for yourself now. That part sounds very good to me. Okay, more. Say more for you. I want to hear more about you, what you want.</p>

<p>Can you get a job in New Jersey?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Could I get one?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm going to have some interviews when I get home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are? Okay, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I always do that because I'm - I mean like, you know, I haven't like put it out of my mind, and I wrote all those stupid things and got all these - why is that good?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's good. Okay, that's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I've taken that sort of - it's just that it doesn't me turn me-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't turn you on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing turns me on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) </p>

<p>PATIENT: No but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which brings up another subject doesn't it, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Turning on, something about that. Talk to me more about that.'</p>

<p>PATIENT: About turning on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you want me to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.) </p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.) Well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Come on. I want to know what's happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, what do you - you mean about seeing how awful I've done? (Laughs.) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like what are you talking about?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow. </p>

<p>So, I mean you can take - you can do whatever you want with it, okay. That's up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can go wherever you want to now, all right. I'll give you - here's a lot of space here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, that's just - I mean, like I just - I mean I feel like sort completely barren. Everything, you know, emotionally, mentally, but that's a whole sort of another thing, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just feel it doesn't make any difference - oh, I don't know. I can't really say I feel bad. I think I do, but it doesn't make any difference, you know, where I go. I'm a big nothing. You know, I'm just sort of down on myself. 0:16:38.2</p>

<p>And you know, but it's like this very sort of - it's really unreal. Have you ever had that feeling?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hold, okay? I feel like there's some parts that I want to ask you about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In terms of what you want. I didn't hear anything - you know, what happened to your sex crusade?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened with that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where are you? Did you talk to that guy, what's his face? You know, the guy in class.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, see I haven't - I cut class and he cut, so I haven't seen him for a week. Then I went out with two horribly boring people last weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, that's bad. That's really horrible. That's nonexistent. </p>

<p>Oh, the crusade's still on.</p>

<p>But see, like, I know when, like, I'm rationalizing, but that doesn't make any difference to me. As soon as I sort of straighten out what I'm doing with myself and stuff like that which is a lot of shit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shit - (laughs.) </p>

<p>Question, are 8 o'clock on Wednesdays okay for you? Eight o'clock until who knows when for a group?</p>

<p>PATIENT: For a group?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just checking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just starting to check. That's okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm scared though, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course. Of course.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course you are. (Laughs.) That's the point</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, 8 o'clock is fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. List of people I want to invite. I also want to bring two other leaders in because I won't be able to be there. Let me see, who the hell can I bring in for that. Ah, that's one. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'm getting it off the ground quick.</p>

<p>Okay, group, Wednesday, you. All right. Good. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't feel like I'm expressing like what I really feel right now. That's why I should try, right? 0:19:58.6</p>

<p>Like there's sort of - like I think I just blocked everything, you know. Like I just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something about me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Except - well, yes and no. I don't know what's happening like in here for me, you know, if anything's - what sort of things are really getting resolved. But then I don't even know what, you know, to get resolved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that got to do with me? Try to figure out up here what that's got to do with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I feel like you should help me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's assume you're right, okay? And now let's say what has that got to do with me. What am I doing or not doing that's been connected by that? 0:21:04.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe you should sort of - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, try. Maybe I should -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Push -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try, come on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, make me push at things more so I really - I don't feel I get in very deeply into things. And like it's really hard for me because I never can. I mean, I just don't want to sort of. Like I do everything sort of (inaudible) I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want me to be helpful (inaudible 0:21:44.0) you want? Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then I - yeah, but then I say well I should be doing all the leaning on myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I have mixed - let me tell you how I how I feel about that. That's something- you're onto something about that, pushed or should you be pushed. Should you push it out or should I pull it out, or should I push at you. You're onto something there it seems to me.</p>

<p>My feeling about that is that one part of that felt very good to me, like I felt released to push more on you. And then there was another side of that to that said wait a minute, you're one of the most pushiest therapists in the business - (laughs) - you know? See what I mean? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see myself as being fairly pushy as a counselor already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: With me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With everybody. I have a reputation for being pushy. Forget with the clients, with the staff. I push very hard on the staff. At least I feel it. </p>

<p>So where is that? What is that going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think you're very pushy with me. 0:23:04.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What do you - what's in those eyes, what's above that? What's that? Come on. Don't smile.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your eyes are wet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are wet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I just feel like crying for some reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, why don't you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't. No I don't want to - I can't stay. I don't want to cry. I'm not good at crying. I don't like to cry. It bothers me to cry. You know, I just get really upset when I start - I don't like it. So I sort of rationalize there's no reason to cry, you know.</p>

<p>I don't know, I'm just completely down, I guess. But I can't - I don't want to cry, but -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:24:09.9) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I just - I can't. No, I feel really bad right now. No.</p>

<p>You know like I just don't - I just don't feel like, you know. I just can't in situations like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't. Like I rationalize -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just shut up. Shut up. Shut up and - close your eyes and shut up. 0:24:56.5</p>

<p>Where does it hurt? Your body, where does it hurt? Where?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All up and down my legs, and my stomach.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Pay attention to that. Don't try moving away, just feel it.</p>

<p>See if something comes to it, a word or a picture or something.</p>

<p>Something come to it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? Tell me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I just feel really, you know, I'm scared of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What parts? What do you mean you're scared of yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just think I sort of closed off all my emotions. I just became like my father. You know, I was thinking when he came.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go back to your stomach. Shut your eyes and go back to your stomach. Inhale in. 0:27:02.5</p>

<p>Does it hurt there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It hurts here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Stay with it; don't try to push it away. Don't look for it so hard. Don't look too hard. Don't try to make so intense out of it. </p>

<p>Let it go, see if it grows. If it gets worse, let it get worse.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were going to say something. You stopped yourself. How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't sure if it was really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doesn't have to be really true when it comes out of your mouth. We do that a lot. Let it out then stop yourself. Don't do that. Let it come out. </p>

<p>We can rearrange it later, or we can erase it. Okay? Do you understand yet? That's important. You have control over that, okay. That's a place - that's a good place we have there now. 0:29:21.5</p>

<p>Don't stop yourself in here. Some places, that's not - you don't have control over that yet, that stopping yourself. Don't try to stop yourself without lying to stop yourself. </p>

<p>But that word stuff you do, you can do that. You can do better, right?</p>

<p>What were you going to say? You know, the stuff that wasn't true? What were you going to say? Come on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was just going to say - oh, I don't know.</p>

<p>I feel like there's like five layers between me and you. And like, you know, like I'm just so -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say what those layers are if you can. You're onto something there. 0:31:15.5</p>

<p>Don't sensor it. It could be anything, could be fantasy, image. Try not to sensor anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it's just like I'm sort of down in a well and I can't get out, or I'm trying to push and I can't get near you. Like I don't - I mean I just sort of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like and I'm just sort of scared because I - I mean like I should be able to cry in here, and I can't cry. And like I didn't want to, and then I rationalize the lie I really wanted to but I - just will not let my emotions really out, and that just hit me and I saw how really true it was. You know, that - I guess I just feel like I crawl into myself more and more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it - let me ask you this. I hear that, okay, and there's some anguish in that, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It has something to do with me and how you feel about me. I don't know what that is. I know you like me, and I know you know I like you, right? And I want to know if that part is getting in the way. Would it be easier if we didn't like each other so much? </p>

<p>Are you afraid to be foolish in front of me? 0:32:55.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't - because I think I am a lot. No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because I really want you to cry in here, and other things too, right. I really wish you would. It's okay that you didn't, but either way is okay with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you know, like, I wanted to cry then but I couldn't tell you why. And I guess I thought you wanted me to tell you why and I couldn't tell you, and then I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no, you don't have to - you don't have to say why. No, no. Just do it to do it, but it's worthwhile to do it by itself. Okay? You don't have to have a reason for it. Okay? Too many reasons, too many reasons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>Yuck. Okay, what are we going to do with you, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like hiding under the bed.</p>

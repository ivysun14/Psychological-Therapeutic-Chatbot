<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Seems to be working.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: An administrative question - have you heard back from Brown? About the appeal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I haven't. I did hear back from the insurance, but they - I forgot to tell you this, this started a couple of weeks ago - that they were reprocessing that thing from the claim as partial inpatient, so that the aid would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I haven't heard back from her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, whatever - just tell me what I need to do and I'll do it. I can go badger them if that would help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah, I imagine if you (pause) called whomever the contact person is there, I wouldn't do any serious badgering, that's certainly not necessary. They need to know we just want to know that other people know about it. [00:01:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Knowing may get this organized, you're certainly right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And I should get you a bill at some point soon, so if - there'd be a big enough difference, depending on what they do, that it would be hard for me to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: When it comes to the bill? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the insurance said they're already? All right, so I should resubmit then, to the insurance company.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because they said they were in the process of redoing it. I'm sorry, I forgot about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't worry about it. Whatever you need me to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right (pause). I won't worry about the appeal!</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So. [00:01:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel better this morning. Fine. (pause) Anxious about things that I think are reasonable to be anxious about. Now I have to find a new apartment and a job in the next couple of months, and that is bad - finding a new job takes a long time sometimes, and that is nerve wracking, and so on. (pause) But it is good to feel like I've made a decision and taken some control. And it's not like I can't take the decision back if I decided to. (pause)But I doubt that I will change my mind. (pause) I guess the thing I'm anxious about (pause) is that in some ways this is pretty typical of me, to get myself in the situation where the work that I'm doing is more than I can handle, and I have to stretch myself thinner and thinner and thinner and thinner, and finally it's just like, "No, I'm done", and walk away, and have that be it. (pause) That's not really a pattern I'd like to continue with. I want to go back to this, I don't want to have this be the end of my academic career. I think it could easily be. [00:03:43]</p>

<p>When I was in high school and college, I did a lot of theatre. That's all I did. I really wanted to have a career in it, for - a second career in it, because - realistic expectations and so forth. And yeah, several of my close friends are still kind of working as legal secretaries and acting, that kind of thing. But about halfway through college I got into a situation - I was working four shows at the same time, and the department at my school was not a very healthy department in some ways. I finally had a really good part on a main stage production of... Actually, I can't remember a name but that's true of all of the secondary characters in Shakespeare. It was a secondary female lead in "The Merchant of Venice", which is one of my favorite plays. And none of the faculty cared about the show at all. There just was no commitment to it. And we were - the students were all incredibly committed to it. And between that, and - there was one night where I got out of rehearsal at 11:30, and I had class at 9:00 the next morning, I hadn't eaten all day, and I hadn't slept in 24 hours, and I had four hours of homework that I had to do. So I was just like, "Okay, I have to do something. But there are all these things that I have to do, and I can't do any of them." I just collapsed. And James put me to bed, made Franco - (chuckling) this is the story of my life, Franco has a car - made Franco drive out to Walmart, which was the only place that was open, to get a frozen pizza, woke me up, made me eat it, and then e-mailed my professors like, "Tanya's not coming to class tomorrow." He's good that way. (chuckles) But after that, I decided to say, "Okay, I'm just going to take a break from theatre. I'm just not going to do it." And I just quit. And I couldn't imagine my life without theatre, but I just said I have to quit entirely, because there's no way I could do a show and not have that show be the center of my life, be the most important thing. [00:06:36]</p>

<p>And if I want to go back to it I will, but I never did. And that was the right - certainly I'm glad that I didn't try to make a career in theatre, because that just wouldn't have been good for me. It's just not stable enough for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tough life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, It's an incredibly hard life, and I wasn't good enough. I was - I just didn't quite have it. I was good, but I... yeah. (pause) And I knew that. So (pause) I don't want this to be that. (pause) Yeah, I need to find some balance, (pause) and not just walk away. And one of the side effects from walking away from theatre was that I lost all of my friends who were in the theatre at the school. You know, because it's a very close-knit community and they spend all of their time together, because all of their free time is spent doing something for some show or another, they're always working on five shows. [00:08:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had time to spend time together on things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's really, really good. But as it turns out, what I had in common with everybody - except for Franco, he and I became friends through theatre. But both of us - he was the only person that I kind of remained friends with, in part because once I didn't have that bond we didn't actually have that much in common, in part I think people felt betrayed, you know, like I just dropped everybody. And in part because I constructed this persona where people thought I wasn't very smart, and eventually I realized that I was playing dumb, and I was like, "That's not a good idea. I don't want to do this anymore." And when I stopped playing dumb, people stopped wanting to hang out with me. [00:09:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That sounds like a problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) It was a disappointing experience. (pause) But also, I mean, it was good to say, "Okay, well, I've never been in a situation where I could make people really, really like me and have lots of friends." And now I know that I can do that, but I know that I don't want to do that because it's not worth it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. But it did something for your confidence in a way, even how things had gone, I guess, especially socially before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was a popular kid, for like six months. I mean, in theatre, which... (chuckling) That's what I think about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So now I'm saying, I'm just going to put this thing down for a while, and... (pause) because I have to get better. I can't do it anymore. But (pause) I don't know how I'm going to learn to do things that I'm passionate about and also take care of myself when I'm not doing those things. You know? [00:10:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, feels like a very central question and problem.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That, and I feel like a failure. But that hasn't really changed as much as I think it will. And I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what made you feel like a failure? For not being able to manage both of those things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for having to take time off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: For having to admit what I - for having to admit that I haven't been doing work for a month (chuckles). That I can't do my work right now. Yeah. (pause) That, and I need help. Realistically I'll probably just really overshare and everyone will be really uncomfortable, but (chuckles)... that's not ideal. (pause) [00:13:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that a lot of that seems to do - seems to have to do with the struggle between (pause) what you need to do - what you're accomplishing sort of socially, or now academically. Or, I think socially in the sense of just how you treat people. Trying to balance all those sorts of things, the things that you can work very hard at, and be, I think, very self-sacrificing around in order to be able to feel okay about yourself. And the things you need to do to take care of yourself. Am I making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know, obviously the goal is to get to the point where I don't have to be self-sacrificing in order to feel okay about myself. That being said, I can't imagine (pause) I want a life that's structured around (pause) doing something that's bigger than myself. I want a life that - I want my job to be something that I'm really passionate about. And something that serves people in some way. (pause) So how do I do that without getting in my own way? By making that - serving other people become the thing that is making me feel okay about myself, rather than saying I want to do it because it's a good thing to do. Does that make sense? [00:15:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That makes sense. Yeah, you want to sort of disentangle it from the first and have it be much more of the second.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I imagine you probably can make it up for something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For the fact that I'm here. Something I feel like I have to make up for. (pause) But at the same time... (pause) He screwed a lot of things up as a father, let's be clear. But I think one of the values that I learned mostly from him is that a life of service is a really, really good life. And I want that. (pause) I don't know whether he feels that he's making it for something. I don't think so. I don't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But for those two things on the end are (pause) not necessarily related. A life of service, and the feeling of having to serve in order to make up for something. [00:17:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, I don't think that they have to be related. And in some ways, they end up being (pause) they end up being in conflict, because I end up putting myself in impossible situations. (pause) Right, where I can't do what I really want to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So thinking about what I'm going to do for the next year - part of, I mean... (pause) I was talking with James last night. His sister is a teacher. She has a young kid and has quit her job, quit her job because she pretty much wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. But she's doing a long-term sub situation at a school this year. And just hates it. And... It's an awkward situation because I sat in on her classroom once when I was looking at teaching jobs, and I think she's a really, really bad teacher, but I can't say that to her. I have said that to James, finally... I mean, not that she's a poor teacher, but I think her philosophy of teaching is something that I think is harmful to kids, and I (pause) so I just don't talk about it. I try to avoid it. But, so, telling you that, he's like, well, you shouldn't (pause) don't build up your mind against teaching right now if in a week you come back and you say maybe this is something you'd like to do. Because, I mean, it's impossible for you to do a worse job than she is doing right now, I think. (chuckles) I mean, she's so miserable, and she's committed to be there but she is not trying, she hates the kids...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They think she's horrible, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I... I feel bad coming to that conclusion because I know that's a really hard school. And she taught in a backwoods poor public school, and I taught in a fancy pants private school. There's a difference in the kids we had to deal with. But I don't care. I can't say that it's good work when it's not good work. (pause) But it's like, basically he was saying that it wouldn't be the end of the world to take a teaching job - if you phoned it in, you would still do a really good job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I saw.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what he was getting at. But I can't take a teaching job and feel okay about phoning it in. If I do that, that's another thing that - this is my number one priority. This is what I have to give myself to. (pause) So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess that I would imagine that if you feel like you've got something to make up for... phoning it in isn't going to make up for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly. And particularly with - especially with teaching, where the responsibility is so great. You know? (pause) Yeah. So... (pause) But then does that mean I just have to set out to look for jobs that I'm not going to be very interested in? (chuckling) I don't know. I mean, the range of things that I feel like I'm qualified to do, that are - that I feel like I could be relaxed about doing is not very large. So... And you know, but what jobs are there? I'll just apply (mumbles) [00:22:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean, to the extent that this is a psychological issue, I'm not so sure that's a good strategic solution. But that doesn't mean that one situation couldn't be easier than another. Otherwise, taking a year off school wouldn't help. But if this is about having to do something that (pause) helps you, or that makes you feel worthwhile as a human being, and yet (pause) not wanting to commit to something at a level that's going to make you feel that way because that would be too much, I don't know that there's a strategic way out of that. Although that, again, doesn't mean all the things are the same either. [00:23:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So you're saying I'm just going to have to deal with it as I come on it? Come to it? Or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think this will come up in some permutation, involving either feeling like you're not doing something that's really serving, or really making you feel worthwhile as a person, or you will, and then there'll be some struggle around how much you're giving yourself to it. I mean...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope it doesn't happen that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But if past experience is any guide for future experience, it probably will (chuckles). Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess (pause) maybe I'm partly reacting, when I think about it - maybe there was a bit of a implicit sort of request or plea in there when you said, "All right, I'll just have to figure it out... any ideas?" (chuckling) Maybe that's not it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess there was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I could ask (chuckling). For help.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there was, but I don't expect you to respond to questions that I don't ask. I don't think that's fair. I don't think that's fair to ask a question without asking you. Mostly what I was saying is that I don't have any ideas. But... yeah. I just - it just drives me nuts in other people, (chuckling) I try really hard not to do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, you know, say what you want. I try hard just to say what I want. And if I don't succeed in that, (pause) just so you know, I'm not</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you're worried about putting me on a - yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, unfair position in one way or another. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems pretty likely to me this is something you want help with.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also understand you're saying that you don't want me to feel responsible for answering the question that you didn't ask. I think either way, you're worried there seems to be about putting me in a difficult position of perhaps not having an answer to a difficult question, or feeling like I somehow should have known you wanted some help even though you didn't ask for it, but I'm responsible for it anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely the second. I don't want that to happen. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would be the problem with that? (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it (pause) People are pretty passive aggressive in my family. Both of - both of my parents do this thing where they state - say something about their situation and kind of imply an expectation of me, or of people around them to fix that somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:27:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then get upset when that's not met. And I just don't think - it's just not a fair way to communicate.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's important to me to not... not to expect other people to read my mind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Come to think of it, my high school best friend was - did the exact same thing. I don't have very many very clear memories of that anymore, but I definitely remember him being that - doing that kind of thing. And the thing is, I grew up thinking that I wasn't allowed to ask for what I needed, and so I have been very, very passive aggressive and very much... (pause) Like I said, as a child and a teenager, that was the only way that I felt okay with asking for what I wanted, was to not ask for it and hope it happened. And I'm just trying not to do that. So I think if you take it too far, it just gets really ugly. It's not really... certainly when I'm with my mother, I feel like I'm in a place of constantly having to anticipate what she needs, or what she wants, from the clues that she's leaving, and that's a huge strain. With my dad, I've learned to be a little more assertive about it, and say, "Well, if you don't ask for it, I'm sorry. You're not getting it." Or like, if - I can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine it's not just that you learned that, although it sounds like you have. But that could work with him in a way that that it wouldn't work with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. He's much more willing to say, "Oh, yeah, sorry about that." Yeah. (pause) But God, watching him and Joanne - my stepmother - watching them communicate is... (pause) Because they both do it to each other, so it's funny. (chuckling) It's kind of like... if I didn't love them, it would be hilarious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, oh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>I guess it also makes musings of what we were just (pause) talking about, to do with (pause) - not just the sort of desire or inspiration (pause) to sort of live a life of sort of, but the compulsionary sense of having to make up for something or in order to feel worthwhile. What you were saying about being a kid and not being able to ask for things, and having to - I guess in various ways, take care of what was going on with your parents in order to feel like you could have anything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Which is why it's, I mean, very hard for me to assimilate you saying, you know, maybe sometimes you just need people to take care of you without having to ask for it. (pause) Because I can't see a model of that, that's not a model of... (pause) coercion.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that's the one you knew.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:32:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if, in principle, such a thing might be (pause) a non-coercive model in which somebody could take care of you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I like what you described with James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With the pizza, and the car, and all that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But when people do that for me, I feel bad. Um, yeah. It's - I feel very grateful and very loved and very taken care of, but there's also this just enormous shame that goes along with it for me that I can't extricate myself from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Sure. I mean, like you say, it's the only model that you know is one in which that's really forced kind of brutally on somebody who treated you as a kid, who in - however precocious came unequipped to really be doing that, or at least unfairly pressed into service doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The thing that's so sad about it is, I mean, talking about my mother with, about her family, is basically just like, four generations of moms who just are not very good at it. Because her mother is (pause) kind of classic abusive narcissist. And so she grew up with having to (pause) anticipate... existing in order to anticipate her mother's needs. Whatever that was. And so... (pause) It's just so heartbreaking that she'll just say, "I just don't want that for you." But it's exactly what she's doing. (chuckles) [00:34:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh, gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you know, I can't tell her - I mean actually I did, at one point, say, "Yeah, a lot of those things are things you do to me." But she also (pause) when she hears something that she can't deal with, she forgets it. So I don't think she remembers my saying that ever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) I'm a little scared of having kids. (chuckles) Like, this needs to stop here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you guys have a time frame about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well, we did at one point, but it was based on the very naive understanding of how PhD programs worked. (chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were both young and naive at the time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This was like two years ago. So at first we were all like, "I'll get my degree, and then we'll have kids." And then I was kind of thinking, "Well, I'll take my exams, and then we'll, you know, have kids, and I'll write the dissertation more slowly and take some time off." I'm going to want to - I'm probably going to want to take at least a year off. But I don't even know. I know that I can't be a stay-at-home mom, that I have to have some kind of work. But it's also really important to both of us to be with our kids pretty constantly when they're little. I'm starting to want to have kids soon, like within the next couple of years, but I can't now. I need to be in a better place. Also, we need to not both be graduate students, and have an income and be more stable and stuff. But yeah. (pause) Yeah, that's a very big can of worms. (chuckling) But you know, it's something I'm really excited about, and more or less optimistic about (pause) but... You know, I think I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that we pretty much all just screw up our kids in some way or another. (chuckling) The important thing is to be open to that. (chuckling) I'm not sure what that is though, but James's parents are very different from mine, in that I think when James only really became an adult that he's been able to see any weaknesses in his parents at all. Even when we started dating, he was still in the worshipful phase. That's really nice, they're really good parents. (pause) Yeah. Although I mean, I don't... (pause) They're really good parents, even though some of the things that they do as parents, if they would try to exercise authority over me now, that would not work. Yeah. His mom's a yeller. I can't do that. That wouldn't work. I mean, it's kind of hilarious now. She's just, she has this big temper. And then she kind of gets over it, and then everybody laughs at her. She laughs at herself. [00:39:15]</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things I'm most afraid of - about with this, that - is that I won't be able to have kids. Or that I won't be in a place emotionally where I can be a good parent. My best friend from high school who has followed, more or less, a similar trajectory to mine in terms of recurring mental illness in really bad ways, although for her it's eating disorders compared to our side of it. And she has a baby. And it was just so much what she wanted for so long, and she had two miscarriages before she had a child, and it's just horrible, and she's so happy. But I think, you know, I think she's depressed again and is having to deal with the fact that she can have everything she's ever wanted, and still be depressed. Which, I mean, I'm kind of grateful of. I beat you there by about six months. (chuckles) But she did have to kind of wait until she was in a stable place before she started trying to get pregnant. (pause) But, I don't know. (pause) [00:41:18]</p>

<p>It's kind of a wide-ranging day. (pause)</p>

<p>Yeah, if I do decide, considering the way James makes decisions... Have I told you about how James and I got engaged?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So about six months after we started dating, we had a conversation where we both said, "Yeah, I could see us getting married. Yeah, this is it." And we were like, "But we're not there yet, so let's just not talk about it anymore. Because that'll just put pressure and make everything bad. We'll just keep doing it small, this is fine." And when we were talking about applying to graduate schools, we were both 22, which in my mind is really young to be getting married. My family gets married when we're 30, practically. We were - and his parents are really not okay with cohabitation before marriage. So we're talking about moving across the country to go to grad school, and how are we - are we really going to rent two apartments? I don't think that's a good idea. That's just silly. And James, just out of the blue, said, "Well, we could just get married." And I said, "Oh, God. Um, okay. Let me think about this." And hung up. And two days later, I called him up and said, "Okay, yeah, let's get married." And he said, "Oh, God." (chuckling) He was like, "Let me think about this." And then a year and a half later, we got engaged. (chuckling) So I think I need to start saying, "Let's have kids." Two years before I want to actually have kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He needs a little room.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or just, I know the decisions that he's going to make before he makes them. He needs the time to make them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some time or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop. But we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, thanks.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the let's see...it's the eighteenth interview. Eighteenth interview. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm getting ready for this party tonight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Party? Is this that party -?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That thing for the four people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [For the to-be Mounties] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I spent all last night barbecuing chickens and then Daisy's boyfriend Marco came over and he brought all this grass. I decided that since last Tuesday what has begun is just one continuous party towards getting out of here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 0:41)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Party moving towards] (ph) (inaudible@ 0:4.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no just a party towards getting out of here between now and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You mean everyone is kind of finished?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean between now and graduation there's this party Friday night - I don't know whether all the people at school are having a party - I assume they probably will. But then the group of people that I work with in Albany that I'm training, the last night of our meeting we're having a party. Just all kinds of things are ending up being parties. Wednesday night we talked about at the training thing and came to the conclusion that the best way I deal with termination is through celebration. I feel kind of good. I guess I didn't come having anything to say today at all. I was just thinking about what happened Wednesday night before the training thing. One of the women who's in the group was in there and two people were going to be absent, Sadie and Seth. And I guess they've got a thing going between them. I don't know. And Marla said that it started and then she didn't want to tell because she thought it ought to be up to Sadie to say it. But then she got into it anyway and she was talking to Gary and I as was saying that Sadie and Seth decided that they weren't getting anything out of the training at all. And Marla told them, "You probably ought to tell Casey that. I'm sure she can deal with it." And I sort of anticipate that for some of the people there. That it isn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That they're not going to - [2:39]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, those are the two that I had mentioned before...Sadie and Seth, who are kind of intellectual. So okay I can see - I think they are getting something out of it. I don't think they see what it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you take it kind of - does it feel bad to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that was what was interesting. I heard it. Yeah, I can deal with it. Well, yeah, I guess it is but it's like dealing with anything if people aren't satisfied with it, some place there's a pang of discouragement or disappointment or something that you aren't getting through or something like that. [3:16]</p>

<p>So I felt that for a little bit and then I thought, "Well, I think they are getting something out of it." And they can't verbalize what it is or describe what it is. And consequently, they don't think they're getting anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They don't feel like they are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So knowing this - and you know, the two weeks before I had said, "Is there anything you guys want to do that we aren't covering?" So I kind of began to throw that out. And again for the third time no one has ever replied. Seth did once and I think we dealt with it. So I threw it out that again is there anything that you feel like we ought to be covering that we aren't that we can still get in before we end? Or is there something about what we're doing that's extremely dissatisfying? That maybe we can still alter at least somewhat? No one said a word. And I knew Sadie wouldn't say anything because well she does that. She'll talk about something and never really confront it when given an opportunity in a group. So nothing happened out of it. And I didn't confront her because I think Marla's right. It's up to Sadie to personally do that if she can. And I tried to give her an opportunity to. I guess nothing's really happened significantly to me since Wednesday crisis-wise or feeling-wise. [4:46]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean nothing kind of feels kind of terribly relevant or important? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no, I guess (inaudible@ 4:58) although I don't feel very serious about as before I left Wednesday. It's really kind of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 5:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to go out to Albany. Gary had called earlier and said, "Look, I'm not meeting with (inaudible@ 5:13) we can have supper or dinner together. Which is what we usually do anyway although he was going to be done earlier. And I was really kind of, "Yeah, that's great! We can spend some time together. So Don decided he was going to go to and I guess I got a little nervous about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That the two of them would be together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when I felt it was the only time Gary and I got to spend just talking together. And it was sort of like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you didn't want Don there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was like an imposition. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look like it's embarrassing for you or like you shouldn't [feel that way?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess as I felt uncomfortable about - he was going to just drive out with me. He's got some friends out there from school. But the whole thing just sort of made me nervous. And it was troubling in that why the hell should I feel - I shouldn't feel nervous about it. I mean, if I'm completely comfortable with the way I feel about Don and about Gary, maybe I oughtn't feel uncomfortable about that. On the other hand, I guess as I talk now I think I, "Well, I guess there is a little bit of a reason to be uncomfortable."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, even if you were perfectly comfortable on how you feel, there's a reason to be uncomfortable just when you relate to someone. I mean, you know, Gary knows, Don doesn't know. And you kind of in relating to Don it's like you have to decide to relate to Gary as you would were Don not there or relate for Don's sake as if nothing happened. [6:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then the other possibility is also that you don't (inaudible@ 6:46) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Well, what ended up is that - I don't know if I said this Wednesday or got into it - but Tuesday night we'd gotten stoned. Did I tell you about that? And somehow last Thursday came up and I don't know -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is you and Don?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, we were all sitting at table, Jill and Daisy and Marco and Don and I. And something came up about last Thursday. And I was really stoned. I don't know what I said. I said something about it was a really exhausting day or I said something about Thursday. And I don't know whether it was suggestive or - Daisy always rides me about Gary - I haven't said anything to her since last Thursday - but the joking that Gary and I do all the time with sexual overtones, Daisy heard a conversation. And she said, "What's going on?" And I said, "Nothing." And at that point nothing had happened. But I didn't say anything to her about what went on last Thursday. I didn't say anything to anybody about it. And so Daisy sort of jokes about it. And I joke about it too. But I don't know what I said, but Don got sort of upset. "I want to know what went on last Thursday! I want to know what went on last Thursday!" And he kept saying this. He kept saying this. Really upset. So I said - well all these people were sitting there and I didn't want to talk about it very much at all. So I kind of just talked to him quietly as I could and said that after the thing, Gary and I had gone out and had a couple of drinks. [8:32]</p>

<p>And I was as honest about it as I felt comfortable about it in terms of saying we were talking about he and I, about you and I, about Marge and Gary, which was true. I didn't tell him about any other kind of relationship in terms of our sitting in my Volkswagen making out or anything. I didn't say anything about that. So then Wednesday when I left I kept feeling - you know, he didn't talk to me very much on Wednesday. He was really upset and I kind of sensed that it was around that he wasn't satisfied with what I'd said about Thursday. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 9:10)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but he wouldn't admit that. And once during the day, I said, "You're bugged about Thursday aren't you?" And he denied it. So before I left - you know when we talked Wednesday, I really felt some anxiousness to talk to him. When I got home I thought we were going to be able to be alone and he was sitting in the living room watching TV and said barely two words to me. He had nothing to say. And I felt like to talk about the seriousness of the things that I had to say it took a very comfortable situation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, the right atmosphere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it wasn't there. And he would (inaudible@ 9:51) So -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what kind of turned you off. You were kind of up for it and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah! It turned me off a lot. It was really aggravating because he starting talking about how strange he thought I was being. You know, I'd told you that (inaudible@ 10:12) and so I said, "Well, there's lots of things I want to talk about and I feel as though we haven't been able to yet take that time. And maybe my [uncomfortableness] (sp?) is around that. I haven't seen you for three weeks and I can't help it that things happen to the two of us and we aren't there to share them." And there is something strange about we've got to share or I feel the need I have to say them. And it's almost as though until we can sit down and do that that strangeness is sort of there. We talked about a number of things and it wasn't the most comfortable timing but it got to be comfortable as we started talking about our talking. And I told him about our talk last Friday or whatever it was. [11:12]</p>

<p>And I don't know. The things he said sort of sounded like distrustful of my relationships with men or something. And it just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't say anything to him more about the Gary thing (inaudible@ 11:25)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that comes as he -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was wondering where that distrust [comes from] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe that was my own perception.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Let me make sure I understand. You were talking to him about the things we talked about. About sexual uncomfortableness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, other stuff too. I guess the feelings that he had were around my feeling strange that he didn't have any discomfort when he came to see me after being separated for three weeks and all. And he didn't understand how I could be that way. Things like that which kind of built up inside of him. At least that was my perception that he was uncomfortable about there's something wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's something wrong with you. I don't feel that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or else I'm doing something and I'm not telling him about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [He might have something there.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, okay, at that point, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But going on is stopping you] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Although that strangeness isn't uncommon for -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Even when there isn't something.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess I'm always really reluctant to tell him that I've dated anybody, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because he gets real jealous or it really upsets him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think it's my own perception of something or that maybe I shouldn't be doing it. I don't know. I don't know that he's </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's kind of like you don't feel quite right about it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like there's something like you're not quite sure if you feel right about it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, this is more general. Not just Gary but anybody that I see. And yet he comes along and he'll talk about going out with girls and he says nothing happened. But he always - and I told him this Wednesday when we were talking - I trust that what he's saying to me is true. He says he's not having any sexual relationships with anyone. Okay. And I think I'm able to accept that now. Where like a year ago or so that would have really made me question our relationship. It doesn't so much now. But he always kinds of throws in something suggestive that something is going on. [13:47]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some kind of innuendo.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and then he gets mad when I question. Well if you're going to suggest it, either tell me or don't suggest it. For example, going to Albany Wednesday, he was going to go to this party. And he said, "Well, if this one person is there I don't think I'm going." And he said it as though, "Well this person." Well, you know, I guess I'm defensive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're supposed to ask who this person is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I jump at, "What person? Who?" And then he jumps on me for questioning. [And you know that's the kind of thing of suggestive well I ought to question.] (ph) It turns out it wasn't even a female at all, but he throws it out. Why couldn't he have just said, "If this one guy is there or if this one girl is there I don't care to go?" But he'll say, "If this one person is there, I'm not going." So as we talked what I told him was that about our talk last Friday and then as I got into it I told him that I guess how we began talking was that when Gary and I were together on Thursday night we started talking about the fact that he had some physical sexual attraction to me and I recognized it too. And it was the first time I guess I was able to verbalize it and I told him that. And I said I felt good about being able to say that and talk about it. And I told him those things. I didn't tell him about being in the car together. [15:24]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And making out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't feel comfortable telling him that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It just kind of felt like you were able to tell him - the fact that you were able to express your attraction for each other. And that seemed kind of funny and tricky at first I imagine. And finally you felt like you could.] (ph) But it just didn't feel right to talk to him about (inaudible@ 15:49)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Part of it was I almost felt pressured to have to explain myself. And I guess just the experience with Gary is something very new for me. And I don't want the good feelings that I have about it to be pulled out. And I really think that they would be if I said any more to Don about it. Like now we're going out with Gary and his wife Saturday night. Gary and I talked about wanting to do that for a long time. And I think we'll have a good time. I think I will because I enjoy Marge too. And I asked Don last night - last night we went over to the bar to pick up the liquor for tonight. Well the man that runs the bar Guv is this guy that I used to work with. He's about forty-five years old or something. He treated me terribly nice. He's taken me out to dinner. Well then he started taking me out to dinner and feeding me all these lines about how he loved me and all this crap. And it was something I felt comfortable sharing with Don because I certainly didn't share those feelings with me. [17:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just kind of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's almost funny. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he was really uncomfortable last night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you told him [about how you feel?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, at the bar. And so I said, "Are you going to be uncomfortable Saturday?" because I shared some things with him about Gary and I. And he said no he didn't think he should be or you know. So I'm a little wary about Saturday night. And Don shows his discomfort in ways that I become uncomfortable with. Like when Kevin and Don and I went over to the bar and on the way over Don started just sort of babbling and really swearing a lot. And it was just sort of like I sensed he was getting uncomfortable. When we got there this woman that Kevin and I know and Don's (inaudible@ 17:56) and she's drunk and really didn't recognize Don's being there very satisfactorily I guess. And he just sat there and didn't say anything and I looked at him. And I said, "You're really uncomfortable." And he really was. He just sat there. "Yeah, well, I feel like I'm not even here." And I couldn't feel that was true in the sense of my being with him because I certainly didn't feel as though I'd been ignoring him sitting there. But he really felt that. </p>

<p>And Guv came over and Guv kind of ignored him. Guv doesn't like him. And okay that's his business or his tough luck. And so I guess I'm just a little leery about - [18:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That same kind of thing could happen [and it seems to be a kind of uncomfortable tense situation.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it could except on the other hand I know Gary isn't the kind of person to ignore anybody. And Marge isn't either. And don't think it should be. I guess what worries me as I talk now is it really becomes hard for me to share with Don feelings about someone else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, it's kind of like you're worried about what will happen when you go out but I mean I do sense kind of you feel very unsettled about specifically where kind of you stopped with him and then kind of the general thing of that like but there's some things are hard for me to talk about and others I can talk about when it comes to my being with someone else.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that part of the dilemma is that I'm not so sure if the discomfort is my own guilt or if it's that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of his reaction.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or Don's reaction to it. I know he can be really jealous.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that make you feel when he's really jealous? Does that make you happy, unhappy? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I find it a little silly. I don't know. Because I guess - I never used to be jealous. He could tell me all kinds of things and I wouldn't be jealous. I guess I would be disturbed if he were having sexual relationships. Part of that distrust or that discomfort about that was that the first year or two when we knew each other and were going together as our relationship grew he kept from or he lied to me. I don't feel as though I've ever lied. Sometimes I'll stop short of telling him everything but I've never lied. And if he would point blank ask me I'd tell him. I just haven't told him everything. [20:52]</p>

<p>And there was one time when he was lying to me. He was firmly saying that he wasn't having any sexual relationships. About three or four months later it comes out he was having sexual relationships and that was just totally dishonest. So I guess my jealousy has grown when he's with another female or something. I can be jealous. I'm not always. It depends on how he suggests things that may make me jealous. And I find that concept kind of silly. That I don't see - there isn't real justification for it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like - the more general thing you're talking about is that it's uncomfortable for you to talk about those things and it may be because of his reaction. Because if he gets jealous, you don't like it but it doesn't sound like it has the same kind of - like it bothers you, you think it's silly but that's kind of not the thing. It's not that he'll be jealous so much because you're reaction is well you don't like him to be jealous. It's silly but it doesn't sound like it's a terribly big thing for you that he's jealous. [22:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, I guess I don't know what other reaction may come out of it. Maybe that's why I've -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he could (inaudible@ 22:20)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that's it. I don't know. When I went out Wednesday night, I had some feelings of discomfort there. I think that was a result of knowing Don was here. And I guess I recognized this later in the evening after everyone else had left Gary and I talked for a while. I guess what it was is that I enjoy Gary and I really wanted to go out and be with him. Then I thought Don is here and this is being sort of devious or something. Not that Wednesday night was because it was a legitimate reason for being there and all. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you somehow feel like what you really want was to be able to be with Gary and see what happens or whatever happens. But you resented the fact that Don was there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don was here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of couldn't really feel free. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well what came at the end of the evening when we were leaving and - I think Gary was really nervous too. He'd been concerned about how I was feeling during the week. Because I'd been able to say that I had some confusion. And I said I felt really good. And then we talked and I said, "I guess I feel it would be nice if we could spend some time together." (inaudible@ 23:57) to fulfill a kind of thing that may be developing or just to talk about it. And he said, "I guess I was afraid to suggest that," or something like that. And I said, "I guess I'm not sure about it in a way. At least right now, I don't see that being possible because I have a commitment to Don's being here and I want to be with him." And I guess that sort of hit it is that I've become torn. But I'd rather be with Don. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You may feel torn but [that's what you want and you don't want to mess it up.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. You know and -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess in a way [telling Don about the whole thing could possible mess it up too.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it would. Certainly if Gary and I spent the day together, or an evening together, or we slept together, or whatever; that would be really upsetting to Don. I mean I'm sure - I guess that's what is discomforting to me is that I would like to share that with him but I don't think I could because he knows that I've never had sexual intercourse with anybody but him. And I think that would really initiate within him all kinds of questions about our getting married - that, "Man! There's something wrong with that." And I really think that would spark off stuff like that for him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Do you think the fact that you did speak with Gary and told him effectively] (ph) (inaudible@ 25:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. And I think at this point that also is a sort of a thing to deal with before going into anything deeper with Gary.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like, "I know that my effect on (inaudible@ 26:09)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I don't think I'd have to say anything you know? If it really disturbed me at all to any degree it would show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 26:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, right and I'm not. I guess I feel like I have to really deal that out before I jump into anything else. And well I'm not troubled - well, I think about it but I'm not troubled with it right now. I'm afraid. Right this second I think I'm afraid I'm putting up that block of thinking about it again and not dealing with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Kind of like it's a lot of things to way and try to know in advance how you're going to feel. So the best solution right now is kind of a lot to try to think about it all] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I sort of feel like I don't have to right now. And it may interfere more with Don and I if I do try to deal with it right now. And you know what's really weird is I find myself setting it up. [27:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Setting up you and Gary sleeping together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like you just imagine it happening?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, like even suggesting Wednesday night that it would be nice if we could spend some time together. And when I said that, I didn't have in mind sleeping together. I just had in mind just spending some time together. And the way Gary picked it up - which I guess can be picked up in the way of suggesting that we get to bed together - I guess that's the way I felt like he picked it up. And as I drove home, I thought, "Jesus Christ! I'm setting myself up and I'm not sure about whether I want to do that yet."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like - it sounds in a way like what happened last week too it's kind of like [there was something similar there in so far as you were setting yourself up for a situation before you really were for sure that is was right for you. [28:20]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Last Thursday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like (inaudible@ 28:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, except that I - but that wasn't set up ahead of time at all. It really just happened. And I didn't -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [You sort of set it up kind of like you let it happen before you realized that you weren't sure you wanted it to happen.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. And now I'm beginning to set this up. And in fact what I've done is - and now I feel really kind of sh*tty about it - is that we're going on this -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 28:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like we're going on this retreat next weekend and nobody's bringing wives or husbands along. And I asked about two weeks ago if Don could come along because I knew he'd be in town. But that was all voted down. It was just going to be our staff to go. So that what I began to suggest to Don is, "You know I don't know if you want to hang around all weekend and I'm not going to be here." And I sort of began setting it up so that he'll be gone until coming back for graduation. Oh, he's not buying into it. He's got it set up so that he'll go to my brother and visit with them for the weekend which may be good because that forces me to deal with it without having set it up or it isn't going to be set up. [29:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Set it for a day or two] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't think so. I don't think that weekend is a setup because there's going to be a lot of people around and I don't feel that that would be - what would be the setup was if Don took off that Friday and didn't come back till Wednesday or Thursday. That would be because I didn't have any responsibility [ around here] (ph). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [So you're kind of feeling like originally tried to set it up but now it's not.] (ph) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's not going to work out that way. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 30:19)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I sense you're not so sure maybe because you're just not sure what you want [or you expect from Gary]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess, yeah. I guess I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that sounds like it's really very basic there. You know it was and it still is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that's from the block [because you haven't really -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess that it all boils down to that kind of fear too that maybe it's not working. That sort of the suggestion of setting something up isn't going to work out. And that may be my way out really. And maybe that's okay because maybe I'm not ready to deal with that kind of situation so maybe that is better instead of getting myself into something that I'm not sure about and having to carry through something that I won't be sure of even going through the experience. And then probably having some real feelings afterwards to carry around that won't be very good. [31:38]</p>

<p>I guess I feel I could go to Don with that too as it becomes something very unsure and that I got myself into. But that would be like playing on sympathy, playing on feelings for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 31:55)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, look what I got myself into. And I know it affects you and I but I'm really sorry and you can't be that angry about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And you understand]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know what Don said to me this was it this morning? I don't know if it was this morning or if it was last night. I guess it was this morning. I said, "Well, I have to go to this meeting uptown. Well, I was asking him to do something around the party tonight because I've got a meeting in the morning and I'm going to see you in the afternoon." And he said, "I hope you have a really good session."</p>

<p>I said, "Yeah." I said, "I don't know. I guess so but I'm not worried about it one way or another." And he said something about, "I hope you open up to him," or something like that. And I said, "You don't really feel like that I'm very open to you." And he really doesn't feel that. He really feels like I hold a lot of stuff inside. [32:56]</p>

<p>One of the things he said Wednesday - as I began to want to talk and felt that the situation wasn't the most comfortable - he said, "Well, I guess my attitude is that you don't tell me things. You don't say things. So I've just decided you'll tell me when you're ready," in a sort of apathetic kind of way or a way of not wanting to reach out to me anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, kind of like putting himself aloof rather than really him being open to trying to help you feel open.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know it kind of sounds like he really when he said that thing about (inaudible@ 33:46)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yes, it did and I guess what's disturbing about it is that I do believe that I'm open with him. I guess it was like I don't know what you're asking. What more are you asking? I guess -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the way I'm being not good enough for you or how much more do you want? Is that the kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I don't know. I've seen him grow I think to be a lot more selfish than he used to be. Like I sometimes feel as though - maybe I've said this before - sometimes I feel like he's beginning to take on a lot of my personality; some of the things that I don't like about myself in terms of being very selfish. You know I'm thinking about my self and I'm going to tell you - like when I came back Wednesday he also said, "You know you bore me sometimes." And he just threw it out! And I hadn't even been there all day and it didn't make any sense to me and that was upsetting. And I didn't know, "What do you mean I'm boring you?" Okay. That's legitimate but it didn't make sense - [35:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [From what you told me it sounds like - I mean that's a really kind of hard thing to say, you know what I mean?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: For him to say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, it's not a nice thing for anyone to say. [But it sounds like something you just wouldn't expect at least -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it came very unexpected and it was almost like a bitter thing like he was striking at me or something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah, it's kind of like the way I hear it is like he's kind of feeling like you've done something to him. Kind of like, "Well if you're going to be that way I can be that way too. And I'm doing it. You bore me sometimes."] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hm. That's the way I felt too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean did you ask him if something is with him or -?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, when I began to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ["It sounds like you're annoyed at me," or -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I asked him. I said, "Something is bugging you. You're just sitting there and you-" He's watching some godd**n television show that nobody watches. And he wasn't really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Unimportant television is more important than you.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He'd rather be bored by that than be bored by you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I said, "What's bothering you?" And I guess my sense was he was bothered by something about Thursday night. And I didn't want to say that because I wasn't sure if that wasn't my -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Paranoia.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, I thought, "Well I must be paranoid about that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [And to say that kind of suggests it.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I didn't for along time. I just sat there and I began to try and talk. And again the situation wasn't the most positive so it was even more difficult to talk. But I really struggled to get stuff out. And I don't know if that's what he meant by my being open is that for him my struggle with verbalizing things that I'm feeling is an indication that I'm not being open. [37:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Kind of it's not ] (ph) (inaudible@ 37:11)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I've said - I think it becomes really hard when I have hard things to say. It's hard to tell - you know, I just can't say it. Much of it happened like that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I'm interested. Was the television on when you were trying to say hard things?] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, it was on the whole time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's hard to turn yourself on to be open when something else is on]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, yeah. He was staring at it. It was really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm surprised you could say anything. [I mean I don't know if you see what I mean. It's just-] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just felt like forced that I had to say. You know, I had to talk. I didn't want to leave things where they were. I got up a couple of times and just left before I sat down and really forced myself to talk. I'd gotten up and left and did some other things. And it wasn't until preps just before I was going to leave for Albany - oh! I guess what had happened was I'd started and he was just totally unresponsive. And I just left and started doing some stuff in the bedroom. And he finally came in and [putts] (ph) around. I don't know. And I don't know what I said but something at least got him to say, "Well then let's talk or something." [38:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 38:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It was a really weird uncomfortable kind of thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It sounds - I sense that you're really kind of feeling disturbed that there's some kind of friction there]. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It seems to happen, you know? Again and I - this is like a projection of his taking on some of my personality traits - and it's like he's move into when something is bothering him he won't say anything about it or if he says something about double messages come. It's not the exact thing. It's a substitute; something else for what really is bothering him. I'm still not sure exactly what it was that was bothering him on Wednesday because I don't feel he ever really came out and said it. And maybe part of it just lies in the fact that I've had some work to do and I haven't been able to devote all my time to him. I don't know. That could be part of it too. We very consciously spent all day yesterday together and before I left Wednesday I felt as though we'd worked through a little bit. We felt much more comfortable together and felt comfortable when I got home Wednesday night. And nothing has come up since then. Everything is kind of worked through. [40:05]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 40:06)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure how much that might be connected with Gary too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Like you've got something that might be in your mind.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess if Don hadn't come down I would probably have been able to work through that much easier. It's like an added pressure, added dimension kind of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's like you can't just work it through on your own.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. I began to feel part of what had gone on last Thursday was a result of not having been able to be close and intimate with Don for three weeks or whatever it was we had been separated. Part of it was a reaction to that. And part of it was - and Don could recognize it too - is that we were both very, very tired and had gone through an exhausting experience together. And yet I can't eliminate the good feelings I've had. [41:13]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was nice [and it's not like you can say it was entirely situations.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. What's going through my mind at the moment is just I guess I'm feeling that I do need to deal out what I have sort of suggested setting up between Don and I. I really feel a necessity to deal that out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. Kind of, "What do I want there?"] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and deal that out not putting it off, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. Kind of make some kind of decision to know where you stand rather than having this big question mark. It does kind of I'm sure affect how you feel.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's almost like now wanting to share the whole thing with Don - at one point he also was saying Wednesday as I told him about what we talked about last Friday and the disturbing feelings I have about my block with sex and all is that he's - and again, I sort of felt like more than really meaning what he said it was a bitter kind of thing - was that, yeah, he was uncomfortable. He felt like sex didn't mean anything to him anymore and that it was just meaningless. It was - he didn't say it - but it was sort of like it hurt his masculinity or something like that too. And I guess I wanted some sensitivity to helping me with what I was going through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Sounds like you were asking him to be sensitive and he was kind of responding within. Not to you but -] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he wasn't responding to what I was saying or asking -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [He wasn't really understanding. He was saying, "Yeah, I know you've got problems and it affects me.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah. And I don't know. As a result of maybe getting out some of those anxieties of his or whatever, things in bed were a lot more comfortable Wednesday night and a lot more meaningful. And so maybe you really do have a need to get that out. And maybe that's what I'm still troubled about is that I don't know how much - were we really sensitive to one another in that talk as much as we were getting out  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Getting out things that] (ph) (inaudible@ 43:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that maybe it needs to be repeated again toward- </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Ventilating.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe the same things that I said Wednesday need to be said again now in a means of asking, "Well, now you ought to be able to be more sensitive or I can be more sensitive..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Now that that's out let's kind of be more sensitive to each other.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I guess that's what - now reflecting on it - it seems that certainly existed in the conversation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [I sense that it's kind of like friction or static in the end.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. Maybe I ought to have held off talking about it at that time except that it was really pressing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was right there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was real for you then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. Yeah. I guess that experience Wednesday hasn't been an overwhelming kind of thing. I sort of feel as though talking about it now sheds a little bit of light on it though too in terms of going with it from here. And also we talked about - and he again expressed and he has today about my going on that trip - it really bugs the hell out of him except that I'm not giving into that. [45:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. Kind of like that's not cool either. I mean, it's clear in your mind but the bad feelings about it on his part kind of] (ph) (inaudible@ 45:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess one thing he feels is like what I said Wednesday about I think a lot of things can begin to work through a lot better as we get to spend more time together. And I kind of sense he's very anxious for that to start to happen; for us to start to be together all the time. And my going away postpones that even longer. And that's valid. And maybe I ought - sometimes I feel as though I ought to deal with that more; that postponement. Maybe I oughtn't to postpone. But on the other hand, I'm damned if I'm going to. I guess I'm just really standing in cement as far as that's concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Yeah. It's kind of like, "By God, I want to be there. I want to go. And that's settled in my mind.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know how much more it can be worked out - worked through as far as Don feels about it. I hope like today or tomorrow and Sunday and Monday it looks very much as though we'll be able to spend all of our time together. And I feel good about that because I know that that's when we'll begin to start talking about these things. And I guess I'm not so troubled about working that through because I see that he's only been here a few days and other things have gone on that we still have time to work through that stuff. I guess I'm kind of confident that it'll -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It'll be worked through.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, partially because I want it to be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but something occurred to me. I don't know Don [but the kind of anger where] (inaudible@ 47:51) [what's bugging him may be that he's angry, feels resentful that you are taking off and standing in cement about taking off.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that and it's more than that. When he's able to say, "You know I'm jealous. You're going off and traveling and I've wanted to travel and I've never been able to. And you're doing that. And you're doing that without me." And I recognize that too. I guess I don't know how I can alleviate those feelings within him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [But kind of I sense that you're not exactly sure how but being able to spend the time together this weekend may go some way towards that.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. At least I hope so. I think so because one of the things is I feel like if I don't go, I can carry that for a long time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 49:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That opportunity to be free before jumping into a very serious commitment to you is pretty necessary. And he sort of struck out in terms of the last three weeks have been really hard for me in terms of not having companionship and stuff like that. If you think I'm sitting around all summer -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible@ 49:34)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I said, "I don't think I have such negative feelings about your being with other women for the summer maybe even having some sexual involvement with someone over the summer." And I just said, "You're not going to stop loving me are you?" And I guess that would be the only thing that if you'd threat that kind of thing, which I don't think he can realistically do as an adult.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said, "I'm much more capable of accepting that now and understanding it and seeing it as a positive thing than I once was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, because you feel more sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. Yeah. I don't know if he accepted that but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It's about time to stop.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Wednesday, two-fifteen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-hmm. That's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I checked my thing. We only have two sessions left.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session eight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Had an interesting weekend. Lots of social encounters.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lots of material, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't know if there is much to be gleaned from it, but yes, things went quite well. I was amazed. We had a party on Friday night and since I knew everyone there it wasn't - except for one or two people - there wasn't too much to see about meeting new people. One or two new people, but I was so much lost in everything that I don't think it mattered much.</p>

<p>However, I was watching how I was behaving in front of my other roommate, the one that I don't get along with. Which I thought - well, I don't know why, but he wasn't part of the party. He didn't want any part of the party and he came maybe about 10:30. The party was really - everyone was there and having a good time and didn't interact at all, but was watching me interact. I was conscious of it, but tried to act like I wasn't conscious of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to think about that, but he's quite anti-social and I'm - I don't know where I am, but I used to be quite social and interacted quite a bit. I think he was just - well since there is so much contempt exchanged between us, I wanted to - I don't know. I was just very, very conscious when he was in the room, how I was acting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Super conscious is what you were doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can take from that what you will. I haven't figured out why. But when anyone else was there, it didn't bother me too much. I was quite comfortable. But again, most of the people I knew and again, I was busy. There wasn't really too much time to sit and think about how I was reacting.</p>

<p>However, on the next night, Saturday night, a friend called me up and (inaudible 0:02:14.7) - a friend from high school that I hadn't seen in a long time. He is a med student here elsewhere in the city. He said, "Come on up." Well, I knew it was going to be - you know, some old friends you meet and it is just like it was when you left. You fall right back into the old, comfortable relationship. But I wasn't too sure about this one because we hadn't seen each other for five, six years and like that. It wasn't - I was interested to see how it would happen. I noticed when I came into the room, Dan initially gave me the once-over. He looked at me to see how I was dressed and if my hair was long or short and how I looked and everything. It was clear that we were both sort of sizing each other up. But during the course of the evening I met a whole lot of people. A couple that I met - we spent from like 5:00 until 2:00 a.m. with this group of people, so I really did an intense social concentration. I really got to know them. I am now of the firm belief, no question, that you can be completely honest with anyone.</p>

<p>There was a - all these people were doctors or med students. There were two very, very charming hematologists, thirty maybe, married. They were just the most honest, straightforward people. Just watching her behave, I could see that all of her reactions were just - when she reacted to a statement or whatever was going on, they were just spontaneous. And I don't see how a person like that could be putting on at all. So it kind of makes me think that it is possible - quite possible - for a person to behave that way. (0:04:08.4)</p>

<p>I mentioned the person at Ryder's that I said behaved that way - the administrator up there. He was sort of - I was thinking - might be an exception. I think there are a lot of people around. I just haven't got to meet a lot of them. But it is possible to do. I don't know that I have to go into them any more other than they were just a delight to be with and it was great being with - well it was great being with, I think, non-egocentric people. You see, the thing that I'm with when I'm with Laura now and Rich and his brother Steve, that I notice their major fault. I really notice it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sticks out. (0:04:50.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, man. It is unbelievable. And if you are really - now these people last Saturday night might have some glaring faults, too, that I'm just not right now noticing. But right now I'm noticing ego-centrism and worrying about interaction. These people were just the antithesis of that. They were just honest reactors and they were not self-centered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I was really pleased. Now then, how did I react? That's another story altogether. Better, really better. I was amazed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More honest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now a couple times I noticed myself slipping. It was really wild and they were out-and-out - not out-and-out - they were gray lies. Exaggerations again. When I would be talking about something that applied to me and to impress them a little bit more, things would stretch a little bit. The work I was doing in physics was that much more significant and the place I was living in is that much more enlightened community. My swim was that much harder a swim when we got talking to the Channel.</p>

<p>Again, I don't know whether it is false modesty or not, but I did want to talk about the swim. Because the minute that pops up in a conversation, I'm the center of the conversation for twenty minutes until everyone is satiated with learning about how that went. In that situation I really didn't want it to pop up - Dan eventually - he had read about it in the paper, so he eventually mentioned it. (0:06:26.8)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That reminds me of this question I want to ask.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter) You love to talk about that. How many people have swam the Channel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was about a hundred and twenty. Since 1875.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Anything more you want to know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Laughter) You love to talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, when I first (chuckles) - I don't know whether I do or not. Not in this situation, because we are not going to get anything out of it, that's for sure. Yeah, I kind of guess I do, but I didn't want it to happen then because it was more of an experiment in how I was interacting and I didn't want that to be part of it. Because that would just make it so - it is so much the former me that I didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would muddy the waters.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Well anyhow, I was really pleased though. When I did notice this happening, I would try to change the subject as much as possible. And the subject was how Ivan (ph 0:07:21.6) pulled a real good coup getting an office. We were only talking about the Channel for like ten minutes and I turned it away real cleverly - well, I thought it was clever - we were talking about drugs beforehand and I turned this conversation towards some swimmers I had seen that used drugs. Because they were doctors, we got into (inaudible 0:07:41.1). The drug I have seen used is cocaine and I mentioned that and we were right back into the former thing again and there I was no longer the center.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were pleased that you were able to deflect in that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I was more pleased with the subtle way I did it. Again, there I am ego-centric. But, outside of the few times the conversation turned to me, I was really, I think, interacting pretty honestly. More than that, I was just enjoying myself because these people that I was with were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>There was - well I might as well tell you the whole story because it sort of fits in. The night these people were all - as of 99 percent of the people, I suppose, of our ilk - they have been smoking for a long time. For the first time they tried something - they weren't quite sure what it was. Being doctors, I just can't understand that, but they took some pills and had a tremendously bad experience on Friday night. So they were still recovering on Saturday. That is the reason they went to this hematologist who happens to be a doctor, because the girl was so very distraught. They wanted to know what to do. It was tense in that sense but the minute we got to these people it really loosened up. They were very, very nice - seven hours there. We talked about the whole drug scene and everything. I expressed my opinions a couple times - I think quite honestly. And although I was worried somewhat with how I interacted, I was worried more about being honest - about not being pretentious. It was hard to do that but I did it. (0:09:44.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I could eventually become comfortable doing that just as before I was comfortable being dishonest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the experience of it would mean it was successful enough that you feel that you could do that now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The times I slipped, I caught myself right away. Although I didn't come right back and say, "That isn't right." I just sort of stopped there and changed the subject a little bit or changed the sentence or some such thing. But it was really good in both the sense that I realized a person can be completely honest and in realizing that maybe I can be, too.</p>

<p>Now the other thing is the way I behave, though, was - well, I don't know. Anyhow, then my parents came into town Sunday. They've been out of town - they live in the suburbs and they have been out (inaudible 0:10:47.9) for awhile so I haven't seen them in a couple of months. They came in to take me to dinner. Then of course, I handled it completely differently. But I don't know that it was dishonest. I avoid talking about things because I don't want to hurt them. If they ever knew that I - some of the things that I was into... But still I noticed not so much that I was being honest with them, but it was all right lying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm. Um hm. You felt better about it than you had before.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I never really felt bad about lying to my parents. I felt bad about - yeah, I guess well - that's not right. I felt bad about lying right across the board and part of that was lying to my parents. But now I realize that - you see, my relationship with my parents is so long-standing. I think every other relationship I could pretty much change. I mean, I could move out of New York now and do up a whole new set of friends and the only people I'd really see staying would certainly be my parents. Except maybe one or two friends that I have maintained over the years that we are now in different parts of the country. But it is just impossible to get a completely honest relationship with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because of the long-standingness of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well - you see I think the only thing that really - yeah, the thing when I was smoking grass - that's the thing they are grieving. Blew their minds. They think I'm their good little - they kind of know that I - they do know now, although it has taken like five years, they do know that I have had sexual relations with girls and that has taken awhile. Initially - if you started breaking it in with a few little jokes here and there about it and then gradually they realize the jokes are not based on fantasy, but fact. So now I think they realize what the story is. And so that part of it isn't a lie anymore, but I don't think I could ever tell them about - because they would just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is the one thing that would be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well anyhow, it was interesting to sort of look at myself to see how I reacted in that. Because I can interact differently with my parents and differently with other people and still feel comfortable about it, I wonder if maybe - and I'm looking at this woman doctor that so impressed me - I can't decide whether it is honest to behave a little differently with different people and just call that euphemistically a different facet of your personality. I have been calling it a lie.</p>

<p>Now maybe this woman behaved differently - and I can't see it though. I was going to say maybe she behaves differently at her job where she creates more of a position of respect and has to give orders. She couldn't be quite so nice if she might lose that respect. I don't know. If she has inferiors with her rather than...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean to say she was so easy with her feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There might be a situation where she would simply have to take on a slightly different person or - I could see that a lot of her patients just because she is a small woman and a very beautiful woman, too, would not say, "This is a doctor that I can trust." So she might have to come in with the glasses and the hair pulled back and the white gown and talk very sternly so they would get some idea that she is the doctor. I could see that, too. I could see her interacting differently.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you could see her trying to act a certain way so that a certain role would get across.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. So therefore, maybe the idea that my life is so bad because it is lies is just the fact - in other words, it is a matter of degree rather than essence. She is doing the same thing benignly for good purposes and I have been doing it for ego-centric purposes. She would do it to make her work more efficient in the case of being superior to people that work for her or just in talking to her patients if that were the case. Whatever the case may be.</p>

<p>Maybe a complete lifestyle change is not in order for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe only partially.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. Maybe it is - no - it is not a - you see, the change in lifestyle would not take place. It would rather be why I behave that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. (0:15:51.9)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could still base my life on what we have been calling lies. I could interact differently with different people, but I could do it by not just trying to make myself look good, but for other motives. There are many other motives certainly. The example here shows that. And there are times that you have to be a different one.</p>

<p>So maybe you see, I was worried about, well, gee I could never do that. I could never behave the same way with all people and always be honest and forthright. Here is a person who maybe doesn't behave the same with all people because it is not possible, but behaves honestly nevertheless. That was nice to see. See how it fits in. (0:16:41.4)</p>

<p>The other thing that crossed my mind and it's been a very busy weekend - that's why I haven't had a lot of time to sit back and reflect - is, well I've long since realized that I'm never going to be rich because I'm a physicist and nobody is paying physicists anything so it doesn't bother me too much. However, I still have this thing hanging over me that you like to be occupationally successful. You don't have to get coin for it, but just to be a physics professor would really be a comfortable feeling. You would have taken your given field and you would be doing something you want with it. I really enjoy teaching and I would like to teach. I don't know how I feel about physics, but nevertheless I'm a physicist. So let that ride for awhile. So it would be a comfortable feeling to get my degree and to be contributing in that way. Even though I might not - I certainly wouldn't be well off. (0:17:42.0)</p>

<p>But, if I took - if I really decided what would I really like to do, I don't think it would be that. I don't think I would really enjoy the day-to-day existence of doing that as I would the day-to-day existence of some other lies. I have thought - I have come up with many. The reason I mention it is that there is a job opening up now that is just fascinating. It is high school teaching and coaching a very, very good swim team here in New York. I just talked to someone that is thinking about getting the job. It would - wow, what a great life, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is the kind of day-to-day thing that appeals to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you see it doesn't really accomplish anything so I wouldn't feel comfortable, I don't think. I think I - when I think of some of the high school teachers you see around - real dolts, you know, it doesn't take much to be a high school teacher. You don't have to know anything, really. You certainly don't have to know how to read and write. I have seen that time and time again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would seem take your potential (ph 0:18:57.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I guess that is right. Then too - well, you see, well, you know - look now - what is your ideal life? My ideal life would be to have some people that were really interested in whatever I was teaching, whatever that may be and spend a lot of time with them in a one-to-one relationship and have them be excited about the subject matter. And really polish my preparation of the subject matter. And then also to have some - well some physical team to coach. Some people that would want to get their bodies into shape, too, not just their minds. I have done a little bit of that in the past, not in any large scale, and really enjoyed it - to see someone go. That's why - well, kids are really great. Well - I don't need to go into that, but I really would enjoy that. And yet that doesn't seem to be the thing I am going to end up doing. What it is going to be - I don't know - it is so hard. Now the job market is - let's say the job market were a little bit more open, all right? What I will probably end up doing, that being the case, is ending up teaching somewhere at a small college and maybe not having anyone really fired up about physics.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it doesn't sound very exciting. It sounds sort of dull.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that it is dull. That can be exciting, too. It is not just my calling. So I'm really being dishonest with myself. It is just - I just can't see bucking it. I can't see getting away from that idea of being accomplished - not in my eyes.</p>

<p>It is all a matter of - I don't know. The thing I will probably end up doing - although in other people's eyes it would seem to be the thing that would be a very accomplished goal, is -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It won't satisfy you internally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It boils down to "Peter Principle." Have you read that at all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I would really be best at some lower level where I can - but I don't think I'm going to go to college and.... Well, you see, I'll probably end up doing something that is right at my limit so that I can't do it well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And yet I have this desire to go to my limit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have a desire to go to your limit but at the same time, you feel that you would really do better if you didn't go to your limit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I would be more honest if I didn't because I would enjoy being the lower. I would enjoy more doing something that I knew I was capable of -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Doing well. (0:22:32.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no I was - you finished the sentence for me. I was capable of doing something on a higher plane, you see?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would feel good doing something that you knew you were capable of doing something on a higher plane?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That has a very poorly constructed sentence, but that is what I said, so... I think you get the idea, haven't you? I think I could be a college professor. I could be a reasonable one. I certainly wouldn't be incompetent. But I would rather fall back on a step and do something that I would enjoy more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah - I guess Peter Principle doesn't apply because I don't think I would be an incompetent college professor. I would be an incompetent university professor because I am not a good enough physicist to handle research and teaching. Both, I just couldn't do it. So take it down a couple of steps. That is kind of still is a self-dishonesty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could never get around to resolving it. I have some friends who are really amazing that way. One guy who - well he is really bright, but wouldn't impress you with that (inaudible 0:23:49.0). The first couple of times I met him, I thought, "What a dolt." But he is unbelievably bright. He really knows his stuff. A physicist. He passed this exam and began working for our professor and decided he didn't like it. He's got an apartment here and he decided he was going to drive a cab and then he got into hotel work. All he has been doing for a year now is talking to law students, med students and different things to find out what he wants to do. Wow, you know, here is a guy who has essentially proven himself to be a physicist. He passed his exam and all he had to do was the research. But he didn't like the research. So after trying it awhile he got out of it. (0:24:33.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is like it impresses you with his honesty with himself and being able to get out of something he doesn't like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could see - if I were he, oh would my parents be distraught. They would just be pulling their hair out. Why are you driving a cab or doing this - I guess he's a hotel clerk now. But why are you doing that? At this time you could already have your thesis half written. I think I would be forced to the point of staying in whereas he wasn't. He was forced by his own honesty rather than being forced by other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is like you feel weaker in pushing what your honest inaudible 0:25:16.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. I think it may boil down pretty much to my parents. If they were to kick off tomorrow, and excuse me for being so coarse, but I'm just hypothesizing - not that I want it to happen at all - I think I could maybe be a little bit more honest and reflect a little. Because there is only about - outside of caring for them because I owe so much to them and - well I suppose I love them. I don't like them at all, but I love them. Well they are bigots and they are rednecks - I mean they almost voted for Wallace. I really don't like that but they are my parents. But I think pleasing them is a little bit important to me. I think of the people that matter to me are so really few - Laura and Rich sure don't matter to me. June may matter to me, I'm not sure. Oh, by the way, she came back from Maryland. Did I tell you she might stay there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you mentioned it, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I was really worried because she said she was going to stay - she said the might - and then I said, "Well, look, I'll call you Saturday." I don't know if I explained I'm on a weird sleeping schedule and I didn't call Saturday - the Saturday she left which was a week ago last Saturday. And wow, there she was - I had promised to call her, to have a long talk on the phone with her before she left and I was really worried that that would be the crowning blow and say, "All right, I'm just dropping out." It certainly shook me.</p>

<p>She is - I don't want to get sidetracked. What was I on before I got to June?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your parents.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yes. I'll get back to June shortly. There are so few people that do matter to me that I think I could - there are like three people in New York that matter to me. I could explain to them I'm being honest with myself and that is why I'm being this way. There is a person here, Tim, my high school friend that I have grown up with since we were four - I would explain to him. And then I could be completely honest with myself. But I think holding me back are my parents because they have such great expectations for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They are the only people, it sounds like, that you can't explain what you are doing is being honest and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, if I were to get my Ph.D., then I might be able to say, "All right, Mom and Dad, look I don't want this." And then go do something. You know, be a Nader Raider or go into the Peace Corps or do something that I would value more for a little while. I'm not talking about that for a lifelong thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you are bound to get the Ph.D.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am pretty much, yeah. Well anyhow, I'm just saying that now. That is the first time I have ever said that, to myself or anyone. That is probably pretty true. You see - I want to get back to that one later. Let me finish with my parents.</p>

<p>The thing about my parents - well, I have always grown up with the fact that my father is a self-made man and that he didn't want me to have to be. So therefore - well he was really proud because he was the first one in the whole family to get a high school diploma. He was the big educated man. And he was the first one to be well off and we have got a huge clan back in the hometown I come from. He was the first one to make it. They were all farmers and roustabouts and things like that. So he is well off now. Fine. But I continually had this idea that because he worked so hard all his life that I shouldn't have to and that I was - his line is that you're going to get paid for what you know, not for what you do. That I was going to be well-educated and by virtue of that I was going to be - everything was going to be all right. I felt this obligation, I guess, all the way along, to do what he wanted rather than what I wanted. Although up until now, what I wanted too was to be educated. (0:29:43.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wasn't a problem until now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you wanted what he wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, I still want to be educated. I still really would like to be the Renaissance Man. If I had it to do over - well, if I didn't have to worry about what anyone cared but myself - if I were that free and I'm not, because I know I'm not that way - I would just like to spend another four years in college just taking all the courses I didn't take. Just because there are so many exciting things that I haven't learned. Just all the one hundred level courses. That would really - but that isn't what he wants. Because I have already got the B.A. All right, I have got a Liberal Arts education. Now I have got to get the physics. So to be educated is my goal, too. But my goal of education is not his goal of education because his goal has to do with a piece of parchment with letters on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that there is something about the way he struggled and the way he is trying to make it so that you won't struggle that makes you feel responsible to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, this is interesting that I haven't brought this up. This is the first time that I have really thought about it. I suppose it has always been there. I have always realized - I never really talked about it. But maybe that is what the whole thing is all about. I mean, why I behave this way. Why I am always worried about other people's expectations other than my own. (0:31:07.1)</p>

<p>My sister told me a funny story not too long ago - last time I saw her. She said, "Your very first report card, when you came home with it, there was a B on it. Mom wrote on it - there is a little thing for comments - Wes is very interested in changing this into an A next grading period." I wasn't interested at all. I couldn't have cared less. Big deal. But that was the start of it and from then on. I guess academically I have always pleased them. Until I got away to college and saw another life, we thought pretty much alike. Until the Age of Enlightenment came. By that time, my entire academic life had been to please them. So certainly my entire social life, it is understandable that it would be to please other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fits in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And now that I am alone - well now over the last couple of years that I have grown so different from them in just life, I still have this thing in me to please them. Therefore, because pleasing them and pleasing other people has become a very major part of me. So it has made my life become a lie.</p>

<p>I'm really afraid of having kids - you can really goof them up. My parents tried so hard - goofed up (inaudible 0:32:43.0) understand. I was always - well all the way through college was a big father man. I thought that was the biggest thing, the most important thing in your life is to raise kids. The more I think about it lately - the last year or so - I really don't want to. I'm just afraid I would botch it. Really botch it. And wow, that would be horrible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Botch it like you were botched.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. I get along. I'm not going to be Jack the Ripper or not going to be on welfare all my life living off other people. But I mean if society were full of me there would be an awful lot of liars around, but I think it would get along. It wouldn't be a pleasant place, but I don't think the world would burn down. There are an awful lot of kids that are that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're seeing so many kids botched up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or not only that so much as botched up themselves. They just can't live comfortably. The extreme, of course, the suicide-type kids. Or other kids that - well, I don't think I need to go into that. But anyhow, I think it is a good thing that I brought this out because it seems to me that that is probably it. That is probably why I am the way I am. Why I am a liar - why I am not a - because I was told all these - I was brought up to please them, their standards. They told me their standards and I react to what their standards were, so therefore couldn't develop any of my own.</p>

<p>It is so hard to develop your own, isn't it, when you are living with adults? But I have since then - I don't know if I have or not. You see, that is another thing. Remember earlier when I mentioned this woman doctor that was doing the same thing I was doing but doing it for different purposes. When I do it I call it lying and being dishonest with other people. I really hate it. When she is going it, she is just showing a different facet of her personality because it will be better oil on the machine. Then it is really great that she can do that. What was the point I was going to make? I keep explaining too much of the midway on it to get the major point. Oh, oh yeah. So anyhow but then if I say all right, now I'm going to behave that way, well I don't know the honest me. I don't know where I lie, so it is hard for me to find different facets of my personality when my personality is for other people. We have been through that before, though, I think.</p>

<p>But it could very well be that it all boils down to parents. Does that happen an awful lot? I mean, that sounds so trite. People come in here and after awhile they decide it is all because of how they were brought up and their parents did it all?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it could be (inaudible 0:35:44.2) of your parents. That is certainly true. What influence our parents have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is sort of hard not to, isn't it? (0:35:49.3)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that is such a major - well, I'm 24 and that is like 18 years of my life. That is a pretty big hunk. Plus they - I don't know - different things. The first ones are so much more important than any subsequent years.</p>

<p>Well anyhow, I wanted to mention June again. She - I was - the initial time I met June, I was fixed up by a couple and they were at the party Friday night. Really great interacting people. Whomever they are with, they really get along with. She was being the life of the party, Karen was, and she said, "Why don't you call up June?" I said, "Oh, June is in Maryland." She said, "No she's not. She's home. She got home today." Oh, all right. So I called her up and she came to the party, which amazed me. But I didn't see much of her at the party. The few times I did see her it was as though nothing had happened. So I didn't know what to think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As though you hadn't talked to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was just like it was before. Amazing. So I called her up last night after I got home from when my parents took me to dinner and we talked, again, like nothing had happened. She was more concerned about some other things that she had seen or read or something. It was so much like the other time that I was reading the paper while I was talking to her. I don't know if I told you she rambles. But I was sitting there and she started talking about something - I guess some article she had read. She started rambling and my interest started waning so I picked up the paper and started reading it, just like the good old days.</p>

<p>Well anyhow, I said, "Well look, I really want to talk." I just wanted to sort of rehash things with her and basically I wanted to say that I felt a little - well first of all, I wanted to tell her that I really feel bad about what happened, which I do now. I think the reason I feel bad is because it was so severe to here, which I didn't realize it was. So I said, "Well I've got some things to change a little bit." She said, "I have, too." So then the conversation slipped away from serious things after we decided that she was going to come over today and we're going to talk for awhile.</p>

<p>The conversation sort of slipped to something else and I found out that she is going back to school now. She just doesn't like being a pharmacist - a pharmacologist, excuse me. I don't know if it is by virtue of this or not, but she is going back. She's got her - she's got a couple degrees, so I don't know what she is going into now. But I think she is going to get a business degree because she is a great administrator, which is what I think she is getting paid for, not for being a pharmacologist, but for being an administrator in the hospital. I think that is really being occupationally honest, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of her to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you see, she has sort of proven herself. She has really risen to the top very quickly in her field and it doesn't matter anymore. Now she saved money so that she could easily go to school for a couple years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that you could do that, too, if you had first risen to the top.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I have another fear of this whole thing and that's what I think, now that I'm being honest about the whole thing, I'm going to - we're going to talk today. This is what I think might happen - have a fear of - we're going to talk today and we're going to decide that I have been an ass and maybe something could have been there and something is going to develop there, the pussy willow (ph 0:39:44.7) thing is going to come. It's not going to come by nature, but it is going to come because I'm going to make it come subconsciously. Because I'm going to feel -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Force it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I'm going to feel bad about what has happened, what a rat I have been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you feel guilt for your part and make it come out that way. And you are afraid of that because you don't want that to happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I don't want it to happen. I just don't want something dishonest to happen. (0:40:13.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, I don't know what the moti - that's the hardest thing to figure out. Maybe it is not figure outable, why one is attracted to one of the opposite sex. I mean we'll see what happens today and we can talk about it Thursday, but still.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you are concerned whatever happens you want it to be natural and honest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, honest is the most important thing. And I just don't know why things were changed so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get this feeling too, that if your feelings do change towards her, you won't trust that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Pretty much. Because it all ties in with us and what is happening here. This is all so confusing to me, what is happening here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I definitely feel bad and I'm feeling worse and worse about it all the time. Although, you see, it is a different kind of worse. Yeah, I guess what I am worried about is feeling some obligation to be nice to her now and because of that obligation - because I have been so mean to her lately over the last couple months - because of that obligation this other thing will develop. We'll see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want it to develop because of obligation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want it to develop because of that, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see, you can never tell why something like that ever happens. It is so blind.</p>

<p>I noticed something else. I didn't see Laura and Rich this weekend but I have noticed about Rich that he thinks - and he is so wrong - that one of the things - you remember Laura and Rich? He feels that the thing Laura needs most is someone to...what's his word for it? Well, to make her feel better because she is so in - she's so - she has an inferiority complex. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Nothing. And he feels that way all the time. She goes into this little fake cry, which everyone realizes. It is sort of a whine, that type of thing, every time someone shuts her down, when actually she is feeling superior all the time. It is really amazing.</p>

<p>Well anyhow, the reason I mentioned that is because once one has this feeling for someone, one is blind to everything else. I guess that is no great major insight. I think it is called "Love is blind" and we've heard it all a million times. However, it is really true. Really true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see it in Rich and that is what you -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but is that what love is? Is it just ignoring what is wrong with other people? It may very well be. Because certainly no one is perfect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe that is what love is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so now what am I going to do? Am I going to start ignoring any of June's faults? I don't think so, because last night on the phone I noticed that she went on and on again. But it is going to be hard to not notice that. But am I going to stop noticing them? Therefore, will love exist not because it is honest but for some other reason. Once it does happen, if it does happen - once it does - there it is, it is preordained already. If it does happen, there is no way of denying it after that. Because no matter how much you rationalize something and use your head on it, your heart is going to prevail not matter what.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think it is, right now, a major fear of mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A fear that you are going to lose your head sense in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see, I can come in here and talk to you all I want about the why and the wherefore and everything, but the heart always takes over. I think - we're talking now about the positive when I talked to you before about the negative - about how - I think I mentioned if I made a list of all the attributes that I wanted in a woman and then I listed all of June's, there would be tremendous overlap. They do exist. And yet it wasn't there. And now we are talking about the opposite, ignoring -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We're talking about where the attributes aren't there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. We're talking about ignoring the lack of overlap.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I was - you were going to say what I said anyhow. Yeah. (0:44:53.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is a lot of fear in there for you, like you are going to get yourself into something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not going to get myself into something. That's - I mean - well, I'm going to get myself into something personal, but I'm almost - I'm not going to get myself into any major commitment. I can see that now. That's just part of my nature. This kid thing and marriage thing is something that I am really turned off by right now, which is a major thing for me because up until the time I was about 20, marriage and raising a family was the most important thing in my life. But now it is certainly not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it is so hard to say when you are talking about your heart and you are talking about your head, what is honest and what is dishonest. That's what - I want to be honest more than anything, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it is so complicated to know how to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And being honest to yourself is, of course, the most important thing. If you are honest with yourself, it is just going to follow that you are honest with other people. So the most important thing is to first be honest to yourself. That is my basic problem. How do I feel about things. I have said on several occasions I don't know myself. I don't have a self. Because I have never been myself. I have always interacted with other people. But I think about that now and I think that isn't really true. A person can't be devoid of self. He cannot not feel. In other words, if everyone else no longer existed very suddenly, I would still feel certain ways about given issues and different things. Of course, that is a very bad hypothetical example because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is something about you which is more than just a reflection of other people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I'm beginning to see that now. And just realizing what that is and then reflecting different facets of that instead of saying to myself that there is nothing there is probably closer to fact.</p>

<p>That certainly must be the case because sometimes when I am interacting with people - or have been in the past - I hope I have changed now somewhat. I feel comfortable behaving in a given way. I feel comfortable behaving with certain groups of people and I don't feel comfortable behaving with others. I think it is because I am closer to myself when I am comfortable. Oh, that's cool. Then all I have to do is decide where I am most comfortable and that should define myself. That would make sense. (0:48:04.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Help to find out who you are by how you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if it is indeed the case that I have always behaved only as I want other people to see me, then if I have done this in a situation and felt good about it, then that must be as I really see myself. If I have done it and felt bad about it, that must not be as I see myself. So therefore, it's quite clear.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if that is a help and a way to separate out yourself...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that is two things I came up with this time. That is amazing. That my parents are what it is all about and that it is possible to find oneself by never really getting at oneself. Well, yeah it is. There is a way for me to find myself. That is something I really thought maybe didn't exist but I think it does. It is just by approaching it - well I did my way I was describing.</p>

<p>I wonder if most people really worry as I have worried lately about honesty and about themselves. I saw statistics in the paper in the room about how many people are using the Center here. And I thought, "Are those the people that are really concerned about themselves?" And then I thought, "Well wait a minute. That's not a good statistical sampling because that is just NYU where people are kind of that way anyhow." Plus it is a university. There must be an awful lot of people that are running around out there that if they stop for a minute they hate themselves. And really be liars. I don't know - that is my case. Or for some reason really not like what they see. Then too many people get so far engulfed with themselves that they just (inaudible 0:50:14.0)</p>

<p>I guess the world would be much better if there were many more institutes like this. Why are they shutting it down by the way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the University doesn't want to fund it anymore.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is really sad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think so too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you find that most people that eventually come in here come out with these major differences or maybe they realize why they behave the way they do and that's the major consequence? I mean I see these two things happening to me, that I'm either going to behave much differently or I'm going to realize why I behave the way I do. I think it is a compromise between those two.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that is how it is for most people by focusing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, by and large, it works. That's what I am trying to say. Does it or doesn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you worried that it won't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not worried that it won't. I know it is going to - I'm really feeling good about it. I'm just wondering by and large what happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, there are all different degrees. By and large, it is hard for me to say. It is really hard not so much because you don't quite know how what happens affects people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would it help if people came back ten years later and you could see what happened?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I believe in it, which is why I do it, but I'm hesitant to say by and large it helps because it is just so hard to know what happens to people in their lives.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I could - the funny thing that I see about it is the fact that I could have meet you eating at I-House or something or walking down 59th Street. I've seen it a million times - no, not a million. You passed me on 59th Street when I thought I was going at a good clip. I thought. There is nothing really special. I mean you have got an officer here and a tape recorder. Big deal. Or I could have met you somewhere else and yet I wouldn't have. It is the fact that I knew it was here, someone told me a bout it. There is an office down there where I can go and sign and take all the tests and then eventually sit here. There is nothing really super weird about it. No shock treatments no [interposing 0:52:43.3].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It stays very - not far from what might happen anywhere else or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If people were honest entirely with all their interactions, you wouldn't really need this. You could be a friend of mine and I could be honest with you and you could help me sort it out. Or I could help someone else sort their life out. People aren't. They don't know these things.</p>

<p>Another thing. Does - go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is a little irrelevant, but I guess it is like when I hear you being concerned about being honest with yourself. That strikes home to me because that is one thing that I think about too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does honesty - does it dwell on honesty a lot - I mean that people are - I guess it just takes on different words, maybe. That is the word that we have used.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I could see that. You see, the thing is I kind of see how I end up acting and why I feel bad acting the way I do and then I see how other people behave in that same context and I see that as a major problem with society. It might be something subtle, but there is a difference. I can see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that is just the way it hits you in terms of honesty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we are very - well it is a very dishonest world and it would be much better if people weren't that way. One thing I'm disappointed about...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that? (0:54:23.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not with the Institute at all. Is Institute the right word?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Counseling Center.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Counseling Center. Whatever it is now. I just come here a couple times a week. That is the fact that I have very few honest relationships. I mean, do people have honest relationships? I don't know. I mean right now I guess June is about it. No - these people in New York I'm kind of honest with, although physics - they don't really know how I feel about it. But that is all right because I have developed that feeling of dishonesty with - that I don't really live and breathe physics. It has only developed over the last couple of years and I haven't been close to them over the last couple years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what is disappointing to you is that you haven't had any honest relationships.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There are all these fences up and that is too bad. Well maybe now I'll develop some. We'll see. It would be nice. Even just one. One that wouldn't be because I came to a Counseling Center.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One that wouldn't need the counseling - one that would be unrelated to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I could meet someone tomorrow and within a week there would be no fences left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be really [interposing 0:55:33.9].</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, it is impossible not to have fences the first time you meet someone. I mean, you're going to notice. You are going to - if they are seven feet two inches tall or if they have bad breath or if they shake your hand and break it, you're going to notice. There are going to be initial impressions, but you can get through those very quickly.</p>

<p>I think this very intensive encounter with these doctors, I think after an hour or two I got through them and was noticing honest reactions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you have really, really missed that in your life - just having honest relationships and now you are seeing the possibility of it. You are really eager to have some to try out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I never meet anyone. That's a definite problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's what - there is nobody to start with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I blew the entire weekend. I didn't study once. That was really disappointing. I feel very guilty about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wasting all that time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it was good. It was a good time because I was making other observations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel guilty, but it was enjoyable and also useful in some other ways.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wish the Counseling Center would close in August or something so we could hold this in abeyance for awhile and I could -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Take your time more or less. When is your exam?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. It is either the last week in May or the first week in June. Those last couple of sessions are really going to be wild if I pass or don't pass.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you will have a lot to deal with either way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We have to stop for now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Thursday at nine then, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Goodbye.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I was just thinking that your calling my name just then, it was the first time I ever remember your calling me by name.  And it made me think of the time I talked about not liking my name or hearing it.  And I don't know whether I react that way about my maiden name and all its parts and I don't feel the same way about my married name, but it made me feel sort of good to hear it called or to know that you had called me by name.  And yet I think when I first was getting married that I didn't like my married name either.  And now I have a sort of ambivalent feeling about it.  Sometimes I don't mind it, or think about it, and other times I still don't like it.  But I can't really — was just thinking about my maiden last name and I don't think I can remember any time when I liked to hear it.  It doesn't bother me so much when I hear my parents addressed or my brother or my, FNA who would still be FNA HRC, but if I hear it in terms of me, then I still don't.  I can't remember ever having liked it.  Or even just have a neutral feeling about it.  And I think I must have thought, because seems to me I thought at one point that when I knew my last name would be QSE that well, I should give up thinking I'd have a last name when I married that I'd like.  And I know I was relating it to the fact that FYC had a last name that I liked, which is BBQ and I don't know whether I'd like it if it were my last name.  But it just seemed to me well of course she'd have one that would be nice and I'm bound to have one I don't like so I might as well marry MSCZ (chuckle) anyway despite his name.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What does the name bring to mind, or what did it a year ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  QSE?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It doesn't really bring anything to mind except the sound of it, I just didn't like it.  I suppose that's not true, sometimes (coughs) I think sometimes it probably made me think of an ethnic group that wasn't settled in america and I was brought up with the good PBRN names being the ones that are the best.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What group is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Uhm, people whose ancestors came on the Mayflower.</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I mean the unsettled.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I don't know what group it is, just any group that —.  Again I think it's a carry over of the feeling my mother has about peasants and aristocracy and it's kind of uh the people whose ancestors came on the Mayflower are the aristocrats and anybody else, is, has fewer roots and is I guess just less aristocratic and all that it might imply.  And my mother even once had a discussion with MSCZ about the pronunciation of his name and how it could be a different pronunciation which would make it a little more fancy and give it a little more finesse.  I think she thought it would.  I think it's just that it seemed like sort of a clumsy name but maybe it's because I feel clumsy and therefore any name I'd have I would think of as sounding clumsy.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose another aspect just in the comparison I make with FYC is that again MEIR represents everything that I was that I think my mother especially and my father too admires or wanted to reach toward in their life.  Because he was born of a family that had a great deal of money and, and they have ancestors of the type that my parents admire.  And he was very, he had been taught to have a certain amount of social ease, and uhm sort of an elegance in his life or aristocratic bearing, I don't know, although he's very shy and in a way doesn't have it, he seems to embody all these things that they always thought would be the best to have and MSCZ on the other hand isn't, partly because of his own family and maybe partly because of his own interests.  But he hasn't been brought up so that in social situations he knows exactly what to do and what's expected and how to put on an elegant show and, and I suppose I was making this comparison too.  (Silence)</p>

<p>But I remember after my mother wanted to cha—, (cough) asked about changing the pronunciation I almost felt defiant that no matter how I felt now I was going to keep it the way it was and like it the way it was.  But sometimes too I noticed that both with, I used to, I think be this way with HRC and I am with QSE, people very often either don't spell it correctly or especially QSE won't pronounce it correctly and I think I almost feel apologetic about that.  And I think also I anticipate having to go through again how it's spelled or how it's pronounced and certainly with HRC, going through the joke that you always get and I think not wanting to have that happen made me react to the name too.  And I couldn't just accept that it was something that people couldn't know always before hand, or that they would make a mistake on and just sort of matter of fact really explain to them how you pronounce it or how you spell it.  It used to always be an obstacle or it still is sometimes.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think maybe now that I know MSCZ's parents I associate a certain something about what they are to their name.  And I think they are, they in my mind, represent well, I think of sort of a lower class, lower middle-class person to be and in what they value, and what they hold important and how they bring up children and — .  There are a few things that I admire, but on the whole I really have, there's not too much that I feel I'd want to be the same way.  In fact, sometimes I can't understand how MSCZ came out of that family.  But this is partly because he was influenced a great deal by his grandmother, maternal grandmother, who lived very close to hi—, to his parents.  And I never knew her so I don't know at all what she was like and how much she differed from her daughter and her daughter's husband.  But it's almost like having the same name now, it makes me like them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I think I even think that people who hear my name will immediately think of them, people who don't even know them will have that kind of vision in their mind when they hear the name.  I suppose because that's what's in my mind.  (Pause) And maybe I felt this way about HRC too because as much as my parents admired a lot of these things, that MEIR, my brother-in-law seems to represent to them, they weren't ever really within that group.  Or they never in their eyes reached that high point and, and so they had kind of assigned themselves as being lower in the ladder, therefore again what their name, conno—, what comes to my mind with their name was something I reacted against.  Because it wasn't, it was less than the best.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And they never played down themselves quiet so much but, well something's happening right now between MSCZ's parents and MSCZ's sister that is extremely upsetting to MSCZ and somewhat to me, although I'm not emotionally involved in the same way.  But his younger sister, I think, is quiet intelligent and, and anything she's ever done she's shown a capability beyond which I think I'd ever shown in the same situation and therefore I respect her a great deal.  But her parents are — and she's only going to a junior college and she wants to finish at another college — but uhm, her parents keep kind of, keep finding reasons why she can't go here or can't go there.  And she now has a very good job with the city of PWS and they're telling her now that she'll never get anything, a, a job better than this and so she better stay with it rather than going off to finish what she wants to finish at college and anyway, they say that she isn't one to do that well in studies.  And of course this to MSCZ is extremely upsetting because this reflects something they've done all their lives, playing down what the capabilities are of any one person.</p>

<p>MSCZ's father certainly does it to himself and, of course that made me think of my own family.  And, and in a way my parents did that with FNA because they used to assume that she would never again perform that well in studies, the way FYC and I did.  And although I think just from what I've heard she could do in mathematics or physics, they were completely wrong, she just happened to perform better in different types of things or under different situations.  So then it made me wonder how much did they underplay all of us or underestimate, underestimate what all of us could do.</p>

<p>And I know that when we were applying for college I don't know how they thought about FYC, but my mother made some comment after I had been accepted so that it was all right for her to say it, but I know they were extremely worried about me and whether I'd get in anywhere that in my eyes and their eyes they'd consider a good enough college.  And then I also thought of times when I'd just be doing work at school and I used to always feel if I needed help on homework I could go to them.  But then I had a feeling always about Latin and I did never understand why I felt this way because when I too—, took a surprise test at school I could always do well for what I thought I'd be able to do.  I don't know how well it actually was.  But in relationship to my general performance, but when I did homework I'd always do very badly and I'd always have to go he—, get help from mother.  And I think my mother loved to give it because it was like a challenge to her to remember her Latin.  (Coughs) And I almost wonder now if sort of subtly she encouraged me to think that I couldn't do it without her help, because she really wanted to be able to give it.  And bo—, with both my parents it was another way that they could show affection, was by helping in academic subjects.</p>

<p>And so finally I, just, I stopped taking Latin after my second year because I just was sure I couldn't do well in it.  And that, I also had this thing happen to me with English, although I liked English basically, but in writing themes there was a time when I can remember my mother reading over my themes before I turned them in and making, suggesting all kinds of corrections that were mostly grammatical, and maybe sentence arrangement.  And I have, I, I don't know how often she did this and I don't know whether she said why don't you show it to me or whether I asked her to read it, but there was one theme in particular that I changed all around according to her suggestions and I did very poorly on that theme.  And I don't think I really thought it was mine afterwards.  And then after that I refused to show anything to them because I figured that even if it had mistakes, it would be me and it would be fresh.  And it would just have a better quality to it because it was sort of spontaneous even if it wasn't as grammatically correct or something that they would advise me on.  But I almost got the feeling that I couldn't write themes too.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Then I was thinking of feelings about things that my parents couldn't do well on that perhaps I picked up from them.  Like my mother was very poor in French and so was I, because I was sure I didn't have an ear for it.  And I no longer think this is entirely true but, because I think she is more tone deaf than I am or whatever it is.  But I was just convinced that French would be a subject I really never do well in and so I needed a kind of teacher who would give me confidence and then I could do very well.  And I was just wondering if maybe that's why I feel the way I do socially too.  Because I know both of them feel extremely awkward, especially my father.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was also thinking just in terms of my themes.  The one problem I've always had and again it's part of a larger problem which I've already talked about and that is, being repetitive and, and too thorough and not selecting and down so that when I'd write a theme I'd go around and around in circles too or I wouldn't say things directly and precisely and then my themes would always be too long.  And I had trouble just with sentence structure and, and again it was like even within the sentence I'd be going around and around in a circle.</p>

<p>And I was just thinking, I think maybe yesterday, that with these parent conferences that are coming up, I do the same thing there too, I go into too many things and too much detail because I'm afraid that if I don't cover something that is either now a problem or potentially a problem that somehow I haven't protected myself when it does arise.  And so I think I have to go into everything.  And of course that only gets the parents excited, because they don't realize the kind of importance that it has since I'm saying it and they think that since I'm saying it, it must already be a horrible problem.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And again it's sort of another kind of conflict like the one think I mentioned yesterday about wanting to be liked and trying to please everybody.  In doing this I'm afraid of having to later say well I made a mistake, or I didn't see something.  And so I try to do things so that then I can tell myself, well, I never did make a mistake.  And yet on the other hand I have this feeling that I can't do things right so I'm going to make a mistake.  Maybe it's not really so different.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But even with my assistant well, not even, probably especially with my assistant (coughs) if she makes some kind of a suggestion which I should welcome, I immediately get defensive again and even if I haven't thought of it I pretend that I have to some degree.  Because I, somehow I feel it's a criticism of me and that I have had a weakness somewhere and I should have seen it.  And that she thinks less of me, to make, if she thinks that I didn't know it and, and she has made this contribution which is entirely new to me.  And so I can see in a way I'm shutting her out from wanting to make these suggestions.  And I can see I'm especially bad that way when it's on a point that I have already thought about and that I would like to incorporate into my teaching or have because of it do my teaching somewhat differently than I am and therefore I think maybe I react more strongly to her because I am sort of angry at myself because I haven't been able to use it already.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm telling myself now you already knew that and you should have used it already, that knowledge.  And so I'm in an angry mood and then I, or defensive mood, because it's almost like I'm having to defend myself against myself.  But she's the object that receives that.  But then sometimes I think well how could I do it all anyway.  Because there are just so many problems that are, you're working with and sometimes you put more emphasis on one than another.  And, and yet, I drive myself because I, I must believe that you can do any of these things if you just drive yourself enough.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or I might be angry if she mentions something because I will know that that is a principal I should have acted under in a given situation but I might have felt tired or been annoyed at the children for some reason or some other circumstance really not related to the children at all but more personal to me might have caused me to react in a different way.  And then it'll make me feel guilty because at that time I was thinking of myself rather than the children in what I was asking.  And I really don't think I know yet how much I think a teacher has to consider herself too.  And how much it's her function to totally consider the children and somehow her personal needs at that time are, should be irrelevant.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking too of how much a lot of my frustration comes from the fact that I crowd the day with so many different things and then any one of those things could probably be developed or at times, sometimes not, but at times could be developed beyond which I allow the time and how frustrating that is then, because no matter what you do then, you can always find fault to some degree because you didn't completely develop it.  And again I don't know how much I think in a way it's good not to completely develop most of the things because then you might kind of do too much with it.  But it is very frustrating to me and, and especially since I'm still confused on it.</p>

<p>But this also made this whole idea of my driving myself and making a lot of work because of what I try to have going on for the children, made me think again of my father and what I was going to say I think last time.  When I was thinking of the fact that he preferred most to be in PTN.  It's funny, I almost started coughing then.  And the fact he needs to when he's up there and my mother too, but well, at different times mother, and at different times my father, but that they really are compulsive workers up there.  There's always some job.  They never just go up and relax.  And I have to admit some of the things really do need doing but it seems like, it's almost as if we're always, I'm always surprised at how little time they actually take because there's so much anticipation of having to get that job done.  (Cough) You almost feel like the whole day will be taken up with it, (cough) because there's so much talk about well we'll have to do this and we have to do that.  And I'm the same way, sometimes when MSCZ wants to do something and I'll say well I have this to do and I have that to do.  And if instead of enumerating them all the time they're just done and they take no time —.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But I don't really think my parents would know what to do with themselves if they didn't have these jobs to do.  It's almost like, my, in PNX they had a terrace and they put flagstones in and then my mother planted thyme in between them all and of course grass kept growing up and it would have been all right if the grass had just grown up and they kept it clipped but she wanted the thyme and I admit it might have looked quite pretty if it had really worked out but she just — any of her free time was spent weeding out the thyme, sort of literally and figuratively.  (Chuckle) I never thought of that.</p>

<p>And then in PTN she has myrtle in her lower garden.  And again it would look very pretty if it, and it does look quite nice now, but again grass gets in and if she'd just let the grass space take up more room she wouldn't have nearly as much weeding to do and so she never really feels the job is done.  And this is something she can always go to if she has nothing else that she has to get done.  And she complains about it a lot, oh have to get more weeding done in the myrtle.  But on the other hand she refuses to set up the garden in any other way.  When suggestions have been made, no, that's the way I want it, and, I don't really mind doing it.  And of course, then other things don't get done that are equally important.  Other parts of the garden never really have the attention that they really should, and yet parts that wouldn't need that much attention, but just occasionally.</p>

<p>And that was the same way in PNX.  She spent so much time with the thyme that other parts of the garden really weren't taken care of and so then everything kind of got out of hand and nothing really was done thoroughly.  And I can see that's sort of what I do too.  I set up so many different things even in my teaching and certainly at home to do, that I'm kind of scattered.  And I've always got something I can turn to and I've always got my little list.  But I've never really felt well, this thing I did, and that's all we did and we really did it thoroughly and it was good and it couldn't have been better.  And I, I don't think I ever really feel that way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And that used to be what I'd do, or still probably is in any projects, any again topics for papers or (cough) projects that I'd work on or anything.  I always keep too broad an idea in mind or try too many different things and make it too hard, so that I can never really handle what I set myself out to do in that given time.  And I, I suppose part of it is a lack of confidence again, that better cover everything in case I don't cover something very well.  Maybe that's all it is.  Because I suppose that's part of just the ability to select anyway and selecting something saying to yourself, this is, I know this is what right now I want most to work on, because I never can decide.  (Pause)</p>

<p>That's really true of a lot of things, because MSCZ will ask me sometimes what would you like to drink tonight, or wha—, do you want me, or at restaurants, what are you going to have and I often, have to know, not always, but very often, have to know what other people are having or what he's having before I can make up my mind.  Or just, I can remember my mother complaining a lot if we were asked would you like milk tonight or do you want more of something, well, I don't, let me think about it.  And again, and this wasn't just me, but I think it was both my sisters, this inability to just decide, know what you want.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I can see that really everything that bothers me or that I have problems which comes from the fact that I, I don't have confidence in myself or that I just don't think I'm important as I am whatever I am.  But then I think well, how can somebody who feels this way, at my age, do very much even though you know it.  Because it seems so deeply ingrained or deep rooted that even kind of anticipate reactions but you're still going to have those reactions.</p>

<p>ANALYST: So you're worried about how much you can change?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because I think I can change maybe superficially.  For instance, as an example, I think I could feel better about my relationship with parents so I'm not so defensive but that will be because I can feel something happening and therefore stop myself before I talk.  But I still will have that welling up of feeling which is defensive.  And that's the part I guess I am then, so that inside myself I can change rather than just superficially.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And this partly concerns me.  I was just thinking that in situations now where I know what to expect to some extent, I can, and, and where I know some, to some extent what my reaction might be or I can feel it coming and therefore I can control it to the point.  For instance, I won't say anything which would make it worse.  Then the situation will get better because I didn't say anything to make it worse and I do feel better about it then.  But any new situation, then I, it's starting all over again and until I know then what to expect, I react the same way I always have.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I was just, for some reason it just made me think of what happened with the greengrocer that I've sometimes gone to.  I don't know if I ever mentioned him here.  But uhm, I was just being friendly with him because I thought he was a nice person.  And I wasn't thinking I was being any more friendly than anybody else, or than, than was proper, it's just if I felt in a friendly mood then I'd act in a friendly way to him.  But one day he'd start, one day he did a favor for me because he helped me get some boxes when we were moving.  And I, at the time I remember thinking I didn't want to be under obligation to him but he insisted on bringing them home and he wouldn't take a tip or anything.  And so here I was in a way, obligated to him and then he began talking about when could he come to have tea with me.  And it just seemed so, such an unlikely situation that I thought he was just kidding and so I kidded too.</p>

<p>And then one day he actually asked himself to tea.  And I was so taken back and I was so, just at loss on how I should act or what I should do, although I knew I didn't want him to come to tea, that I didn't just make some excuse or put him off or whatever.  And I felt as if I were acting in a very stupid way and then I had to make some excuse the next day why he couldn't come to tea and I stopped going to him, to his store and, and then it turned, then I started work so he couldn't come.  But the next time I saw him he immediately made some comment about that and I said, well I had to get away now, I'm working, so I can't do it, and he said well I guess we'll never do it will we?  And I didn't really answer it and then he said oh, I think you're just afraid of me.  And this really disturbed me, that, because in a way it was true.  I was afraid of the situation and I didn't know how to control it.  And I was angry at myself for not handling it.  And I was angry at him for putting me in the position and acting in a way I didn't think he should have been acting either.  And I just felt sort of stupid because he was right, I was afraid of him.  (Coughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You felt he was proposing something more than tea?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, sometimes I suppose that did occur to me.  And it occurred to me partly because that's what occurred to MSCZ because he was furious when he heard that the guy had asked himself to tea.  At first it didn't, I just, I just felt awkward because that wasn't the kind of thing that I'm accustomed to thinking happens.  And I think I also thought to myself well why shouldn't I if he's a nice person and I feel like having him for tea but the fact that he invited himself ruined it, because then it was, that he was being aggressive to me and I was just kind of being pushed unto a corner.  I never would have done it though.  What I was thinking would be nice if I could feel free after this joking.  If one day I just thought well, it would be nice to have him for tea and then I just asked him.  Because I thought he was somebody nice.  But I knew I'd never feel free to do that.  And of course then I got confused on why he was asking me if he could come to tea.  Whether it was just simply because he thought that I was somebody young and pretty and he liked to have me be around because it made him feel better, since he's quite old.  Or whether there was something else on his mind.  (Pause) And then when he was saying, "Well you're afraid of me," I couldn't really answer it.  I couldn't just take a position and, and again, I think I just felt sort of apologetic, partly because he was right.  And then I got angry at myself for again being so weak and looking so foolish and letting him say something like that to me, because that made me angry too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time is up.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Cough)</p>

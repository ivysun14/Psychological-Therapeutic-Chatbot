<p>THERAPIST: This is interview number 9 with client number 1429-110, Therapist Dayton. The date is January 8, 1971. Client 1429-110, Therapist Dayton, interview number 8, January 8, 1971. Hello Johnny.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got it clipped.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My hair.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, God, (inaudible at 0:00:49.1) you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:00:50.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You took no vacation, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I wasn't away, I was here, but - in New York, but I didn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was it good or bad?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was good, it was relaxing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm in a bit of turmoil today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:01:20.2). Well, yesterday I quit my job. And so, like, the last couple of days - and I'm not quite sure why I quit it. I remember I woke up in the morning - well, the day before this girl, Susie, who has been dating three of us - I don't know if that was the final...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Susie from work or Susie...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, this is Susie, the one that I've been dating. I saw her last Saturday and I was supposed to call her up. And on Wednesday - God, this gets me so mad because she - what she said - she said she might have to visit her grandmother on Saturday. And so I looked at her really funny and I says, "Oh, come on." And she said, "No, really." So I believed her. 0:02:29.4</p>

<p>And so I was supposed to call her on Wednesday. I called her Wednesday. I was going to play bridge on Wednesday night with some other people. And I called her up and she said she couldn't see me anymore. She said - there's three of us, I know about the other two guys.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she says there's - she's going to, you know, limit it to one guy, one of the guys she has been dating. And I said - I says, you know, nice to tell me on the phone. Thanks a lot and all that. And I talked to - I don't know, then I was getting a little sore because I couldn't figure out, you know - unless she's PD or something, I don't know what the hell's wrong. And just then there's a knock on the door, and all these people came in so I couldn't say much of anything else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you didn't get much of a chance to talk to her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no, I mean, not much. I just - I said it pissed me off and I couldn't really understand why, you know, because I knew that it was really a strain on her, you know, to be dating three guys. And then I guess the thing was, I was very content the way things were. 0:03:45.1</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, you know, when she told me that, well, then all of a sudden I said, "Oh, shit," then I was kind of - well, in a way it kind of - well, you know, well, I was angry and I felt shot down and all this other shit. And then I says, you know, how come it never is that until a thing breaks up, you know, that I realize, like maybe I would have liked to hang in there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, you realized that you really liked her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or if - I don't know (inaudible at 0:04:24.2). Well, that put me in an unhappy frame. Then I got mad because the knock on the door was, you know, this girl - well, a girl named Kathleen who I used to date, but now she's, you know, going with another guy. But we play bridge. In fact, this is the girl that I went through the abortion thing with. So she wouldn't go away. I says, you know - I knock it off for ten minutes at least. But she - you know, she wouldn't leave. So then everybody came in.</p>

<p>And then - well, it took me five minutes just to get myself, you know, that I would - you know, that I could even talk. And then we played cards and all that, you know, I got a little bombed. And I think we played cards, God, until three, four in the morning. And then I when I woke up I says, "Well, shit, then I have to go to work." And I know goddamn well everybody - well, it's the same thing over and over and over again. And I know who's - you know, things are going (inaudible at 0:05:29.6).</p>

<p>I just - I says, you know, I'm not up for...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Go through all that tumult again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I - I just says, I said, why, you know, really why? And it's getting close, like, where I got to decide on school. And my head's in no condition to decide on school. So I said, fuck it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Decide on school for - when - you mean starting (inaudible at 0:05:52.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: For next year, yeah. If you want to make a decision on school, you've got to decide, like, nine months prior to wanting to get in. And I'm not all that convinced I want to go into social work either. And so I said, well - this is the part I'm not too clear about why I did it. You know, because I said all morning long - I said - you know, I tried to put it through my head, was it just - since I had been rejected, was I going to reject, you know, the job and say, screw the world? 0:06:25.7</p>

<p>And then I had weird ideas about, you know, just dropping out completely, going to Texas. And I had this thing too about not wanting to even - see, you can take a thing called a leave of absence, like, for a year for any kind of reason, and you don't lose seniority or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I even - I - well, I submitted - I submitted it as a resignation. And then I - there's something kind...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still didn't know why you were resigning, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It had something to do with that for once in my life I wanted to make the choice. That - you know, it doesn't make sense, but I wanted to make a choice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As opposed to the night before when you didn't make the choice but Susie did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think that, you know - I think that was part of it. But what it did was that it was kind of like, you know - I said, okay, now I have a choice this morning of going to work and doing something, which I'm not particularly happy in doing and doing something, which I didn't really choose to do in the first place, you know. So I said, if I quit, you know, just outright quit, walk out of the place, then - you know, then at least I would have a feeling that if I ever come back, or if I ever do anything again that's it's something I want to do.</p>

<p>Because I know damn well I can get a - you know, I've got enough money to last through the end of March rent wise. So that gives me at least, like, two and a half to three months. And I only need - well, I don't know what the therapy costs are going to be. I want to continue in therapy, but I got to get a scale down on the thing. 0:08:22.0</p>

<p>But, you know, I really don't know what I'm going to do. All I know is that I didn't like what I was doing there. And...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, so what did you do, you just walked out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I almost started balling, it surprised the hell out of me because, you know, I had to walk in and then I wanted to go at a time when all the - see, my unit, I really liked the people in my unit. And some of them are - well, I'm (inaudible at 0:08:51.2) especially close to three of them. And the other lady a little bit too. And three of them were all there. I walked in, I thought maybe Mrs. Easter who is the supervisor would be there and I could just give it to her and get the hell out of there.</p>

<p>But I walked in and she wasn't there. So I figured, well, I'm going to have tell people, so I sat down, I just told the people in my unit. Well, Cory is - she's the one girl that was there, I told her first and then I told - oh, Wesley, Shelly. 0:09:33.6</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, Wesley, Shelly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Shelly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: First - last name...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always call her Wesley. I always call her Wesley. And Courtney, I told her too. And we talked it over for a couple of hours, especially with Wesley. And I don't know. Then - well, then it got really hard to talk to them anymore. So I just left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you go back today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, they submitted the thing this morning. Which, you know - which is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't you usually have to give some kind of notice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I did, I gave two week notice. But the two weeks are three personal business days, two - they call the thing comp days and then a week of vacation. So, you know, it's in and last night - you know - well, last night I went out and got a little bit smashed too. But I was thinking about - you know, I says, okay now, you can hedge a little on it, I said. You can tell them that you just want it to be a - you know, like a leave of absence. 0:11:00.8</p>

<p>And actually, my supervisor did call me this morning and ask if I didn't want to make it a leave of absence. Because that way, if you ever go to school and stuff - it's got something to do with, I don't want any part of it, you know. And then if I ever come back to anything, then I'm coming back to it and I'll do it in my own way.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I say, it's stupid not to take the damn - you know, as long as the privilege is there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the other things, I don't know (inaudible at 0:11:34.9). My head is really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What other things, like Susie you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It started - I don't know, it started even when I was home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What started, what's going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, at home my sister and my brother-in-law and my ma and I sat down one night, you know. Well - and we were talking, you know about - we got into - like, my ma wants to leave. And she's got this older brother and this older sister and her mother so she can't really leave the town because she would feel guilty and all this crap, and they use her, you know, I mean, they - she's been enslaved to them her whole life I think. 0:12:37.4</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - well, we talked a whole lot about that and, you know, I says, "Ma, you know, why don't you just try enjoying your life for a change and, you know, just letting those people go. Why don't you just do whatever you want to do?" And then we said a whole bunch of other things. I don't know if they're that important. But the thing that kind of came across to me was that, you know, here was a 60-year-old woman (inaudible at 0:13:14.8), what is my ma, 60.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and my ma's kind of got, like, aches and pains all of that. She's got a bad back, she's got a bad knee.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Always complaining?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she doesn't complain.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's got - well, she started limping. And I said to myself, okay, you know, like, she's 60. And she says, like, when she sits alone and she climbs up the walls, you know, she doesn't know what to do with herself. She got - you know, she takes pills sometimes. There's not that many friends that, you know, she calls friends. And she's afraid to take off. I really wonder how much she knows herself, you know, what she's all about. 0:14:14.7</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's facing the latter part of her life alone, you know. And I don't really know the meaning of the word "alone" or to be lonely. I mean, I have never felt that. But she must have felt it. And to not have the resources, you know, to...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To get out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And not to be lonely?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stuck in this town without a husband?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And she says stuff, like, "If you go anywhere," she says, "You always, you have someone" like, she was telling my sister, but she doesn't, you know. (Inaudible at 0:15:01.5). One night when I went to bed and I thought about it, you know - I think I even started crying. It was just - I think I was crying not so much for that, but I said to myself, you know, when I reach age 60, I want to have all that - you know, I want to be able to deal with that, and have it worked out in my head or wherever it's worked out. And... 0:15:23.5</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you got, what, almost 30 more years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, see, I talked to Shelly about that. Shelly is about 50 at work. And she says whatever it is I'm talking about she worked through when she was younger too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, all right, well, what was going on with you and your mom and your sister and brother-in-law? You said it started when you were home that night you were talking with them. You were feeling badly for your ma, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she always - she kind of says, like, you know, like, what's she going to do now?</p>

<p>COUSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: She always says she's going to go south as soon as her health, you know, gets better. Well, I know I got it - well, I don't know, I got after her on a couple of things. I made, you know, comments about the way it looked to me was that, you know, she always has had the people around her, you know, to tell her what to do or else she's always had the kids.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then she - you know, that - I says, "You don't - I don't think you even know what I'm saying." But I said, "But I don't think you can go south because you'll feel so damn guilty, you won't enjoy yourself anyhow." I think that's what I was trying to say to her, you know, that that's what was going on. I don't know. 0:17:21.8</p>

<p>My sister said some other things, though. My sister said things about - like, I asked my sister could she remember anything from when she was small. And she says, "Yeah," she says, "Mostly happy things." So it's funny, when I remember back, I said, "I remember mostly bad things."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said stuff, like, when my sister and I used to run, my grandmother had real long hair. And we used to run through my grandmother's hair, you know, before she was going to wash it. Then she said this one thing - she says - I can't even remember the right word. She said, oh yeah, she said, "I remember once when I learned never again to trust my mother," you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was that about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was something like - you know, because it struck me and I says, you know, "When was that?" When my sister was little, I even remember too because I remember it was such a horrible thing. My sister loved cottage cheese. And she's always, you know, eat it like mad.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure, and one day my ma had horseradish on the table. And my sister asked what is this? And ma said it's horseradish or, I mean, it's cottage cheese, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Joking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or serious?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I imagine she meant it as a joke, I don't know. So my sister takes a big scoop of it and almost choked. You know, and she started crying and everything else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How old was she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, it was when we were still in - she must have been five, six, something like that or maybe even younger. Because I remember it - I remember she really started coughing. And - but, you know, it was that same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What same thing, Johnny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the thing with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My thoughts are all disconnected.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Bad things, you were talking about bad experience, she remembered something bad when she was (inaudible at 0:19:50.9)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she remembered - yeah...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: She remembered - that was the second thing she could remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:19:54.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she said she also remembered that I was always spanked. That I always...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't remember getting spanked that much. But I remember that I always caught - she says I caught the hell. And she said that - she said she was the one that would always watch me. And then when I caught hell, she knew enough not to do it. But I was always the one - always heard her when I caught hell. And she even remembered the thing I remember too. One night I was out in a carnival. And I was having such a good time and I forgot to look at the clock. And then I realized what time it was, it was, like, almost twelve. And I came running home and it was a small town. And my ma made me stand up, I remember that until I got so tired that I - and she kept waking me up when I - you know, almost collapsed.</p>

<p>And I remember I had a knot in my shoe and I couldn't get the damn shoe off. Finally, I remember just waking up. Somebody threw a blanket over me, but finally, she let me go to sleep. And she said she remembered that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't remember getting...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about that, can't remember getting upset with her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can't remember catching hell that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there was an example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that I knew, yeah. But I can't - she says all these times that I was always the one that would catch the hell. And I - I can remember that, but I cannot remember that many other times specifically where I caught it, you know, other than - I can't remember ever being spanked. Maybe it was another kind of - I don't know. 0:22:03.3</p>

<p>What it made me feel like was like what - you know, what really was going on all that time. Because this - you know, one of the things my ma said to us, like, she doesn't want to visit my sister, I think because she thinks she'll be imposing on them. And yet, you know, she's asked me if she could come down here and visit or when we'd go some place. We'd go over to my uncle's, my ma, she knows I like those people. She knows I like to talk to them especially this one, my sister's father-in-law. And I always have a good time. And I just as soon stay, you know, 11 and 12 or something like that. And yet, when 5 o'clock, she says, "Now it's time to go home."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She won't stay for dinner.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she - no, well, no, it goes this way. We always get together on - like, at Christmas, not this Christmas. She had it at our place. But when we're over there, and it's just started, like, in the last five, six, seven years, when we go over there, you know, you have the big main dinner. And then you, you know, you sit around. We usually watch football, which she hates. And then - but then toward evening, you know, everybody's kind of back and we're talking and stuff. And it's like she's not really a part of things. And she wants not to be a part of things, and she almost kind of sits by herself sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Um-hmm 0:23:59.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she - and then she knows that, you know, she knows that that is irritating to me and yet, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you don't get irritated at her, you just go.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I go. I'm...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how can she know it's so irritating to you if you don't show your irritation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I - I guess at the time I never thought about it. But why I mention that is that when those people are over at our place...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, then the reverse is - if they say they want to go home, then she doesn't want them to go home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She tells them to stay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then - but what I - the only thing I can figure out is that's what she thinks of herself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe she wants them to say that to her also, "Oh, no, stay." 0:24:53.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, but to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or for you to say it, but you don't say anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I usually stall a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, why stall, why don't you say, "No, no, let's stay a while?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "I'm enjoying myself."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'd be going against...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Aunt and uncle were over until 11 o'clock last year, "Why do we have to leave at five?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I can see that. I could see that, you know, that I - that really is weird that I would ever, you know, assert what my thing was. I would do it in other ways. You know, I'd never say, "No, I'd rather stay." Or else she'll say stuff - well, she would say stuff if I wanted to stay, would take two cars, you know, and then she could leave. I mean, that's never happened because I would always leave. But sometimes I'll...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you said it's a small town, you could have driven her home and come back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's two towns - they live in different towns when we go over there. They did another thing, there was another thing at home. This old routine, the old guilt routine because this guy - I'm 27 years old. So we get all done eating and, you know, my ma says, "Johnny will do the dishes." You know, I'm going to do the goddamn dishes. So I said - you know, I didn't cross her up, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? 0:26:49.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I don't cross up my mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm tending away from that (inaudible at 0:27:01.1).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to do the dishes, why should you? She invited you over for Christmas, didn't she? If she wants help, she can ask your sister and your aunt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I never said that to my ma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hurt my ma's feelings. All right, if I would have said...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe your own. Remember we were talking a week or two or three ago about how maybe you're still testing her and still want her to be your ma, the ma that she never was to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Still seeking her approval. She tells you to do the dishes - "Johnny, little Johnny, do the dishes." "Yes, mommy." "Good Johnny, good boy." I think you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except I said I would do them in two hours.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not atypical for little boys, is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I usually would have stalled before. Why did I (inaudible at 0:28:56.0). Why did you say it would be my feelings that would be hurt?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you want to be the little boy that she, you know, approves of. And if you do something that you don't think she likes - it's not just that you're crossing her up, but she'll cross you up too. She'll not like it. She'll tell you you're a bad boy instead of a good boy. How you going to feel then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't get it, well, why would it be my feelings?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would you feel if she told you, you were a bad boy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to make the connection if I'll do it. You mean if...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I laugh at her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd laugh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, if she used those words I would laugh at her. But I see what you're - I see, you know, I know what you're saying. But I'm just trying to say - I'm trying to feel or to see exactly how she would do that. She wouldn't say that, she would use a way to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. She'd make you feel guilty in some way? 0:30:21.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Disapproving in some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, the - yeah, the thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you would feel guilty and bad, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know that, you know that she would do that if you didn't do what she wanted. But the catch is you allow that to happen to you. So suppose she did try to play her guilt game with you, and you didn't feel guilty in spite of that fact, but you do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, there's one - yeah, there's one thing. Don't let - I just want to say one more thing. Don't let me forget the thing about that - really, because it didn't register with me at all that it's my - you know, that it's my feelings that would be hurt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, that - I want to keep that in my head. What happened after that, I said after dinner, you know, I would rather sit and talk for a while. There's no need to go Goddamn running into the kitchen and do the dishes. I didn't say that. I says, I'll do them two, you know, like, two hours later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did she choose you to do the dishes anyhow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I said, I - you know, when I was driving back from Iowa, I says, "What, a 27-year-old doing the Goddamn dishes."</p>

<p>COUSELOR: Why did you ask yourself, why didn't you ask her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It would upset her I imagine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And she would upset you? 0:31:58.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That your own feelings we're talking about. But, you know, if you upset her enough she might get out of the house and find something else to do, rather than wait until you come home a couple of times a year to boss you around. She might find her own man to boss around. You might feel a little more grown up yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I was just going to ride to the defense of my ma.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Look, she can take care of herself. She's been married a couple of times didn't you tell me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's dated several men. Why does she need you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She can't really, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why does she need you? Why do you need her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:33:15.5) you to tell me what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want me to tell you what to do? I told you what to do, not do the dishes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I'll say what happened then. I didn't do them right away. I went over and I sat down. I said, you know, "I'll do them later." Well, there was this other woman named Margaret who's my sister's, you know, relation, who is about my ma's age too. Well, and she's - she just says this is the way it is. So she - a little while later, seeing as how they couldn't sit and talk, she gets up and walks into the kitchen and starts doing them. 0:33:53.7</p>

<p>My ma says, "Johnny, Margaret is doing the dishes." I said, all right - yeah, okay, well, there I did, I said, "Okay, let her do the dishes." So my ma gets up and goes and help her. I says, okay, you know - and that point I didn't feel any problem with it. I says, if they want to do it fine, that's what they can go ahead and do. I said - and for that - see, I couldn't do if my mom...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She made you feel guilty when she did that, didn't she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, if it would have been my ma going in there, I don't think I could have made the connection. But I saw exactly - you know, Margaret went in there. And I watched my ma - maybe this is what I was trying to - I watched my ma, and my ma immediately felt guilty, you know, went in and started helping her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I was sitting there thinking, "Well, I was the one that was - you know." She was saying, "Johnny, you were going to do the dishes." I says, "I said I'd do them later." But see, I couldn't - if she would have got up and started doing them herself, then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Limping toward the kitchen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, then I couldn't have - then I probably would have gone along and helped. That was her way. That was always her way. If she wanted to get me she would start doing it. 0:35:01.9</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then I'd naturally, you know - I'd get mad and I'd...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Naturally?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Naturally, I'd get up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Naturally?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. My sister once wrote me a letter and she said - I was seeing a girl in St. Paul. And it was - oh, it was a mess. And it wasn't going anywhere anyway. But I really liked the girl. And so my sister sent me a letter saying - you know, it was a cuss out letter saying I had better come home because that's - that my ma only lived for the times when the kids would come home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, so you went home?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your mother wouldn't die?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What I wanted to say is, don't most people see their mothers, you know, like once or twice a year?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But maybe most people don't do it because they feel obligated to (inaudible at 0:36:33.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think most people feel obligated, but I don't know whether they let it get to them the way she gets to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I - well, the other times I didn't even think about what was going on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think they'd do it if they were more interested in visiting, you know, a girlfriend that they were serious about. Were you serious about her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, of all the girls, that's the only girl I've ever told her that I loved. Another thing my ma said was that she wanted to come up and pay a visit, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. 0:37:41.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said - I don't want her up here, really I don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I just don't want her up here. And I said not in January. And she said maybe later. And I don't really want her to come.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would she stay with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have enough room?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wouldn't mind a couple of days, but if she'd stay, like, a week, I wouldn't want that. When she came to Texas she stayed two and a half weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was a long trip, put her in a hotel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And usually I'm not quite capable of that, no. I don't think I want her to come here right now. You know, I can't make the connection. Why would my feelings be hurt if she - if she would - okay, if I'd say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she would disapprove of your reaction and make you feel badly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, but why wouldn't I - all right, you know, if I would do the thing - she gets up and starts doing the dishes or something like that or, you know, ask me if I would do it and I say no, I won't, you know, and she goes ahead and does it anyway, and then I'd feel guilty, although I'd tell myself she's doing it. So I would tell her to do it or I would try to help her do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if that lady wasn't there, you would have gotten up to help your mother, wouldn't you? You said you would. You would have felt guilty and did it anyhow. You know how she can... 0:40:16.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, why should - I mean, why...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She gets up and starts doing things herself, and then you take over because you feel guilty.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why should - I mean, why should I feel guilty?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, why? You tell me. Because there's no reason to or is there? It's no wonder you only want to see her once or twice a year and you don't want her here. She puts you in a bag every time you see her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that's so because it never - it never comes to the point where things are - you know, it's always like subtle things like that, which I've grown so accustomed to that I don't - I don't notice those things. I'm oblivious to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She did a thing one year when I was - when I was home. (Inaudible at 0:41:55.9). She left the house for something like two days. And my sister and I didn't know where she went, and she wouldn't tell us, she just came back. But I remember I was just - I felt, you know, like I had done it. I had made her do that. I drove around the town looking for her, all kinds of things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why did she leave? 0:42:34.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't even remember, it was something - my sister and I were teasing her. And usually if we start really going on her we can - she usually never would get mad, she kind of likes it. But that time - I can't remember if it was that - it was something that touched her off, and boy, she wouldn't talk, she (inaudible at 0:42:58.9) and she left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She can really react when she reacts, can't she?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah - yeah, when she does, she...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to watch your P's and Q's. It's like walking on eggshells before she explodes. You have to be careful, don't you? She'll make you stand until you can't, you know, stand any longer. She'll leave the house, she'll abandon you for two days. She...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I remember once when I was little too she said, she was making a couch and she was upset about something. And she just said, "I wish I were dead." And I remember - somehow I thought, you know, I made her feel that way. And I don't - all I remember her saying that night, the feeling I had.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Everything bad that happened to her was your fault, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even the death of her husband?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:44:25.2). How can it be my fault, though?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. That's what I asked. Did that have something to do with you also, question? Did you feel as though you had something to do with it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, I can't - you know, I can't remember. I can't remember anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if I was the one that always caught the hell - see, that isn't coming through, but if I am the one that always caught the hell, I would guess that that - that some way or other that, that would mean that I'm the one that's responsible for my ma's problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm the one that, you know - I'm the one that's punished. It's funny because I can't - I can't remember getting punished all that much. My sister said I always caught it. And my ma said she couldn't - finally it got to the point where she couldn't discipline me anymore by spanking me. She'd put me in corners. See, I can't - it will not sink in on why - you know, I know what you're saying when you say this thing about my feelings will be hurt, but I can't understand that. 0:47:11.5</p>

<p>You know, it's like when I try to explain to my ma the difference between intelligence and going to school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't - you know, I know and I know what you're saying, but I can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not just that your feelings would be hurt by what she said, but you would feel badly, you would have done something which caused her to react as though she were punishing you and you would feel badly. It's not like she embarrassed you. She'd make you feel guilty or unloved, rejected, sadistic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She would make me feel sadistic?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, you're making her suffer. I mean, as though you were being sadistic to her. No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you yell at your mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then you - then she's not going to love you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but who said you were going to yell at her, you were just going to tell her you weren't going to do the dishes, that's all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you yell at her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's not obeying, though, and you should obey your mother.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At 27?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess. But even if you do obey your mother, you know, that doesn't mean that she loves you anyhow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what do you think she - how do you - what do you think she'll say to you if she knew you were screwing around?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't think she could deal with that. I really don't think she could deal with it. I don't think if - I don't even know if I'd ever tell her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd probably lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because she couldn't deal with it or she disapproved? 0:51:20.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'd disapprove.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Damn right she would, so you don't tell her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you don't tell her. Like, you don't have a chance in this case to disobey her, huh, because she doesn't know. Just like she doesn't know you go to bars as often as you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she knows that. The bar thing she (inaudible at 0:51:52.0).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The bar thing she knows.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Okay, look, we have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is there any (inaudible at 0:52:11.6) about 14.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Is there any what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I wanted to make sure I read (inaudible at 0:52:23.5).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: On - to have an adjustment made on my fees, who would I contact?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whether - there are several ways that that used to be done. One was we would defer some of the fee until you could afford to pay it. But since the center is closing the end of June, I don't think we'll do that anymore. I don't know who the fee committee is made of up of right now, but I can find for you, okay, and let you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm. They're really going to close it in June, huh?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Now you can come during the day now, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can come any time. My time is pretty open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about Thursday at 1:30?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. My friend Susie is going to get (inaudible at 0:53:33.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's going to get what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: She's going to get (inaudible at 0:53:35.4), she was going to come here too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's going to get (inaudible at 0:53:37.7)? Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, she signed up, like, about three weeks ago.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe she's not interested anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The one - Susie did you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the one that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The one (inaudible at 0:53:54.0) call?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, see you next...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

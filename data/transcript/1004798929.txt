<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I usually never do that (ph), I'm sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You hardly ever do that. Yeah, I was very surprised when you weren't here because you typically are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I guess there's a lot that has happened over the past four weeks. (laughter) So, yeah, I actually quit my physics class as well, even though that—so the other one I quit in time to not be on my transcript, but this one will be. But I, you know, I don't know. I, like, feel really great about the decision even though it, like, really sucked at the time. So my schedule's much...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Much (inaudible at 00:40) now, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...better, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were doing way too much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's good. I think, like, I (inaudible at 00:50) the past couple days or the couple days after I quit that, I felt...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you make that decision?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think a few days before I missed our appointment actually, yeah. And I think a few days after I made that decision I was like, well, like, I'm such an epic failure and I just, like, I felt like a huge failure, because I guess I—you know, maybe I knew this before but not really, like, knew it, was that my self-esteem and my, like, self-worth is so tied into being a student. And I'm like, well I'm not going to be a student until, like, I die, you know what I mean? (laughter) Like, I'm going to not be a student at some point—that's the goal of being a student. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You haven't really not been a student...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ever, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In your memory.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And so that's been, like, a little bit strange. It definitely, like, (inaudible at 01:45) rebounds of, like, I'm exhausted moments. But then there's also, like, there's like all kinds of stuff that's coming up for me, like, now that I have time to think of the things. So, like, I don't remember when—it was a few weeks ago, like, I was driving home from work and I started to feel, like, really bad about my whole situation with my dad. And I was like, this sucks. Like, why...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this hasn't been present (ph) for you for a while.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And I was like, this is so random. It's not like he called me and I missed the call or, like, there's no trigger. It just, like, randomly came up. And so I—I was, like, just feeling really crappy and that kind of stuff. But then there's also, like, you know, I'm, like, realizing that I'm really, like, a creative person and so I like to draw and paint and stuff. And so I have, like, the urge to do that are (ph), like, stressing me again. Like, I really miss that.</p>

<p>So there's, like, all this other stuff that I guess I didn't realize I put on the back burner, which is weird...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [There are] other things that you could tie into how you see yourself. [00:02:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. I never really realized that before. Like, I remember thinking in school, like, oh, it'd be really cool if I could, like, paint something this weekend. That would be nice. And then of course, like, not doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have that space in your life to do it now, when you have then urge? That (ph) you said that you sort of have the urge to do it, but have you been able to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I actually scheduled—my roommates and I were doing a (inaudible at 03:21) painting class. (laughter) Or, like, I guess wine because it's fancy. (laughter) So we're going to do the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 03:29) fancy (inaudible at 03:29) if you want.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) So I guess we're going to do that and I'm actually really excited about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds fun.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I've been looking around for, like, acapalogicians (ph), as long as it's not—like, I don't want to get into, like, ridiculous schedule again. Like, I don't' want to fall back into that. I want to—I don't know what it is. Like, every time I do something, it's like I have to do it and, like, do it. (laughter) Like, I can't just be a swimmer—I have to be a competitive swimmer, like, you know what I mean? So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Find a way to do something casually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. Because that's important. (laughter) You know, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it allows you to enjoy things without it becoming a focus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and, like, a stressor I guess, yeah. So I think, like, it's still—it's very much, like, new. All this is very new. But then there was a point, like, right after I quit my class or maybe, like, right before I was making the decision, that my, like, my job starting sucking administratively, from above I guess. Because I really like being in the emergency department, but that's not all there is to my job. There's, like, a lot of reports. There's, like, weekly reports, there's quarterly reports, there's one-third reports, there's, like—literally, I'm writing reports every week, which sucks. And I hate it (ph) and I don't find it to be useful there. [00:04:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you—what do the reports consist of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there's, like I said, there's, like, weekly, monthly and quarterly and all kinds of reports. The weekly reports aren't too bad because it's just a couple sentences, but then, like, the monthly reports are a couple pages. The quarterly reports are, like, you know, ten pages. And most of it's, like, really scripted, so it's not like I'm actually thinking about it, you know. I'm just, like, "Today so-and-so was late." OK. "I talked to Doctor so-and-so and he said that we are doing well." Like, it's just, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feels like busy work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And it's not something that I'm good at doing, like, just because I don't really value it. Like, I don't know. I know that it's, like, it's dumb. It's just not something I'm good at. And so, they're having me train three people this month. So each shift is 12 hours and each person has to be trained in five shifts, so it's, like, a lot of hours. [00:05:56] It's, like, literally the whole month. I have, like, one or two shifts alone the whole month and for the rest of the time I'm training people. And I was like, well this seems as though it is not my position that I was originally hired to do. Because they have trainers. And so they were busy all over the country doing other things.</p>

<p>And I was like, well, send us a trainer. And they're like, "No, we can't. They're all busy." And I was like, well, then, like—how did I phrase it? It was something like, "I would, like, really like for you to reconsider my, like, salary for this period of time because it seems to, like, lie outside of my job description." And they were like, "Oh, you know, we have it in your job description that you occasionally train scrubs." And I was like, "OK, but a whole month is not occasionally." (laughter)</p>

<p>And I was like, that was pretty interesting because, again, I had that urge to be like, "All right, I quit," you know. (laughter) And so at one point I was, like, facing not having a job and not being in school. [00:06:57] That was, like, really scary. (laughter) But it was interesting because I've never really been, like, a good advocate for myself, in terms of job situations. Like, I wouldn't know how to begin to, like, negotiate a salary or anything, like, you know, that's just not something I'm good at. And I kind of had to do that so I, like, learned to do that too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it turn out when you pushed back again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, the pushing back was a little bit hard because I didn't know how to phrase it because I was so angry. Like, I didn't know how to phrase it nicely. But they actually agreed to bump up my salary for the training shifts by, like, a little bit, which is—I mean, it was more of, like, a moral thing. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 07:43) that they would sort of acknowledge that you're doing more than what is typically required.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And that's actually what I said. I was like, I'm really not feeling appreciated and, like, I'm doing a lot more work. So it was something like that. I phrased it. So that—I don't know, that was kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: yeah, that sounds like really a big change for you to be able to, one, sort of assert yourself, to push back and have them really acknowledge something that felt really true for you and be able to stick up for yourself. And it worked (inaudible at 08:20).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I was really surprised by. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it didn't create a huge, you know, sort of dramatic exit, which sometimes happens when you feel angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. And, I mean, it was (inaudible at 08:33) just like (inaudible at 08:35) back and forth, then I had to cc, like, another person and I don't know if that was, like, appropriate or not, but I don't know, yeah. It felt really weird. It felt like I was being, like, bitchy or something. (laughter) But I know that Julia's really good at stuff like that so I kept asking her to, like, proofread my e-mails and so I used a lot of her suggestions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you did it in a really thoughtful way. It wasn't impulsive, it wasn't...</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I don't know, that was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was big, I guess. I guess a lot of, like, the other stuff that has been coming up for me now that I don't have class, it is like I'm going back to, like, my, like, body (ph) stuff, I guess. And I don't know, I realize that I didn't even feel healthy and one of the things I realized, like, probably about a week after I quit class, it was like, how am I supposed to help other people be healthy and, like, try and do that if I'm not healthy myself or if I don't have that as a priority in my life, you know? [00:09:39]</p>

<p>So I actually—you know how I was like, oh, you know, I don't know, should I be a vegetarian or should I not, like, all that kind of stuff? I actually became a vegan (laughter), which is (inaudible at 09:54) I know, but I think it kind of satisfied that, like, need for change. And that's been, like, really huge. It's been, like, probably, like, for the past, you know, week and a half, that's really been a lot of where I'm putting my energy, because I've been cooking a lot and trying to—because I don't cook. (laughter) I'm, like, the worst cook of all time. And so, I've been, like, trying to figure out, oh, that's what the fryer's for in the kitchen, like, oh (laughter).</p>

<p>So that's been I think, like, a really positive experience for me. And I also started...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is appealing about veganism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think because for me, like, I don't really listen to my body a lot, even though—like, I hear it but I don't listen to it, you know what I mean? And I think—like, I just feel so much better. Like, energy wise, like, I remember a couple weeks before, a couple weeks ago, I drank five huge coffees for my overnight shift because I was really tired. And now I'm drinking, like, one small coffee a night. [00:10:59] And, like, that's, like, I don't know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 11:02)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. I feel a lot better. I feel better about myself, I don't know, in a weird way. And I started, like, working out and stuff more regularly. So that's been pretty big too. You know, I still feel, like, weird. I go the gym and, like, I should not be here. I'm, like, not super fit and I'm not about to run 30 miles, you know. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Most of the people in the gym are not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Not running 30 miles? Well there's a 30 minute limit on the treadmill, but (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That'd be really fast for 30 miles. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whoa, a minute mile. That's crazy. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't even drive that here. (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, right? But I still feel kind of, like, out of place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So let's talk about that rather than joke about it, because that's probably a big deal to put yourself in a place where you don't feel comfortable</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. It's like, again, I feel, like, uncomfortable and I just feel, like, uncomfortable in my own skin. Like, I feel, like, icky almost, just because I feel like, oh my god, everybody is so much more hardcore than me or whatever. [00:12:18] (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how do you get yourself to stay there and go there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I've actually—this is, like, the lamest thing of all time (laughter) but they have a sauna and I love the sauna. Like, I love—I don't know what it is about the sauna. Like, it's like a really meditative, like, peaceful centering. I just feel, like, so different for the rest of the day when I go the sauna. It's, like, weird. But I'm not going to go to the gym just to go the sauna, right? So, I kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you use it as your reward?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That doesn't sound lame. That sounds smart. I mean, there is something uncomfortable that you want to get yourself to do and you've found a way to tie it with something that's really enjoyable for you. So, I mean, that sounds like really classic motivation or reward.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I've also started to do—I have, like, an app on my phone that's like a cache 5k thing. [00:13:26] So I started running, which has always been, like, my greatest fear ever. Like, because I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't' want to make it too easy on yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (laughter) Well, no. But, I mean, you know, the—I've always sort of, like, cycling, like, spinning and I've always done, like, the elliptical and I'm good at exerting myself (inaudible at 13:42) and I'm good at—I'm more endurance because (ph) I'm not very fast, but I go for a long time kind of thing? But running has always been, like, that thing that, like, when I was younger, like, I would always try to run to lose weight and it would never work and I would never stick with it and it was so hard. And so, it's always been like this, like, the holy grail of what is hard for me. And so it feels weird to, like, finally be tackling it, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Weird. Can you describe weird?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, so the program, it starts out really easy. You know how (inaudible at 14:18) to, like, joke around a lot, but the first day I started on, like, week seven of eight by accident. And so I was like, all right, I'm so into it, like, yeah. Ten minutes in I'm like, wow, this is really hard. I think 13 minutes in, I was like, something is wrong. (laughter) So I was really sore the next day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 14:35) (laughter) halfway there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was kind of funny. But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you make it through week seven on day one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (laughter) No, 13 minutes in, I was like, good God. So then I went back and did day one.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Probably a lot more manageable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so much more manageable. And it almost feels, like, less embarrassing that I'm, like, walking quickly, like speed walking or whatever, instead of, like, running 9 miles an hour or whatever. Because I'm like, well, I have to do this. Like, this is—I'm not really choosing. This is what the lady on the phone is telling me to do. So it kind of takes the choice away from me, I guess?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the responsibility for what you think could (ph) probably be judging.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right and, like, I know in my head it's just me, like, judging myself but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty powerful (inaudible at 15:32). That sounds like a good way to take some of the pressure off, is to do something that—and to let somebody else decide what really is an appropriate regimen, because you often choose the hardest group for yourself. I mean, just the fact that you've chosen running to be the thing to go back to the gym too, when running has been such a loaded (ph) activity.</p>

<p>And it sounds like in some ways being able to tackle this really loaded activity is important, but having a way to do it in a measured way rather than what goal you might set up for yourself. Because I can, you know, just—I know you accidentally started on week seven, but it was just really hard. You didn't stop. You didn't stop until 13 minutes later when it was really, really hard. So having, I think, a way to kind of temper the goal of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it kind of—I think, like, what I was saying before about, like, making things competitive. Like, I feel like that's kind of just my nature, like, that's fun for me. Like, I remember competing in swimming and I remember having a great time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with competition.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think there's also a fine line between, like, is this fun? Is this a stressor? And I'm not very good at telling where that is. But this is definitely not a stressor so far (inaudible at 16:52).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How could you—what would be some of the red flags, in case it does start to feel like more of a stressor rather than something that's taking care of you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) I don't know. Maybe, like, dreading? Dreading it or feeling like, oh my god, I have to go do this again, how annoying kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So if you start to feel that, rather than give it up, I wonder how you might alter what you're doing so that you can continue it with less dread.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I could (pause) maybe do what I just did and—because I don't necessarily need to be pushing myself to do more. Like, I feel like a minimum would be, like, just do what I did last week kind of thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, like, on the program if you start to dread because maybe the next day is too hard, you don't necessarily need to do it the exact number of days that it's prescribed. I've heard of (inaudible at 18:08) program before (inaudible at 18:09) people that have done it, so, like, if you need to repeat week three, you can repeat week three. You could repeat week three seven times if that's what got you to continue to go to the gym and move, because the object really is to get a little bit more movement into your life. Because the activity feels good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I have noticed, like, changes in my mood and stuff, now that I'm actually, like, exercising a lot. So I think (ph) that could be its own reward in its own way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely. How is it for your asthma?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I don't have exercise-induced asthma, so it was fine, except the last time I went I had this, like, big asthma attack. I was, like, stuck upstairs because I go to (inaudible at 18:59) three floors. And I was stuck upstairs, and my inhaler was downstairs. I never bring it up because I never need it. And I was like, oh my god, how am I going to get downstairs? But I just carefully (inaudible at 19:16) and then I used it and it was fine, but that was weird. That was, like, probably one of the more significant asthma attacks I've had in a while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you ask anyone for help?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't know what I would say. (laughter) I'm not very good at that (inaudible at 19:31, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What could have been helpful, now that you're not in that pressure situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Maybe if someone could get the inhaler?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that possible? Was it in a locked locker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I had my...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You had a key.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so that is something you can do. Sometimes just thinking of ways that you can help ask for help when you're not in the panic situation of not being able to breathe makes it a little bit easier to then enact that situation, because that's a frightening place to be caught, when you can't—not being able to breathe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's weird and I've noticed—because I never had asthma as a kid. It started in college, actually. And one of the doctors—we had a patient come in recently who was, like, extreme, like, pretty much they were going to intubate her. She was really, really doing poorly. And the doctor's, like, "Yeah, these, like asthmatics are so used to, like, not being able to breathe frequently that they don't care. They don't come in until they're, like, dying." And I sort of—I was like, wow, I'm not going to do that. And then I, like, realize, oh, I'm kind of doing the same thing, so I, like, I have to be a little bit more careful of that I think, a little bit more mindful. Maybe bring my inhaler upstairs from now on. [00:20:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you can carry it with you. It's not that big. And if you don't need it, you can bring it back down (inaudible at 21:05) having it. Because, I mean, I think it's a big deal, and when it gets too far, then you can't ask for help anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that would be really embarrassing. (laughter) But yeah, so that's kind of been going on, I guess. And it's like, (pause) I think that's a pretty big, like, that and, like, Veganism has turned my daily life totally...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 21:37) really different focus.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what does the routine of your week look like now, with these things in place?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, a lot of them—the food is, it's different. It's more like—it's not food is bad anymore, which I think was, like, a lot of my attitude before. It was like, oh, I have to, like, eat again. That's so annoying. (laughter) Now it's like, well, I have to eat because I'm hungry. (laughter) I'm hungry more often. I was never really hungry, I just kind of had to—I just ate, I don't know (inaudible at 22:12).</p>

<p>But now, since I have less options, I have to be more creative, so I have to cook more, which is kind of really cool. And I've come up with some pretty awesome soups. Because I don't follow recipes, I don't—yeah, they're not really useful for me. (laughter) And I've been kind of, like, feeding my roommates a little bit and they've been trying stuff. So it's almost turned into, like, a bonding thing...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (ph) that's nice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I tested out a dish for Thanksgiving. I did a vegan lasagna. So a lot of it's, like, thinking, but without, like, feeling like, oh, this is going to be the worst thing in the world for me and I'm going to regret it tomorrow when I'm two pounds heavier or something, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are those the kinds of thoughts you were having about food?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And still a little bit, you know, like, it's not, like, one day to the other. (pause) Yeah, but I don't think I've ever really—like, it's always been, like, a necessary evil, you know. It's more just, like, necessary. (laughter) But I still, I mean, you know, it doesn't really change from one day to the next. [00:23:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you feeling about your body?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I don't really know. I feel like that's a little bit abstract for me still. I don't know. Someone told me such the other day, they're like, "You have such a pretty face." And I was like, (pause) "Thanks."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What does this response mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that means—I feel like that's like, you know, you can just say, like, "Oh, you're such a pretty person," like, that would be—that's different than...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would've felt better to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel like that's like, yeah, "Oh, your face is so pretty, but your body." (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you heard an unspoken (pause) critique of what wasn't singled out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. And not that I feel like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who said this [to you] (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, it was a friend from—we're not even that close. It was weird. [00:24:27] (laughter) We were talking about, like, being vegan, because he's a vegan. So it felt, I think, even more kind of—because we were talking about, I don't know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you were talking about food?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So that kind of felt crappy, but I was like, well, whatever, you know, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did you respond to the (p) back-handed compliment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think he meant it as, like, a...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet he didn't, but it felt like it to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I said thanks. It was just—I think, like, intentionality is, like, really important to me, even though sometimes, like, sometimes I take that a little too far. Like, at work recently, someone—like, I was talking (inaudible at 25:16) and I said, oh, and she said, like, "Wow, it's so nice to meet a smart Mexican." And I was like, oh. (laughter) But she totally meant it as, like—I could tell that she meant it as a compliment and was, like, really enjoying having a conversation with me and was interested in what I was saying. So I was like, you know, I didn't really know what to do so I was like, "Thanks." (laughter)</p>

<p>So it was kind of awkward but, you know, I guess I've been thinking a lot about that too. It's, like, words versus intention.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How did it make you feel? Both of those things were, you know, kind of (pause) sort of aggressive comments, even though they maybe were—I think you're right. I think probably the intention of both speakers was innocent in trying to be complimentary, you know. In the second example, she was really probably trying to say was she was enjoying having conversation with you. But the other thing she said was that she holds a stereotype of Mexican people, that they're not smart. And that's a really hurtful comment. It's biased and it's racist and can carry a lot of hurt. [00:26:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, somehow, like, I was a little bit more offended by the guy's comment for some reason. I don't know, maybe because that's more of a sensitive subject for me? Like, I don't know. Because, you know, like, OK, well I'm Mexican, like, whatever. (laughter) It's somehow, like, less of an issue for me. And in the other case, I kind of just felt bad for her. I was like, well, she has really good intentions and (pause), like, clearly, this is, like, an ignorant comment to make, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It didn't feel as personal to you as the male's comment, when you felt like he was commenting on your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. So that was (pause)—yeah, I guess, you know, the guy's comment would definitely be—it stuck with me longer. And I almost, like, it took me a while to figure out, like, what she had said was not the smartest thing in the world. I was like, I was like just so confused by it, you know. I was like, what? (laughter) So it was almost, like, less impactful, whereas the other one, I, like, sort of immediately was like, oh, OK. [00:27:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting, because I think the first comment hit you in a place that you feel uncomfortable. You feel, you know, when I ask how you feel about your body, it's like, well that's a really hard one to answer, because you don't feel comfortable, but you don't know what exactly—how to phrase that, so it hit a very sensitive spot for you. And, you know, this inaccurate stereotype doesn't hit home for you. That's not something you hold against yourself, whereas the other comment, I think, I mean, that's a voice you hear in your own head saying that you don't like the way your body looks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if that's made it stick a lot more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And also, probably, like, to hold a stereotype against a group of people is different than to make a comment specific to one person. So that may have also played a part in it. But yeah, I don't know. And that's been kind of in my mind, I guess. [00:28:54] And I think some of the other things, at least in the emergency department, is that there's been, like, other comments made about other people that have made me, like, really uncomfortable and that I don't necessarily know, like, how to respond to.</p>

<p>So I've, like, been thinking, you know, like, is it appropriate for me to, like—you know, if someone's using really homophobic language and, you know, being really rude and saying all kinds of crap, that appropriate for me to ever say anything? Because, like, apparently this, like, happens. (laughter) I didn't realize it happened in the real world, you know. So I think, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would you want to say, if you were to say something? Forgetting about what's appropriate, what would your gut say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I was thinking about that the other day. I was like, I don't even know, like, I would want to, like, maybe, like, respectfully ask that someone use less hateful language. (laughter) But I don't really know if that's—I mean, I guess it would be appropriate, right? Because that's—but I, you know, like... [00:30:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you absolutely have a right to say something because you have a right to feel comfortable in you workplace. And if somebody's using language that makes you really uncomfortable then absolutely you have the right to say that. Now I guess there's probably some policies in a handbook about discriminatory language and things like that. You know, a lot of places have some stuff written in that effect. And what you just said was beautiful that, you know, that sounds like really hateful language to you and you would prefer a different choice. So, I mean, (inaudible at 30:44) we've talked before about, you know.</p>

<p>So two things you want to do is, one, make it clear that this feels, you know, unacceptable to you and you also want to protect yourself, because someone's who's using really hurtful, hateful language could potentially act out in other ways too. So, I mean, you want to make your feelings clear but you also want to make sure that when you say something that you're going to be safe too.</p>

<p>And one way is thinking about how you phrase it so that you decrease the defensiveness in the other person. Makes them more able to hear your message without getting really insensitive (ph) about it. And you know, just like when you were having, you know, hard conversations with a roommate about something that was sensitive, doing the I statement thing can sometimes help to alleviate some of the defensiveness in the other person.</p>

<p>So using, "It makes me really uncomfortable to hear that language and I would prefer a more neutral word choice," might get your point across. [00:31:49] Lets them know, acknowledges that what they're saying is not an OK thing to say in a work setting, especially. And you're, you know, expressing how it makes you feel. You're not saying, "You're a crappy person because you're saying that," you know. (laughter) Or you're not even insinuating that, but you're letting them know that it makes you really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. Yeah, I guess, like, the little cubicle that we all share, it's, like, difficult to do that because it's almost like when you talk to someone else, like, you have to expect that other people are listening. But that—yeah. And there's this one person in particular that I'm thinking of and she just, like, everything that comes out of her mouth is, like, "I hate this fucking job," and like, "I can't believe this fucking patient." [It's to a point] where I'm like, do you like your job? You don't have to—I don't know. I don't even care. Like, it's just really sort of disruptive to... [00:32:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To [the overall morale] (ph). I mean, the other route is if you don't feel comfortable having conversation, if there's another way to have a private conversation with someone? Is this a policy for involving HR? Or is there somebody else that might help you navigate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. I feel like it might be—I think it—yes. But I feel like that goes on people's records and that I'm somehow less comfortable with that. Plus, I kind of want to, like, learn to do that for myself, you know what I mean? Because I'm not good at that anyway. Like, I'm not good at confrontation and, yeah. But I'm, like, really good at avoiding it. (laughter) You know what I mean?</p>

<p>Like, there's been times when, like, people say really hateful, like, really sort of annoying things that I really profoundly disagree with and, like, I just kind of walk away and then sometimes I hate myself for doing that sometimes. I'm like, well that's really crappy. Like, there's no reason that, like, if they're clearly voicing their opinions and it was a friendly conversation, like, there's no reason that (pause) I can't, you know, respectfully express what I think. [00:34:00] But this obviously all an afterthought and (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You need some time to sort out how you respond to something you've heard and what you think about not responding to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially a comment like that woman made. Like, (pause) I don't know. I feel like if I was like, "Well that's really racist," or, like, if I said something like that then she'd be like, "Wow, what a terrible person to talk to." I mean, we were having such a great—like, it was such a nice—because it was slow and we just kind of randomly bonding, and so I feel like it might impede, like, future relationships. I think that's my, like, my fear, in not really confronting people, is that it might, like, make it difficult to make it talk to them in the future.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, and that can happen. And so the art is how do you have a dental confrontation? [00:35:03] Because if you jump to one end and have a really strong reaction and label their transgression really stronger and if you attribute it to them, like, you know, "You're clearly a really racist person for saying that." That's like leaving it in the way of the relationship. But if you can find a way to gently confront the one piece that they said while still acknowledging, like, the intent behind it. So, you know, if the intent is to be hurtful, it gets a little bit harder to find sort of, you know, the two sides of it. But when you're pretty sure, you know, with that woman's comment to you that her intent was good and how she packaged it was really thoughtless and showed some ignorance perhaps.</p>

<p>But if you can focus on both those pieces, if you can validate her good intent and acknowledge the good conversation you were having, but also gently acknowledge and help her to be aware that how she said that could be really hurtful, you know, even though you are enjoying the conversation and are glad that she found you smart. You know, if you can acknowledge both pieces, it's likely not to necessarily get in the way of being able to connect with her. You've kind of alerted her to this other piece, the unintended piece of her message. [00:36:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And maybe that's where the intentionality piece comes in, is, like, when to have what conversation, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think it sounds like you're being exposed to lots of things—some things that are meant to be sort of mean and some things that are not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I guess it's a crazy place. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That's what I figured] (ph). (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow, yeah, so I think—OK, that's a lot to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think your goal would be in confronting some of the stuff that you're hearing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, honestly I think at some point, like, I just feel like I'm still doing the thing where I, like, don't really tell people what I think. And sometimes, like, even when I feel like it's a terrible thing, like, it comes up—like, (pause) just to say it I think would be my goal [right now] (ph). I know sometimes it's hard (inaudible at 37:38), but... (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But just to feel like I can. Like, the other day, Julia—it was, like, Sergio's birthday or something, and she had texted me something and then we switched to G (ph) text —she was at work. Then, like, a couple minutes between, she was like, sad face text or something, and I was like, OK, well, sad face text, like, OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you hadn't responded fast enough?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it had been a couple of minutes and then I G-chatted (ph) her, so I didn't reply to her text. And I just chatted to her about something random, like, something. And she was like, "That's really rude when, like, I had just—did you see my text?" And I was like, "The sad face text?" And she was like, "Yeah. Well, clearly I'm, like, really upset and, like, it really, like, bothers me that you switched the subject so quickly and started talking about nothing." [00:38:35]</p>

<p>And I was like, I just—I felt so angry so quickly but, like, sort of channeled it, I guess? And I was like, "Look, I'm not about to get into a fight about this, all right. It's not my intention to ignore your feelings. Like, I think it's really inappropriate that you think that and I'm not going to get into a an argument about this." And, like, I don't say that, ever. That's not really—that's more of a Julia reaction to have, it's not really a normal reaction to have. And she was like, "Oh, OK," and then started telling me about how she felt about Sergio after I asked, right. And I was like, oh, really, you can just move on from that? (laughter) Because that was kind of a big deal for me.</p>

<p>So that was—like, that felt good to, like—I feel like just being able to say that, you know, because we've had some, like, other, you know, exchanges that were not so positive. And so I felt like this was going to be another, like, huge fight, and then I said that and it wasn't. And I was like, what? Like, it does not compute. (inaudible at 39:44)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think made it possible for that not to be a huge fight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, like, because I think—my normal reaction with her is to, like, shut down and be like, OK, well, I'm just not going to talk about it and, like, talk about something else. Like, fine, whatever, like, you can be angry, let's just move on. And I think that that's really unsatisfying for her because, I don't know, she likes to talk about feelings. (laughter) She always asks me to, like, what do you think? What do you think about this? And like, that's kind of why we got into the argument before, you know. And so I think that I kind of just, like, bursted out and was like, no, like, I'm not trying to, like—this is a normal conversation. (laughter) I'm not, like, being aggressive or anything. I'm not saying, like, I don't want to talk about Sergio ever. So I think maybe just saying that maybe that told her what I was thinking and allowed her to move on, I guess? [00:40:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, different things are going to work with different people. You know, you have a different relationship with her. She responds well to having it all out on the table and you might find that you have to kind of play around with matching what's working for you and what works for someone else. You can have a different style with one person versus another. Work is going to be different than Julia.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think I've been experiencing that a lot with my other roommate Tracy (sp?). So, like, I've kind of been thinking about, like, wow, we—because Tracy (sp?) made a comment the other day. She was like, "Yeah, Julia, like, thinks about things in a different way than we do." And I was like, what? I didn't really think about that. I've (ph) been thinking about it and kind of thinking about my relationship with both of them and it's been interesting. So, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it has been a lot of process over the past (inaudible at 41:48).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh my god, yeah. (laughter) That's not even half of it. Next time. Yeah, there's been a lot of changes, but hopefully they're good changes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you've made some hard decisions, but good decisions, for yourself in, you know, freeing up that space by not taking classes when it sounds, you know, the evidence was sort of there that classes right now were not in the game plan. But it freed up some space to explore some other things that you've wanted to work on. I mean, you know, putting some of the communication skills that you worked on at home, putting that into place maybe at work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 42:34)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Making some space to, you know, explore the creative things that you're, you know, kind of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't even know existed still.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It's hard for them to exist if there's not space for it and there just hasn't been. I wonder if the creative outlets will allow you kind of another way of expressing some of the feelings and taking some of the intensity out of some of the feelings that you have.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's right, because I'm trying to, like, write it because I'm just writing erratically and distortedly (ph). (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not being forced on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And so I've tried writing a little bit and it's really hard, like, emotionally. I'm like, oh wow, like, I feel like I'm processing a lot of things. (laughter) But, I don't know, in a good way, you know. Like, I feel like it's OK. But it's still—I feel like it's opening up a whole other (pause)—I guess it's like another access point to, like, the same stuff that, like, we talk about in here, I don't know. [00:43:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think it is. It's so many different ways to get at what you're feeling and find a way to express it, understand it and, you know, talking in here. You know, some people use movement, some people use creativity in other ways—painting, drawing, listening to music. [I think there's] (ph) lots of very valid ways of getting at stuff. And you can translate it for me. If you have some creative outlet at home, you know, feel free to translate it some way for me so that I can understand it. You know, if it's a portable thing, if you do a painting and it means something to you or helps you express something, I'm happy to look at it with you and, you know, try to understand that way as well.</p>

<p>Let me stop there for today. I have some scheduling stuff I needed to save time to talk to you about. I know we've been doing the every other week thing, but I have some stuff that's going to screw that up. (laughter) So, I can't be here the afternoon of the 30th, which would be our normal week if we were doing every other, and I can't be here the 6th. So I was wondering if you could do next week at your normal time and then skip two weeks and do the 13th. [00:45:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) OK, so I'm sorry, because they just switched the view on it. It's a new thing. So the 23rd?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, would be next week. Can you do that at 4:20?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Let me just put that in before I pack (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, take your time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 16, 20, (pause) OK. And then...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then if we skipped two weeks, because I'm out the 30th and the 6th, so that would put us on Tuesday the 13th at 4:20?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And then I could do the actual two weeks and do the 27th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 27th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, OK. Thank you for your flexibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, November's not scheduled yet, so I'm free (laughter) the whole month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) I'm glad I got you first. OK, I'm glad we (inaudible at 46:18). We won't be missing any sessions, just kind of sliding them one week to the next.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I actually—technically, I'm insured now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: As of, like, two weeks ago, but I don't have any of the information because they still have to send it to me. But maybe for, like, the next session or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I can still—even though you don't have any information, I mean, if you get me the information I can bill them. So, do you know what it is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Blue Cross Blue Shield. I'm on the, like, the high young adults plan, or whatever. I don't know if that means anything to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Blue Cross has a million plans. I am a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider, so hopefully I'll be covered. There's a couple Blue Cross plans that use a different provider now? So we're just going to hope it's not one of those. (laughter) So bring your stuff when you get your—all I really need is the number, your member number. So sometimes you can get that from them before you get your card.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I meant to call today but I slept through the day. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No big deal. So I'll just get that information from you. So you do owe for the session you missed last week, but I won't charge you for today until we find out what your copay is. [00:47:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I actually—would it be OK if I just do both and we can start the next...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you want to, but why would you want to pay for a session that was would be covered?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? Because you're covered, even though I don't have your plan number, so why would you pay for that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because I feel bad, like, leaving without...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, but if you use insurance, I never get paid that day. So it doesn't matter. But I always bill the end of the month for any sessions you've had that month, so technically even if I had the number, I wouldn't be submitting it right away. So what you will owe is a copay and I don't know what that is, but I'll charge you for that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's 30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, so do you feel better if you pay that now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like that would confuse me actually. Is that... (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, that's fine. So let's do the 140 for last week for the last session and then we'll figure out your copay next time and square that away. [00:48:27]</p>

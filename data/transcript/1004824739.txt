<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I figured it out before 4:00. I'm good, though. I found one of those little short-cuts, went way too fast. (both chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You made good time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I beat down a crossing guard. It was awesome. (pause) We had a really good show last night. It was like our best show, I think. It was really fucking good. It wasn't really packed because it was so last minute, but we still had the best crowd, best reaction, people were totally into it. We played awesome. I was really high-energy. It was awesome. It was a great show. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How exciting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it just felt good. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It sounded good. We had a good time. It was just great. It was funny because there were two writers there. One of them is kind of friends with our base player, I guess, back from college, so he was there; and then their music writer was there, this woman named Maria, and the weird thing about that was that I didn't know her, and then when Philip said, "Yeah, this woman, Maria, she's a music writer," I was like, "What the ?" She chipped into our Kickstarter next week. I was like I don't know who this Maria is. There are people kicking in that I don't know. So I'm like whatever. Maria. Okay. So that's cool. I don't know what to make of that. That's almost like a conflict of interest or something. That's cool. So I don't know what that means. She came to maybe write something or . . ? I don't know, but it's all good. [00:02:12] Yeah, it was good. Everyone was all into it so it was cool. We're almost getting to $2,000, so I'm just still working it. (pause) And then I was proud of myself because I went out with Dave and I didn't drink. So the whole night I had maybe three beers. I went to meet him at a bar and I just had soda water, so that was good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was special, too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did pick up some Mickey D's, but that was just because I hadn't eaten almost all day. I was like fuck it, I'm just going to celebrate, go home and watch Modern Family, have a little Mickey D's with my cat. But, yeah, it was cool. I didn't really drink, so that was good. (pause) So, yeah. I don't know. [00:03:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a sign of someone who knows music who's maybe new to your music who likes it . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Who's this?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The writer. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. I don't know. I will say that—again, it's when you underestimate yourself. The guy that booked it, this guy James, I don't really know him, but then when I got there I was like, "Hey, may. Thanks for thinking of us." He was like, "Oh, yeah. I was a huge fan" I guess he's a big booker. He books the bars and all these places, so that was good. [00:04:05] This woman, too, it could be that she remembers. I don't know. Whatever it is, it's great. I friended both of them on Twitter today. I'm trying to be diplomatic. I'll probably just say, "Thanks for coming to the show." I'll just say something like, "If you feel up to it, if you're inclined to check out the Kickstarter video and let people know, it's cool either way." There's this other dude, Jack, who just gave me cash. He's like, "Man, I just feel weird about giving money over the Internet with my card. Can I just give you $30?" I was like, "What? Yeah. Sure." (both chuckle) He was really nice. Good guy. I didn't know who he was either. Dave said that he's a huge music fan and I guess he's been around for a while. So that was good. It was good. (pause) Yeah, there's definitely room—it feels different. I just feel different. [00:05:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you going to say—"room"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For example, this girl I know did a music video for one of the songs, so she sent it over yesterday and it's okay. I can't complain. She did it for free, did it really fast. It's just—whatever. It's okay. But then I was talking to my friend, Tim, and he was like, "Dude, you could probably make a good video. You have iMovie on your Mac and you have an iPhone. There are websites that have stock footage that's not copywrited." So I was like, "Yeah. What the fuck? What's so hard about that? I don't know how to do it, but I'm sure a couple of hours and I'll just make something."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can learn it. [00:06:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So it's not like I'm not going to use hers, but—yeah. What I was saying is that there's room for—yeah. Why wouldn't I do that? It's exciting. It's fun. Because now there's space to. You know what I mean? There isn't all this shitty clutter. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also doesn't sound quite as scary to try, I think. You have the feeling you could go check it out for a few hours and see where it brings you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. It was like he sent me all these clips like, "Here's one I did for one friend and here's my other friend's. He has this little video." He totally made it sound like they were off-the-cuff kind of things. That's what they do. They're like graphic design people, so of course for them it's like—but, still, he was like, "It's really not rocket science. You could just probably make something really cool if you just kind of take a little time to work at it. Give yourself a few hours," so I think I'm going to do that. [00:07:58] (pause) Also, after the show it was good. I was mellow. It wasn't a high or a low. Actually, I didn't think about this. I didn't think at all about the set. I didn't think about—like there was one song where I kind of flubbed a little bit. No one heard it, but I didn't even think about that. After the show I was just fine. I wasn't too excited. It was a great show and that was it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's another way you were talking about there being this room, this space to be in the moment after the show instead of anxiously [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:52) about something that happened during the set. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's like real confidence. Like we're good, man, really good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have to worry so much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Especially last night because the other bands were good, you know? But it felt good to play with those kinds of bands—kind of like the hip-stream. I guess we are, too, but they're just not that good. A couple of songs you were like, "Oh, this is good," but by the end of their set you're done. You're like, "All right, everything just sounds kind of the same. Nothing's really making me stop and really, really pay attention," whereas we have that. We have some intangible, where people just seem to be really riveted from beginning to end. (pause) [00:10:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound like you feel that in a more genuine way. You are good. It really does sound good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could feel it less while I was playing. I was just in it singing the songs. It was cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very different. There have been times when you'll say, "We're fucking good, man," but it has the feeling of on the surface there's elation, but there's still some doubt underneath. Even if you don't meet the goal, that doesn't change that it's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's going to suck. No, no. It's not going to be about whether we're good or not, but it's going to suck because then I'm going to be angry that I should have made it a lower goal and more of the thought. Honestly, I'm not even thinking about that. It's just got to get done. I'm just going to have to do what it takes to cobble it together. [00:11:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear you're determined about that, but it's different than thinking if you don't meet it, it means something about your talent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. No, it doesn't mean shit about the talent. No, no. I know that. It will just be disappointing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really disappointing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It will just suck to have to do it all over again and all that stuff. I guess you could argue that the good thing will be that when we do it all over again we'll clearly hit our goal. We should if I make it for $2,000. We'll clearly hit it probably really fast because all of those people will just quickly do it again and—you know. And actually I was thinking about it and it really isn't that, because I imagine when they're kicking in it's this big process, but it's not; because what happens is in the beginning you just go, "Oh, yeah. I want to chip in." You click it and that's it. You don't have to actually pay until it's funded, so all that credit card whatever shit . . . so when I thought about it, so really it's like two clicks or whatever. It's not a big fucking deal. But it just feels good to be determined. I don't see why not. (chuckles) There's got to be a way to make this happen. But, yeah, I feel more like we'll just retool whatever and it will be fine. It will just suck because I think Jerry is probably already in the lake, you know? I haven't paid him yet so that's just a bummer. [00:13:04] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's the PR?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he's the PR guy and, I haven't paid him yet, but they've basically been working. He knows I'm good for it. That would be the only thing that would suck is that I would have to find a way to at least pay him a little bit or something. But, yeah, I'm not feeling that catastrophic whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there often a flurry of stuff in the end from people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: On Kickstarter? Yeah. The statistics say it's usually in the last three-to-five days, because a lot of people will be like, "Oh, yeah. That's right. I was going to chip in."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Even people who are intending to just got busy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's right. And I was like that with my friend's jazz thing. I think I chipped in the last day or something like that. So, yeah, the two statistics they have are that you shouldn't make it more than 30 days so that people feel a sense of urgency; and that usually it's the last couple of days that you've got to really make a push and people respond. We have 14 days and I'm working it hard every day. I think the last seven days is when I'm going to start reaching out to the big bucks, people that maybe can kick in a few hundred bucks or something like that. A few people went back and upped their . . . yeah, that's nice. (pause) [00:15:16] The one weird thing that I've been putting off is I haven't gotten back to yoga girl. We're supposed to maybe get together tomorrow. It's like I know that if I don't get together with her tomorrow she might be like, "All right. This guy . . . I don't know what's going on here."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what would that do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm torn. I kind of do want to see her more, but I know that this is like these other girls. I'm not really head over heels, but I don't want to close the door on it, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not? Why don't you want to close the door?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because she's cool. I like hanging out. She's a nice person and it's fun. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So to close the door you'd be alone?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, alone. Or cutting something off that if I was patient . . . I don't know. I guess either alone or—I don't want to keep doing that where I'm shunning options just because I'm not madly in love. I feel like that's maybe wrong, too. The few times I was insanely in love it was a fiasco, so maybe it's cool to just hang out with someone normal and nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The idea that what if there would be potential for something more than what you're feeling right now with her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's 44, man. We can't have kids. It's just a reality. Of course, there are ways—adoption or whatever. I'd like to have at least one of my own kids. It sucks that for dudes it doesn't really matter as much, but for women it does—not to mention she's really into me; but she's pretty soured on marriage, so I just don't know. There is a part of her that's sort of evolving, so I feel like that could also mean that one day she would be like, "I'm kind of not into this anymore because I'm evolving and changing." That's fine even though she's really into me, so I don't know what. I don't know if she's just scared to get serious with someone again so she says stuff like that. Whatever. But either way, that's just the reality. [00:18:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're aware on one level of this feeling that maybe it wouldn't be a permanent thing for her. Would she be?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Permanent? She's been more into it than I have in a way, but when we talk she just really puts down—she doesn't put down marriage, she just feels like it's an outdated kind of thing and people are not facing, not reality, but things change and people fall in and out of love or whatever. They stop understanding each other so this whole marriage thing just makes it more difficult. Theoretically, I kind of agree with all of that. I kind of don't see why you can't just live with someone as partners and just have a great life, but there's just something—yoga . . . I don't know. [00:19:43] There's just (chuckles) something about her that I just feel like . . . I can't explain it. And, yet, I think she definitely wants to date me. I don't think it's like she's seeing other people, I just think between her age and some of that stuff she says, I don't really know, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds as though she's been more into you than the reverse.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was more into her in the beginning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was more equal. It's not that I'm not into it now, it's just . . . I don't know. There's just something . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you're also thinking about she's 44. You want to have a family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe in the back of my mind. She's really attractive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to have kids, or a kid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, man. Sure, man. I'd be a great dad. [00:20:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think I've ever heard you say it quite so clearly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never really thought about it until recently. It came up and it was the first time I've actually thought . . . I was like, "Wow. I guess it hasn't been important, otherwise I could have been married five or six times by now." I had many chances, but I guess kids or marriage hasn't been that important. (sniggers) Marriage still kind of isn't. I think it's a window, even for dudes. I think it would be more work, you get more tired. In the next five years it would be kind of cool. I won't be devastated if it doesn't because, like I said, with dudes it can happen anytime; but it is making me think about who I might really get into. (pause) [00:22:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Getting married, having a child, those are other commitments.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those are things you have more room for, to contemplate in a good way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like there's this sort of opening up of thinking about the future in a longer way. It doesn't sound like—it's so different from "I might die tomorrow".</p>

<p>CLIENT: The difference now is that there can be a future. In the past, I was like day-to-day hanging on. You can't foresee anything, but that's neither here nor there. You can still hope for things, you think about things, whatever. Even the science girl, too. She's a little chunky, she's really pretty but she's a little chunky. She's a little reserved. Even though I think she's really into me, but there's something that's kind of . . . but it's not me. I like her. She's nice and whatever, but . . . So in a way it feels good to wiggle. If they want to hang out, whatever, fine, but I'm not going to be heartbroken. (pause) [00:24:24] I'll probably just be honest with the yoga girl. I'll just be like, "You know, I want to hang out. I'm just kind of . . ." Maybe it's because it's Saturday. It's like it's date night or something. Sometimes I don't like that. I've noticed I like dates on weeknights. Weekends I feel like I just want to be free and just be able to do my own thing, hang out with my own friends or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Unless you don't, one day. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course. I was like that with Lily a little bit on the weekends. We'd hang out sometimes, you know. If I'm really into . . . then it's the opposite, of course. I want them to hang out with me and my friends. That's the thing—I know Suzanne, the yoga girl, could. Suzanne's cool. I like her style, the way she looks and all that. She's very fun to talk to, but it's misleading, kind of. [00:25:47] (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're worried about leading her on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though . . . I know . . . girls . . . even these . . . evolved . . . and whatever . . . totally . . . she's very . . . but she's not. That's nonsense. She's into it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said you were worried about leading her on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, even she's going to feel like, "What?" If I don't see her, it will seem like—whatever. But then if it's like Saturday night and we're going out, we're hanging out, we're dating, we're sleeping together, she's not going to be like, "Oh, yeah. Whatever. Let's see what happens." She's playing that card, but I know that that's not . . . she's a warm person. I think she would like to be in a good relationship. (chuckles) It's just her defense mechanism. She had a shitty divorce. [00:27:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said you were into her; it felt mutual in the beginning. Do you know what changed for you or when it changed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it was the age thing. The age thing, some of these things that she says.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About marriage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Relationships, marriage. But also I think I started thinking, "She's into this. I'm into it, but I'm into it because of the sex and because I like talking to her. She's a good person." You know what I mean? I think I'm trying to be a better—I don't want to lead her on or make a mess out of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting, though, because you're also adding that a couple of the things that made you pull back were her age and her attitude towards marriage, which are both about "this wouldn't work as a long-term relationship", so that there's . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's a good thing, right? (chuckles) [00:28:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, but it also sounds like you're protecting yourself, too, in a way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think what happened was, also, it could be that she was this chick that I'd seen at the store that I was smitten with, who I thought, at first, was maybe a little snooty. I couldn't tell. She came onto me months later when I saw her, so how could I not be? Initially I was, and I still am. I still think it's so cool that we ended up actually hooking up and that she's awesome. Maybe I just don't want to waste time anymore, too. Even sex, man, it's great, but like I said, I can just have a Big Mac and watch The Office. I have a really high sex drive but I've learned now that it's transient. What does that mean? It's fun but it gets messy, so maybe I'm just more now into protecting—I just want to spend my time better. For whatever reason, I feel like maybe it's just healthier staying home (chuckles). [00:29:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like we're trying to sort through how much is there the theme of someone who is nice to me, who is good for me and no longer interested in so you pull back; how much is you actually realizing you want to get married maybe or have children and that won't work with her.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not even that. Do you realize I've not had a normal girlfriend? Okay, Lily, I guess, but when I say normal what I mean is anywhere in the parameters of what I'd really like. Yeah, Lily was cool but she was a little chunky—even that, she was so pretty. The way she dressed and there was something all college-y about her still. I want a girl that just lives around here who—I don't know. I'm not explaining it well, but I just have not had a normal situation, someone who's not too young or too old. We just fucking hang out; it's steady; you get to know each other. I haven't had that. It's amazing to me. It's a true sign of a fucked-up pattern. Maybe that's what it is. Now I'm just like "Ehh. Yep. Sex. Whatever. Awesome," but that's not going to work after a few weeks. Unless you just want to hook up and you're okay with that, but I'm not going to plan Saturday night dates. I get more out of being with my friends. [00:31:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would she, the yoga—you're calling her the yoga chick. (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Suzanne.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Suzanne, would she fall in the category of normal? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the thing about her. Other than the age and some of this kind of, not hippy-dippy, but whatever this evolving shit is. Has her own place, very cute, cool apartment, she's pretty, dresses pretty much the way I like, she's super into me, she's thin. She's obviously healthy because she's a yoga instructor. She cares about her friends and family and stuff. Everything else is there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just her age?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The age and I don't know if she would even, if I wanted to take it to the next level, I wonder if then she might . . . it's like, "I'm so into you," and blah, blah, blah; but what does that mean? She's the type that would be, "What does that mean, boyfriend and girlfriend?" Things mean things. In relationships a lot of times we'll talk about stuff and she'll be like, "What is money?" Well, money is paper that we give a lot of volume to (chuckles), whether we should or we shouldn't, but we do. (chuckles) She does a lot of that. [00:33:15] It doesn't mean that she's irresponsible. She's very responsible. Justine goes a little like that, too, but in a different way. She would also say the opposite. She would question what I'm saying. Dude, I'm not an idiot. I don't mind some disagreement, but when it's often I'm like "What is freedom? What does it mean to be free? It's like fuck me. I know that sounds weird because I'm so contemplative (chuckles) that I think about things a lot, but not when I socialize. I'm just like okay, Abby just said something that I fucking completely disagree with, but I'll smile, nod and get you another drink. Who the fuck cares. So between that and the whole—I don't know what her ideas are about relationship ultimately, so . . . [00:34:16] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's interesting to hear the things you're describing get to you as kind of both being really challenging "what does that really mean?" because, in a way, that does sound like something you do, per se; and not conforming to clichés which is also something you've talked about being pretty important to you at times. So maybe there's something that feels right now like "that doesn't work as much."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I need something between Suzanne and Lily, a totally, kind of pretty college girl that would do anything for me, has a couple of roommates (chuckles), dresses kind of girly and not very interesting—very hot, but not very interesting—and then (laughs) someone who's been through divorce, is kind of out there, evolving, doing yoga shit, has some funky friends and wacky friends. None of that's bad, it's just . . . I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said that about the yoga, that that somehow fit into . . . something about the yoga . . . [00:35:38]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all about bettering yourself, evolving and all this shit which, clearly, I'm here. That's important, but when I'm out and about I rein that shit in. I don't talk about it. [00:35:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not where you live.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I do talk about it, but I do talk about it in a . . . for example, if she tells me about her money problems I don't say things like, "What's money?" I say positive things or I'll just joke like, "Fuck money." I'll say sarcastic things or I'll just be very genuine and tell her about my experiences. But there's something about, "What does marriage mean, anyway?" I don't know what those questions mean anyway. That's like saying, "What's that recorder? What is this tissue?" They are what they are. We've come up with words over thousands of years to name things. Those are questions that just go in circles. It's not a big deal. There's something about that that I find a little annoying, I guess. [00:36:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something you're describing on the one hand someone being tied to reality and conformity and unquestioning and, on the other hand, someone being kind of lost in fantasies without any grounding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing, she's grounded. She pays her bills, she has her car, she has her own apartment, she has a job. It's just maybe, yeah, she got divorced maybe three years ago. I think she's in a process and I think that was her one and only hard-core, serious thing, so I just feel like I need to be cautious about that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She may be feeling jaded or hurt or wounded by that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think she's done well to not be jaded because it was her call to get divorced, but I think it's brought up things about what did that even mean? What is marriage? And I'm sure it's hard. She knows her age and she's cool with it, I'm sure. But I think any woman—I don't care how evolved you are—thinks about kids. Even if they decide they're not going to have kids, that's got to be a big deal. So I think there are just a lot of things that I don't even know. (long pause) [00:39:19] There's this girl that wants to come over tomorrow, and that's easier for me because she has a kid, she lives an hour from here; and I like her, but it's definitely just about having sex and hanging out. That's just defined. (laughs) It's like, "Okay, we like each other, but we know what's what." Then I feel like I'm not toying with someone and it doesn't feel messy. It just feels like, "Okay . . ."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's not as much potential for hurting her or being hurt. It's just clear what it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I could just talk to Suzanne and be like, "Look, I don't know what I'm feeling or thinking but . . ." (pause) [00:40:34]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So next week? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Thursday, 12:50. Thanks. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You, too.</p>

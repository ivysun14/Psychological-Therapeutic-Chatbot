<p><b>Jon Carlson Interview regarding Client SM</b></p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Can you please describe your approach to therapy for our readers?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> I use an integrative approach to helping based upon the theory of Alfred Adler’s Individual Psychology. These theoretical ideas allow me to focus on the strengths of each client and to help them to develop the courage needed to bring more satisfaction into their lives. I often find myself helping the client or giving permission to the client to continue to do the types of things they are already doing. This often involves helping the client become more present and aware of what they are doing, thinking and feeling. I place a premium on satisfying relationships especially with the key people in the client’s life.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b> Will you provide a brief description of your training and background? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> My formal education includes two earned doctoral degrees. One degree was in counseling and the other in clinical psychology. I also have a Certificate in Psychotherapy which is the Adlerian equivalent of psychoanalytic training. My informal training comes from developing over 300 training tapes with the leading psychotherapists where they worked live with actual clients. By watching and discussing the multiple sessions that each expert conducted I was able to indirectly hone my own skills in assessment and intervention.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you describe the client and the surrounding issues/challenges for our readers? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The client was six feet and six inches tall with muscles rippling against the material of his tee shirt. His head was shaved and he had hoop earrings in each ear, and he was also covered with tattoos. He began the session by asking if I remembered him. I responded that his name seemed familiar but I ido not remember seeing anyone like him other than maybe on television. He laughed and indicated that he saw me when he was 5 or 6 and again at 16 when his parents were going through divorce. He reported that he was now 28 years old and again living with his father. He elaborated that he had been involved with many criminal activities and had been charged and convicted for burglary, assault, disorderly conduct, and battery and was now out of prison and on probation for the next two years. His probation officer wanted him to seek therapy and work on some of his issues. Most pressing seems to be that since he is now a felon it is hard for him to find any good jobs. He needs a good job to make the money to move out of his father’s house and create a more fulfilling lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  What was your goal or hope for the sessions? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The goal was to help SM create the life he always had hoped to live. He reported that he had been a good athlete and student in high school until things got really crazy at home. It was then that he started hanging with the wrong crowd and ended up becoming someone he really didn’t like. He had hoped to go to school, play college sports, get a good job and raise a family. He wanted to get back on that path if it was possible</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  When do you know if therapy is successful? Is there a typical number of sessions? How did you feel about the sessions?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> Success comes in many packages for me. Therapy can be successful if I feel a collaborative relationship with the client. Sometimes I feel success when I help the client achieve a goal that they have set. While other times therapy is successful if I just honor and accept the client and their story. In SM’s case it was important for me to be his friend and to show him that I cared for him and thought he could get his life back on track. If I believed in him, he could start to believe in himself.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you point to the successes/breakthroughs, as well as any bumps in the road?  </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The simple fact that SM continued treatment and followed through on any suggestions were to me significant breakthroughs in the therapy. This showed me that a positive treatment alliance had been created. SM had a history of few if any positive relationship connections. Other successes were that he was able to get a good job and that he met an older woman who had a positive influence on him.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Can you provide a context for the therapy? Where did the session take place and how the client was assigned to your care? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> The sessions took place in an outpatient mental health clinic in southern Wisconsin. The client was mandated to therapy by his probation officer and choose this therapist because he had worked with him when he was a child.</p>

<p><b>ASP:</b>  Anything else you would like the readers to know about you or these sessions?</p>

<p><b>Dr. Carlson:</b> These sessions show that looks can be deceptive. That underneath this scary exterior or outward appearance was a young man who wanted the same thing as anyone else. Somewhere along the way he lost his way and no one got close enough to help him find the path back. The treatment alliance can be such a healing force in situation like this.</p>

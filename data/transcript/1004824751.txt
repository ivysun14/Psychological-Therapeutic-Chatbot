<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Went to get a sandwich. [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He goes there, too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He goes there, too? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, he loves the sandwiches there, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's not—he doesn't really eat enough, like he doesn't—he sort of like stressed and scattered, so, once in a while, he just runs over there. [Sighs] So the Kickstart campaign ended...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And... [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Pauses for suspense] Raised $5,000. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Woooow, ohhh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A hundred and eleven percent funded. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wooow, that's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, but I kind of couldn't believe it. I mean—so other than my mom's little help, I mean—so, I mean, you know, they take a cu—you know, we should be getting somewhere around $3,800, something like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Unbelievable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, thank you. Yeah, [pauses] I couldn't—and it was like a day early. [00:01:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so on Friday afternoon—it hit, like, $4,550 or something like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it was actually—I've got to say, of all people, Michelle...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So then people kept—it just—you know, it started avalanching after, like, when—once people saw that, "Oh, my God, this might..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, so, at Kickstarter, they're smart, man. That's a lot of what they had said. They had said that, last week, people usually—because they put—in the beginning, they put, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to chip into that," and then they put it off, you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, also, when they see that things are happening, people get excited, and they—you know, then it just kind of starts snowballing a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but then—yeah, on Saturday, like just two or three hours before the deadline, um, Michelle chipped in, like, almost 200 bucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it is too much. She's like, "Ah, I wanted to make it a perfect 5,000." She's, like, "And I'm so, like, happy and excited for you." [00:02:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How lovely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was really nice. I mean, it is a little bit mixed. I mean, you know, it kind of made me miss her or think about her, or whatever, you know, but, yeah, very, very nice—very nice. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, I'm still kind of [chuckles] processing, decompressing, sleeping...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, kind of nervous because, now, it is like, "Well, [pauses] yet another thing that I set my mind to, that I did."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, on the one hand, I'm so proud; on the other hand, it just—it just makes me nervous 'cause I just feel like—wow—it just seems like, when I really put my mind to something and I believe in it... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And you work really hard...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I work really hard, yeah, it just tends to happen. And I've—I don't think I've worked harder on anything than my music. You know? [00:03:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [clucks] I don't know. So it gets a little scary. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is so different than it being in the hands of fate, whether you succeed or fail. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah—oh, yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is more of a feeling of it is in your hands.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, yep. And even though we got to 5,000, I don't feel like, "Oh, it is just because these people helped me." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I—I willed this to happen. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just—you know, the music speaks for itself, but I fucking willed this. You know, I got it to work. So I'm not—I'm not shying away when I talk to people, but I do—I worked my ass off... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, like videos, fucking hours and hours of Twittering and—what—Facebooking, and talking to strangers, and I don't know what the fuck. So [shifts in seat] yeah, I mean, that—that feels good. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I—in other words, yeah, like you said, I don't feel like it is just like, "Oh, these people just happened to suddenly want to help me." You know? Um, [pauses] but, um, yeah. So I kind of can't believe it; I'm just like, "What the fuck?" [00:04:07] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, now, what I'm excited about is—hopefully, we don't have to do this again...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, you know, it does get easier once you become known. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Once this record is out, promotion, more followers, more—the next time I want to raise, like, three grand or four—you know, like, I think it is not [chuckles] going to be much of a problem. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? 'Cause this was a combination of mostly friends, but, you know, a fair amount of people I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that'll start shifting as we get fans that you don't know. You know? I don't know, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean, hopefully, we won't have to do that, but, um, I just feel like, "Wow." I mean, if I was able to do this, and many people don't even know who I am, that's—I'm pretty psyched, so yeah. [taps something] [00:05:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, another way of putting, metaphorically, what you're talking about—you're talking about in the concrete of being able to do this same kind of thing again, but that, to feel like, if you work really hard at something, that because of both your talent and your hard work, that it would most of the time succeed...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Kind of opens up the future of things you could go and work hard at, and make yours if...</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Yeah. You mean—no, it is the idea that this could be applied to anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could be that there's more in your hand. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But I think it is particularly—but I think it is more interesting that it is about music, because it just goes to show you that you've got to just do what you're good at. I mean, it is something, deep down, I've always kind of known. It is just—so, in a way, it is bittersweet in a weird way 'cause it is like... [00:06:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Well, I wasn't working less hard on my songs before; I was just keeping it to myself, and things were happening half-ass because I kept getting sidetracked...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...By, "What does my family think?" Pressure, shyness, being negative or whatever, or just being withdrawn about that stuff, not owning up to my own talent, and being proud—like, genuinely confident, and—you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, um, so [pauses]—yeah. [Claps hand once] Whereas, all the other stuff I've tried, it wasn't because I really—I didn't really care enough to get it done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Um, [pauses]—you know, the book got done because that poetry and music are the two things that matter to me, so [claps hand once]—but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:06:59] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, yeah, I'm psyched. I mean [pauses]—and, now, I'm already like—and I haven't even really taken a break. I mean, obviously, I feel much more rested and decompressed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, now, it is all about, like, what is the best way to manufacture the CDs and distribution, and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...You know, 'cause it is a chunk of money, but it is not that—you know, I mean, like I'm going to be very careful about how it is spent. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but, yeah. [Taps an object] [Pauses] Crazy. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for 14 seconds as CLIENT fidgets with what sounds like a ball]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the one thing, though, I've been—I mean, I think this is normal and it is to be expected—now, I feel restless. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was such a—this was such a month of high intensity, and there is something about, like, you know, you get to e—every time someone chips in, you get an e-mail. [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There's something about that, you start 30 days of that. You know? So, now—like, yesterday, I was, like, just kind of restless and not sleepy, and... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...'Cause it is like, "All right, well, I did that," so [chuckles] that's like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Now, I'm just suddenly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Um, so I think that that's why, now, I'm making sure I—like, now, like planning shows, contacting people, still promoting, still networking...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Festivals. You know—I don't know—like there are just a lot of different things we should be researching, like the best way to make T-shirts that are cost-effective. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so... [pauses] yeah. [Pauses for 16 seconds] [00:09:00]</p>

<p>It was cool, too, because a couple of people on Twitter [slaps hands in lap]—uh, were, like—congratulated me or whatever, and then some other people commented on those, and I was like, "How did I not know this was happening? I would have checked—like how did I not —?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was kind of cool that they're, like—you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That they would...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and that—that goes—sure, so next, as our reach gets bigger, you know, more fans than not... [pauses]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah, so it has been good. Um, [pauses] [exhales]—[pauses for 15 seconds] and I haven't been too focused on Gwen. [00:10:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm kind of actually pulling back a little bit. She's been a little quiet? I don't know. I can't—I'm sure it is just work or whatever. I mean, she's—we text, but something seems a little—whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I can't tell because she's, like, "Oh, I definitely want to get to—yeah, get together Wednesday or whatever," and, yeah—so—but I—I'm just kind of like... [slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, just playing it kind of [pauses]—not even to be a game, just I don't want to get too—overly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, plus, also, 'cause I have, like, other dates that might be really cool, so I'm like, "You know what? I'm just not going to worry about it"...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which, I think, is good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is not totally clear, though, what you're feelings for her are. Does it feel like...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] I mean, I think I'm really, really into her; I just—I do feel like she's... [pauses] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's going back some. [00:11:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I can't tell. I mean, texting is so weird. I mean, I can't tell, but, yeah, I just feel a little bit—I just can't read it that well. Like, I feel like—sometimes, she won't get back to me for a few hours, and she does, but it is not—like, yesterday, she was like, "Oh, I definitely want to get together," like, we can get together Wed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you know, so, I mean, it is nothing bad, it is just [pauses]—you know, I tend to be pretty flirty or more open in my texting, and maybe she's not like that? I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But—[clears throat] yeah, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was she in the beginning? [inaudible at 00:11:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, I can't tell. Yeah, I feel—I feel like it was a little more something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel like there was a little more [pauses]—I don't know. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But [pauses]—um, but if we hang out Wednesday, I'll probably ask, you know, just 'cause, if we're going to do it that way, let's do it that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just going to be like, you know, "Is everything cool or whatever?" [Slaps hands in lap] Yeah. [Sniffles]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>[Silence for eight seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Meanwhile, the 16 year-old [taps object]—this shit is kind of unbelievable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, she—she's pretty fucking mature for—for [chuckles] her age. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She hates high school. All her classes are, like, college AP. She's, like, really sharp. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's, like, really good friends with some of her teachers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, she's like—she's like, "All my friends are older or whatever. I just don't get along with these high school people." [Sound of fidgeting]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She, like, did all this research, and she's, like, telling me that, "Look, we're not doing anything wrong. Like, I'm not sending you, like, dirty pictures. You're not—we're not doing anything like lascivious." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like, "No, I just want to kind of just sext with you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is like I don't—she's not doing—we're not actually doing anything, just some dirty texts. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like—she's, like, all the guys I've dated have been older than 18. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like—she's like, "You're not -"—you know, she's like, "I really like you, and—you know, and it is not like some weird, you know -" [Slaps hands in lap] [Sighs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Mumbles] I don't know. [Taps object] So she's kind of wearing me down. I've got to be honest with you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, I—I kind of—the only person I've told is Dave.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, he gave me a high-five first...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, um, he was like, "Dude, not -"—he's like, [stutters] "D-d-d-did (ph) you say?" [Chuckles] He was like, "That's pretty awesome." Plus, he said something I couldn't believe, though; I hadn't thought about it—he said, "Well, dude, how do you —?"—he's like, "You're doing the right thing." He's like, "You're, you know, kind of playing into it, but you're not—you know"—he's like, "I don't know about that because, yeah, I don't know what I would do, either, you know, in that situation." [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Especially because we're not assholes, and we're not perverts. Like, if someone is mature, and they're just genuinely cool and nice, and you actually like them, you know, he's like, "That's a very different thing." You know? "And you're being pursued; you're not—you didn't—you know."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But he's like—plus, he's like, "How the hell do you know? Maybe you're going to marry this chick."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He was like, "You don't know." He's like, "What if this is someone you really like, and, in a couple of years, you know, you guys have this great friendship; you're flirty, whatever, whatever?" He's like, "You know, you just -"—like I—he's like, "I don't—who knows about these things?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is just you never know if shit's—is it unusual? Yeah, it is a little bit unusual, but it is like, "At the end of the day," he's like, "look around you, all the shit people are doing." Like—I hadn't thought of it that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It is freak—this is like so out of the blue. And I told her, too. I was like, "I [slaps hands in lap] -"—'cause she—now it is really sounding like she's older than me, in the texts. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She'll be like, you know—she'll be like, "Seriously, it is like you..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."It is like you're being really paranoid. Like, you're not—you're a good guy. You're not doing anything wrong. We're not..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like it is really—you know what I mean?—and I'm—I just keep, like, "Hahaha." And I'm, like, I don't—I just... [inhales]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She's good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Well, she's good, but, also, I don't—you know, she's not—it is not some kind of weird manipulation. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's a good person. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not saying she's some, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Like, I think she's a genuinely good person. You know what I mean? It is not some kind of—because if it was just a manipulation thing, what—I—I mean, there—there are plenty of dudes in her area. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, they—there's no reason to [pauses] [slaps hands in lap] make all that effort and, you know, whatever. [00:16:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, [pauses] [inhales] um, yeah, it is weird. [Sound of something dropping] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Anyway. And I told her—I was like, "I've never been in this situation, so I don't—I just don't know how I feel about this." And, you know, "You're awesome; I just -"—[pauses] She's, like, "I researched it. There's nothing illegal about it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like, "You know, whatever." I'm like, "Dah, I just..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sound of putting an object down] [Pauses for six seconds] Well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that—I think it doesn't have to be that it is either genuine or a manipulation; it is like this is sort of a black-and-white dichotomy of choices. I wonder if there's something in the middle that includes genuineness of a particular kind of attraction to you, of fun, like that—a real part of that and something in her that means that she's friends with her teachers, or always dating people who are older than 18. [00:17:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: One is that, in her...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I thought of that, too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Sort of a boundary between...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Older and younger is—constantly gets blurred. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I thought of that, too. And that's one of two things or a combination of two things—one, she has got issues. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Two, she just is mature, and [clears throat] she comes across that way...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And there you have it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, when I was—when I was 16, all my friends were older. [Clears throat]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If I was like—I mean, she has confidence. You know what I mean? If I had the confidence, I probably would have dated older chicks. I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wasn't—I didn't get along with anybody my age. You know, and I'm sitting here reading fucking Camus (ph) and writing songs, and there's just nothing.[00:18:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I hated high school. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Some of it could just be—well... [Clucks] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and some of it, yeah, a combination of some kind of—I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, they—and they can go hand in hand. Sometimes...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I guess they should be, but doesn't everyone have that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, she could be 20 or 30, [pauses] or 40, and it is like who—I don't know [slaps hands in lap] how I'm choosing people. I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Things I—some of it is genuine; some of it is who-the-fuck-knows; some of it is, um, [pauses] [sounds of fidgeting]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it is true. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just is—you want to understand what Gwen was all about and what she was really looking for... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And [what you think it isn't] (ph). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a way it isn't different from...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...What's anybody really finding another person for?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right, yeah. But, that being said, I know what you mean, though, because this is definitely more—I mean, if nothing else, the other thing I thought is—let—I mean, I'm sure all of this would be fine if I totally indulged her. [00:19:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The more I'm thinking about it, like I—the shit that's happening out there...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I do—I feel like, wow, this is really revealing my—I guess, my conscience, which is great...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But also that I really am kind of naïve about—like, I just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm very good-hearted—you know?—and I just can't...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Clucks] ...You know. [Pauses] I think other people are very dubious (ph). You know, like, "Look at that girl. She's a hot 16 year-old chick. Fuck yeah!" You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm sure that shit happens all the fucking time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Especially as the generations have changed so much. I think people, [pauses] like, even just a few years younger, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, this is a different world. Like, they are so—I mean, you know, I talk about this with my friends. Even my friends who are, like, 30, even in their late twenties, it is like, "We were naïve, naïve innocents in high school." [00:20:02] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, there is—it is unbelievable now. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, [pauses] what was I going to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What was I going to say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. I don't know what the "but" was. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, son of a bitch. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is really your thing. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was getting all worked up. [Slaps hands in lap, begins drumming fingers on surface]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Drums fingers on surface] From naïve to—oh, Mike! </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, at the end of the day, I'm sure all of [chuckles] this would be just a fun time, whatever. Who cares?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, he's my best—I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: 'Cause, like, let's say...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the relation to Mike?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Her uncle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Her uncle's daughter. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, her uncle—Mike is her uncle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Is her uncle. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—because, I mean, let's say, you know, in a year or two, whatever, and we're like, "Wow, we really like each other and, you know, maybe we're going to try to hang out a little bit and just—you know, whatever—and see what happens." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] How the fuck would I—you know? That's a tough one. [00:21:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it is another added layer of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it is just—I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It being complicated. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, on the one hand, Mike would be, like, "Well, I mean, [pauses] this guy is my best friend. I know he would never do anything disrespectful or whatever." You know? But, at the same time, he—you know, he could also be like, "Dude, of anybody yet —-?" [Chuckles] Like, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know. [Stay out of there] (ph). I think that's—of all—more than anything else, I'm realizing that's actually the biggest...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That would be the biggest concern. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Pauses] It is—there are issues enough in somebody without all of this, [where you just met someone else] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And they are adding a layer of an age difference, a legal age difference, and being the niece of someone... [00:22:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...You are very, very close to, which makes it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is like with other layers of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Is this worth it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's why I like Dave. [Chuckles] Dave is so, like, a pragmatic about everything. He's like, "Dude, you're doing the right thing. Just, you know, when you guys are being friends, you genuinely hit it off with her. She seems like a nice person..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."And she clearly really likes you. You know, like, and she's not just sending you dirty texts if you're talking about things." You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it is just like, "You know, just go with it. Just don't—you know, don't get ridiculous. You know, just kind of have your boundary—you know?—and then just see what happens down the road. You know?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "It is not—you know -"—he is like, "Trust me, dude, if you or I were other guys, they'd already have gone to see her for the weekend." You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like, "Trust me." He's like, "Don't..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He would?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You think he would have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mike—or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no, Dave. Dave was saying that. [00:23:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Trust me, if it wasn't you or me, if it was other kinds of guys..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, he's—Dave is saying—[was trying to say] (ph)...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, in general. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...He wouldn't do that, but other guys, in general. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, he's saying that you—me and him—he's saying, "Dude, trust me, you and me are like a ..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "You know, others guys are [chuckles]—you know, they'd fly her down here." You know? So he's like, "Just [slaps hands in lap] you've made a friend, you know, and it is kind of hot, but it is also kind of cute and, you know, she's just a nice person." [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So fuck it. So you know your boundaries, and... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? [Pauses] Um, [drums fingers on surface] I was a little bummed—maybe that's the thing with Gwen—I was a little—I don't know, but this just popped in my head...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of bummed [slaps hands in lap] but, you know, it is a big deal, this Kickstarter thing. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, it is a really big deal, and I'm wondering if part of the reason I feel kind of restless. You know, it is like there is just kind no one to celebrate it with. [00:24:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I think that made me sad a little bit. I was like, Wow, man, yeah, a lot of people are like, "I'm so proud of you, so happy for you," but there's no one to, you know—it is a bit of a bummer. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like Gwen didn't react quite—she was really excited, but—ah—I don't think she got how big of a deal this is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. [Sniffles] [Pauses] Whereas—whereas, this girl was like, "Oh, my G -"—I didn't even say anything. She's like, "Oh, my God, I checked. You did it." Like, "I'm so excited for you." She's like, "That's unbelievable." She's like, "That's so freaking cool, and, you know, you made it happen, and you can relax now." It is like totally un—you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Just nice. You know what I mean? So I don't know. I just started—that bothers me a little bit, when people don't go out of their way a little bit to inquire about... [00:25:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. Um, like, I kind of had to send Gwen the videos I made. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, she wasn't like, "Ah, I really want to hear your music or see your -" bah-bah-bah. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I gave her my book, and she made one comment, but it—like, you know? I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I don't want to be, like, narcissistic about it, but I just [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something missing in the genuineness of her being excited for the things you're excited for. It is not quite to the level it feels like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, again, I could be misreading. You know, I mean, maybe in person it is going to be different—I don't know—but it is just like, "Ahh."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[00:26:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 16 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Disappointing. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a little bit. I mean, [pauses]—like, for example, just a little thing, but I had to be the one to be, like, "You know, I really want to celebrate with you."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what I mean? Now, if you had—if you, whoever I'm dating—if you had—or even if we weren't dating, for you to call and say, "I just won the, you know, [slaps hands in lap] Rocket Science Award for Psychology," or [chuckles] whatever, you know, you wouldn't have to say anything; I'd be like, "Oh, man, drinks are on me. Like, we're going to go and grab a drink." That's just a no-brainer to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, someone you care about did something amazing. Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't know. I just never get people who aren't like that. I don't—I don't understand that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Almost a feeling that—[pauses] I mean, we don't know yet. It is vague over texts, but there is something about is she not stepping quite outside herself enough to get—to get how important this is and was to you. [00:27:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How exciting it is. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I wonder, is that she is kind of—she's seems—maybe she's really wrapped up in this job thing and being stressed and tired, and kind of figuring things out in her life that, yeah, it is just kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like not quite the space to think about just sort of...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, to think things—right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Really empathizing, "Wow, this is a big deal."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, "We should celebrate" is a way of recognizing what a big deal something is to another person.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, that's right, yeah. Yeah, exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that worries me because, if that's a sign, that's exactly what I don't want. I don't want that again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I've—see, I've been down this road, where it is like I'm somehow listening to them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of—you know what I mean? Like it is—I don't want that anymore. It is like I've got shit going on, too, and a lot of important shit, so it has got to be someone that can really stop and really, like, [slaps hands in lap] give their all. You know? [00:28:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pay attention to you, to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the way I do for others even when I'm stressed, even when I'm—have already—even when I'm not interested, you know, I fucking make effort. You know? It is just a—if nothing else, it is the polite thing to do. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for 13 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You—when you say "been down that road before," who do you associate that pattern with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Michelle, Meredith—you know, where they just can't get out of their own fucking craziness.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It wasn't that way with Julia, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, it was a little bit. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But a bit more Germanic and [chuckles] contained. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, she had her shit together. It wasn't—you know—but, yeah—but that was a different kind of—you know... [00:29:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She just couldn't show genuine passion and warmth, and—you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses] but—I mean, Julia is actually more like Samantha, when I think about it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know, the surface is all really put together really well...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But there's just something. There was just something icy, kind of, on some level that was just her. You know? It is just her not dealing or not whatever. I don't know what it is. But, with both Meredith and Michelle, the things were there, like the—much more warmth and whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, yeah, just between Michelle's constantly moving and not knowing what she's doing, and the little kid, and always being broke... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And a little bit manic and all that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And then Meredith with the eating thing, and the body issues, and [slaps hands in lap] it was just like, "Come on, dude." You know? [00:30:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, Gwen is not like that, but it doesn't matter to me anymore if they're kind of like that or not like that; I don't want anything to do with it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I just don't. [Slaps hands in lap] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did for a while, though, that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, fan (ph) yourself for staying, in these relationships, I never quite heard you articulate on where you are now that you're aware of how much it was about them... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Most of the time... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Absolutely. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...And how unseen you and your life were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I was—I mean, what were those relationships? I saw a beautiful chick...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And, somehow, I got her. That's all it was. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Once I was in it—pffftt—it was just a free-for-all. I mean, the—from the get-go, I was at a disadvantage because they—you know, I just thought of them as these perfect—just, I got this really hot chick that fit some kind of criteria. You know? [00:31:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that means nothing. That has nothing to do with who they are; they're fucking nut jobs. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, yeah, everything was about them and their weird—you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Meredith comes all the way to England and then gets depressed, gets into a funk, and there's no—it is like, "Dude, you know what? Go back to Australia." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, you can't—you can't, on the one hand, move all the way across the world for somebody, and then get there and just withdraw. You know, at least be—I mean, I'm not one to talk—beat depressed if you want to be, but try not to project or be depressed, but reach out and make me part of it, and, you know, let's be depressed together. I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But you can't—this kind of weird distancing or whatever the fuck it is, I guess—there's not time for that. You know? [00:32:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and the same with Michelle. It is like, yeah, that was much more warm and passionate, but it was just manic and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like, you know, mood swings and whatever the fuck. Like, just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like always being late an hour or two hours, three hours. Like—so [pauses] it just... [exhales]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a while, those relationships worked because you'd found someone who mirrored back to you what you wanted physically. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's, in some ways, all that mattered. And, now, it is starting to sound like, well, these other parts of who a person is are mattering a lot more... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Even if it may be in addition to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I still like what I like, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But now I can [pauses]—I'm not mesmerized, or I'm not hypnotized. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what it was; I was just hypnotized. You know? Um, now, it is like, "OK, yeah, that chick is -"—you know, I kind of don't care. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, if I meet her and she's—if we start talking, and she's amazing, well, that's awesome, but I'm not...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But so what? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, who the fuck cares?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's just the surface. That's just a start. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Who cares? Yeah, I don't care. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not to mention, I've somehow gotten really good at—like, if I'm somewhere and I just see someone like that, I immediately just think of them, like, in bed with me or in the morning, or whatever, and I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ..."You know what? There is probably something about them that is so fucking normal and mundane, and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] ...So imperfect that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...That, like, it immediately diffuses any initial, like, "Oh, shit." You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just immediately think of that, and I'm like, "Yeah, whatever. They're a person." You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, [pauses] so.... [00:33:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if, also, part of what you're doing, psychically in imagining the morning after, is kind of getting over the hump of the thrill of getting her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's what I mean. That's what I mean. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And then you're just sent to, OK, so it is the next morning, and check that box off. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I've gotten over—I think it is out of my system now, this whole, like, "Oh, I can go somewhere and get a chick and -"—so the fuck what. Who cares? I mean I—good for you, but that's neither here nor there. What does that mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um [pauses]—yeah, so now, because I'm genuinely confident, I just feel like, "All right, if I put the effort into it, I could probably—if nothing else, I could probably go on a few dates with this girl."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But so what? Like, then, what is going to happen? You know, like [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[00:35:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 25 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, picking up on Gwen being in her own world, venting about work...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...Last week, you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...As a little red flag. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't have if she hadn't gone on and on and on and on. I mean, I literally was saying....</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's the point—she did. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she did. Yeah, and I literally said nothing. That was just like, "Uh-huh," or, "Oh, really?" I mean, it was like, "What the—wow." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I was stunned a little bit; it really caught me off guard. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I thought, "Well, these things do happen, and she's really stressed, so, obviously..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I mean, she almost—she cancelled the date a few hours earlier...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...So I was like, "You know, just let it slide. These things happen." You know. [00:36:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sound of putting an object down] I don't know. [Pauses] I had a really proud moment. Do we have time?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a really proud moment [claps hand once], and it was really fun. Saturday night, [claps hand once] I was invited to [clears throat] this little dinner party thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, there's this, like, kind of snooty, artsy, older, like, Assyrian woman. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She's, like, all like architecture, design, whatever the fuck...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And she's invited me to a couple of little get-togethers, and I've always not gone. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And this [sounds like] (ph), "Ah." Like, she chipped into the Kickstarter. You know, I was like, "Ah, yeah."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, also, I went because she invited me and my good friend—two of my good friends—and this other older lady whose husband, who's passed away, was the only guy I ever studied music with. [00:37:00] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, he was just a very inspirational...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Visiting experimental composer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They're Assyrian. Yeah, they're awesome. And she's awesome, like Alp (ph)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's my—she's like my mom's age, but she's like all feisty. She's like really intellectual and a very cool lady. So I was like, "Well, they're going to be there, so fuck it. I don't give a shit. We'll go, get some -"—you know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was awesome because we went, and I felt so comfortable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? Like it is this very posh house, kind of like a mansion or whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um—and this other—oh, this other girl was there from California, who's a poet [shifts in seat], who fucking sucks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles silently] </p>

<p>CLIENT: Her poetry sucks. She's kind of weird, whatever. They just have this, like, hoity-toity...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they're the kind of people where they'll put some music on, and you're just standing there and talking, and they'll just, like—they'll kind of start dancing a little bit, because they're just so cool and confident, and carefree and artsy or whatever the—I don't know; I just want to punch them in the face. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, anyway, so we're sitting around and we're—and I don't know how this came up, [clucks] but Alp, the older—the lady I really like, the older lady...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I guess they're all kind of the same age, more or less, but Alp is the oldest one of them...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I'm the youngest. But—so they were talking about some Assyrian artist of some fucking Assyrian documentary or something, and Alp was just like, "That was stupid. I hated that doc," or whatever...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I had this awesome moment where, because I'm so comfortable and confident now in who I am...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I was just ripping at things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "No, that's not how—that's not good poetry. That's not a good -"—whatever. And here my other two good friends were kind of trying to stick up for—it was like, "Well, sometimes -"...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I know what it was—because Alp was like, "I'm sick and tired of these fucking, 'Oh, my grandmother, you know, what's a fucking genocide,' so she's like, "What is that?" </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:38:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like, "It is really about you. It is not about your grandmother; it is about you and your fucking little story, and you wanting attention." She said, "That's -"—and, also, it does nothing about—what is it, really, that you're saying about mass trauma? You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it is that old thing about can you even have any kind of artistic representation of that kind of—is it possible? You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, at first, I was listening, and her—[mocking female voice] "Well, no, you know, I—"—and, finally...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Resenting (ph) it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we're—because they have to, because, especially, that's her poetry. It is shit. "My grandmother does the -"—you know, it is all this, like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And Alp is saying that in front of her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: About her poetry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not about her poetry...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...But, basically, might as well have been her poetry. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, at one point, she's like, [mocking female voice] "Well, but, you know, it is a way—it is accessible to people that don't know about -" bah-bah, and, suddenly, I was like, "You know what? I don't give a shit if they know or they don't know about my grandmother. That is not the point of art." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:39:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my job is not to cow-tow to douchebags who don't know history or don't know about Assyria. I was like, "I don't give a fuck. I don't give a shit about that. I care about making great art." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And Alp was like, "Yes, that's exactly what I am saying." [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It just felt so good because it was just like, "You know what? You people are just snooty douchebags." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, I was like, "Wow, I know what I'm talking about." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: In my [chuckles] mind...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I was like, "I feel completely comfortable, and I know exactly what I'm saying." I can back it up, and I have backed it up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I even said this, that I probably didn't succeed in my book, but—you know what?—I worked my ass off to try to do just that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it is just not some teary-eyed narrative about the Assyrian genocide. I said, "I really tried to keep disrupting the narrative, and I'm never specific about anything I did. There is just a general sense of catastrophe, but it is not some kind of lesson about Assyrian culture or some shit like that." [00:41:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I said I even didn't want them to write that thing on the back of the book—"One Assyrian American's -"—you know, whatever it says on the back. I was, like, "I don't want that." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just an American poet. It is just a book of poems. Maybe it is about memory, maybe it is—I don't know, but I don't like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they really tried to go for that thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, that's fine; they're a publisher, and they did that, but I was like, "I didn't even approve of that. I don't like that shit." You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But the way they capped off, we were vindicated because this idiot—fucking idiot—read us a poem. First of all, who the fuck does that? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She had the balls to, like, read us a poem that we had to sit there and listen to, while Gwen's Assyrian maid cleaned up right beh—right there in the kitchen. [Slaps hands in lap]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was unreal. It was literally—I was going to lose my fucking mind. I was like, "You fucking douches." [00:42:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, and in Assyrian. You know, she's all proud she wrote this poem in Assyrian, and it is like, "Are you fucking—this woman is washing dishes behind you because you can't do it yourself, I guess. You only had four fucking people at your house, and you dare to —?"—[sighs in exasperation] Ahhh, [shifts in seat] anyway—but that felt really good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the hypocrisy of it, you're just saying, is just outrageous. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, you might was well just chomp on a cigar and just laugh at that lady while she's—you know, why the pretense? Just fucking, you know, um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But that—I don't know—I felt like that felt really good. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, the next day, I took the high road. I went to her stupid poetry reading...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And I left. I didn't say "hi." I just stayed. I stayed in the back. I didn't even applaud. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole time, I was just texting. The minute she was done, I was out of there. I was like, "You know what? [Pauses] ..." [Sound of drinking, putting object down] [00:43:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound realistic (ph) outside and beyond of the feeling that these people were somehow above...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. It was like I want nothing to do with those people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Free (ph) was out there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I want nothing to do with them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like maybe you don't even want them to be in your life so much. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't. Yeah, that's the thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't like them that much. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. There's a reason—why that I always say "no" to her. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It could have felt like intimidation or insecurity or something like that, that actually sounds like it wasn't mostly that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Well, what also fucked it was I thought, "Well, I guess there are going to be moments where you have to do these things."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's also part of how I've gotten things done—right?—but I'm not going to go and not be myself. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If they're so interested in getting to know me, and they're so proud of me, or they're so, like, "We have to push him. He's a young -"—then they also have to deal with what I really think and—you know, so... [00:43:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. You may need to be present at things that aren't your top choice, for political reasons, but you're also saying you're not going to go there and then core yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're going to go and be you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm—I'm not going to be crazy; I'm not that kind of artist, where I'm going to make a scene, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I'm also going to take moments to fucking verbally bitch-slap if I have to. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Finding yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Finding yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So Thursday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So 3:10...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Three-ten...</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Twelve-fifty, 3:10. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Boom. It's beautiful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, you got my message—also, the twenty-sixth...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...We can find another time in midday, if you want to, if you have flexibility...</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...It is just the later afternoon that I can't do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK, sounds good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: See you Thursday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: All right, see you Thursday. [00:45:00]</p>

<p>[Sound of rising from seat and door closing] </p>

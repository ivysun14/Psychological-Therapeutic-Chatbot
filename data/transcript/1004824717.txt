<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I am doing okay, thanks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) So I am having all of these dreams because (pause)-I am remembering all of these dreams because I have stopped taking Adavan completely and the SSRI is very activating. (Pause) Like I have had this with all of them, which I wake up in the middle of the night and am completely wide awake. So I am dealing with it much better and I am sort of almost completely used to it. But as a result, the dreams are much more vivid and there are more of them and maybe the content is different from other dreams I have had in the past, but... [00:02:03]</p>

<p>There are a couple of really persistent themes. Kelly and Thomas are in almost every single dream every night. I have dreams about being at my wedding again. I have dreams about being at the lab retreat-can I turn that on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes-I'm sorry, the bulb blew in that and I have to bring in a new one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have other people asked that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At the retreat, there was a lot of drinking and my talk was the morning of the second day and the drinking all happened the night of the first day. And I was pretty torn and feeling sort of frustrated and stuck about my relationship to drinking right now on the medication and my anxiety about alcohol in general. But it was fine, I didn't drink more than I was comfortable with and I think I was uncomfortable about that because there is tons of great beer for free for like six hours. But other people drank a whole lot and it got to the point where people, including the faculty members, were just completely (pause) completely trashed. Maybe to the point where it was getting scary and it was mostly the men. They were having a great time and singing these drinking songs in Italian and then they started to sing all of these other songs. This guy, who is the-sort of the most senior researcher in the field, Kelly did her post-Doc in his lab and it is his lab that sort of started a lot of the research in this area. Anyway, he is sort of an amazing guy. He has been incredibly helpful to me over the years. He is very, very sensitive and he cares a lot about students. So he has reached out to me in many ways, including in January when I had the upsetting sort of time with Kelly. He was the first one to call my cell phone and say, "Hey, Kelly told me you guys sort of had an upsetting conversation. I'm here to talk."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. [00:05:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So James is this great guy and he has done that a couple of times before. But he was totally drunk and he was singing at the top of his lungs and I think it was a very significant thing to watch for me, somehow. So various versions of that scene come back in the dream. And in the two times that they have come back most vividly, I have been singing too and I have been sort of self-conscious about my singing. </p>

<p>(Pause) But like really excited to be signing and then the drinking has always been-the drinking up here is more-not just in the retreat setting, but in other ways. Last night's dream was me handing out little shots of bourbon to all the people in my lab. I had drank a little bit of bourbon last night and I was totally-I totally loved it. It was such a positive experience. So Thomas appears in all of these dreams and he (pause) I am sort of enjoying it. It is sort of quite a confusing and sometimes intense and sometimes totally benign thing. The first time that I have had a dream about him that I totally remember was the night that Jeremy got alcohol poisoning at this wedding in April. It was one of the sort of events that I really remember as being traumatic over the last year or so. Do you remember? [00:07:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not so well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we went to this-Mitch and Ashley's wedding. Mitch is a college buddy of Jeremy's. We all played jazz together and this was sort of a perfect storm, kind of like the retreat was for a person who is fond of drinking and doesn't have too much control. And I think Jeremy falls into that category and I have a lot of anxiety about it, partially because of this event. So it was an open bar forever, we were staying the night, Jeremy was in the wedding-it was a lot of people that we really liked and he hadn't seen them in a long time. So he drank to the point of essentially being nonresponsive and, before that, decided to do bare hand boxing with one of the other buddies, the drummer who I dated and who cheated on me. And it is all these college like things coming out. The whole thing was horrible for me actually, because I could tell after Jeremy's second drink that it was going to be a really upsetting night just from the way that he was almost-wasn't thinking at all and had two drinks in his hand by the time he had the second drink and it was like that the rest of the night. [00:09:19]</p>

<p>So that was a hard blow [inaudible [00:09:22] from a perspective that it wasn't really a great experience being at this wedding because I was sort of nagging Jeremy. I was sort of saying, "Hey, I know this doesn't really make sense to you, but I have noticed that you are kind of drinking without really pausing at all and it is making me worried." Jeremy totally was not receiving that information. He was not happy to really be hearing it and so decided to kind of ignore me and take a little bit of revenge as he described later. [00:10:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On you for saying that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, on me for intervening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So he was not responding. I probably could have called an ambulance, but he was breathing and essentially he threw up for eight hours and couldn't really move and we had to extend our-we had to miss the morning after brunch and extend our reservation and Jeremy lying on the grass for another three hours before getting into the car. It was horrible. I was sobbing, but also needed to take care of him so I was also sort of putting on-or had summoned a lot of strength, similar to the way that I had summoned strength when my Dad passed out on me. [00:10:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that night that Jeremy was throwing up, I had a dream about having sex with Thomas and it was a great dream. I told Jeremy all about it the next day and sort of maybe admitted to being attracted to Thomas in a lot of ways, but also not really being interested in him in real life. There are a lot of things about him that rub me the wrong way. He is a very A type person that I don't feel like I am a compatible match with. So-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible [00:11:38] imagine that he [inaudible [00:11:40] very good looking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, he is great looking. In a way that is like objective and subjective, obviously. But there are people that I have been attracted to in real life that I have had trouble with sort of deciding and trouble with the feelings and sort of it has passed and this is-Jeremy and I have been together for eight years, so we have handled it well and it has been things-it has happened and it has gone away and Thomas is not one of those real life attractor people. [00:12:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he is in my dreams and so all of these-so that was the first pretty intense dream and (pause) I don't know-I could describe it, but I think the important point is that essentially he (pause) is quite attracted to me in all of these dreams. So in the dreams that-in the SSRI dreams, I have never-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you remember what happened in that dream? Could you describe it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. We were in-so we work in like these spacesuits to work with tuberculosis-not all the time. I mean, all the time when we work with tuberculosis, but most of the lab work is not with TB because it is so annoying to wear these spacesuits. But we have to work in this negative pressure room with all of these laminar flow hoods and it is very tight quarters and sort of sterile and white and fluorescent lights. You can't bring anything in without autoclaving it out, so it is sort of this very visually and-it is a space that has a lot of specific visual aspects and feelings. It has kind of been my dreams before-just things happening in the BL3. So I think we were in one of the rooms of the BL3, but we were not in spacesuits, we were nearly naked and it was like a really small room, like maybe the size of a closet, but bright white fluorescent lights, nothing on the wall. And (pause) Thomas is like a really big guy and there wasn't a lot of foreplay. I was on the ground and he was standing up and then like entered me and that was dream-was actually the feeling of having sex.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:14:51]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It might have even been a wet dream-I actually don't remember now. And the things that I remember are that he-I think there was enough real life context in the dream where it was like this was being revealed-this attraction-my attraction to him and his attraction for me was being revealed in this moment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. Is he attracted to you in real life? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is married. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I guess it doesn't. So in all the SSRI dreams, though, there isn't any really sexual contact. It is more Thomas has his hand around me; Thomas has his hand on my leg. The two instances that I remember are we are all in this big band setting and Kelly is the director and Thomas is sitting on my left and Joanne is sitting on my right and somehow there is double the amount of people that there normally would be in this space, so they are both very close to me. Thomas has his hand around me and Kelly announces that for the second half of the semester, the following people are going to be cut because they didn't do enough work-and I was one of them and Joanne was one of them. [00:16:34]</p>

<p>This dream was about Thomas, but that was what was happening. What was vivid about the dream was the feeling of his hand being on my shoulder and his other hand being on my leg. It wasn't like here, it was like here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then that was it. I must have woken up or the dream must have ended. The other dream that I remember that is similar to that is that I was giving some kind of-I was performing a short story in front of thousands of people and it was going very well but there were some problems and I fixed them and there was a big applause and I had taken twice the amount of time I should have. Essentially Thomas was-Thomas and a number of other people-there are always other people in my lab and in my life in these dreams, but Thomas was waiting for me in the back and sort of said, "Great job" and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek and then asked if I wanted to go to a diner, like leave the rest of the show and go to a diner. (Pause) Yes. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>So there is this weird alcohol Thomas performance, lab, Kelly connection. I know that I have a lot of real life anxiety about Jeremy and alcohol and it doesn't come up in our normal life because he and I don't drink in situations in which it is really easy to lose control. But when he is with some of his friends from childhood-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: —some of them are pretty heavy drinkers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) And my Dad's traumatic event comes up in real life, too. I just see it. It is always there in my visual space. (Pause) I don't dream about it-or I don't remember. (Pause) I had one kind of intense and a little bit upsetting dream about kissing all of these men and (pause) yes, (pause) I think I was in my bathroom and there was this line out the door and I only remember like the physical sensation of kissing one of the men who is this recently immigrated graduate student from the third lab that was at the retreat and I have been working with him sort of closely. I am very fond of him. He sort of reminds me of my dad at the time my dad had immigrated to the U.S. and became a graduate student. In real life, I see him and I-"Oh, this is a lot like what my dad and my cousins and other people like that in my life have been through. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. [00:21:56]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But in this dream, I could see his lips and like feel them on my lips. I think I was really enjoying it. But there were all these other people in line. I didn't know who they were and soon, like, his turn was over. It was very strange. And then I woke up and thought, like, "It is over." Like I-I sort of had this really grossed out feeling which I don't have after the Thomas dreams. I really enjoy the Thomas dreams but I am a little bit bothered that they are happening in that monogamy way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause) Well there seems to be a lot going on with all of this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know! </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Chuckles]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't feel too compelled to figure it out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am curious.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't bother me-I don't feel too upset, but it does take up kind of a lot of mental energy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It is a like mental real estate? [00:23:47]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. All my life I have had vivid dreams and I think it is somewhat inherited. My dad has (pause) has had a very active dream life and describes these recurring dreams that he has had since he was six or seven that he has had throughout his life. So I have had a lot of vivid dreams before and whenever I have them it takes a couple of hours for me to get back to neutral and that is true about these. (Pause) </p>

<p>The only other time that I remember having dreams every night about the same person for weeks is when Jeremy and I spent our first summer apart, which was the first year we were dating. And like every single night for three months he would appear in these dreams. The dreams would be about him breaking up with me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And taking on this really strange role that-he doesn't have any of these personality traits in person, but he has them in the dream for some reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of relationship stuff-effects on the relationship stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I think I am pretty (pause) kind of pretty about my relationships. (Pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um (pause)-well-I have a few thoughts. It is sort of a little preemptive, but given our time constraints I will kind of guess [inaudible [00:26:26]. (Pause) I (pause) wonder if there is a bit of an association (pause) between (pause) Thomas and your dad. [Chuckles] There is a psychologist comment for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So cliché. What is your-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why do I think that could be? Because you know, for a few different reasons. I mean, one of the sort of a narratives we have talked a fair amount about is to do with you kind of moving away or feeling like you are moving away from your family-get ahead and gotten married-and so I wonder if the dreams about Thomas are, in part, expressing ambivalence or a wish to return, which is something you have been struggling with somewhat. I mean, not consciously in a sense that you really consciously want to return, but there is evidence-it is a tough loss.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it is pretty tough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you know, in a kind of initial layer is funny, like ironic, that you mention Jeremy saying he probably took revenge on you that night by drinking and paying no attention to you, because you seem to take revenge on him by dreaming about being with somebody else, which [inaudible0:29:11] Thomas is probably a reasonable choice there in a way. He is different from Jeremy, there is not just somebody else, it is somebody who is a different type that you are not usually attracted to, but he is very attractive. I think, in a way, sort of standing behind that is also perhaps, "Maybe I would really rather be with my family than with you." </p>

<p>CLIENT: And he does play a pretty supportive role in all of the dreams.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Also, again, this is very [inaudible [00:29:46] like-for some reason I associated his physical size-I don't know if your dad is a big guy in real life, but when you were a kid he was a big guy. (Pause) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have-we have talked a lot about my mom. We haven't really talked a lot about my dad. And I don't have too much to say. He is lovely and I love him and he has played a very important role, but I don't have the same sort of really like heart-wrenching-you know, I don't cry when I talk to him too much. He just-he is sort of-he fills a different space for me. And I wonder why I am not dreaming about Kelly or a person who might represent my mom more. But maybe I do have a lot to say about my dad and I don't know. [00:31:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if there is a kind of intensity between you that is kind of understated in a way or isn't as obviously center stage as the stuff with your mom and you [inaudible [00:31:28] really important. It is a total hunch. We should stop. We'll talk more next week and then the following week is Thanksgiving. I may be able to reschedule that week if you are around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I can let you know next week what would work if that makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

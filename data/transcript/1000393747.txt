<p>PATIENT:  (5-minute silence)  What I am aware of feeling, because it's almost that I'm not letting myself think, is, uhm, I, I'm feeling quite tired because I didn't get to bed until late last night and—.  So it's almost as if I'm thinking I am tired so I have to be really careful of myself now and, I don't know, be sure to co—, be controlling myself and, and what I'm about to say.  Because I keep me—, what keeps coming back to my mind is what I was talking about at the end yesterday and—.  And the fact that after I said that about thinking that I'd be angry if you couldn't change the time or not even if you couldn't change the time, but if you couldn't change it to precisely when I wanted it.  Then I, then I started to think, right when the time was up, that I really now want to ask you.  But now when I think of that I'm not sure why now I want—.  It's more I think almost—, well, I don't know if it is. I, if i—, if it is now I want to ask you or if it's just I want to know and I accept I'll be angry, or just what it is.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You know, but what you're not doing is, uh, thinking out-loud about the meaning of this to you.  I mean clearly it must carry a big load.  I mean, much more than what it seems to.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  You mean why I want to change, or—?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, why you've gone about it in the way you have—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: —and why it seems so important to know right now and, eh, so on.</p>

<p> PATIENT:  Well, I was just thinking that if, I was feeling sort of silly when I was thinking about it before I started talking, because it seemed like it wa—, it could be a very simple thing just to ask you, and I'm not letting it be a simple thing.  And that made me start thinking about how I almost never ask something like that, that I want in that way, directly.  And I was thinking then of I how I've handled requests like leaving school early at school.  And I've always found it hard, too, and if I was seeing Judy I've always sort of tacked it on as, "Oh, by the way," when really that was very much on my mind, and—.  So it seems to be something—. I just don't like asking directly.  Because then I'm not manipulating.</p>

<p>ANALYST: No, I think there's more to it than that, though.  For one thing, you're asking, uh, way ahead of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, that's sort of—, I was—, when I a—, when I brought it up at first, it seemed very sensible, but now I'm not sure why I'm doing it like that.  Except that when I s_, brought it up the part that seems to have made sense, although I don't know why I picked at that very time to suddenly want to do it, but it seems like I wanted to give you time to think about it way ahead.  So that it was kind of that get-used-to-the-idea thing.  And maybe I'd—, if I'm going to be refused, I want to have time to get used to the idea, too.  I don't know.   (pause)</p>

<p> But I can't even remember now if thi—, if this is when I did it, but it seems like the day I decided to do more about finding out whether I was pregnant I also decided to start talking about changing the time and—.  So somehow the—, at least I'm connecting the two things in my mind now.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because, well, sometimes when I'm thinking about it, I am thinking about as far ahead as when I do have a baby and am still coming.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I just had a thought that I don't like.  But I think it certainly is part of how I was looking at it and—.  I don't know if it's the whole way I feel, but when I was thinking even more so for when I had a child than when I was just thinking about the summer and all and how it would be more convenient for me to be able to come early.  But especially when I was thinking about having a baby, then it just seemed like the best possible thing would be to come and really just get it out of the way.  It's a responsibility to come everyday, and the easiest thing for me would be to have it fir—, ha_ happen first.  And I don't really know whether that will be true.  It might be very inconvenient, but—.  In my thinking it would be sort of, "That would be that responsibility out of the way."  And then I could think about other things.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And why didn't you—</p>

<p>PATIENT:  As if—.</p>

<p>ANALYST:— want to think this?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, it was as if I were pushing that aw—.  Analysis was not important anymore; the baby was more important or—.  Well, I mean it should be the baby's important but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>(deep breath) There's something about, sort of, getting it over with and then I wouldn't have to keep thinking about it or—.  I don't know.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why would you be coming then?  If it's just something to—.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that's why I don't know whether that was the whole way I feel about it.  (pause)</p>

<p>But I think maybe I still have very mixed feelings about coming to analysis, because sometimes it seems like I'm feeling I really would want to be still coming, even when I have a baby, and that would just make everything easier for me.  And that was the way I'm looking at it.  And I can't imagine not coming.  And then other times it seems like I'm thinking, "I know I'm not through yet," but I'm, I'm hoping it won't go on and on and on.  So that must mean then I'm not seeing it as as helpful a thing.</p>

<p>And then, I don't know, the—, I just was just thinking about MSCZ and I went to a play last night.  And it was that one by MNP, "XMN," which I never, I don't know, I just never seem to like his things, because his, all his humor seems directed at something that I just don't find funny, really.  But one thing he kept poking jokes at because they were, well, set up like 3 skits, and each one involved a new woman with the same man.  And it seemed like at least two of the 3 women, and maybe all three, were going through analysis.  And it was the way they were talking about it, or the way the man would talk to them using, "I know you're going to analysis but don't be that way, or stop saying that."  I mean it was all—, the audience thought it was hilarious, but I don't know, it just bothered me.  Because it—, I think it stood for the way I used to look at it and the way so many people do of  'Analysis is just silly' and (hesitates) brings out bad things about people sometimes when they start talking about themselves and their problems and analyzing everything when they're not in analysis.  And things that I haven't found really—, I mean maybe MSCZ and I do somewhat with ourselves, but I haven't found I do it at all with other people, anymore than I ever have (sniff).  And—, but yet I still am bothered by that kind of joke.  (pause)</p>

<p>It makes me sort of angry, and I'm not—, I do—, I was just thinking I wonder why.  Is it that I'm feeling defensive and therefore feeling angry or if I'm feeling it isn't that way and that is the way most people see it.  And so they're misjudging things or—. I don't know.  (pause)</p>

<p>And also I—, I was just thinking about how I know I'm happier now.  And I know that just the short time I have come here, it has helped me.  So it almost seems like sometimes if I'm sort of looking backward, remembering how I used to feel and then how much better I'm feeling now.  I still think well I want to continue, because it is helping.  But then other times, I guess, I don't know whether it's I'm looking at every—, day by day or ahead or just what, but it is hard to measure things when you're trying to sort of feel or see a change, immediately.  And sometimes I think that's what I'm trying to do and it's—, it can't be done.  And then I feel discouraged or—.</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you seem reluctant to, you know, express your feeling discouraged.  I mean you say it now, but it's sort of the last of all the thoughts.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  I suppose because that's been the feeling I've been having, espe—, well, certainly throughout April I was, because I just didn't feel I was getting anywhere.  And I think I feel discourage today because I don't find I'm, I don't know—.  I mean you ask me more about my feelings on wanting to change the time, and, and just the way I did it and how when I wanted to know it and all that.  And I just find I can't seem to get anywhere thinking about.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it seems like sometime's I'm discouraged because I'm thinking I should be able to make myself get at these things.  And other times I think maybe I'm feeling that I'm expecting you should be able to make me, even if I'm fighting you.  (silence)</p>

<p>Almost seems like that's part of this feeling I've had to wanting to change the time.  Sometimes it seems like if it, if it's as it has been lately, leaving me feeling discouraging, or even thinking about coming sometimes makes me feel discourage because it—.  I don't know, I keep feeling the same thing and—.  I think this is the longest period that I've felt this way, so maybe this is why I brought up the change of time when I did.  But then it's better to get something that's going to be discouraging over at the beginning of the day rather than waiting until the end for it. (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: How do you, uh—, how do you see what you've—, what's been going on here the last few weeks, during this period when you've felt discouraged.  What do you think's been happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  I don't know, I thought immediately of being—, thinking anyway, because I didn't know definitely that I was pregnant.  And how the way I pulled away from MSCZ and did pull away from you and—, I don't know, kept feeling on one hand and acting this way that I didn't need either of you.  And yet not wanting to feel that way.  And I kept on feeling that way, and didn't seem to be anything I could do to stop feeling that way.  It was—, I mean it seemed like I was alienating myself, as if I were on some set course now that I was pregnant, and there was nothing I could do.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: So our usefulness has literally ended.  Which, uh, makes it sound though as then you got what you wanted, eh?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But it didn't seem like I had.  Or wh—, I don't know why else I'd feel discouraged.  I mean it seemed like something in me was reacting as if that were supposed to be what I wanted, but yet that wasn't the way I was feeling.</p>

<p>ANALYST: (said simultaneously) You mean you think a baby is not what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Sometimes, yes.  (pause)  And I feel very guilty now, because if I am pregnant it seems like it's too late to be feeling that (sounds close to tears).  (silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: But you clearly are feeling something of that sort, because you know you had this idea that you wanted to pound on your stomach.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  It seems like—, I don't know how much this is being rational and how much it's feeling but (sniff) I could very easily try to get out of having a child and being a mother feelings I can never really satis—, get satisfactorily in that way.  And yet I seem to resist the way I could which I've found on occasions when I have been able to that being close to MSCZ and giving to him, I don't know, not feeling alone then is the way.  And, I don't know, sometimes then I can feel like a woman and, and complete and not dependent on him and yet in a way very much dependent on him.  And if I, if I don't have that feeling from him, from my relationship with him, then I can't—, I just know I can't be a good mother.  And I know I'll try to get something out of being a mother that's wrong.  And that seems to be part of what makes me not want a baby and the fact that something in me seems to be resisting this other relationship when I know I am pregnant.  And I think I feel discouraged because I—, I do keep resisting.  I think I'm resisting a little less now, since Friday, but—, and I think I'm still resisting.  Maybe it's just I'm a little more aware of when I'm resisting and thinking maybe by controlling myself in some way I can stop resisting.  I don't know.  (silence)</p>

<p>The other thing I keep thinking, and maybe it's because I do have such mixed feelings about being pregnant.  I keep thinking that either I will have a miscarriage, and sometimes I'll get feelings that probably are just natural feelings but I immediately assume something's going wrong, or else I think when I get to the doctor on Thursday he's going to find I'm not pregnant.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Which must be what you wish right at the moment, hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I'm not sure.  I think even then I have mixed feelings about it.  I suppose, in a way, yes.  Because it seems like before—, well I remember even when I was thinking about stopping the pills, I mean right before I knew I'd be stopping, and I wondered how—, what would happen.  Because it seemed like our relationship was better.  And I was just afraid of what would happen once I knew the possibility would be I could become pregnant.  And then when I did stop the pills, I couldn't, for a long time, have intercourse with MSCZ because I was so afraid I might become pregnant.  And then I guess, I don't know what made me decide finally that I would risk it, but it was feeling I'll risk it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How's that?  You had a diaphragm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But I didn't use it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Why not?  You never talked about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Because in a way I had decided I was going to become pregnant.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But then when it actually came down to it, I was afraid to. I mean it was more I was thinking, "Well, I'll pu—.  It might be better to put it off for a month."  Which then would have been, "Well, it might be better to be putting it off for another month and—."  (deep breath)  I don't know, it was almost, I guess in a way a decision to face to what would happen.  And I don't—, I don't know, I guess once I had had intercourse, and either for the first time and gotten used to the idea of having intercourse when I could become pregnant or even once I'd become pregnant, I didn't expect to have the reaction I did of turning away from MSCZ and being so resistant here.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Sometimes I, and I was doing it now after you asked why I didn't use a diaphragm then when I could have, and (deep breath) it made me think of the question that (exhales) I'd—, I have wondered different times since I kn—, have thought or knew I was pregnant, of why do I want a child and, I don't know, feeling very afraid to know why, because I'm afraid that I want a child for the wrong reasons only.  And, and I—, just now I was wondering when I was struggling over the decision, should I put off becoming pregnant or take the chance.  Or, I mean, anyway, hope that it'll happen or something. I don't know how much it was just for the—.  I, eh, mean it seems like the bad reasons were there, but I don't know if was only bad reasons or—.  And I don't know what it was that made me resist it, too, be afraid of it.  It seems like some of that was for bad reasons.  And I think what I keep wanting to do, is to have a very clear cut thing.  Either I want a child for a good reason or a bad reason, and I find it very confusing that there might be this mixture.</p>

<p>ANALYST: You don't say what you think the bad reasons are.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I was just thinking about my using the word bad, and—.  I do keep it kind of vague.  And if I ever start trying to think them out I, I start immediately fighting it and thinking I know it won't work like that.  And it, it's impossible.  I won't be happy and neither would the child with these reasons so—.  I don't know quite whether I don't want to face it or if it's my rational sense that's fighting it, but—.  I don't know, it seems like feeling I guess—.  I mean It's a self-serving kind of thing, feeling more important or that I'll be necessary then.  (pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know, sometimes I don't know which comes first, but in thinking of stopping work it'll give me some point or purpose to my days, and I'm very afraid of that reason for having a baby.  Because the—, because then all I can imagine is if that's how I'm looking at it, my days will be the dullest possible days that could be.  (pause)</p>

<p>And just also this feeling I've had so strongly that my parents felt of raising this thing that will be—, and it would be a thing, it wouldn't be a n_, a human being, that would, I don't know, somehow reflect me and, and my ideas and attitudes and everything.  I mean that would be ki—, some kind of a self-gratifying thing and I don't—.  It doesn't seem like the words I'm using quite explains it, but it's exactly this feeling I had was the reason for my parents having children.  I guess it's a sense of power, too.  I mean you're making—, it's an attitude of making this child into whatever you want to make it.  (pause)</p>

<p>I was just thinking, when I read that article in the magazine section on Sunday, I think it was last Sunday, on the wrong reasons to have a child, I just felt as I could fall into about 2|3 of the different reasons that were listed.  (pause)</p>

<p>And the thing that made me feel better when I was reading that was what was put in about good teachers can make good mothers because—, not that I always feel like a good teacher, but sometimes I do believe I have—, mixed in with all the bad attitudes that come out in my teaching, the right attitudes of what I would like to be able to do as a teacher and—.  That was the first time since I've been thinking about being pregnant that I felt, "Well, maybe I might have a chance not to be such a bad mother."  (silence)</p>

<p>I just thought of something that (deep breath) I hadn't thought of in this way before, and I don't know—.  Well I just, I don't know quite what I mean by it I guess, but I was just thinking that the feeling I have in being unhappy about thinking of being a mother is this feeling that somehow I'd question whether I'll be separating what I want from the child.  And I don't know how to explain it more, but it seems to me very clear that I have to want things separate from my child and my child and what the child is, in order to be free enough with the child and — (deep breath).  Or I have to get a feeling of being worthwhile and somebody and what I am or whatever it is that you feel that makes you feel happy that comes from another source, not from the child.  I mean it might—, having a child might make me feel happier, but sometimes I think I'm waiting to be very dependent on the child for that.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's on your mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've just been feeling really terrible for the last, I don't know, four or five days? Just (pause) (sighs) kind of feeling like there's no point to living anymore. That's a little bit scary. Not to the point of actively wanting to die or making plans or anything, but, you know, in my experience there's a slippery slope between there's no point to... yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do let me know if that changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will. But yeah, it's really upsetting. [00:00:59] I kind of myself talk around that hasn't exactly been helpful because, you know, the voice in my head has been going, you know, "What the fuck do you have to be upset about? Your life is wonderful. You have a partner who loves you and a good job and, you know, what the fuck is wrong with you (inaudible at 01:18) that you're feeling this hopeless?"</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm struck by (pause) the way that that seems to negate however much of what you were saying and we were talking about yesterday. [00:02:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Those all seem like really petty problems though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, [there are not to go] (ph) all their children serving in Africa, but my dad grew up in a refugee camp. My advisor helps (ph) as a refugee from the MidEast. I just heard from a friend that a friend of hers had been kidnapped and raped. I was like, you know, nothing horrible on that level has happened to me, like, I'm, you know, I fight with my partner about cleanliness in our apartment. Like, that's such—that's nothing compared to what people I know and are close to have gone through. So I kind of feel like I don't have any right to be depressed. [00:03:12]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 03:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly more of, you know, here's the world's tiniest violin playing the world's saddest song for you.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also there's a part of me right now that can't even believe I'm bringing this up given that, you know, the (pause) the actual behaviors I want to change by coming to therapy all center around not being able to focus and get work done at work. And I know you're methodology says that, you know, talking about whatever can lead to solutions to behavioral problems, so. But... [00:04:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. But for you, at least at the moment, what you're talking about now seems (inaudible at 05:12) from what you want to be working on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And past experience has demonstrated just hammering on, why can't you work? You're only hurting yourself and going around that cycle week after week. That doesn't actually help, but there's still a part of me that thinks that if we're not talking about that then I'm wasting my time. (pause) Does that make sense? [00:05:56] Like, I believe you but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. I guess I would imagine a part of you believes me and a part of you feels (inaudible at 06:03) about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I'm also kind of feeling there's something else going on, or that you are doing so far today unconsciously (pause), which is, again—if there's any merit to what I'm going to propose—I don't think that's something you're consciously trying to do. (inaudible at 06:42) maybe you're trying to polarize things here, where you sort of (pause) undo what we talked about yesterday. Tell me (pause) you have thoughts about killing yourself. Tell me you don't really deserve sympathy for anything of the things you're talking about and then tell me that you're not even really talking about the right things, for the same (inaudible at 07:18) you don't have any right to talk about it. [00:07:19]</p>

<p>And the polarization that I have in mind is like that that would pull for me to either step in and reassure you about how wrong you are about all those things, or to kind of join in the beating. (pause) And (pause) either way—again, if there's any merit to what I'm proposing—I'm imagine it's because (inaudible at 07:18) at least this could be getting played out between the two of us, if you pull me in to one side or the other from that, rather than having (inaudible at 08:04 in your own head, which is terribly overburdened and pained by it. [00:08:13]</p>

<p>And I guess I want to be clear that though you may, you know what I'm saying, (inaudible at 08:24) I'm not intending anything critical or (inaudible at 08:29). (inaudible at 08:30) apologizing to be honest about it, I think this is the way you're trying to manage a tremendous amount of pain.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 08:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>But you're right in that no matter which position you staked out—if you were to pick one of those two you outlined—I would just pick the other one and then it would turn into a kind of a tug of war instead of anything useful. [00:09:40]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which, you know, I guess, was at least an air waver (ph) or something lead us away from how bad you're feeling and about how (pause) ambivalent about (pause) sort of feeling the right to talk about it, or, (inaudible at 11:14.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>(inaudible at 11:50) kind of stop or are you unsure of what to make of this? Or you have some fleeting (ph) idea?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually just mentally got derailed onto another topic entirely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, what was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little stupid, stupid situation with my priest. And we had this day-long anti-racism workshop Sunday that I was dreading. I never actually replied...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I can just—I can imagine what you said. (inaudible at 12:17) look forward to it. (inaudible at 12:21).</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was shockingly far less awful than I was bracing myself for, which is not to say it went well. It was still awful (laughs) but not as bad as...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:29)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I still at that point hadn't responded to that horrible letter that my priest sent me back in June. And so I e-mailed her on Monday replying to (inaudible at 12:41), then she predictably did not apologize and tried to shift the blame onto me and tried to deflect any responsibility from her. And in addition, before I sent my e-mail response, while I was still composing it she had e-mailed the entire team saying, you know, this thing that (inaudible at 13:03) volunteered to do, I think so-and-so should work with Constance (sp?) even though he wasn't at the meeting, haven't been to the last two meetings, and also he's not someone I particularly like. And he doesn't particularly like me. And we both think each other's theologies are wrong. So asking us to work together on designing a liturgical service kind of seems (sighs). [00:13:29]</p>

<p>So I sent my e-mail to her and she sent one back. And then I saw her e-mail to the group about having Wes work with me. I was like, "You know I would've appreciated your heads up in private first. Someone else already they were really interested in working on this. Three people is too many, both because too many (inaudible at 13:47) are in a (inaudible at 13:48) and also, we all work in different sides of town. There's no way we can coordinate three peoples' schedules. So, you know, it seems important to you that Wes work on this, so I'm happy to bow out." To which she replied, "Oh no, no, no. I think you're so valuable. I really like the work you do. I'll send an apology to the whole list immediately," without ever actually saying, "I apologize." And then she didn't send the apology out to the list. She e-mailed the other guy privately to say that she misspoke when she invited him to work with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just, like, massive pile of ridiculousness. So. [00:14:28] And then she tried to make it all about her, "I've been feeling so guilty all summer because I was afraid that you were staying away because of me and, you know, blah blah, me me me, me me me me me." And then she never actually—despite my asking her twice—told me how my letter made her feel, even though that was one of the things that she wanted us to go into mediation to talk about. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I assume that the reason she imagined you had, you know, stayed away all summer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she tried to focus all the attention on her feelings without actually stating what those feelings were. Like, it doesn't make any sense to me when I say it. I'm just like, how can that just happen? But that was exactly what it was and (sighs). So I don't know.</p>

<p>I sent her one final e-mail saying, you know, I wish you the best in processing these feelings. If it helps you feel free to share my letter with your spiritual director or a therapist or a fellow priest, I don't care. Those words are—you can put them in the public domain. It's really fine me. Best of luck. And I think I'm just going to write her off now as one of the people who can't be trusted and need to be at arm's length. [00:15:46]</p>

<p>And it's just very—terribly frustrating that I don't understand where she's coming from. And I keep trying and trying to understand some model for her mental state that would make the things she said make sense and I just can't. And Dave and I had a long conversation about this Wednesday where finally he was just like, "You know, I'm sick of talking about this with you. You just need to accept that you're not going to understand Julia (sp?). And coming up with these hypotheses for her psychological damage is, as in trying to get me to buy into them? Not a good use of either of our time." And Dave's right about that. That was hard for me to hear, but he's right. It's not a good use of his time or my time, but it's still very frustrating to me that I don't (laughs)—as we've covered before, I don't like not knowing things. [00:16:40]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>Yeah, so I totally just derailed my thoughts there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 16:58). I mean, I know what you mean. But (inaudible at 17:07).</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what else? [00:18:15]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What else? I don't know, I'm drawing a blank now.</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe there was something you didn't like about what I said in that you (pause) changed the subject. I'm not vouching for it and then drew a blank. [00:19:20]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are you feeling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Tired, frustrated and headache-y.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was before you came in or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. [00:20:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's frustrating you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, what isn't? (Sighs). There's an ongoing developing situation in the science fiction fan community, particularly the group of people who run and go to fan conventions, which, you know, I might have mentioned before. I go to a couple of conventions a year and I really enjoy them. And there's just been (pause) people with relatively large amounts of power within the subculture saying horrible things about people like me, women in their 30s and 40s who think that the culture of harassment of (inaudible at 21:12) is unacceptable and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, (inaudible at 21:21) follow—you're being (pause)—people in power are saying horrible things about people like you who are saying harassment is a problem and is not OK? [00:21:34]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so it's just—I could just stop looking at those people's Twitter feeds or Facebook pages, stop reading their blogs, but it's kind of like a train wreck—I can't look away. So I'm frustrated at the people who are being assholes. And I'm frustrated with myself for not maintaining my boundaries and just not engaging with them. So there's that. And I'm frustrated with work because work is a mess right now. I got switched groups again...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, earlier this week, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So I've been playing catch up and the new block that I own—I used to own a block called the (Lab), now I own a block called the Store. This doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, sorry, I'm confused. What does a block refer to?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A block refers to a piece of the chip.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So the chip gets partitioned into smaller segments. [00:22:34] So the names don't' really matter. It's just easier for me to say Store than the block I own now. But yeah, so I've been trying to do—trying to build the Store from scratch without making any changes to the source files, just to build it. One of the tools (inaudible at 22:50) and nothing was working, and I spent most of yesterday and half of today thinking that it was something I did. So I was trying to debug and I finally, finally, finally found a log file that told me something useful.</p>

<p>And so I went to another guy in the group and said, "You know, I have this problem with this tool called Apply (ph). I think I did something (inaudible at 23:14) on applying the swap files and you're the one who designed this process, so can you take a look and help me out?" And so he came over and we spent probably an hour looking through my files together and he was like, "Yeah, so the problem with Apply (ph), but it's not a problem with the soft files and it's nothing you did. You need to go talk to Jamie because this a problem with the tool Jamie wrote." [00:23:35]</p>

<p>So I went to Jamie and I was like, "Jamie, Conrad told me to come talk to you. I'm having this issue with Apply (ph) but Conrad said it's not actually a problem with Apply (ph), it's really a problem with Adfil (ph) but it's showing up in Apply (ph) logs because—I don't know." So Jamie and I spent an hour looking through my logs and he was like, "Huh. I think this is actually a problem with SXCL (ph). We need (laughs) to go talk to Alec (sp?)." I was like Jesus.</p>

<p>So this is terribly frustrating and (pause) yeah. And I think I'm feeling so physically tired and lethargic because I haven't been exercising. So, I usually exercise in the evening and then I sleep well because I have been exercising.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not sleeping well. Yeah, you're (inaudible at 24:39) lethargic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yuck. [00:24:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Oh and the headache is because I haven't had anything to drink today except coffee and that's a bad idea, but I need to be awake. I know that's a bad idea, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 24:59) water?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No thanks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 25:10) bottle of (inaudible at 25:04) to drink (inaudible at 25:10).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I almost feel like I should apologize for being such a downer today, even though that's completely ridiculous. [00:25:51]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Presumably, you wouldn't have the job you have treating people with depression if you weren't prepared to—for your advice to come and be able to (inaudible at 26:00), you know, it's kind of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what's so bad about it? Like, what (pause) is there any more you can say about that impulse? Yeah, I appreciate the certain reality testing that you're testing—of course you're right—but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Part of it is, like, this is a known bug with me that I always feel the urge to apologize for things that aren't actually my fault. And it's something I've been working on pretty consistently for, like, six years now and I felt I deserve to be like, "I am so sorry for things that are in, you know, not my fault." [00:26:48]</p>

<p>So, some examples. You know, I'm driving late to work and there's construction on the road and we can't go forward because the entire road is blocked and now traffic is backed up two miles behind us and we're stopped. "I'm so sorry I'm going to get you to work late." Like, clearly not my fault, right. So (sighs), yeah. (inaudible 27:07)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a bit of a self flatuating (ph) quality to it. (inaudible at 27:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Everything's my fault.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and it's not like, "Oh gosh, I should have been able to anticipate this, you know, this is about me not being (inaudible at 27:31). It's more, like, "I'm unworthy, I'm horrible," like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think it's a little of both.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause) where, you know, this problem with maybe Apply (ph) and maybe Adfil (ph) maybe accessing cells who knows after, like, half an hour of Jamie sitting at my desk who's like, "I'm so sorry. I can't figure out what's going on here." And he was like, "Don't worry about it. I can't figure it out either. This is weird and nothing some you did, this is a..." I was like—but I still felt the need to apologize for (pause) wasting his time with my silly problem, even though probably in the next day or two everybody in the group is going to have the same problem and it's just bad luck that I tripped over it first. [00:28:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. And that (inaudible at 28:20) actually everybody will be benefiting from the time you're taking to get it sorted out. Which I understand has, in a way, nothing to do with your being apologetic about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So there's that. And then there's the (pause), I don't know, I've been told that it's off-putting to people how depressing I am to be around. (pause) Mostly been told this by, like, frenemies (sp?) in college who, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ouch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, that was, like, ten years ago, but it obviously stuck with me. Right, like, actually going back before college I remember being told by the middle school teacher. She pulled me aside after class and held me back from recess to tell me, you know, "You should smile more. It makes people uncomfortable that you don't smile." [00:29:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's horrible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean, I could do an analysis of the gender dynamic of that and the way society feels entitled to women smiling and being happy and being receptive to with whatever people in society want from women and that's, you know, very much kind of a feminist political thing. And I can apply that critique to the phenomenon, but when it comes to myself I have sort of—have internalized society that I have an obligation to be witting and charming and entertaining to whoever I'm talking to, regardless of what the context is. [00:30:25]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) I imagine you're worried that I'm thinking critically of you for talking about (pause) things you feel bad about, that makes you feel bad. And...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the least I could do is turn it into, like, a colorful, like, party anecdote, right? Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I guess it's even more particular than I'm going to judge you or I don't like it, but that I don't want you to go away. [00:31:36] (inaudible at 31:40) I don't like you. And that's sort of insulting and hurtful rejection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, again, with the reality check, it doesn't matter if you don't like me as a person, as long as you can still do your job, right? Like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is absolutely true as a reality check. It's also absolutely as a reality check that as far as I can tell, we all worry what our therapists think about us (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [So thanks] (ph) a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it just seems to me it'd be part of the nature of what happened. [00:32:26]</p>

<p>(silence)</p>

<p>I think for you, like, a lot of what I note are ways that you (pause) you're uncomfortable about and maybe try to steer away from. Like, talking about ways you feel that (pause) you have no right to, other people have it worst, and you feel guilty, people won't like you, they'll walk away, say hurtful things (pause), which (pause) I'm, like, leaves you in a pickle. [00:33:50] I would think in that if you want to be, like, open and closer to people, (inaudible at 33:55) talk about important things that you really (inaudible at 33:58) feel because (pause) (inaudible at 34:00).</p>

<p>[We need to] (ph) stop, for now. So we'll talk more next week.</p>

<p>(background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: See you later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, take care.</p>

<p>[00:34:41]</p>

<p>(background noise, inaudible conversation)</p>

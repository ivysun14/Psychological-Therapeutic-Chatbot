<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I don't know, I, I know what I thought of first and
uhm, and then I realized something I was thinking and I couldn't see the
connection.  And I started following back and I think there's several
things I was thinking in between.  But the first thing I thought of when I
came in here was of a dream that I had last night and then, at the end — I
wasn't really thinking of the details of it — I'm not sure now exactly
what I was thinking of but, except that I'd had it.  And then when I
started realizing I was thinking of something else it was thinking of, uhm,
how I felt at the very end of my pregnancy, before FBO was born.  And I
think the connecting things were wondering what MSCZ would give me for my
birthday and then thinking about how old I'd be.  And I usually figure that
out by thinking of the number of the year because uhm, I don't remember
readily how old I am without thinking what year it is.</p>

<p>And then I was thinking of the fact FBO has an even year to go on too. 
And, uhm, wondering — well, thinking of what day she was born on and
wondering if I'll ever find it hard to remember what day.</p>

<p>And I think I was thinking of — wondering what MSCZ would give me for
my birthday because of uhm, I think somehow I was aware of or I don't know,
I guess aware of or conscious of how I look.  I don't know what I was
thinking about except just that, uhm, I think I was wondering if MSCZ would
give me anything that would be clothing.  And, or if he asked me what
clothing I'd want.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, in fact I think I was thinking about, uhm, well something I can
buy on my own or that he could give me if he asked me if I wanted one. 
But, uhm, I was thinking of the belt I have on, which is not constructed to
be worn in this way.  And, uhm, so I've been thinking for some time that I
want to get a belt for these pants.  And, uhm, (pause, with sighs) well, I
don't know, somehow it seems like being aware of my appearance today is
somehow similar to, I guess it was yesterday, when I was aware of my
breasts and that other time when I was or when I was calling your attention
to it.  And, uhm, I'm not sure how.  And yet it seems to be connected with
the dream.  Or, I don't know, the two followed one another.</p>

<p>And the dream I had, uhm, well I'm not certain of the details but
there was somehow, I, at some point, whoever was in the dream went on a
trip of some sort.  Uhm, and it started out that FBB and I were together. 
And FBB is the girl that I had lived with one year when I was teaching and
she now lives in PBB.  And then she, I think she was going to be going off
and doing something else.  Except she never did, actually.  I, well, I'm
not sure exactly what happened to her in the dream but it started out that
she and I are together.  And, and then it ended up that, uhm, MSCZ and a
friend of his that he sees more than I do, I mean he sees him more by
having lunch with him occasionally.  And he went to law school with MSCZ.</p>

<p>But, uhm, that fellow and MSCZ and I ended up together.  And I think
FBB may have been there, too, I'm not sure.  But, uhm, I don't know, it
seems as if somehow at first I was flirting with, or maybe making sexual advances to the, the one that, the friend that I don't know particularly
well.  And then as the dream ended, I was with MSCZ.</p>

<p>And the only thing I could think of — although I don't remember
exactly what I was doing with FBB — I don't know that I was, except being
with her, doing anything more — but it made me think of, uhm, the sort of
the dilemma I'm in of having to choose between women and men and being a
woman or a man.  (Silence)</p>

<p>Well, also thinking about it, first I was wondering well was I feeling
sort of the male position with FBB because she's not married and maybe —
and she's a, small person — and uhm, maybe I was feeling somehow that she
needed to be protected but yet it seems in the dream that she was more in
control and that I was sort of clinging to her.  And when she had to go off
somewhere that I had to have somebody else to cling to.  And I was just
thinking that it seems — I, I can't remember what I was doing with MLE,
that's the friend — but I think it was the same thing that I'm quite sure
I was doing with MSCZ, at the end of the dream.  But, ah, I was literally
clinging to MSCZ anyway, at the end and uhm, but it was almost as if —
well, he was sort of tolerating my clinging: he didn't mind and he wasn't
trying to get away but on the other hand he wasn't doing anything because I
was, he had his back to me and I was sort of holding on to him facing his
back from behind.</p>

<p>And, uhm, well, the other thing I began wondering about is, uhm, —
except then it would be complete confusion of roles — but it made me think
of my — whatever it is —, trouble anyway, talking about intercourse from
the rear and, uhm,—</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Eh, did I get this clear: you were behind he, him? /</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes, that's why I said I was, I'm not sure.  It made me think of that
but, uhm, it would be a total reversal, then.  (Pause) And I was just
thinking of — I don't know, there are parts of the dream that I know I'm
not thinking of — but I was just thinking of one aspect of it that I think
is true — and it makes me think of yesterday because of your asking if my
talking about that dinner party we'd had was to make MSCZ jealous.  Uhm,
because I think in this dream, when I was with MLE, MSCZ was there and I'm
not sure where FBB was.  At that point.  But, uhm, I went from MLE to MSCZ
as if — well, I'm not sure why I went from MLE to MSCZ, whether I got the
feeling I had to because MLE was going somewhere else too, or just how it
came about.  But somehow MSCZ was the least important one.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, maybe not exactly.  See, eh, what strikes me is that you, you
seem to imply you didn't really change in the dream.  What really changed
were the other characters.  So you start out with a woman and you end up
having this, this eh, what strikes you as unusual arrangement where you're
clinging to MSCZ from behind and that reminds you of your fantasy of how to
make a boy.  So you were literally in the position, then, of male with
MSCZ, who has replaced a female.  And I think maybe that's really the
point.  In the dream you really turned him into a woman.  And you are the
one who's going to make the male baby and you said this reminded you of how you felt when you were pregnant with FBO, before you were going to create
this big thing.  Before you'd have your penis.  And the implication, seems
to me, is clear that the way you're thinking at the moment that you have a
relationship with MSCZ is to convert him into a woman and take away his
maleness and have it yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) How, well, I mean, I'm just trying to think of just how I
felt with MSCZ lately and uhm, I can't seem to think of anything specific
except one thing but it does seem to be that's what my feeling is.  But
then I think of, uhm, that dinner party again, that I had such strong
feelings about, and feelings about afterwards when I was talking with him. 
Oh, and, I don't know, the thing that came into my mind is somehow I
associate a certain ability, or type of conversation with being male, that
can go on at gatherings of both sexes and, uhm often does when MEINZ is
present because MEINZ and MSCZ particularly like to talk to each other. 
And on the whole, MEINZ is inclined to have any kind of a meaningful
conversation with males rather than females.  It was unusual at the dinner
table that both sexes were involved.  But after dinner MEINZ went back to
talking with just MSCZ.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, somehow I was, I think I was thinking it's because
he's male that he can have these conversations and be with other males,
which I want to be with, and, and also, at this particular uh, party it
seemed as if — except at the dinner table — people broke up very much
according to sex.  And, uhm even if people sat in ways that they wouldn't,
they still did seem to, to tend to talk to their own sex, which I didn't
like.  (Pause) In fact that is part of what, when I think about it, made me
feel I wanted to spend all the time before dinner in the kitchen because,
well, FENI was pregnant and, so there was obvious comments about that.  But
then all the women there started talking about their children.  Well FENI
was going to have her second and the others — well FNI has 3 and then FLE
has 2.  And, I don't know whether — now I think of it — whether I had
feelings because everybody was going to have more than me but uhm, I think
at the time I just felt annoyed that there was this kind of conversation
going on or that at least I didn't want to be part of it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I, I was thinking that so, so — at the — after everybody left
maybe I was really angry at MSCZ just because he is a male and I was
jealous.  But, uhm, and then I was thinking that my whole feeling about the
evening might have been — well, except it seems like it was different
yesterday when I was talking about MEINZ — but now I think of it as if I
were a man, people would have noticed me and would have wanted to hear me
say something, or I don't know, just uhm, (sighs) I wouldn't have come away
feeling so dissatisfied.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And the last thing I think of is, uhm, I don't know, somehow,
something about MW.  And, because, uh, sometimes he can say some pretty, I
don't know, silly things.  And uhm, he, he'd incline to that evening and
everybody would listen to him.  So I guess I'm thinking if I were a man I
could say almost anything it would be alright because I was a man.  But
then I started thinking about, at one point he made a toast, and it was in
the middle of this discussion about women's lib and what it led off to and he was just toasting people having different opinions but he went o-, he
always is quite pompous about things like that when he makes a toast and he
went on and on.  And at one point he said something — I can't remember his
words exactly — but, "I'm not a man."  Or, "I can't be a man."  Or, or
some, something that uhm, it was a slip: he meant to say woman except he
said man and it was kind of — MSCZ and I were feeling anyway — revealing
of certain feelings he has — but uhm, — well, I don't know what I'm
thinking of but — unless I'm sort of feeling very aggressive and pleased
that that's one man that was less than a man.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Would you eh, like to render MSCZ the same way?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) Well, I, I, the thing I'm thinking about — I'm not
sure if this may be the just kind of to keep from thinking about MSCZ —
but I was just thinking that, uhm, well of FNI and MW and, and the fact
that in some ways she does do what it seems like I'm thinking I want to do
with MSCZ.  Except she does it only because MW is the way he is.  And I'm
not sure if MW could be more of a man, stronger and more sure of himself,
how much FNI would treat him the way she does.  And I don't know how much
I'd really like to — or I'd be happy with MSCZ being emasculated the way
it seems like I want to emasculate him and yet — yet it still seems like I
do want to.</p>

<p>And then I just began thinking of well, women's, the, the question of
women's lib that I was feeling strongest about, which I never really said
anything on, and, on Saturday night.  And, uhm, thinking about FNI's going
to something.  I don't know how often she goes to ballet but she has
tickets that she goes with another friend and that friend is going to these
consciousness-raising meetings, too.  And I've always been jealous, I
think, of their relationship.  And I'm not sure exactly why but I think I
have.  And uh, and I always get very — if FNI ever brings up the subject
and talks about FTPZ going to these things I always get annoyed.  And I was
feeling this way during the discussion on Saturday too.  Because, I don't
know, it seems as if — well, in particular with FNI — it seems as if she
admires FTPZ for going and yet FTPZ is always talking about how people
should be doing all these things and yet all she's doing is going to these
meetings and doing nothing else.  And it doesn't seem to me it's in the
end, solving anything.  Or I don't know, it, it just seems like a lot of
women's lib is not helping women to be women, except I don't know exactly
what I think being women is.  And it, I don't know, it seems like I don't
want to be one too.  So I just end up being very confused by all this. 
(2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And then I'd just started thinking of something particular that MEINZ
kept saying at dinner, that I never fully understood.  And it's been
bothering me.  And actually he's at other times, not just Saturday night,
said something similar.  And so I — maybe because he's a psychiatrist I
feel he knows something I can't know unless he tells me, or anyway he knows
it, or whether it's just because of the fact he has made similar comments
several times — but it's something to do with male and female roles and,
given our society, people who wanted to switch.  
Because one of the arguments was why — the typical women's lib one —why does a woman have to be the one to raise the children, why can't it be
the man?  And, uhm MEINZ remained very general.  And yet he was saying that
it was a female role to raise the children.  The child needed the mother
more at the early years.  And, uhm, I don't know, so then it was just
getting down to just, well, what is the female role uhm, just what is it
that a woman can't escape from being just because she's a woman that makes
her different from a man and therefore gives, makes her locked into this
female role?</p>

<p>And uhm, well, he didn't use that term exactly — but right now,
anyway, I was sort of, I guess, I was fantasizing seeing MEINZ again and
making him tell me, I think.  Which I think — I had a very strong feeling
of wanting to make him tell me, uhm, Saturday night but there were other
people there and, I fe—, I suppose felt maybe I'd reveal too much if I did
what I really wanted to do, which was to pursue it in such a way that he
would have to answer my questions or at least I'd finally ask the right
question.  Because I don't know if I knew exactly what question I wanted to
ask.  And —</p>

<p>ANALYST:   What would you reveal?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, when I think of it now it seems like what I'd reveal is I don't
know what I am and I wanted him to tell me.  (Silence) And it doesn't seem
like such a terrible thing to reveal: I mean, that I don't know what I am
except that amongst other people, or amongst — when I'm with people,
period, I seem to try to create a, a very self assured impression and that
I know exactly where I am.  (Pause) And I think, too, the fact that the
extent that I feel I don't know, makes me very vulnerable.  And, I mean,
it's a kind of weakness that I'm, I in particular anyway, maybe people in
general just don't want to let everybody see.  But of course then it
strikes me as just, that fantasizing making him tell me, or sort of
pleading with him, I guess — or whatever exactly I imagine doing — then,
then, it, it's another way of sort of forcing him to notice me and be with
me alone.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   And what would you like to do with him alone?  Besides make him
(stops) tell you?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I didn't, this time specifically, think what way you asked me
makes me think: of making love with him.  But that's what I think when you
asked me.  And at this point I'm not even sure who'd be what.  (3-Minute
silence)</p>

<p>Well, I, I, I don't know what I was thinking between but I thought of
this before — I guess before you asked me what I thought I wanted to do
with MEINZ when I got alone with him.  And, uhm, I was just thinking of
when I was fantasizing asking him to tell me what I am in effect, it would
be going to him to find out what I'm here to find out so it would be, I'd
be replacing you by him.  And it also seems I'd be replacing MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think when I first thought of it — I'm not sure what to make of it
— but when I first thought of it, I think I was thinking of it more —
when I was thinking that was a way to finally get alone with MEINZ — and
then by not answering it for myself, that's the way to keep coming here and
being alone with you.  I think what I was sort of remembering is just other
things that have come up recently about my not wanting to see not coming
here.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Yeah, but you know, it's possible to see this in a little different
way, too.  Eh, if, if your idea would really be to get the answer from
MEINZ, that you presumably came here to get and you haven't gotten it from
me and you say, in effect, you're going to get it from MEINZ, or you'd like
to.  It has the same ring to it that the idea of wanting to turn to MEINZ
from MSCZ had.  And what it fits for me, it fits in with eh, what was going
on in your mind when you were silent at the beginning today after you
apparently were thinking a whole lot of associations — the dream and other
things and the pregnancy all in a kind of a sequence, you then sort of
reorganized them all to tell me, in a totally different kind of a sequence,
which ah, is also doing something to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, the thing I think is that uhm, I don't know — when, when you
compare it, having the same ring as my turning to MEINZ from MSCZ — makes
me think, well, it's as if you can't be the way I want you to be and do
what I want you to do, then I'll turn to somebody else.  And, and so then I
think of the way I was at the beginning: that, that would be a way to try
to control what happens here.  Although, I don't know, the thing I'm not
sure of is the fact that I don't, I'm not sure if in my fantasies I'm
controlling MEINZ or making him something I want him to be.  But whenever I
think of him I think of him as one of the most unlikely people to ever try
to control.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And another thing I think of the way I said things at the beginning,
as — well, I don't know if this is all part of it — but it seems as if
part of my saying things in the order I did, somehow it was to, I don't
know — I knew what I'd thought second and I didn't want to say anything
about being aware of my body or how I looked.  And so I think maybe I
thought if I said other things and then sort of threw that in it might go
unnoticed or something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But the thing that confuses me — and I think this is something I
haven't understood from the other days, too, when this has come up — is by
thinking, it must mean that I do want you to notice and yet I always — I
don't know whether it's just I can't admit I want you to notice or uhm, or
what it is.</p>

<p>ANALYST:   Well, our time's up.</p>

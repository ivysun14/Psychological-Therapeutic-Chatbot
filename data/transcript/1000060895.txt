<p>COUNSELOR: Interview # 11 March 2, 1971</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I need is two tape recorders. </p>

<p>(Inaudible @ 0:00:46.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Seems like every time I get used to either coming here regularly or missing, it changes before we ever settle into a pattern. I'm going to Boise again this weekend. Josh left an hour or two ago. His job ran out last Friday so he is in the process of starting a new job which will take a week so he's going to go down to get his car and I'll join him this weekend and come back up. Another guy may come back up with us. I'll do some checking today and tomorrow to see if there are some job opportunities for him. 0:01:27.5 Really can't afford it, but I'm going to do it anyway. It's the only chance I'll get to go to Boise for probably for the next three months, especially this cheap. 0:02:27.4 Seems last time I was here it kind of came to a point where everything seems to be just waiting for something to happen and I'm only that way more so now. Everything is still waiting. Jessica and I kind of came to a point where we just kind of threw it in the air, said we're fucked, we'll worry about it in a little while, so waiting until we get back down there and see if we can't get straightened out on that. 0:03:30.7 Still waiting with my job. They bummed me out on my first paycheck and kind of excused it as well I guess they didn't get it filed in time so you'll get it next time kind of thing which does me a helluva lot of good. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to go out and buy borrow money, buy money, I wish. 0:04:27.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get this feeling that there is some sort of emptiness as you talk. I'm not sure if that's there for you or</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure it is. I'm just sitting here with nothing to say really. I don't know whether it's because I'm just kind of in a dazed state all day today or what but I couldn't seem to generate the interest right now to really find anything to say. It doesn't seem to be there anyway. I have a feeling that although it may be a false peacefulness, kind of the calm before the storm or something like that, I'm perfectly willing to just settle back in the comfortableness that it does avail me. 0:05:27.2 0:06:27.4 Did I ever mention to you that Matt disappeared?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He managed to corner Tye one night and Tye was all ripped out, talked him into buying a, well Matt bought three hits of acid from him and a little while later he came walking out of his room, smashed an alarm clock on the floor and walked out. He kind of disturbed the one guy that saw him and so he came up and asked about it. Tye said well I don't know what he's up to, he's maybe stoned, although it had only been about 10 minutes, so he went down and checked his room. It was completely cleaned out. Nobody has seen or heard from him since. 0:07:27.6 Evidently it was all very well planned out. Very full plan because he didn't carry anything out with him and yet he couldn't have, there's no telling where he's got it all stashed away, but. He had been planning on going back to Montana, he evidently hasn't done that. He told another guy he was going to India. Somehow that doesn't quite fit him. That's it, instead of concluding itself it kind of ended with a just a</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Up in the air?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Kind of disappearing from sight. 0: 08:27.5 If I didn't tell you that Matt had left before, then you haven't heard that Jessica will be coming up here? Don't' know when yet, but things have cooled off enough around there now, to where she's able to trip off for a day or two at a time 0:09:28.5 and she managed to make up to KU for a day and a night and a day so I figure under the same pretenses with a little more (inaudible @ 0:09:40.3) planning, she may be able to trip up here but because of school hassles right now and figuring on waiting for another month and a half or two. In fact, she may be up here before I get to go back there again after this weekend. 0:10:27.3 0:11:27.2 0:12:27.6 0:13:27.20:14:27.3 I have a feeling I'm going to get bored with being this way with the world. I mean just not not here now, I mean just nothing happening. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that was kind of business about emptiness that I was saying before, not just so much in here as you just sound like right now things didn't have much (inaudible @ 0:15:11.1) for you. Not sure where I got that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They all have import but they all pertains to what's, it will all (inaudible @ 0:15:29.4) but not at the moment. It's all later. So it's just kind of a time that I have to pass through and it seems like fill it as best I can with reading books or just messing around. I had an urge lately, I don't use chemicals much anymore. I had an urge for the hell of it to stop smoking weed even for a few months at a time to see if there would be any effect, to see if how much of me is me and how much is dope or whatever. I think mostly it's curious I don't know. To find out what Jessica is up to because I know she doesn't smoke anymore, she doesn't like it. Strangely enough, if she had the time and the freedom, she'd probably still be dropping acid. She enjoys that. She doesn't like to smoke. I'm quite the other way around for the main part. Although I use to be that way I guess about a year ago. 0:17:44.3 I got a letter from one of Jessica and mine's best friends, Carmen Daniels, she lives in Boise and she'll be coming out April 2nd, I believe. Her mother and I, although we aren't around each other that much, probably only met each other on occasion for eight or nine months now, she and I are awfully good friends but I don't know where she is coming from but she said it's perfectly okay for Carmen to come up and spend the weekend up here to go to a concert. 0:18:59.7 There's another friend of mine, a younger, well a friend, a younger brother whatever that will be coming up for the same concert so with a little bit of scheming we may even try to have Jessica come up. We don't know if it will work out. That wouldn't be our choice, it would be chance but right now that seems to be the only thing cooking. That's just all that is happening and that is still in such a vague place that it's not much to worry about. The guy that I borrowed the car from to get to work told me that that will have to end soon because he's going to be needing his car for something in the daytimes so I made arrangements to get my motorcycle back into town and put together this weekend. My contraband bike. 0:20:01.3 I and I think three people at the frat house that I live with are the only people that know I own it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that something to do with your profession?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I like motorcycles and they're cheap and I don't like to ride in the city but broke as I am, it's just the advantage to be gained by insurance costs and upkeep is too much over the advantages of having being able to drive in the rain and such. So until middle of the summer, I'll probably keep riding the bike but my old man hates bikes and my brother doesn't know a thing about them and couldn't care less. To him there just a stupid inefficient piece of machinery also so I just never bothered to make myself that kind of an ass in their image by telling them I have a bike. If I manage not to kill myself and I manage to get the money together to buy a car later on, I may tell them how I did it, but in the meantime I'll just let it go by. 0:21:19.3 I seem to completely manage to completely alter my sleeping schedule even on weekends I don't sleep more than 8 hours. Bums me out and I enjoy getting up early on weekends anymore because I like morning times, one of the prettiest times of the day. Somehow eight hours, even when I wake up naturally and can't manage to get back to sleep, I still feel like I ought to be back to sleep. I got mad at a guy the other night because, it's the first time it's happened to me in a helluva long time. I mean like I wanted to stand up and belt him one. I hadn't felt anything like that in a long time. I had been writing, well not writing, I was drawing. I don't know if you call it drawing or writing but it's a weird way of lettering to make a four letter name, mine or Jessica's, it took me about two hours per page. It takes a page to put a name on it and I have been working on one page for about two and a half hours and I had it about three quarters done and a guy came into the room I was in, stumbling in drunk, started plinking around the room with a pellet pistol. So I tried to ignore it and he started bouncing off the walls, around the walls so I went over and took my record off the record player, put it away, I didn't want it ruined, sat back down and was bent over with the thing in my lap bent over like this and he bounced one off right under my nose off the clipboard and back off to the left of me. I just really didn't know what to do with the way I felt right then. 0:24:03.7 I was so goddamned mad. Of course I probably couldn't you know I used to be known to give my (inaudible @ 0:24:22.1) semi regularly in that kind of a way. I used to have a terrible temper that way and it wouldn't take that much to touch me off at all. I would lay into somebody and usually get myself creamed. Undoubtedly I would have in this case, he was standing there with a pellet pistol and he also is a hell of a big individual plus being drunk. That wasn't so much what bothered me, not being able to go beat him up. It was such that it surprised me to have that feeling spring on me so strongly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like before you knew it you had a fury on your hands and nowhere to put it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could have stood up and yelled at him or something like that but I didn't want to do that. I just walked off. It was the next day before I ever even started getting over that and then the next day was when I found out they managed to lose my paycheck so by that evening I was really bummed out. I guess that was yesterday. I don't know what I did with the check.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bummed out. You mean mad? Depressed?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well just confused I guess. It's like getting shit on twice in that short of time. I wasn't used to, leave alone all the things that I hadn't quite figured out about that. The check was simple enough. It was just a mistake. Somebody fouled up but the other thing I still hadn't gotten quite straightened out. I would like to talk to the guy about it, but he's not that kind. He is an awfully strange dude. Who isn't? Everybody I know around here is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's both strange and not the kind you work things out with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I don't have any idea where his head is at? He seems to have a very strange image of himself. 0:28:12.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:28:43.3) You want some?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure there's any there. You want anything in it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:28:53.5) So I suspect it was the bottom of the barrel but there's still some here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If there is anything that will keep you awake, it's that. Once you chew it up and get it down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's (Inaudible @ 0:29:48.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, every day at work right in the middle of the morning and right in the middle of the afternoon, broken by lunch, I always have just the most terrible time trying to stay awake and I'm sitting there at my desk with my eyes shut just almost asleep. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:30:14.9) you know active all afternoon so I didn't know what was happening (inaudible @ 0:30:20.8) Not the company, just the time of day. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what it is with me. It doesn't seem to have a whole lot of correlation of how sleepy I am with how much sleep I got. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I haven't gotten any for weeks but I complained about that last week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If I wasn't here last week (inaudible @ 0:30:39.4)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:30:41.3) If anybody has trouble sleeping, I have to tell them about my trouble sleeping. Let me ask you like what, you've been here (inaudible @ 0:30:56.9). Something like that. What if anything has been happening to you so far like how do you see this therapy and you? I'm not asking you to compliment me, get that straight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The well one of the big things that I noticed was I don't know maybe the third or fourth time I was here, I was talking about to the effect that I was expecting some trouble between Jessica and I and normally that's the kind of thing that I wouldn't admit I mean not that I wouldn't want to because I didn't think it was true but I would try to ignore it and I found that it was kind of useful to go ahead and be a little more realistic about I figured would happen. Now I haven't come across any deep revealing truths in myself or anything like that but it seems useful to be able to verbalize this kind or formulate about I expect to happen or what seems to have happened and it seems to he to set things in place to do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I was asking because what I kind of realize that I have a sense that you do a lot of the work or whatever in a way that's not visible. I have no sense for what all this would mean for you if anything I guess. I'm not saying that's anything bad I just have the feeling that you put it away (inaudible @ 0:33:09.4) what happens to you and I have no sense for it, I just have no sense for it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Vaguely. I'm not sure I follow you right down the road but I have an idea of what you are talking about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well maybe like you take something (inaudible @ 0:33:26.6) might think about it and might see no need to mention it again. It's like a lot might be going on for you other places. I wasn't</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's something that strikes me strange is because this kind of situation here is something that if not this situation, but things very similar to it are what I really like, a rap session per se and for little over a year now you know the best times I have is when a bunch of us get together and start rapping and yeah, it's true, I'll go home with something on my mind and turn it over and maybe come back the next time with what came up and there is no way even I at that point can relate it to where it came from. That's kind of like I was telling you, just turning through the pages and finding out what comes through. Its pretty good.0:34:38.8 I like strong coffee. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you'd get along very well here and at my house. (Inaudible @ 0:34:43.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Must be a 19 cup percolator or some such, some obscene thing at the house. There was rather an infamous individual who would fill the basket with coffee, put in 6-8 cups of water, whichever he planned on drinking and leave it perked for three days. Whoa, the poor person who would happen to decide to try it out. It would dissolve spoons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's some kind of coffee they sell in Louisiana that's like that. It's either part or whole chicory (inaudible @ 0:35:34.3) big yawn. (Inaudible @ 0:35:52.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible @ 0:35:56.2) That's like me going to law school. It would be cheaper to live. Oh, that's finally starting to roll around. I have received notice that sooner or later I'll be having to go back to Boise for deposition. I think I told you that, didn't I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I don't think you gotten notice about it, (inaudible @ 0:36:31.2) </p>

<p>PATIENT: They still haven't decided when. I just can't seem to give a shit about it. I don't think about it, I don't worry about it, I don't care about it anymore. I do hope very much though that I can manage to have Bob McDonough come back up with me from Boise. I'm getting awfully tired of the frat house. Just that incident where Johnny banged off with that pistol the other night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of stereotypical of a frat person?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no not really because the guy that I was with the typical drunk frat person. He and I get along eye to eye although he could probably kill me also. He knows that it 0:37:30.8 would be a foolish thing to do whereas Johnny just doesn't seem to care about things like that. I've never known him to be violent although he seems to give the indication of it consistently but he's a doper but he also goes out and gets drunk and he's very obnoxious and he's just a complete paradox of a person. I can't figure him from one end to the other. That's why I say he has such a strange image of himself. Maybe that's just because it's strange to me. It's not that just, I'm getting awfully tired of one small room. I'd love to have a kitchen, I like to cook, I don't even have a bathroom of my own, I would just like a little more privacy so I would like to have Bob come back so that without well it would be a little bit easier to manage to get an apartment with Bob and that way not to have to have a apartment with Josh and it would be to just get an apartment by myself 0:38:40.3 which I can't afford and still exclude Josh. I couldn't live with Josh. He and I are awfully good friends but we would make terrible roommates. We still have the problem with. I think of it as he being overly sensitive to me. Don't really know. I found an indication of that kind of thing happening between Jessica and I. It's the only time it's happened between us but it almost maybe wonder if maybe there isn't something that I'm doing that makes Josh feel that way. Last Saturday we went to that car show and I used to ride the IC daily to work when I worked down in Luth and Josh just loves the IC. He thinks it's so cool to ride a train to work and he was telling me all about the new trains that they were going to have. Their umpteenth feet longer, they hold 120 people instead of 80, they're a foot wider. I was saying a foot wider, they'll have to cut the platforms. He says yeah they've already done that. I said well you'll have to jump to get in and all the little old ladies that are going to fall down and bust their ankles. 0:39:49.3 He says yeah, they warn you to be real careful about it and all that. Well when we got on at 55th, I didn't notice it being cut but I wasn't paying very close attention. I could've stepped over six or eight inches without maybe noticing it although I didn't remember doing it. So I mentioned it to him and he said I didn't notice it either. Maybe, they didn't have to cut that side or maybe they haven't cut that station yet. We got off at 23rd or whatever the hell McGuinness Place is at and as we got off I said that didn't cut either and what I meant by that was simply the fact that one didn't cut. I wonder if they're fucked up somewhere and he looked at me and he says all right dammit I lied. It really pissed me off because that was as usual in the case of these kinds of misunderstandings the farthest thing from my mind was to put something on him so I 0:40:42.3</p>

<p>(Inaudible @ 0:40:42.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he said, I turned around to him and I thought I might as well as say something about it, I said Josh you are doing it constantly, you're too god dammed sensitive. He says well don't talk to me then. So I didn't. I walked away and we didn't see each other for about eight hours and when got back together again, we didn't mention it. I'm getting, that really upset me badly that time, usually it's just the kind of thing where we shrug our shoulders. That was harsher than normal and I think I'll talk to him about although I don't whether he would be willing to. Like I said, I'd like to wait a while maybe before I do because after that hacking with Jessica, I don't whether I'm giving that kind of feeling to them or whether there's really some reason for them to feel like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of what, of being critical (inaudible @ 0:41:39.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well like I said that's not my intention at all but Josh does that quite often and I thought before that that was just Josh because I never had anybody else seem that way but it happened once with Jessica in a considerably different circumstance but I just decided that maybe there's a reason for it. I can't find it though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like you're wondering even if you don't intend to come off as critical, or just a disproving person or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've even talked to other people that were present in situations where Josh got upset like that and they didn't realize what he was upset about. He rather shocked them with his actions also.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like disproportionate to whatever the situation was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not a matter of proportion so much, it's a matter of just reading everything wrong. One night I was even trying to compliment her at least I don't really call it a compliment but the night we were standing out on the Pier and we saw the light from the water purification plan that's 2 1/4 miles off shore and it was such a blizzard you couldn't see across, you couldn't see 40 feet. One person walk away from you, you'd lose him, but Josh saw the light, he pointed to it, and I well that's weird and at the time stoned out and everything else. It was kind of like a revelation or a miracle to me and I was just going wow man that's really strange. A couple of days later, I told you about that, he accused me of having called him a liar or per se not in that many words, he said but he indicated that he felt I was making fun of him and calling him a liar that night. Jack Larkin was with us that night and he was rather startled by Josh's claims also. 0:43:41.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's so puzzling because in the most I mean it sounds like you feel he reacts to the least things, you said it's the farthest thing from your mind and you begin to wonder like you don't even you never know when you're going to set him off or something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right and I remember just before this incident with the train happened, we were sitting on a train and he was talking about how he (inaudible @ 0:44:10.2) train work and Josh the kind of guy, he'll find he'll be happy about it, he'll always find an angle to it to be happy about and I started laughing. It came to my mind I was going to tell him as a compliment that if the only thing in the world was Josh and a rock, he would find someway to really dig on it and I decided I better not because he might he would take it that I would be claiming he was simple or stupid or unambitious or something like that. Normally, I would just go ahead and say something as a compliment and figured if they didn't understand, I could explain it. I realized then the situations that have happened in the past were making in effect where I was making special provisions in how I dealt with Josh already. 0:45:05.2 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you said that about Saturday's interchange being (inaudible @ 0:45:20.7) was that mean like overtly between you, was it more angry or you personally felt more angry about that, like the hell with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Both. I wasn't, well I was angry but still I wasn't angry so much as I was just shocked and really hurt and it caused more action or non-action between us because when he said that, I said that's just all I can do. If he's going to be that way, I'll just fucking do it so we were standing there side by side as we stepped off the train and he said that so I just walked away and made sure that I walked at a faster pace to make sure that I got there before he did and more or less we made sure that we didn't see each other for about 8 1/2 hours during the rest of the day. It was kind of a bummer because the day had been planned from the morning. I hadn't planned on going anywhere that day. He came down to my room and said let's go to the car show so we were going to spend the day together. (0:46:22.5) I ended up doing nothing by myself doing nothing but that's kind of a waste of time and a waste of friendship and it disappoints me a great deal. I had intended to talk to him about it that night and when I finally, when we finally were both home again and I ran into him and decided not to, well even on the way home though I got on the train and just out of random chance, he had planned on leaving at five and I got on the train at 3:15 and he walked in front of me. He said hi and I just kind of nodded to him and decided to carry on with the game so he walked on by and sat down. We got off shoulder to shoulder and didn't say anything and walked off on our separate paces again. Later that evening, I had intended to talk to him and for some reason didn't. I just, it still seemed like it was too delicate a situation, I don't know. I'm not sure why I didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For one thing, it sounds like you don't feel you would get anywhere even if you did bring it up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm kind of afraid of that because he seems so sensitive just in bringing it up I'm afraid he'll start feeling that I'm that I'm saying he's wrong but I mean that's the hassle between us. The reason I couldn't live with Josh isn't that so much, we have completely different personal habits. I'm a slob in a neat way. I have you know details like are always put away and my room looks like hell because I've got clothes laying on a chair and my bed is never made and things are laying around but actually it's all very ordered. The clothes on the chair are all stacked so that I put them on in that order or take them off in that order and the junk laying on the desk that looks like hell is all actually laying in piles that I know how to get hold of and </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just hatching out a plan.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. There's a method to my madness but Josh the kind of person that throws down and leaves it lay. I don't think he's ever washed a dish in his life. I don't think he's ever heard of deodorant. If he has, he doesn't believe in it. He does laundry once a month. He takes a bath once a month whether he needs it or not. That kind of thing. It's a slight exaggeration but I'm afraid it's not enough of a saturation to please me. (0:49:40.7) Re-sprained my ankle last night. Not badly but it was just starting to heal from several months ago when I did that terrible thing on it. It put me on crutches for a while. I kicked a door open just kind of needlessly and it hurt at the time but I thought I just, it actually hurt my toe first and I thought well I just didn't curl my toe up enough. About ten minutes later I start to take off my boot, it was already swollen up, so it was hell getting my boot off. So I have a feeling in the same, oh you can't see it, in the same change, in the same fashion that my father did, it's screwed up toward where it will be like that forevermore. Like my shoulder. If it were possible, I have four F's to spare right now. I'll loan them out to someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible @ 0:51:11.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've got to find a doctor that would recognize them. Let me think about it. Oh, I wrote to, every three months I'm supposed to write my probation officer and tell me where I live and where I work. I usually manage to be a little obnoxious about it. I really don't have anything against him. I kind of like him. He's a good egg but he's the only person I can spout off to so I just stack shit on him every time I write him a letter. I take about a line and a half to tell him I still work at such and such address, or still live and still work and he told me that the civil case is coming to trial soon and that seems to be where it's at. The prosecuting attorney didn't know what a child's death is worth in money. So far, he hasn't bothered to answer any of these really rotten (inaudible @ 0:52:10.4) that I've been making. I plan on dropping him a note someday to see what's up, to see what he thinks of the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like to hear what his response is? Like the thing isn't just you know letting it out on somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's both laying it out and I know that it's probably being filed away. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was thinking that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One of these days I may find it handy or I may find it very painful to have someone dig into the file and find out what a mouthy bastard I can be. I'd like to know that it's being put away somewhere that I think this is a really shit deal. If he is not willing or not interested enough to respond to it, I'm just as well that he didn't. What he would have to say if I had to drag it out of him wouldn't be worth a shit to me anyway. Actually I was kind of hoping that by being a little more honest and a little more or a little more honest and I should think considerably different than what would be expected of someone talking to their probation officer, I would was hoping that he might open up and I could start a little communication with him. Maybe find out what's going on and have someone that I can depend on to have a friendship with. I don't know whether this is professional aloofness or he just really doesn't give a shit. It hasn't bothered me that much. </p>

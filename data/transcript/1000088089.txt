<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>COUNSELOR: This is session number eight...1975 (ph)...number 2326 - 104.

</p><p>PATIENT: What you making?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Huh?

</p><p>PATIENT: What are you making?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not making anything; my husband [went to go get gas.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hi (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: It's warm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You kind of need] (ph) a jacket.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah...well...I carry a jacket around because there's no place for a wallet in these stupid things. (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You mean] (ph) in your pants pockets?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, the back pocket. [I don't think I can really] (ph) carry a purse. (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's a pretty green, good color.

</p><p>PATIENT: This? Thank you. [It's worn] (ph) just for my eyes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) is that where you work?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, but I think of it when I put it on...kind of, a birthday gift from my little sister (ph) I think; maybe it's from my mother I don't know. [They gave it to me on my birthday] (ph) Yeah it is...it's a nice color.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Shut the door.

</p><p>PATIENT: I hope I don't ever get a ticket out there. [It's exactly an hour so I only get caught] (ph) without two minutes. (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you put in what...a...? [2:46]

</p><p>PATIENT: I put in a nickel for an hour but that is all it goes for so. Well I haven't gotten mine yet. I was debating whether to ask this old man to put one in today. 

</p><p>He wasn't old actually; he was just sitting there reading a newspaper. And I was debating whether to tell him [to look] (ph) for five minutes while [she took his nickel.] (ph) Then I would have had to explain to him. 

</p><p>(inaudible)

</p><p>Couldn't wait those 40 minutes...40 minutes I was suppose to wait. I wouldn't do it. There was nowhere else to park...it's convenient. Better than uptown. Uptown's so bad - why do you live here anyway?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well because we wanted an apartment that was high enough up because I have a problem with...

</p><p>PATIENT: You have to be around a lot...down. You have to be...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, but we would either have to commute from the suburbs because their pollution and dust and smoke and stuff. If we lived below the - I don't know 20th something or other like that floor - we have a lot of dust and pollution and I cough and...

</p><p>PATIENT: You can really tell the difference? Wow.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And up here we don't get the sooty black dust. We didn't know at the time that we wouldn't but we decided to try it rather than having to move to the suburbs. 

</p><p>You think the air pollution of driving in a car ought to be bad on the road so...we experimented.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, plus the mind pollution. That's the worst experience in the world I think - commuting from the suburbs every day. It's not bad for me in (inaudible) though. That's so bad; it's just every time I do it...you know I have to go [out to the airport] (ph). I don't know how people can do it every day. It's just too much.

</p><p>And it feels horrible doing it once every three months. I can't imagine that you ever get used to this. I just get so upset and I start growling and howling. [And then the next time I get on land] (ph). It's the evilest thing in America.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's really saying something. [5:21]

</p><p>PATIENT: It really is terrible. I mean it must...I don't know. I don't know how people can do it. My father does it and it doesn't bother him. But maybe it does bother him. 

</p><p>The cats are upstairs? (inaudible) Are the hidden?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Which one?

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, that's Charlotte. 

</p><p>PATIENT: You really can't tell by looking at cat what (inaudible). I mean...maybe you can. How can you? Can you?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, not without seeing whether he has a penis or vagina.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well can cats tell just by looking at another cat's face?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know they can sit and smell (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I mean humans...well humans I guess make themselves look... (inaudible). I wonder how different they'd look otherwise. Well if they didn't have any clothes on they'd look pretty obvious. Like dogs you can tell always. Still you have to look at their belly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd have to do that with her. You have to look at her rear end and not her belly.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well with dogs you look at the belly...to see if there are nipples there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Did I? [This place I'm living] (ph) this poor cat is in heat. They're so miserable. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What are you thinking? [7:25]

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm thinking I'm talking a lot of (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is what you're saying not important to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it is important to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I...not greatly important. I doesn't matter that much. I see myself as a charity a little bit. So this feeling like I am pushing myself to talk. 

</p><p>Those cats are so different. That one is so smooth and this one looks like a cactus. From here she really does.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: ...a cactus? [So she'd] (ph) be prickly?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I mean it looks different from that. But from over here - just like the way she's sitting and the other (ph) cat looks like...I mean her face doesn't but her - the back end of her body is sort of [spread out] (ph) like that. 

</p><p>Sort of looks a toy not like a cat. The sand just looks so soft. (inaudible) It looks like a (inaudible). It looks like it'd be soft to walk on...walking on nice, thick carpet (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Walking on heaven. (ph) [9:49]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it would be it...it's just looking at it. I am sure she doesn't feel like a cactus. But I'm only sure by experience, I'm not sure just by looking at her. She sure looks like one. Well I am sure she's fine. (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She comes from an area originally where they would have cactus's. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Where's she from?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's an Abyssinian so I guess from Egypt. 

</p><p>PATIENT: How about an Abyssinian?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I think its Egyptian maybe. It's...I don't know...the holy cat of Egypt or something like that. The British stole some - they came here in the 1900's.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well why do they call it the Egyptian if [it isn't] (ph) from Egypt?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They called it Abyssinian.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know...its right near by. Like that's Ethiopia...right?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah that's what Ethiopia used to be called...is Abyssinia...I think.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All I know is the British stole it. Stole...brought a couple back...managed to get it out illegally and they bred them in England for more. [11:22]

</p><p>PATIENT: Why is it illegal?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because supposedly this was a rare cat and worshiped in Egypt.

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I see. Well I guess it is Egyptian...or maybe it's not the same thing. Anyway it's how (ph) a cactus looks.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And she's got wider paws then (inaudible)...and I suppose it was probably from walking on sand. [But she could not] (ph)... if you had little teeny tiny paws then you'd sink in...but she couldn't (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well maybe she blends in with the cactus's and sits like that so she doesn't get eaten. That doesn't look very comfortable.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What, the cat?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah the cat.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The way she's sitting?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean it looks like it would be uncomfortable [for me] (ph). Crunched up. (inaudible)... [not very] (ph) comfortable. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She sleeps [locked up] (ph) sometimes. So if you were a cat you would prefer to flop out like [Joshie] (sp?)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh for sure...if I was me too. He looks like a...She looks like sphinx. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible) The sphinx is the Egyptian cat. 

</p><p>PATIENT: How about that. Her breed's been around that long huh? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I guess so.

</p><p>PATIENT: Here we go. He (ph) sort of looks Egyptian too now that I think about it. Cats are so fascinating. Someday I'm going to get a cat.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What kind would you get?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I don't know...it depends on how much money I have.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Supposing money weren't an object, what kind would you get? [13:58]

</p><p>PATIENT: Probably Himalayan. They are so smart. Plus...I don't know, I'm still unsure whether I am allergic to cats or not. Like I don't seem to be allergic to these cats...but there are cats that I have found myself being allergic too. I think I'm more allergic to alley cats than I am to good bred cats...just by experience.

</p><p>Certainly not to sound (inaudible) cause I've never had any interaction with them. I like alley cats... [It seems a lot like they are] (ph) great big...huge. 

</p><p>There were these huge cats that used to kill squirrels in our backyard and they were awful. They're really enormous cats. (ph) They really were big...fat.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't want to tangle with them 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh no, they weren't [really vicious] (ph). But they weren't there like real alley cats. They lived in the alley... (inaudible) vicious. I like quiet cats though.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Quiet?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah kind of like that. Yeah. I don't like loud dogs either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You can hear dogs.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess it's just lazy...well no it isn't. It's just annoying.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're like God damn it...shut up. [15:46]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I just...it's like if they come up when they actually want something out of you. And you can feel that there's someway to respond that's ok. Like when they bark all the time...just make noise all the time. [I suppose maybe I'm able to live with toddlers more then animals. I'm not in the mood to bother with them. Shut up.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Don't bother me; get away.

</p><p>PATIENT: My 18 month old kid, two year old...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The one you [brag] (sp)...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well just when you started talking. Oh he can put up with it for awhile but it's just really troublesome when I'm in - just not in the mood to bother him. 

</p><p>A one and half year old is just really learning how to communicate and can't shut up...and keeps nagging. But fortunately they don't mind too much if you don't pay that much attention to them. I think, I think they mainly listen to themselves...but still.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Still...

</p><p>PATIENT: Ross, (sp?) come do this. [He just spoke to me.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a particular one in mind?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah, little Timmy...my wife's nephew...too much.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He wants to have you read to him?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh he just wants my attention all the time whenever I go over there - which isn't too often. But it used to be. Just the whole time - come on build something for me and I go over and start building and he'll tear it down. Ah it doesn't really bother me. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't bother you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Na.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But just his always wanting something from you. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Just always - do this, do that. I don't know...seems like I'll always push him off on a friend of his own or something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Leave me alone...go play with your own friends.

</p><p>PATIENT: But he's a little too young to have any friends really.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you said friends but he's really all by himself and [not very many people] (ph) pays that much attention to him. [18:05]

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know if it happens intentionally but he complains (ph) to them because he just wants attention the whole time. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How much attention can you pay to somebody that's that hungry?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Wants it all the time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. And I don't know it's hard to know exactly how much attention is good to pay to him - I have to pay some attention to him (inaudible) so he won't feel totally unloved. I suppose you should pay attention to him when you feel like it. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel in [his place?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: I was thinking about it but it's hard to imagine me right now being in his place. And it's hard to really know...like I was saying exactly how much attention he really wants and how much he'll be satisfied with. 

</p><p>And he might be satisfied just if you sit there and make faces at him and sort of...you know. If you push him aside or something while you are talking to somebody else he'll come back just playing a little game on the side [real] (ph) quietly.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you don't know what he'd be satisfied with?

</p><p>PATIENT: I try to feel it out. I try to sense it - I try to sense how he reacts and if I'm concerned...if I'm pissed off I just want him out of the way and then I don't really care too much... unless he really seems hurt. And then I start feeling hurt.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [You think he's insensitive because he wants love.] (ph) Not to have anybody want to pay any attention to me...no matter if you do all your tricks. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [He may be kind of hurting inside.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's always hard to know exactly how someone else is feeling. You have to judge by how they feel on the outside. (inaudible). 

</p><p>...about how you should try - not should but like it's...to get a working relationship you have to try to feel the way the other person is feeling through his own perceptions seems really, really hard. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.

</p><p>PATIENT: I've just been thinking about that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just like how hard it is? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, trying to think about doing it. Thinking about trying to understand people they way they are.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To see them the way feel. (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's good; it's good for me to try doing that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How am I feeling?

</p><p>PATIENT: How are you feeling? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not particularly excited one way or the other...just kind of calm.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Can you tell from the way that I am sitting? [21:12]

</p><p>PATIENT: You look relaxed but not sprawled out relaxed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How would you feel if you sat them (ph) down?

</p><p>PATIENT: Comfortable. Again, just pleasantly comfortable. And for this kind of thing for talking...it seems very relaxed. 

</p><p>Without being falling asleep type of relaxed or [further] (ph). I mean...but you also seem occupied with what's going on as opposed to just being spread out and being day dreamy and not being concerned what's happening.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of can tell how I'm feeling?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just from looking at me.

</p><p>PATIENT: And listening. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Listening to how I (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I'm playing with one of my hangnail.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Good thing you're patient. I would if I were doing that.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know. I kind of like the way it feels. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The sharpened finger? (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: I like the way it feels on the finger that's actually rubbing against it. But I kind of like the way if feels on the other finger too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's a harder question. Just was like there's something rubbing against this.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is rubbing things wrong?

</p><p>PATIENT: No it's hard. It's hard but it's also the fact that - I don't know what it is. It's a nice feeling. It's like rubbing against something pointy. I was going to say like a needle...but that feels good too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Rubbing against a needle?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes just rubbing like this against the chair. Just rubbing a pin across your skin...or a sharp needle. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A sharp (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can also feel it on the other... hand where the hangnail is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What feels good - to be rubbed or pulled or something?

</p><p>PATIENT: No I can just sort of feel it digging into the skin [on the other] (ph)...sort of a mild pain but [right there] (ph). But I suppose it is a fidgeting habit of mine. I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but you mostly are feeling kind of - like the sharp, you know...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it feels good, and I enjoy doing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You like the sharpness of your (inaudible at 24:05) digging in? Like you said you were leaving this little bit because you liked the way [it stuck]. (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's similar. It's a little different. It's not quite as prickly; I'm rubbing it [rather than just] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Cool (ph)...being prickly or prickled. 

</p><p>PATIENT: One of these days I'm going to cut it with a clean (inaudible). [I need to.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're feeling uncomfortable?

</p><p>PATIENT: No.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I thought maybe you were because you're saying, "One of these days I'll..."

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I was just thinking about that I had a [cardigan on.] (ph) Here I am dressed up in long pants instead of my shorts wearing a suit coat and fancy shirt. But I still have my grubby [shoes on.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of fancy but... [25:01]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I'm not really fancy...fancier than I generally appear. I went to the mirror and I saw - 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What did you think?

</p><p>PATIENT: I laughed. I said, "Oh well, I still have my grubby beard."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "All spruced up except for my grubby beard."

</p><p>PATIENT: Well and my coat I don't know... it's a nice coat but too much. This used to fit me...if you can believe that.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You've lost a lot of weight. 

</p><p>PATIENT: It's incredible...really...in April.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Have you lost all that weight?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Try to imagine me 40 lbs more. Well it wasn't...yeah; it was about 35 to 40 lbs. It feels good. I don't know how it happened either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Had you been planning to?

</p><p>PATIENT: No it just happened. I don't know it just started happening and just kept continuing. I'd go to the gym and be a couple pounds lighter each time. I started doing exercises for the first time in my life.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Maybe that had something to do with it.

</p><p>PATIENT: I am sure it had something to do with it. But I can't believe it had everything to do with it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you feel more attractive this way? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. Well I feel better already. [I just have the character.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's no good for you.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not pretty then.

</p><p>PATIENT: No it isn't pretty. Doesn't even help anyway. My mother's upset though...180 that's not enough.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Makes you (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: It's so ridiculous and she's not the only one. There's other people that are like "Burt (sp?), you look terrible." Lost all that weight. Where are those people at? They're all fat too. I guess it's their problem. [27:42]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Guess so. But they yell at you or something...for like you look so awful because you're not fat?

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I look skinny. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Skinny?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm not skinny. Skinnier than I was...lost all that weight - something wrong?

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's wrong?

</p><p>PATIENT: That's their immediate reaction. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does it matter what's right?

</p><p>PATIENT: It doesn't really bother me because their just so - I don't know. It's strange to have to react like instead of why I look good. I lost all that weight. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "You look great, boy..."

</p><p>PATIENT: They say, "Wow, what's wrong? What's the matter?"

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. "Oh my God something's really wrong."

</p><p>PATIENT: I must be sick, I've heard that line. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Must be.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because we're not sick and look at us. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I still eat a lot but my stomach is showing or whatever now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Then you don't eat as much?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't need as much to get going. It's a nice feeling as opposed to just piling everything in and still wanting dessert.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To just feel full. [29:15]

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it feels good. I haven't known this feeling in an awful long time.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [It kind of feels good] (ph) to be trim and be able to look in a mirror and smile.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it's true. It's really... That was my success story (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You sound like you're putting it down a little bit now.

</p><p>PATIENT: No I'm not. I really feel good about it. I feel like going out and exercising I might (ph) - I will this afternoon. Run around the track.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you do?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that's one of the things. That's ok.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But just seeing yourself this way and liking yourself so much makes you feel like doing something?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah just thinking about it. Because once you start doing it - exercising really is tiring. Not the most exciting thing in the world. Because you want the results but you don't really want to go through the agony of it all. And it's not all that much fun. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's not?

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Running is ok because I sort of pride myself (inaudible). Just trying to get a little better each time...that's a little bit of a challenge. It's enough of a challenge anyway to keep me going. Lifting weights...it's ok. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You like that? [31:06]

</p><p>PATIENT: Not particularly but I can do it...because I say well I have to be able to do 80 times that. So I'll try to do it. (inaudible) I've got to get my legs in shape too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You do your exercises by yourself?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't like to do it with other people. I kind of feel a little bit ashamed, a little embarrassed. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Embarrassed?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well if I was doing it with somebody about the same caliber as me...but like generally if I go to the gym or something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Coordinated huh?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I'm coordinated...just really muscular guys over the weight room until you know you think, "I look really silly."

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What about doing them with Susan? (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh well...it's just we run. I don't mind running, I mean I'll go running with anybody. Because I'm not...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Not as (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I don't...I kind of feel ok about the way I am at that. Like I don't really feel that I should be better or worse or anything. I feel good about the pace that I think I'm good at. 

</p><p>But lifting weights - well you're not suppose (ph) to lift weights by yourself. But ah...if someone's around you can chat with them and if not...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you wouldn't want to do something if you felt like you weren't so hot at it? And someone could see? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Sort of yeah. You know I'm really not that bad. I mean I am probably better then I think I am. But still those guys at the gym can lift...I'm thinking they're all (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They're all what?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm thinking they're all sort of smirking.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "Oh look at that guy boy he doesn't even have muscles." [33:09]

</p><p>PATIENT: "Look at that guy." Right. 10/15 pound weight when they're doing 128 pounds. Why all I do is look around sort of - do them real quick and run away. And go run around the track.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Just to get the hell out of there before they... [33:28]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well that doesn't bother me running around the track. That's good for me. But I always hope that there's nobody around when I (inaudible) weights. 

I suppose it's probably because I feel that way about other people too. If I see someone else who looks kind of scrawny or fat or something then I do that (inaudible). I sort of feel myself judging you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: "Boy she's sure out of shape." What else do you say...about it? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well generally nothing very complimentary. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like what? Like you look at this guy and he's kind of spread (ph) a little bit around the middle and kind of not very much muscle.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's sort of - it's sometimes what he's doing. It depends how he looks. If he looks like he's [doing something] (ph) confidently, he's running around the track at a decent pace or he's playing ball and he looks pretty coordinated - just looks a little fat, I'll say, "Well he's ok he's just a little overweight." 

</p><p>And generally if I go down and play ball against him he'll be better than me. So I really don't look down upon that. If there is some guy that looks really sad and dumpy, slovenly (ph) I sort of shake my head. (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A big creep. 

</p><p>PATIENT: But yet that's really stupid because here he is at the gym trying to get himself in better shape. [35:19]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's not nice of you to say that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah that's prejudging anyway. But I always tend to judge people on how they look. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do I look?

</p><p>PATIENT: How do you look? 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Saying you judge people buy how they look...

</p><p>PATIENT: You look different then you used to look. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm just more - I'm just used to you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Hmmm.

</p><p>PATIENT: How do you look - that's a strange question. You look ok. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You think I look different but I look ok. 

</p><p>PATIENT: [Little bit, yeah little bit.] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I look different and I look ok?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I don't know. I just feel like that's a funny question to answer.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Why? Or how did it feel for you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well because I'm not - I don't know. It's like I feel sort of called (ph) in front of myself to say something nice but I sort of feel embarrassed but really complicated things rather then just being straight forward.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: The reason I was asking was because you were saying you have these opinions about everybody so I thought you'd have them about me. So I thought maybe we could talk about it. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I suspect I do. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) Are you scared to say? 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah right now.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Right now particularly?

</p><p>PATIENT: I'd feel funny about saying something complimentary and sort of bad about saying anything uncomplimentary so I wouldn't - I'd not say anything. [37:17]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible.)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah because I can't really view it as just being objective...because it isn't. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's your feeling?

</p><p>PATIENT: My feeling is good right now. I mean I like the way you look right now. I like...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying you feel more but you don't want to say good things because that feels funny and saying bad things that seems funny too.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I feel good about the way you look.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What changed?

</p><p>PATIENT: You mean I feel good about looking at you (inaudible) I don't... (inaudible) It's looking at you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is it not pleasurable or something like that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Does that scare you some?

</p><p>PATIENT: Na.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [What are you thinking?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Just thinking about...I mean generally when people say, "Well how do I look?" they don't really want to know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You think I'd want to know? You'd think I'd listen?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. On the other hand I'm not exactly sure what you'd make of the information. I guess you'd just view it as "for what it's worth" for what I think. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like I might not take it seriously is that what you mean? Or... [39:28]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's not a matter of taking it seriously or not. It's a matter of you don't look the way you do...well it's a question of how much it matters and how much it should matter how other specific individuals think. 

</p><p>And the question of, "Do you look the way you do to please everybody else?" or "Who do you look the way you do to please?" or "Do you just do it to please yourself?" - it's complicated. I can't really figure it out for myself either.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you wouldn't know how I or how come I look the way I do - and it would be to please you or to please me or something like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah I'm not sure it that's really bothering me. I was just going through that in my mind. That you - I guess nobody wants to hear, "Boy you look terrible." 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Even if it comes from a fat mother.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Who thinks everybody ought to be (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Well of course that's absurd. Yeah I mean you can laugh at that...that doesn't really bother me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So that doesn't hurt?

</p><p>PATIENT: No that doesn't hurt. Well I kind of feel myself sometimes trying to look presentable for other people - and other times - and there are lots of things about me that I really do just for my own sake. Just for comfort.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What kinds of things? [41:11]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well the fact that I am reasonably sloppy and don't really spend much time (inaudible) the latest clothes and all that. I find that it's nice but I don't worry about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: But on the other hand, I do dress according to certain fashions which are certainly dictated not by me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like what do you have on that's dictated by a certain fashion?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well a colored tee shirt, bells, boots. This shirt too... [sort of] (ph) everything. Colored socks, but on the other hand the boots are scruffy the pants are filthy... (inaudible) I just feel comfortable.

</p><p>But on the other hand these pair of pants looks better on me than this other pair of pants I have so. And I find myself more likely to put these on than the other ones. Now, "Is that for my sake or for somebody else's sake?" - I'm not really sure. 

</p><p>I have kind of asked myself. I guess some of both; I guess they are all very related. Because what I think I look better in, I think when I think I look better...I sort of feel better and I feel more confident. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you like to look good?

</p><p>PATIENT: And well and feeling confident really means a lot in terms of how other people think about you. If you feel scared if you feel like you're costumed up and if you don't feel comfortable in what you're wearing - other people can sense it and I can sense it too. A lot of people are like that. They're not really being themselves. (inaudible) [43:16]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [That's kind of...] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess it's all kinds of things. Well anyway sometimes I worry about dressing for other people. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did you come dressed for me here?

</p><p>PATIENT: Ah no. I've been thinking about that and I feel good about the fact that I come with just whatever I'm wearing that day. Not dressed particularly for you. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It would bother you if you did that?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it just would seem kind of silly. It's just part of my day and that's the way it should be. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd feel silly if you'd said, "Oh gee, maybe I'll put on that shirt. I bet she'd...something like that." It'd be really silly.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I mean that would be ok if I was putting on a shirt but if it was a real hot day and I was just walking around in a pair of shorts and a tee shirt and I'd feel kind of stupid. I wouldn't feel bad about it...just why do it? You don't demand it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I said, "Wear that shirt" - something like that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Only you're not going to think any less of me and if you like this shirt that's ok too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So there's sort of got to be a balance between how much discomfort you'll have to feel in what you're wearing with like how you look.

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't like to feel uncomfortable when I have most of my clothes on. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you are?

</p><p>PATIENT: Are not. I also felt good when I looked in my sister's closet and she has 25 pairs of shoes and I have two.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Kind of smile to yourself?] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It just seems so ridiculous when you feel so good about you?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I can get by on two pairs of shoes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like somehow she'd feel crowded with so many.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well kind of...how can any body deal with themselves? On the other hand I'd like a lot more shoes too. It's funny. [46:01]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Both kinds of things.] (ph)

</p><p>PATIENT: I kind of feel good shopping for clothes - I don't feel guilty and I don't feel (inaudible) or anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It just feels good.

</p><p>PATIENT: Nice clothes are very nice. When somebody gets so dependent (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: They have to have them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah so concerned. I was so glad when I moved a month ago. I just put everything I own in about two or three suitcases - all my clothes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What made you throw it all out?

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh yeah...but it felt great.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did we (ph) have that much? That's all I have...I'm not so loaded down

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Two trips everything I moved...I own in the world. Stick it all in my car. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you're off.

</p><p>PATIENT: Off around the block. [Central Park] apartment.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But you were saying, like there's a certain sense that you feel free to just have only a few suitcases instead of being weighted down with all this crap. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah it does. Possessions kind of - possessions tie you down. I mean it's nice to have a lot of nice things too but it's also nice to be portable.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I like to be able to be free to move and get around.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's nice when you want to move to have not much to move.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It sure it. You have a kind of a "fatness" will all kind of extra...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. There's so much junk you can accumulate too. It's nice to trim off all the s**t that you don't want. [48:22]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Paying (ph) down just what you want.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I wouldn't mind having a lot of nice furniture but I wouldn't have anything to do with it right now. But that's sort of ok still. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like that (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah that's nice. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like it wouldn't fit with you right now because you only have twice the...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: When you're in (inaudible) is that what you mean?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well just extra stuff. Like all those shirts I've been carrying around for years that I never wear - kind of stuff.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Did you get rid of them?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't want to wear any of them - I left them in my closet. The people who moved into the room after I was (inaudible) I don't care. All these clothes that I've been toting around for so long...it seems like (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that the kind of thing that you...

</p><p>PATIENT: It's all that I've had that I've gotten rid of. Oh what else...I guess (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like 23 extra pairs of shoes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I [still have to] (ph) sell some of the books that I haven't used. I sort of still carry around three boxes of books that I never look at. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd like to get rid of them?

</p><p>PATIENT: I don't know on the other hand I sort of feel for some reason that I should keep them. I don't know quite why. My tie with the past. All my college books. All my biology texts. My guess is as soon as I break from the whole thing, I'll get rid of them - if I ever do. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But it feels like right now that you're still to have them?

</p><p>PATIENT: It's a little bit of a guilt feel. I don't really feel like I want them - they don't do anything for me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't want them but I have to keep them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. I ought to keep them. [50:28]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I ought to really have all this stuff.

</p><p>PATIENT: After all.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: After all.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm a biologist and I have my library.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: After all I'm a biologist and I have to have my biology library. I mean you have too. Even if they're books I didn't like.

</p><p>PATIENT: Never look at.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And I never ever look at. I've got to have them - so it'll sort of look like I am a biologist. 

</p><p>PATIENT: So there they are.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So there they are - heavy.

</p><p>PATIENT: Fills up the bookcase too.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It gives my bookcase something to do. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I never like reading books. (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I just seems like I can never really ever get involved. Sometimes I could. When I could it was fun. But I always hated libraries for some reason. I'm not quite sure why. I just never really felt much initiative to go out and find books that I liked. So as a book came along and I'd read it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But the feeling of who wants to - I don't want to have to go back to...

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah and I just never liked reading very much. I always liked hanging around doing nothing, playing ball, things like that - unless it was (inaudible) watching television (inaudible)...in the past.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: I like reading a lot more now then I used too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What seems different? [52:36]

</p><p>PATIENT: Well just...it's just. I still don't read that much but I just - I feel that I know what I like better. Now I'm more willing to go out and get something I want. And I'm also much more into a whole lot of different things now. 

</p><p>And there are certain things I can read now that I wouldn't of ever interested me. Well I've grown up a little bit since I was 7 years old or 10 years old or 12 years old.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying like one of the ways that's really having a better sense of what it is you like to read about or...?

</p><p>PATIENT: And plus I have a much larger scale (ph) of the things I'd like to read. [53:22]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Plus your interests have grown and you know more where you're at.

</p><p>PATIENT: Still I don't like it as much as I do just sitting around and talking. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that ok?

</p><p>PATIENT: Is that ok? Yeah I think so. I mean books are just...I don't know. I sort of tell myself books are a service that substitute in a lot of ways (inaudible). In a lot of ways that's true...it is very intellectual. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Getting away from life (ph) participating in...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well on the other hand I also tell myself that because it feels good - because then I don't have to read that much. I am sure (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [Will you be good enough?] (ph) and sure again whether it's ok not to read that much or...

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess what's really horrible is to have to be forced to read something. Something that you don't want to read.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: To have too. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah. To have to write book reports. I guess that turned me off too. I always used to hate that. Book reports and then you have to get up in front of the class and read it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: A dumb book report on a dumb old book.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yeah.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Didn't like to have to read them and didn't like to have to prove you read it. Well it's time to finish.

</p><p>PATIENT: It sure is. [We're awake.] (ph) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Alright. [We'll see you] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Ok.

</p><p>PATIENT: [You need to get your door...] (ph)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Bye. (ph) [55:45]

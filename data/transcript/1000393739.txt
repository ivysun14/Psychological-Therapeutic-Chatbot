<p>PATIENT:  (2-minute silence)  I was just thinking about FYLR, I don't know partly wondering—.  I know there's something constantly that I'm not happy with about her and her attitude and so forth that we've talked about.  And so it doesn't, in a way it's not so much of a problem because I have to accept it, but some days, I don't—, I think I feel more annoyed.  And I know one day here I was talking about how I wanted to be—,  I just thought I was being more critical of her that day than I might be another day and—.  I was just thinking the last day or two she seemed stranger than usual with me, or more awkward or moody.  I suppose that would be it mainly.  And I think also I've been more critical in my own thoughts, although I don't know that it—, I was just wondering if it shows and if that's why she's more moody.  Or is she moody first and then I feel the way I do.</p>

<p>And, I don't know, somehow I think I have guilty feelings about her, because last night I had a dream about her, which is the only time I think I've ever dreamed about her.  And, and she was the only one in the dream. And it was definitely concerned with what she was going to do next year.  And throughout the dream she kept saying, "I'm going to live with,"  I don't know, "somebody who likes me.  And then I'm going to work at such-and-such a place because they like me."  And I don't know, it was just done in such a way that I think in the dream I keep feeling what she's really saying to me it, "You don't like me."  (pause)</p>

<p>And I d_, I think maybe I don't really like her and, and that might be why I feel guilty.  And it might be why she's found it so hard to work there this year, despite the fact she doesn't agree with a lot of things.  Maybe she could have overcome them if I had liked her better.  (silence)</p>

<p>Another thing that I keep noticing the last day or two—.  I've noticed it a lot, but I've—, I don't know, sometimes I just notice it and then forget about it, because it's the way she always is, but when we are in the faculty room she'll talk to me, and maybe once in a while she'll talk to somebody else if we're on the opposite side of the room, but—, and she might talk to people when I'm not there, but if I'm there, she'll just withdraw from conversations.  And it isn't even then being quiet and, and  listening, she just acts like she's not really interested.  And it will happen abruptly if she's been interested and then I come in, and she just stops.</p>

<p>And it made me think of how I used to feel when I was in the faculty room when I worked with FHYZ, because I used to feel very intimidated by her.  And somehow I felt she didn't want me to participate when she was there.  She was supposed to be the one in the center, and I was supposed to support her but otherwise be kind of quiet.  And I don't know whether I imagined this or not, but in any case I was quiet.  But I was (exhales), I don't know—.  It's sort of a sullen thing that she did that I don't think I did, and then I keep thinking I don't really feel that way.  I don't want her to be just sitting there feeling that way toward me, if that is how she's feeling.  I think once I used to feel that way with FEIZ, but FEIZ just would never have felt that way, and I think I changed.  And no matter what I do do to bring her out or to be quiet, so she can keep talking or anything, it just happens this way, and, and this has been bothering me lately.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it just came to me, too, that I think I feel guilty about her sometimes because in the fall—, I don't think I've done it lately, but it's kind of too late to change now, uhm, change what's happened as a result of it.  But I think in the fall sometimes, no matter how hard I tried not to do this, because I knew I was inclined to, I would still take things out on her that bothered me, or my need for authority.  And here I was over her, so I think sometimes I took it out on her.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about something, and I'm not sure if it's really telling you something in light of what I've been saying the last few days,  but the then thing I thought of was a remark that FBS once made that she wondered if FYLR felt the way she did because she doesn't feel she has any friends at school.  And certainly, uh i_, for our floor, uhm, FBS's friendly with her but they don't do things together after school.  And Barbara, FBS's first assistant, and she didn't do things together, and then I haven't done things with FYLR.  But then I'm not in co—, I didn't start out doing things with FEIZ either.  And I don't know whether part of that because of my way or just what, but anyway, I kept thinking with FYLR it might help to have her over for tea or something sometime.  Because it shows a certain sign of friendliness that I think helps.  But then I didn't really want to do it, I guess, and, and I keep thinking that I can't really, because I'm always here.  And either I'm going home and then coming right back or else I'm coming directly here.  And it just wouldn't work out.</p>

<p>And it's something, I don't know, it—.  I was thinking about the fact that it's something that FBS does, and she did it with Barbara, too, with whom she never really did feel friendly, so it's very much the calculated thing, but on the other hand it's good policy.  And so, I don't know, my thought has always been if I don't feel it sincerely then I don't want to do it.  But it does make things better.  She always has a better relationship, and I think it comes partly from this attitude.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What's the message for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, for a while there I was wondering if I was trying to say something about having to come here all the time and see what I'm giving up, or something like that.  Because it also came to mind that today we had watched the XPS at school, because somebody had a TV.  And then FBS asked me if I'd like to go out for lunch afterwards, which I would have liked to do, but I couldn't because it would have meant I'd be late here.  I don't know, it seemed like maybe it was on my mind more "I have to come here so I have to give up things I'd rather do."  And also since I can't, at least I never do say anything further, it always seems rather unfriendly, or abrupt or something that so often I can't do it.  And it's always at a specific time I can't.  (clears throat) (pause)</p>

<p>For some reason that made me think of the time that—, I suppose I was thinking that I haven't had lunch with FYLR much either after school on Fridays, because of the same situation.  But I'm sure she wonders about that, too, sometimes, or maybe did once, probably doesn't now.  And, and then I thought about FEIZ and the time she visited this year.  And we had arranged to go out to eat and nothing had been said about anybody else and, I think I feel sort of, I don't know if would as much now, but I know I did then feel dog-in-the-mangerish about her.  That I didn't want to share her at that time with anyone else, and at the last minute she'd said, "Oh, maybe we should ask FBS, too," which would have been a nice thing to do and right now I think of it as—, it wouldn't have—, it would—, it might have made more fun and certainly not less.  But yet at the time, I guess I was jealous or something and I just didn't want her to come, and—.  It was a built in situation that I could push on why FBS couldn't come.  Because at that point we had to be sure to ask way ahead for permission to do something unusual like that, and she hadn't done it.  Uhm, but yet it might have worked out if, if I'd, I'd might have been able to think of a way to make it work out otherwise.</p>

<p>ANALYST: In any case, you talk about coming her as something you have to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  Yeah, it, uhm, well sometimes I think of it that way, but it—, differently than today and I don't— (exhales).  I don't know, before I went to watch the XPS and FBS asked me if I wanted to go out to lunch, I didn't have that feeling, as—, at least openly I didn't have it.  And then I just feel it had something to do with the fact that I had to withdraw from being with other people or— (sniff).  (pause)</p>

<p>Well today, too, was different.  I was just thinking of something else, but because today, part of all this depended on being able to just be spontaneous, and take things as the developed, and I was sorry not to be able to be.  But I was just thinking that coming here everyday means that often these situations can arise, and wa—, often what I've done is, just not ever gotten into the middle of one so they never arise.  For instance, very often I might not even have gone down to watch the XPS, because I knew that it might lead to something else, and I would be sorry not to be able to and—.  But I wonder if sometimes I've kept myself withdrawn because it makes a nice excuse to, and that sort of is the way I've always been.  And that with a little extra effort I needn't be as withdrawn as I've kept myself.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking, too, that sometimes lately I've thought about how am I going to do it next year when people are all assuming I have all the time on my hands that I want, and—.  I mean this year it's been easier, since I just disappear after school.  I don't know, but anyway I started wondering what I talked about yesterday after I thought that, and I couldn't remember.  Or I can't remember.  And it, it's interesting to me, because I know each day I've been really continuing something, and yet each day I forget what it is, for a while.  (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, it seems to me that, uh, in a very real way you're doing to me what you feel FYLR is doing to you.  You're saying things but, uhm, you're going through the motions.  Now, you mention this dream, a little later just now you mention you have exactly the same concern you attributed to FYLR in the dream.  You make no connection between you.  You think of yesterday when you, when in effect you rebelled here.  And you forget that, which is another kind of rebellion.  And I don't think it's just accidental that you think today about having to come here, that you're being made to do something that you don't want to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  First I was just thinking that if I'm saying I'd, I had to come here and I left people that like me to come here, an— and assumingthis, eh, I'm feeling the way I think FYLR feels then it means I'm saying that you don't like me, and I don't like being made to do things by you.  And then I was just wondering, yesterday I was just feeling the desire to fight, but today I'm wondering why yesterday I had that feeling.</p>

<p>ANALYST: And why today you continue it—

PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: —but in a very disguised and indirect way.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I also remember at the end of yesterday I told you something that I didn't really want to tell you, and yet I—, and I had to convince myself that I was telling you for other reasons, but really I told you I think because I was afraid I'd gone too far and so now I had to start being good.  And I suppose that would all be part of why now I disguise it more.  I remember now yesterday what I was thinking about.  Why after feeling close to you as I was—, and I don't remember what weeks now, at least I guess last week, that I would feel like rebelling this week but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>I don't know whether it just doesn't make sense to me now or—.  I remember I was feeling again a feeling I had with my father that I don't feel right now.  Maybe that's why it doesn't make sense.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>Instead of thinking more about why I'm feeling the way I have been this week here, or today anyway, I started thinking about school and I don't remember how I started, but I ended up thinking about the fact that FBS seems to bring out one type of quality in the boys she has and I seem to bring out another type, which I suppose is normal but I always wish I could do—, bring out some of the qualities she does. Or I wondered do mine have it.  Because I—, I think I tend to bring out sort of serious studious kind of children and she pulls out the more, I don't know, it's not exactly imaginative, but—.  I don't know, maybe it's just kind of the childlike things they'd say.  Whereas it seems like mine always weed out those things and say things that are more adult oriented and— (clears throat).  A_ we—, I was thinking of this on the basis of something that happened today at assembly, which was on the topic of JCF and then what it's about.  And this was first grade assembly, but they were having participation (slurs word), participation (repeats more clearly) from different classes.  Which was supposed to be set. I mean there was supposed to be one boy from a class who spoke.  But it got started and then the boy in the play who was sort of the chairman, got mixed up and people who hadn't been planned to speak began to.  And some of the thing that her boys said were really cute, but obviously childlike, because things like, "Well the bugs should stay in their holes," and things like that that, uhm—. They were very serious about it but yet, in a way, they didn't make sense whereas mine would only say things that, I don't know, would make sense in an adult idea of how they made sense.  And they weren't necessarily mature children.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, it sounds like you right now, here.  Instead of simply saying you just really don't want to figure out why you're feeling the way you are, you illustrate it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause)  You mean by talking around it?</p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, you make a certain kind of sense and so forth.  But it's indirect again.  It's a way to hide a feeling that must be behind it.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (pause) Well, the feeling I think of is the one I had over last weekend and the beginning of the this week that I was feeling ways that didn't make sense to me really.  And I couldn't stand feeling that it didn't make sense.  (pause)</p>

<p>And it seems to me that's part of why I don't want to think about it today, because the feeling I had each day, this week, was maybe I got at something connected with the feelings, but—.  I just felt each day I wanted to say here's the feeling and here's where it came from and here's what it is and really label it.  (pause)</p>

<p>Because then that makes me think—, and since I couldn't, I'm sure I got mad.  And then I just wonder how long I was mad at you and how long I've wanted to rebel or fight.  And if it just happened yesterday I do— I don't know if I was feeling that way before but if yesterday was—.  I don't know, I mean in other words if it didn't happen immediately after the week before, well then—.  Well here I am labeling it again, but it would seem it came partly out of blaming you for something I wanted to do and couldn't do.  (pause)</p>

<p>I just remembered something else, too, which must be part of this wanting to rebel, but it just—, I couldn't believe I was doing it, and I didn't get far enough to actually carry through on it.  But this morning I was thinking that, uhm, sometimes Charlie likes to meet me down here and we go out to dinner somewhere, but since I've been coming early on Friday we don't do it on Fridays.  And so I was just thinking today, this morning when I got up, I wonder if Charlie would want to meet me and then we could go out to dinner which meant I was assuming again I would be coming at 5:00.  And I know I would have realized anyway once I got to school, because it's now almost habit that on Fridays I clean up quickly so I can leave on time to get her but—.  And I, and anyway I realized before then, but it—, I don't know, it just seemed kind of strange to me that I would have done the same thing again.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  W_ why can't you believe it?  That's the real question.  Why is that so hard to believe?  That you want to do something that you don't recognize?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know, I guess just that I'd make that mistake again.  (pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe I'm not really recognizing why I'd make that mistake, because I keep thinking now I—, I mean obviously in a way I didn't want to come again, but—.  (pause)</p>

<p>It's almost like there are two me's, and what I can't believe is that one me would let myself get away with it again.  Even to the point to think it out a little bit.  (pause)</p>

<p>And that reminds me how I felt that Friday when I did do it, of I don't know, this—, finding it hard to believe I'd done it because somehow I assume I have rigid control over myself in that way.  So somehow it meant a lack of control.  (pause)</p>

<p>And the control is always been more important that what I want.  And they seem to be separate.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I, I was just thinking about the whole combination of the way peoples' ideas are now on that subject, and how my parents' was, and how old fashioned they were, in a way, in that sense.  That it never occur—, I don't think it ever occurred to them that maybe there should be some correspondence between what a child wanted and the control he exerted.  It was just simply very often the want went against the control and he should have the control first.  And never that there could be any possible way the two worked together.  And now it seems to me that a lot of the ideas on bringing up children today are based on making the two work together.  Or helping the child in such a way that they do come out to work together.  (silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you see I see what's going on as just a continuation.  You've felt very strongly about my explaining your discontent, as a result of your still not having a penis.  Didn't like the idea, you didn't want to have to accept it.  And finally you felt that I can't make you accept it and then you, in effect I think since then, you are really showing me that in fact I can't make you.  That you can control yourself and you can not remember things and you can, uh, keep a tight reign which you sound like you're doing.  And that's your way to show me.  That's carrying on what you called a power struggle.  That way you feel you have power.  And I don't.  (pause)</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And that makes me—, well I know I already started to say it one time about how I thought I'd come to understand that and—, but I still have this feeling about having a penis.  And that part of what bothered me when you said it was that in effect it was—, you weren't telling me so much as just the fact and I didn't think of it before meant I hadn't accepted it, or understood it really.  That somehow I fooled myself into thinking I was when I'd really not at all.  (silence)</p>

<p>And I can see if it were something I didn't want to hear then immediately you would be—, I'd put you in the role of being there to make me hear it or that would be the same as accept it.  And so then I would start fighting, so I wouldn't accept it.  And I can, I can understand what's happened since, but—.  I guess part of what I didn't want to hear was how I'd been tricking myself. Becau—, we—, and that's partly what I'm saying to myself as a result of what you said, but—.  And it still is something I don't want to hear.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

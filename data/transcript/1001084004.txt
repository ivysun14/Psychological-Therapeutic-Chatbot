<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what's new?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, not much.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Things are going pretty well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Spirits have been pretty good overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's been pretty good. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll take it, considering our baby is a month old now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh congratulations.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I didn't know, that's new since we talked last.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it is, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did you have a boy or girl?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Boy.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh so you have one of each now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, ah no we have.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Two boys.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Two boy, yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what did you name him?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I have a good friend who is [NAME OTHER] so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Is he sleeping much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh you're kidding.  You're so lucky.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He is the mellowest guy you ever met.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's great. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He doesn't really cry, which is.  I mean he just does one of the, eh, eh, eh, and then he waits.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He'll do it again if we don't come.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's wonderful.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's been really nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how often is he waking up at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's up, let's see, we feed him, we do the dream feed, they call it, in between 9 and 10, so we kind of wake him up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Feed him and then he goes back to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then basically he's eating while he's sleeping.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just kind of top him off.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then he gets up, right now he's been getting up at one thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then four thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh that's not too bad.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then at six.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're wife is doing okay with the?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She's doing fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, she's tired and a little grumpy but she's, for the most part, really really doing well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This has been night and day from what it was last time.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER] that's right, he was not a good sleeper?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He was a good sleeper but we were, she had really been kind of put through the ringer with her birth, with the birth, and then we just, it was such a new, a change for us.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was really difficult.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  It's a huge change.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Huge.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I don't think anybody, I was never prepared for it and I don't think anybody really is.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's no way you can really predict or estimate how it's going to effect you, it's just, I don't know</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but I think the effect, especially if you're lucky enough to have a good baby like that, it does get easier.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, it's been really pretty nice.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds great.  So you're getting to enjoy him then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, yeah, you know, it's, I think when you're in it, it's hard to remember to just be grateful and happy and, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Look at this miracle and all that, you know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, for the most part, it's gone really well.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good and are you sleeping at night or are you waking up when she wakes up?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She, yknow, I did with [NAME OTHER] and I would do, because she, her breast milk didn't come in and the same thing with this guy, so she's bottle feeding, so with [NAME OTHER] I was up, I had the two a.m. shift.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, just because she was in such bad shape.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But she has not wanted me to do that, I've asked several times.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She wants to do it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're able to sleep through the night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, which is great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Lucky guy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think she's figured out me, who I am.  I know I'll do it but I'm not as good when I'm tired.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it is hard.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're a lot tougher than we are.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think so too.   I'm a wuss when it came to those night time wakening, I'd get grumpy and irritable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So irritable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I even have a hard, I do the 9 o'clock, I have a hard time with that sometimes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He falls asleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Well, hopefully, he'll keep sleeping longer and longer and it will get easier and easier.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So is your energy level during the day pretty decent?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not bad, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I actually, we had talked, this is my, I need to apologize here, we had talked about going down to 10, 10, taking just one pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I started thinking about it after our visit, you know, there really has been an improvement, at a pill at an half, so I didn't end up going down to 10.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I kept meaning to call you and I told [NAME OTHER] about it and I feel bad I didn't call.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh don't worry about that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so you felt pretty good just staying at the 15.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I was actually thinking about that exhaustion we had talked about has gone away.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was actually thinking about maybe going to two pills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just because there still is, I'm curious to see, there still is like some, some real periods of depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know if Lexapro would help with that or not.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, it could.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Certainly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How long do those periods last usually?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're, you know, they're more like moments where, you know, and it's typically on the weekends or when I have, you know, when I'm tired and all that but</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, maybe a couple of hours.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I seem to climb out of it again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I should qualify what I say, increase of those may or may not help.  I'm not sure, it's reasonable to try if you want to, just to see if it takes away those kind of periods.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if it does, great, if it doesn't, you can always back down to the 15 again so.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Your appetite has been stable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fine, yeah, everything, sleeping is fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, concentration and focus are pretty good?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that is fine, yap</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Do you find yourself worrying excessively about things?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, not really.  I mean, you know, the reason I came in and all that paranoia and all that has become very manageable.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The obtrusive thoughts</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are non existent or they're kind of faded?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They're there, I'm kind of waiting for them to be completely gone.  I'm waiting for that day, you know, where it's just like I wake up one day and I think geez.  It's kind of like thinking about a drink, I haven't thought about that in six months.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I'm like wow this is great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think that'll happen.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Also going up on the Lexapro may help with that.  Higher doses of Lexapro are more likely to eliminate those kind of thoughts.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And those kind of thoughts I've realized are produced by those periods of depression.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's usually the case but they usually go together.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  What about, are you getting some enjoyment and pleasure just out of day to day activities?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I am, that's gotten a lot better with like just playing with [NAME OTHER] and stuff.  We have a lot of fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Is he [AGE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's so [AGE] right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's a fun age but a trying age isn't it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's so much harder than having a baby.  We never realized.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I always though, oh, no way.  Having a baby is like cake compared to this.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There's different stages aren't there.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Each has its own unique challenges.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So you're having fun though for the most part.  No suicidal thoughts?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, huh uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Any side effects at this point that you can tell from the Lexapro?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I think if anything, the one thing that just taking medication in general has kind of effected is my, it's kind of hard to, like you know so in AA we talk about principals and things that we do on a daily basis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And it's kind of been a shift in my view of myself and what I need to do on a daily basis, like I've noticed I've kind of slacked off a little bit.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> On taking medication?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, on just like my approach to what I used to do on a daily basis.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With AA and stuff.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And so I'm not saying I'm disregarding that, I'm aware of like how much do I rely on mediation and how much do I rely on what I need to do as an alcoholic.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, I don't if it makes sense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It does make sense.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's been kind of uncomfortable in that sense.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> In that it's just shifted, there's an adjustment period where I kind of figure out who I am in the context of AA and medications. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Approach to life.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, so let me ask you, the meetings you go to, I know in some meetings people are open to people taking medications if they need it, others are not so open, how are the folks at the meetings you attend?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, it's not really a topic that I've broached.  I kind of know, I know with some crowds what the answer would be and with others I don't really know.  I'm kind of just, I'm not talking about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm kind of looking at it as an experiment right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that's reasonable.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, somebody that can be in meetings and still take AA the way I need to take it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But also be taking medication.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then having maybe a year down the road I can share what my experience has been.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think that's very reasonable. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, in talking with other folks, what I've found is it really varies from meeting to meeting.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some meetings people are very open and understand that, you know, medication is not, there's a difference between a medicine and a drug, you know, this is not something you can abuse or misuse.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's not addictive.  It's something like wearing glasses that if you need it, it helps to make you better, great, go for it, do whatever works. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> At other meetings, there are still some folks who I think maybe just don't understand.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The type of medication.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't get it</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Most people don't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I thought it was like you could get high off it or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And you really don't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you can't.  I mean you take a bucket load of it, you wouldn't get high and I think once people understand the medication then they don't have a problem with it because there's no risk of relapsing or it doesn't increase the risk, if anything it decreases the risk of relapsing because if you're not so depressed.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You have a better shot at staying sober so I think your approach is fine.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think the criticism is and I think there's a point here and it's kind of what I'm saying about what I've gone through is that you take medication and then you kind of think you're cured or you think you're able to slough off a little bit and that's the danger.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's one of them, it's not just that you maybe get high, it is that you, the side effect is that you kind of, you stop doing some of the things that make you feel better that maybe have a less than immediate effect, they're more subtle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> You know, going to meetings every week is more of a subtle effect.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Then you know what I mean.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Absolutely and that could be a trap for some people if they become so reliable on the medication that they don't really think they need to anything in life to stay healthy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That could be a trap, you're right so, but I think your wise enough to see that is a trap and you're unlikely to fall into it.  You'll keep doing those other things too, so good.  What else?  Any other side effects like headaches, sexual dysfunction, excessive sweating at night, dry mouth, upset stomach?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing, okay.  Excellent.  So it sounds like, oh, what about stress levels?  Besides having a baby at home and a [AGE] at home, anything else particularly stressful these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you still seeing [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Regularly?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Once a week or every couple of weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, every couple of weeks at this point. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and that's going well?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, okay.  As far as you know, that's probably going to continue for the time being?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And how many meetings are you going to these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One to two a week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, good.  You've got over fifteen years sobriety.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I just had sixteen.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Congratulations, that's excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So, I think we talked before, you had a sponsor but you dropped him.  Have you found anyone else yet?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, and [NAME OTHER] and I have been talking about that.  Actually that was, I met with [NAME OTHER] yesterday and we kind of talked about, I'm going to wait to see her for about two or three weeks, then I'm going to try to kind of get reengaged in AA with, you know, coincidentally, I went to a meeting last night and there was an opportunity to chair it for a year, so I took that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's up here in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh cool.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And there was some, there's one guy I was talking to last night that may end up being somebody I can, I have a friend, I still have a friend who's got a couple more years than I do and I call him every Tuesday and Thursday morning at six thirty and we talk.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent, excellent.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm sticking around.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, yeah.  Have you ever chaired meetings before?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Okay, so you sound like you've done a lot of good things for yourself.  Work's going okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, work's fine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Excellent, it's like you've done really well.  So it sounds like now it's just a matter of fine tuning and finding the optimal dose for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again I think it's reasonable to try the 20.  When you increase the dose, it'll probably take roughly a week to notice any difference.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Three to seven days and then the benefits typically will kind of build over four to six weeks then kind of level off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So unless you have any side effects which is very unlikely, you probably want to give it four to six weeks before you decide if you want to stay at that dose or cut back.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If you were to have any side effects which would be very unusual at this point, normally people get side effects, it's when they first start the medicine not when they bump up the dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But if you did get side effects, they'd probably be very mild and go away within a day or two.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if there's anything more than mild or lasts for more than a day or two, you know, call me but that's not likely to happen.  You'll probably notice no difference the first few days then, hopefully, over the next few weeks, if it's working well, you'll just find those intrusive thoughts kind of receding to the background and those periods of depression just kind of fade into the background as well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And 20 mg of Lexapro is the maximum recommended dose.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We can go higher if we need to.  In other words, what they do with these medicines when they're trying to determine the optimal doses, is they give a wide range of doses to people and then ask them to monitor their response.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And what they get is what's called a bell curve, are you familiar with that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And so, you know, in terms of dosages, so a typical bell curve would be something like this for Lexapro.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Where, you know, the low range is typically 5 mg  Some people feel better at 5, the average is 10, the maximum recommended dose is 20, they go two standard deviations from the middle here and that's how they determine the therapeutic dose but there are some people out here at 30 or 40 that feel better than the 20 but most people don't so that's why they say the maximum recommended dose is 20.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But let's say you feel better but still not as good as you like at 20, we can try 25, 30 if we need to.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So we'll just kind of play it by ear and try to find the dose that works best for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let me see how I wrote the prescription too.  Why don't I get you a new prescription because you're going to go through it faster.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I don't think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You sound like you're doing really well.  Do you want to go with a 20 mg tablet?  Oh, we may have to with Kaiser. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They usually require us to use just one pill per day if it's available.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if that's all right with you, we'll go with the 20.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If we need to fine tune the dose later, we can.  And are you taking it in the morning still?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and put like a years worth of refills on here.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So if it is the best dose, you won't have to worry about another prescription for a while.  If you need a new one, I'll just get you a new prescription if we change the dose again.  Here you go.  Anything else today that you wanted to talk about?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  What I'm thinking is, if it's okay with you, maybe we should set something up for four to six weeks down the road.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When we get to that kind of plateau and see if you're liking this and if you are, we'll keep it going and if not, we can adjust some more.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, that puts us somewhere in August.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It'd be one of the first few weeks.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Eight a.m. is a good time for you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it's great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Let's see maybe what we should do is to go out like six weeks, by then we should feel the full effect.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And that week I've got a bunch of times at eight o'clock.  I've got a Friday again, is Friday great</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Fridays are great.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  That is [DATE].  So do you have plans for the weekend?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not really, baby.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Do you know if you're going to have more kids yet or.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> She says she's closed for business.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE], oh boy.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we'll see though.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, she might change her mind when she gets some rest.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Would you like to have more?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm good with two.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think I'm good.  There's a lot of</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's so different today than, well I am older than you, but when we were kids, you know, people had bigger families and it's easier today.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The expense and the time commitment, it's a challenge. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's incredible.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you've got four right?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I've got four.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you know, we have friends, you know, around here, that I just, I'm amazed and there's still some large families that have like ten kids. I don't know how they do it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I don't either.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because we're just running, you know, with our kids and, you know, between birthday parties and sports and school activities, there's just always something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Are your kids in school up here, do they go to public school?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I've got, my two older ones are in high school and my youngest one is going to be a first grader at the elementary school and my little guy is at preschool.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it pretty good?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, the schools are really good.  Where do you live?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Over on [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So your kids will probably go to [DEIDENTIFIED], do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's an excellent school.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [DEIDENTIFIED] which is excellent.  They will go to the same high school that's here, I think, with all the boundary changes, I can't remember.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, there's that new one going in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And the new one, yeah, I don't know, my little ones are going to go to the new one just because of we live over in [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But the schools are excellent up here, they're really some of the best in the state.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's why we moved, one of the reasons we came, that is good to hear, but</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The only problem I'll warn you about is that there have been some changes in terms of there's more drug and alcohol problem up here than there used to be.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just because, what I hear it's because of the affluence, a lot of parents are commuting and so kids are latchkey kids.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And my kids were exposed to pot already in middle school. And alcohol.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No kidding.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  And I'm starting to see kids on cocaine in high school now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Wow. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So that's a problem just to be aware of.  A lot of parents aren't aware of it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And so as they get older, keep a close eye because we're learning, but uh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I figured that would happen as the neighborhood gets richer.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know it's everywhere but I hear it's a little more up here in [DEIDENTIFIED] than in certain places but there's always trade offs in any community.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's one other things.  Here's the card.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sure, anything before then, give me a call.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I sure will.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Take care.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You too.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thanks a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Congratulations again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thanks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bring a picture one of these times.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I will.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, see you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll bring him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That'd be great.  All right, see you.</p>

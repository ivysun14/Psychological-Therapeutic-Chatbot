<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Wow. I don't remember what I was talking about last time at all. However I have something on my mind. I think I mentioned that I was going to try and look and get some extra work outside of Microsoft and possibly reduce my hours. I have had it definitely confirmed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good!</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not the job part—my decision to make this decision.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There has been some massive changes in terms of corporate and philosophically I am...I'm not willing to leave them but I am willing to distance myself because I am deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's too bad!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm really disappointed how things are turning. Right now we had the all-time stock high, the most valuable company in the world, making a huge profit. The person who left us...the person who was with us for retail—he sort of (inaudible) way in the back of the day. He's known for being a very big visionary for things and for example that they would pay us overtime actually to learn how to do certain things like that and all kinds of stuff like that. Just above and beyond. Well he has moved on and that's not like a bad thing. Whatever challenges, he likes to move on to the next big thing and the person that they brought in did this whole, "Oh we're going to make sure you get your pay raises ahead of time," blahblah, this and that. And I was a little disappointed with what I got, but that's fine. I heard yesterday that there are people who make substantially more and is a raise and that's fine. I knew that they were in different positions in the store and they may have been trying to normalize stuff because some people I know got 25 percent pay raises. I got three. [00:01:59]</p>

<p>So not a big deal because I actually make...because I have a master's degree, Microsoft counts that also within Microsoft philosophy. I have a master's, therefore I make more money than most people do. I've been there eight years, obviously that part too. But (pause) we've got somebody new who's been there for a few months now and there have been some changes, enough that he actually apologized to the [Dow Jones] (ph) last week. He took one look at our stores after a couple of years and he's like, "This all bloated (ph). There are people standing around doing nothing." So he cut back our hours. There's a hiring freeze, there's a promotion freeze, no more training. This is the time of year where—and I feel weird talking about trade secrets like this but this is not that big of a deal—but statistically we sell more computers in August than we do in December. [00:02:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like back to school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because December is a big time for portable electronics, smaller electronics. We do a lot but reduced year after year. And they substantially cut it back, a lot, and when we did tax free we were understaffed for that. We had a bunch of other things that it's just been really bad. And the thing is our business is better. We're doing better and better but he's cutting things back and he's forcing our management to have to deal with how to explain some of this stuff. For example, we no longer teach classes at 8 am anymore. This was a great thing for me, I believed in this, because people could [surf at the outright] (ph), stop off at the store and learn something, and then go to their jobs. No more 8 am's. </p>

<p>All of this stuff. People who were...just cutting back hours and things that don't even influence me but make me feel like, "Wow." Even if I felt like that doesn't bother me because it doesn't affect me, it doesn't matter because a company that will do this will do other things. There is somebody who was supposed to transfer to California. All of their stuff is moving to California—hiring freeze. Yep. All of their stuff is on a moving truck to California. There is no more being able to move. I can't transfer. This is why, by the way, I couldn't figure out why they never called me back from the other store. I didn't know that. Most of the middle level management didn't understand why this was going on until becoming...and technically this guy –– he apologized to the Dow Jones that he made a mistake, he didn't understand that these are non-traditional staffing models, blah blah blah. [00:04:47]</p>

<p>And he had a track history. I never knew what his track history was until this point but it's really bothering me. It's bothering me a lot. There are people that I work with who count on a fixed...count on 40 hours a week for their income. They're being moved to 32. Which they're trying to position it as, "We're trying to give you the...letting people first volunteer to go 32, that way you can have some work/life balance." That only floated for so long because in summer is when people want work/life balance. They're like, "Wow! I don't even have to use a vacation day if I don't want to? I mean, I don't get paid but I can take the time off? Great!" Well it's becoming really apparent everything is falling at the seams and so I really feel like our founder hasn't even been (inaudible) a year and already this person along with a couple of other, people who have a (inaudible) in our company. [00:05:50]</p>

<p>And it makes me very sad, especially being told that there is bloat, and this and that. And it's one of those things where that's what made us successful is we poured it in to our people. We poured it in to developing people. There were things that didn't work. Obvious when somebody was doing for a living that they really actually are doing something it just doesn't look like it. And I'm very angry and I've never felt this way towards corporate. I've been there eight years, I've seen it all. Especially with stock being at an all-time high, paying out dividends, this and that and then a lot of other just trickle down issues make me very, very worried that we're turning into Best Buy.</p>

<p>And a couple of people that I've spoken to who are on my level, in terms of not quite experience but definitely what we do, are very concerned as well. And I've never had a two week feeling of panic before like this but I'm sort of testing the waters. I actually called...I Skyped a friend of mine to find out what was going on with them. And just a couple things (inaudible) everybody is feeling very, very nervous. So it's not just me overreacting. It's a lot more of that. So it makes me very much wanting to find something else right now. I may just say, "Hey you know what? Schedule me one day a week. That way I can keep these amazing benefits, which who knows if we'll still have them. [00:07:38]</p>

<p>But I don't like the fact that they're trying to squeeze more profitability out of us because you treat people right and that's where the money comes from. We wouldn't have gotten to where we were if that wasn't true and I just feel very...whenever we've had new initiative there's always been people in corporate talking to us about it, do we (inaudible) video casting in everything that's going on. Question and answer sessions—nothing, like that. So I just don't feel so great about the company right now.</p>

<p>So that's been really fun and it's been in my mind a lot. A little bit of a yo-yo because I had heard that he had apologized—not to us but to the Dow Jones, which is even weirder—but the only reason why he apologized is because it leaked what was happening. [00:08:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. He apologized to the shareholders or to the...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He apologized to the Dow...there's a press...if you go Dow Jones Microsoft retail in there you'll see that he apologized to Dow Jones, the group that does the...that's what they said. They said a press release apology to them, not to the Microsoft employees for what they did. They claimed that some of the things weren't true and they may or may not be but everything I'm telling you is absolutely 100 percent true and is across the board. And I can't give everything I have to a company that is going to treat me that way. The reason why I have let them take a lot of liberties with my life and my health is because I believed in them. And I felt like what I did was really just not making a difference in lots of people's lives. People who I work with, people like (inaudible) and I just don't feel as stable about that anymore. And it's made me really sad. [00:09:42]</p>

<p>And of course this coincides with me having severe financial difficulties. I have been behind on car payments so I had to sell a lot of stock because if I didn't get caught they were basically get very upset about it. Well more than just very upset about it. So I sold a bunch of stock yesterday and hopefully we'll get that settled in time to keep them at bay. And hopefully the car sells soon and I promised myself that I did this to pay off a substantial part of the car so that it can be sold and I'm going to put it back in, or put it back in somewhere else, I don't know.</p>

<p>But it was sort of my last...I've been really trying hard. Although I have touched it over the years or sold about half of the stuff that I accumulated, it's been very important for me not to. Not just symbolically yes but it's also because I bought a lot of shirts at 26...$26. Yeah, this was $6.60 (chuckle) But when all is said and done I really feel like because of...this wasn't just great timing this was...between $26 a shirt and $6.60 I went to London for them. I went to Kentucky for them. I broke my hand for them. I don't really believe like, "Oh my God, I broke my hand for Microsoft." I did break my hand working there but the point though is I gave them everything and I really feel like it isn't (pause)...not that I ever thought would be immoral anyways but I feel like part of the reason why the stock prices there is I feel like I made a significant contribution, maybe not. Obviously [didn't do anything else] (ph) but I can feel like I did it. [00:11:33]</p>

<p>So the money is symbolic in terms of the work I've done. When I worked for big companies and I got (inaudible) stock—which they only paid your 401K, which I think is now illegal—but I never felt like...I mean I felt like I gave a lot to change the world but I never felt like when I saw the stock move one way or another that I felt like, "Wow, this is something that I did that influenced this." I've never felt, until a couple years ago, so powerful in the company and part of it was I was powerful in the company. I don't mind taking a step back because quite frankly my personal life is such that the responsibility of holding these long...these huge teleconferences and doing all this stuff, I couldn't. I (inaudible) my secret pretty soon that something was not going right at home. I had to really step back and it looks like I flaked out to a lot of people or that I sort of zoned out but it's not that at all. I had to take less responsibility so that I could make sure that people didn't see what was going on. Otherwise they would figure it out. Maybe not the specific problem but like the whole thing of my husband having to go home and take care of things all the time or whatever. They would figure it out eventually. [00:12:56]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices)...a different role?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, same job but I used to be a lot more influential. I used to be the person who would fly out—well one of many people. When they get trained, when (inaudible), and they would spend weeks with me and I would teach them the Microsoft...not just how to do something but also the Microsoft way to teach something to somebody because we have a whole philosophy about things. I think I may have mentioned that you never take—specifically the tablets—but in general you never take anything from somebody. You put your hands out and have them give it to you. Things like that. And it's all psychological. There's a very sound basis for this. And I teach people why something is this long and people would complain that they couldn't have training for more than this time and I explained to them, I teach these people, "This is a learning model. Learning model says cognitively, after this period of time, if you don't take a break, then you are actually (inaudible) diminishing (inaudible)." [00:14:04]</p>

<p>By the way, I have no real training. I just spent time reading a lot of journals and just keeping up on adult learning models. I guess it's not all that...I mean, in a way though, once you learn AI and machine learning stuff, it's not the same thing at all but you learn how to explain these kinds of things in terms of cut and...so I would explain this to people. I would influence a lot of creators. And I'm usually and actually better when I'm in those situations. I lecture well. The more of a crowd I have the better I am. I slow down and it's partially because I'm ritualistic on that kind of thing. I think I described this. Anything I do to almost prime myself for doing things, I don't talk too fast when I'm teaching. I don't speak in the way that I would do casually. How do I do it? I'm not entirely certain. Part of it, I mean, it's not just the, "I'm wearing heels, I'm doing this." I've had a couple dozen pairs of shoes that I used to use for this kind of thing. It isn't the high heels. It isn't the fact that I'm doing this. It's all priming. It's all setting it up for that experience. [00:15:22]</p>

<p>I don't do that stuff anymore. I don't have conference calls talking to people about different things. I specifically don't show people how to pore over numbers to find out where we are missing our...for example, if someone tries to book appointments, what happens is they'll look and see if there is an 8 am and then they decide that there's no 8 am that they won't bother, they'll check later—that's called abandonment. And I would show people how they can feed this abandonment statistic and figure out, "Okay, if there is this much of this and there's only this many things, this means on Mondays you need to have more appointments at 8 am," because people are like, "If I can't have 8 am, I'm having nothing."</p>

<p>I would teach this kind of stuff and it wasn't really anything official and luckily I trained enough people to pick up the (pause) (inaudible) plus just in general we've gotten a lot better systems in place we can see that. Before, instead of just me and my spreadsheet, now we actually have software that analyzes it. Yeah, much easier than reading thousands of numbers. [00:16:38]</p>

<p>But the point though is basically I can't do that. At some point I was hoping to be able to get my life back together again to do it again but to be honest when you have so much chaos in your life between help (ph) or husband or anything else, you can't focus. You can't be that efficient person who can be on top of the stuff all of the time. And so it was (pause) impeding my ability to (pause) do my job basically. And so I was like, "You know what? I think I'm going to pass this off," that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>But I believed in it and it makes me sad that things are going this way. (pause) And I'm just really frustrated. I'm not frustrated with any single person in my store, especially now that I'm starting to figure out that none of those people actually were given any information either. I don't think they can do anything either. I'm angry that things are not being driven locally. It's just frustrating. And I'm not saying that every business should be run this way but that's just the way we do things. We've always had...everything is the way we do things. And it's just very sad and I spent a lot of time thinking about whether or not I'm just being resistant to change. I don't think that's what it is. I have been on board with all kinds of weird changes in life, like with this kind of stuff. I think it's the fact that I feel like things are being changed specifically to try and extract more money and that makes me very (pause) frustrated. [00:18:34]</p>

<p>And it's not even my money. It's not like they're trying to extract more money from me. My hours are the same. I just upped them. It's the aggregate of the whole company and that influences the people [that you'll be] (ph) with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it influences the moral considerably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It also...well who was going to be attracted to these kind of jobs? We were able to get a lot of people that traditionally you would not get in retail ever—teachers who are there...they work occasionally a night and a weekend during the year but during the summer when they have sabbaticals, people who got PhDs who are lecturers at universities and haven't gotten tenured yet so they're looking to augment their salary—that's not going to happen anymore, not when the company isn't paying for their tuition or it isn't doing this or that, you know?</p>

<p>So like I said, it just makes me very, very sad. But instead of being like all the other people that I work with, trying to make jokes about it or being bitter, I think that I just need to find something else that I can put into and see it grow and get happiness from that because I don't have any influence over this. If I ran into that guy I'm sure I'll tell him my feelings. I have met most of the board except for one, not because I'm special but because for different events there were different people present. I went to school with one guy's son so I know him really well. (inaudible) But just casually, you work for the company that long, and you're around, you eventually meet people. I met the CEO a couple of times, that kind of thing. I'm not special. I eat in the cafeteria like all the rest of the people. And so I don't feel like it's like that anymore. (pause) I really don't and so I... [00:20:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's really too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was a really different, remarkable company and it makes me very sad. Especially literally this happening when this weekend the new store is opening downtown. They are priming people by giving them...they have a special Lenny Kra...we've always had rock stars play. We've never had the thing where to get people to stay [they'll try to get people to have] (ph) overnight lines to get in there so the first 2000 people will get free tickets to this concert. Yeah. That can get people to stand overnight in a line because they want something.</p>

<p>But just (pause) people are going to start catching up and makes me...it's really frustrating. So I've got to find something and so this week is me figuring out, first of all trying to do some networking, but also me figuring out what I can do and what I can find satisfaction in. Because I really do feel like to me (pause) I need to feel like I build and grow something. It doesn't have to be as big as a company. Part of it sometimes is just my students but I need to feel like I make a difference and a change in something. And if I can't immediately find a job to do that, I may just do some volunteering so I can feel like I'm doing something to make a difference because I just don't (pause)...and maybe this is sort of...this is definitely a trait I got from my dad but (pause) living a meaningful life. Like [if you just not] (ph) necessarily have your name attached to them but in the reconcile you know that you did something. You have that. [00:22:41]</p>

<p>And sometimes he over does it. I like to believe I'm better than he is on that. But it is pretty engraved in me. We have met with people on New Year's Eve at an airport so that they can sign deals because I guess something with the way contracts are they need to be taken care of by the end of wherever, so then New Year's Eve, 9 pm, to International Airport, notarizing stuff. So he really does push that a little far. But that wasn't his idea. He would just let people walk all over him for that. (pause) And I'm not as bad as that. (pause) But I do need to feel like I have some sort of meaning to what I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's too bad sort of that it's [draining out of you] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. I do have a couple of ideas in my head that a bunch of us have been discussing. It may very well be that I—again something that's free that I'll just do—is I've got some ideas for some apps that I may very well try to create. We'll see. I was...okay so we would actually...Microsoft cares enough about us that we have a break room that is not attached to the store. [00:24:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you've mentioned that. Yeah so you can really get a break.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, plus you'd never even see it because it's back where most people have their storage stuff. So a lot of times when people are there, sometimes there are students that are working on their homework or whatever, and we were discussing how much the tablet has really changed certain people who are [kinesthetic groomers] (ph) but for math that's never been really a big way of learning, ever and I was explaining how I used to show people how to do things with polynomials with flash cards so you can move it around. And we were discussing this concept—a couple of us—of doing certain types of apps where you would physically move things on the screen, like for meteorologists.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, like for little kids, those [inaudible] rods, the different colored tubes but it's like the (inaudible). [00:25:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like (inaudible) if you wanted your row swapping, it will only let you move things that are proper operations or if you want to be able to do something, like if you're trying...various different mathematical things where we permit (ph)—and this is where things get kind of funny—because a couple of us realized that we need to get the right grouping of people if we were going to do this. Because you have to have the people who do math which is great, the people that know specifically the programming but then also you need the graphics issues, along with other stuff. But it just feels like there are people who are picking up on these things because we never even really thought about them being kind of (inaudible) learners until they started moving around. Something like an idea or something that I can make changes with.</p>

<p>I don't know, just stuff, ideas. (pause) As you know I don't like to stay still for things. And for a long time I used to stress myself out about the fact that I can't not do stuff. Like I had a lot of people like, "You need to learn how to be happy with yourself doing nothing." You know? [00:26:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I would get...it is partially unsolicited advice, partially philosophically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just like to do stuff. I guess it's a problem if there are situations when you can't and that sucks. Like if you're saying you lay down for whatever that's [very hard] (ph). But what the hell? You just like to be busy in spite of everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But to some extent I am one of those people who has difficulty when I'm expect...because I get myself psyched up to do something and when it doesn't go through...I'm not one of those people that can't sit still to read. There are tons of people who can't do that. Now if I was getting ready to do something and then it doesn't happen and then something still (inaudible) sometimes it's difficult, you know? [00:27:25]</p>

<p>That kind of thing but it's not as bad as that. But I do like, for example, as an instructor I do not like the feeling between five minutes and 15 minutes after the hour wondering if this person is going to show. I can't leave the floor. I need to be where I need to be but I get stir crazy because I'm like, "Okay are they going to come? If so, great! If not, I'm going to find something to do," and I've always just kind of been driven like that. And maybe it wears me out, I don't know, but I have stopped beating up on myself for not being...I used to feel like the fact that I am so Type A and so action oriented sort of as a person—God, I'm spouting out a lot of corporate speak today. Action oriented, my God—but I really do feel like if I hate myself for that and tell myself I need to learn how to stop feeling like, "Oh, this is what I have to do." But I feel like I spend more time trying to fight who I am, if that makes sense. I spent more time trying to not be that way. I spent so much time trying to specifically be somebody than I am but it was really terrible and awkward. So, I don't know. [00:28:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's really too bad!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I hated that. I understand the "pick your battles" on things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well (inaudible) you really wanted to pick?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes. A lot of the times I want to do something. I'm just an overly helpful person and sometimes people take that as a weakness or being a little too whatever but I see problems and I like to fix them. And sometimes I've been told that I need to step back and let other people do it and (pause) I find that really frustrating. And I'm not talking about other people do it like as in you're taking something out of the hands of a customer and not letting them learn it. I'm talking like as in there is apparently a very fine line between what needs to be done and what you need to do, if that makes sense. Sometimes what I need to do is step back and let somebody else freak out and figure out what they need to do to get...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like if I go in to do something, I should do it. I'm never going to step down from something. Microsoft says, "We only technically teach Microsoft products." If I know how some program works and they're there, I'll tell them officially Microsoft says this but I'm not going to...because I know Adobe Photoshop doesn't mean I'm just going to say, "Okay I know it, but I'm not going to talk to you about it because that's unofficial." Oh (ph) it's legal advice while I'm there or anything. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. (inaudible) the same realm as that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We do get people who want help with their taxes a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah because you can buy the Turbo Tax software at the store. I am not an accountant. That kind of stuff. But yeah, I don't like the (inaudible)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you're pretty excited about finding something new to put some of your energy into.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I really want something I can put my energy into. I really just (pause)...I need something to do that. Success or not success isn't really—I mean yes, it is true. I like it when it's successful. But that's not really the option. That's not really the thing that drives me. [00:31:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't sound that way actually. It sounds much more like inspiration and fulfillment than success per se. You want to succeed but it sounds like it's much more you want something that's going to make your life feel more meaningful and productive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whether or not it is successful is not really, to me, it's not completely unimportant but it's not even in the primary driving (ph). And that's, to me, kind of an interesting thing. Although I do write things when most successful, that kind of thing, but it's more about having something that I want to pour my heart into. And you may have people back in the startup days, back when startup companies, they would work 18 hours a day. Not because they were getting paid and not because they were being forced to and not because they were scared about the jobs, but they were doing something that they just loved to do. Sadly, a lot of that PC (ph) the money was not necessarily in anything that was going to make money so they eventually had round (ph) jobs but that's a different...that's not my problem. But I just feel like I'm missing out on doing something again, so I've got to figure out what. (sigh) [00:33:06]</p>

<p>I really (pause) need a big...I need a project. But I need something more than just a project. I need something that's a push back, in terms of challenges and thinking through things, that kind of stuff. And preferably something that gets me out and about if possible because (pause) as much as I talk about getting people overloaded, overloaded, too much stimulation, that's just simply the retail environment. It's not that the people drive me crazy. It's the fact that...it's the nature of the Microsoft store that after a while gets to be over-much. That's not...if I were around people all of the time it wouldn't bother me. I think I do thrive being around others. So, we'll see. </p>

<p>I think a creative environment, for me, needs people. I just don't need catastrophic disasters over the things I've been dealing with. That's the problem with success that you have to take home the bad parts of it too, like the person who dropped their laptop. But (pause) I really just, like I said, need a project. I always have ideas on the back burner. I just need to start taking something and finding a way to make it happen. [00:34:54]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What else are you thinking of?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well nothing specifically now but I've had, over the years, lots of different ideas and concepts. Some of them have...yeah, just things, you know? In terms of technology, one of the things that I have had looked into and researched actually a bit about was (inaudible) teacher, especially for people who are older, people who have Parkinson's have...their handshakes. And it's very frustrating for them on the mouse because to them they are [sending the muscle things] (ph) that have been doing a straight curve, and they're not. I've looked into the idea of taking and having it do noise reduction, the same way that yeah. And so that as they're moving the mouse it may be shaking around a lot but it can figure out based upon...it learns...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Trajectory.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It learns over all how to dampen these different spots here and actually make a smooth curve so that they see on the screen what their brain is telling their arm to do and whether or not it's wildly shaking here, it's not and so therefore that would be able to, specifically as a concept, be able to empower them so they can feel more confident about it. [00:36:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you could make it into an operating system or put it into various applications for that matter too. Photoshop or something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or even just reading their e-mail because partly the reason why they do it is because they feel like they're moving the mouse and it's not doing what they want it to do and they (inaudible) shutdown, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>That's one of the millions of different ideas I've had gone through. Almost all of them have some sort of—as you can see—there's some sort of engineering backgrounds on them. They're not directly though, that kind of stuff, you know? (pause) Almost all of them it's like they're just outside of my official expertise to be able to quickly (pause)...almost (inaudible) small learning curve to go with them on that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean you'd have to learn something that implements (ph) that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I have to learn something. I don't have the credentials to officially do that kind of thing. I know a lot about signal processing and noise processing, that kind of stuff, but that is not officially the same thing as what you would be doing for adaptive technology for an example. That kind of thing. (pause) Although I see it as the same thing, the world doesn't see it as the same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that matters if you were going to raise money or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for the (inaudible) That and also for if I wanted to potentially also get grants and therefore publish steps and things to be able to look legitimate enough in order to be able to. There are two realms of ways of raising money. One of them is getting people to give it to you or loan it to you as capital and one of them being winning them to be able...winning the money as a grant to go forward. [00:38:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I actually did [start one] (ph) a bunch of years ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's basically what the... (pause). So for me...but that's...and the thing is, that's the problem with wanting to do something as a company as opposed to coming up with the technology and then maybe down the line if it's really great, letting somebody else license it, that kind of thing. I'm not actually all that driven to make...I mean, I'm broke. I'm really broke. Nothing about the money involved with anything I do excites me in the least.</p>

<p>(pause) When I was talking to this guy I work with, I brought up that specific thing. He said, "Spoken like a true rich kid." I'm like, (chuckle) I'm broke! I really am broke! But my [used skills, that's not my carrying force] (ph). Money is nice and if I got it that would be great. And the thing is, I don't even necessarily care if anyone knows that I did it (pause). When I worked for [inaudible], oodles of things that people will never know that I did or I was on a group that did this, lots of stuff for the SR71, when they did the rehabbing of U2 (ph) to make them more modern, that kind of stuff. No one will ever know. I mean, to be honest, most of the specific features on them, people won't even know about what actually became a part of that because it's already classified anyways so it's secretive, secretive, and secretive. No one will know it. But I'm damn proud of what I did and that's all that really matters, to me at least. I've often wondered if the fact that my own opinion on most things makes me a kind of egotist that I only really care about myself. [00:40:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How would that...how is your opinion...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact that the only thing I really care about is how I feel about it at the end of the day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I know that sounds silly to say, "I only care..." but I do have to wonder if like (pause)...and that sounds like it's a little egotist or a little bit...you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (pause) I suspect that...I don't see it as egotistical in part because (pause) of the sort of things that lead you to care about something in the first place. My impression of this is mostly like working on something that (inaudible) working on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Problem solving, yeah. It's the engagement of the work and so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't see how liking and picking out tasks involving problem solving would be egotistical. [I wonder if outside of this] (ph) that you're like doing something wrong or something should be different or you should care about something different or in a different way. (inaudible) lack of confidence about your (inaudible) or the measures you take in certain things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yeah. (pause) I am worried about the slippery slopes/pitfall of thinking that the world revolves around me. [00:42:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how does that fit in with the rest of this? Like, where is the world revolving around you here exactly? (chuckle) I don't see it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So where the concept comes from, from me being told this, as I was being told very early on by people including my stepmother-in-law—which I'm working on her website for her therapy thing. I can't believe I got talked into that one. Yeah, that's the one...it's not anything that I've worked on. It's the old stuff that she had somebody else do. But anyways...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of therapists are doing websites, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so it's very funny because she was the one that told me about how basically only children are completely self-centered. I've been told by other people too that the only thing they ever think about is themselves. And it's sort of been reinforced by the fact we don't have children that we're very selfish. This is totally...like, I get this from family and from other sources that I live a very selfish life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) That's really too bad that you get that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that we...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that you would love to have the help and the resources of various kinds to have kids.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep, mainly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it wouldn't necessarily make you selfish if you didn't want kids.</p>

<p>CLIENT: See that's the thing that you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially a problem because it's not that you are loving the time, energy, and money you have to spend on taking care of yourself [just because you don't have any] (ph) kids. We should stop for now, but we're scheduled for some other thing this week right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 3:30—ish I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 3:45 tomorrow?</p>

<p>CLIENT: 3:35, yeah good. And I'll see you then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks! [00:45:04]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, and thank you very much for that sort of nice bit of holiday cheer.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I give them out every year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's so nice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's so little and so convenient.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that's such a neat idea, too.  It's a little calendar and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never met -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anyone who -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Couldn't use a ChapStick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely and a calendar.  So, but you mentioned that the blood sugar, you know, it's no distant relationship -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I've really got to get that straight with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, I had some lows, and he said, "We'll, break your pill in half."  But it seems to me there out to be some kind of formula, like, this pill is good for X carbohydrates, and this pill is good for X carbohydrates.  And it ought to be something like that I could figure out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Fortunately, I have two meters.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I keep one in the living room and one in the bedroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> One -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a great -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I got for free -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Idea.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As study.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's something they said, "We'll give it to you free.  Tell us how you like it."  And it was all over the phone, and that was a few years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then when I thought I lost it, I got one through my insurance.  It turns out it wasn't lost.  It was hidden under something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's always good to have an extra, though.  Because you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just never know.  Batteries could give out or, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus I have these cute little cosmetic bags to keep them in.  They come with their cases, you know, the little black cases.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The little black cases, but it's so, you know, everything has to slide into its little strap.  And it's easier to keep it in a cosmetic bag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not such a tight fit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Looks nice.  It looks nice.  You know, it doesn't advertise, "I am a diabetic meter."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fair enough.  Yeah.  It could just be anybody's cosmetic bag.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you get a sense that the, um, different oral medications that you take might address the carbohydrates differently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I think that the metformin versus the, uh, glipizide.  The glipizide is a smaller pill, but that doesn't mean anything.  It's 5 mg, but, you know, that depending on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The dosage, it could be, could mean more than the 1000 mg metformin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't let me forget I have, it's prescription time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  As a matter of fact, I'll get out the prescriptions.  I may be able to, you know, start filling in some of that while we talk.  And I think I recall from a little while ago you had left a message that you might want to talk about some doses with the medication or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I was, I think, the depression gets real bad when I'm home by myself.  I'm, I'm supposed to meet someone here next week -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From [DEIDENTIFIED].  I asked if we could meet up here to start a volunteer position calling and visiting people here in the North East.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that'll be fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The real problem, I think, is, you know, medicine helps, but it doesn't do everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Part of it is up to me.  And I have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A, I have -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have a hard time with myself.  I think part of me is still seven years old and saying, "I'm not going to do that."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the holidays are tough, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, that's a time people -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I had to spend -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really feel -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My birthday alone.  It was [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, my parents had been in town since mid-October.  And they, uh, they couldn't stand, they couldn't stand [DEIDENTIFIED] anymore, so they -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Went back to Florida.  It, but I knew it.  I would not have wanted them to stay had they been looking at their watches.  And they had been in town in October.  My nephew, [NAME OTHER], was Bar Mitzvah on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So this is a special year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I could understand they're ready to get back to Florida.  When they come to town, they stay in my brother's basement.  He has an extra bedroom down there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I think it's hard for them not being in charge because they've been in charge of everything since they were [AGE] and [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  And sometimes as people get older, they're a little more set in their ways.  They like to know their way around their own home, their routine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And if you look under stodgy in the dictionary, it will have picture of my dad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my word.  That's hard.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I just tease them about it.  Because, well, they say, they admit that they're stodgy.  At least my mother does.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, at least she's got some insight.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I know your dad, that's been -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My dad -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A journey for him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think he sort of rules the marriage in ways that I wouldn't want a man to rule a marriage if I were married.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, like, mom doesn't go places and doesn't do things because dad doesn't want to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, she says it's probably his eye.  It's big, he has a macular pucker in his left eye.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh my goodness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He got hit with a baseball when he was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it didn't show up until, you know, he was older.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he doesn't see that well out of his left eye anymore.  And that must be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So that makes him even more insecure -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That must be very -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In unfamiliar environment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Frustrating.  I mean, he must blink and blink and blink.  And no matter what you do -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You can't get your vision to be perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're very empathetic about that.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it doesn't mean I don't get mad at him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, sure.  It's still frustrating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, if he's, if that causes him to be more preoccupied with himself and his routine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [COUGHING].  This dry throat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me see if I have some bottled water here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [COUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I feel kind of angry they took away the, um, do you like Diet Pepsi or Diet Sprite at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Diet Sprite would be perfect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll get you some.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Because you had -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's so nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Happy belated birthday.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bless your heart.  Let me see if I have anything else that might be fun to give.  Uh, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When they say -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When they say, uh, "No more pens," does that also mean no more deli platters, no more anything for the staff -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Except samples.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're cutting way back.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think they're fools to stop giving out the pens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Office supplies are always useful.  And especially in these economic times, there are so many pens around, I don't think any one company stands out or doesn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I don't see it as favoritism.  I mean, I, I've collected pens for medications I don't take.  And some of them, I don't know what they're for, but the pens were nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  I remember there was one a couple of years back for an allergy medication that had a nose on the clip part, which was hilarious.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> By the way, did you, were you able to pick up anything cute at that conference you went to or no?  It's okay if you, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That conference actually was really interesting.  They did have a few pens.  I'll see if I have some extra ones.  But that was pretty much all that they had.  It's funny.  There aren't a lot of medications used -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't agree.  And it's not like they're going to lower the price of the drugs or anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you not?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have Geodon already?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a pretty good one.  And blue and white is nice too.  You're very welcome.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I love pens.  I don't know why.  I've just always liked them.  When I, I think it happened when I worked, when I was younger, I worked at the [DEIDENTIFIED] for three years before they closed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  Was it down by the shipyard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, [DEIDENTIFIED], right near the stadiums.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yes.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  I, they have blown up the building that I used to work in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a piece of history that you worked there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was a lot, well it was 20 years ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it makes me, you know, blink to think, my God, I started working 20 years ago.  And when kids, young kids come in, I'm old enough to be their mother, and it freaks me out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's really true.  People used to say when we were young, as you get older, the time seems to go by faster.  It's just amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> My mom was right.  She said it passes faster after you, you go, after you leave school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  That's definitely true.  School always, there's, there's something immediately coming up like a, an exam or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The end of the semester or whatever.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I've been feeling guilty a lot about not having a graduate degree.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, because it seems like everybody who is working has one, and I don't.  And I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of competitive pressure.  I have three graduate credits, but that was when I was [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.  What are they in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, accounting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't consider them perfect because the first half of the semester, I did really well.  I got an A.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I did, got an A on my paper but something happened in the second half of the semester where I couldn't concentrate that well, and I only got a 44 on the final.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hmm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And now, I still end up with a B, but I don't consider myself much of an accountant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But then again, too, it sounds like, what do you think might have happened?  Were you feeling ill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.  I've been feeling guilty about that for years.  Um, I was too scared to go on when I graduated college.  I was very terrified, and I was having all the flashbacks of having worked with all those small children about the abuse my uncle did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Your symptoms really flared up then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It was really hard.  And it was rough, and I didn't think I could handle it.  I don't, I know I'm smart enough to go to graduate school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't think that I'm, have enough physical energy nor enough confidence.  Two years after I left, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] on [DEIDENTIFIED], I tried to get my job back.  But they, they kind of said in the interview, "Well, have you been to school or anything since last time?"  And I had to tell them, "Well, no."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I, I've, I've taken some courses in my life about auto repair and stuff like that.  But they kind of made it clear that, "Well, you don't have a graduate degree.  You know, you're not good enough."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Even then.  Gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, that was '99.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But still -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would go into a training program or something from, what's that, [DEIDENTIFIED]?  It's just that I'm not strong enough to go downtown every day right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Are you feeling very fatigued?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I feel weak -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Physically.  I mean, when you do what I did -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's hard on your body.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes my chest bone still pops.  They told me there's no treatment for that.  You just have to live with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  Are you in pain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I feel physically weak.  But no, I'm not in pain.  Only when I walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Matters.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm trying to eat less.  You know, my therapist says, "[PATIENT NAME], you know" -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> "Don't tell yourself to eat less.  Tell yourself to eat healthier.  That way, you won't resent it."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she's right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And also spreading it out so that your body, like you were saying about the blood sugar, so that you body gets used to kind of a steady level of, of fuel, so to speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I thought I was being careful enough.  I had some peanuts.  I had some cheese.  I had a little piece of fruit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those are great choices.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But apparently, I should have checked before I ate something again.  But then, I ate some pasta and it felt better.  All of a sudden, I could relax a little more.  And I thought, "I should have thought to check my blood sugar 20 or 30 minutes ago.  Maybe it was too low, and that's why I was feeling so weird."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's possible.  It's possible.  But you did what you needed to do to feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I do have an exercise tape you can do sitting down for large women.  I did it yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't do it this morning because I figured just coming here and everything is enough exercise for the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you did well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus I have to go to the grocery store afterward, which is always exciting for some people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always feel so conspicuous in the grocery store.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Why is that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, because I'm large, and I use the automated cart that people ride around on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was too embarrassed before, but [NAME OTHER] said, "Just think of yourself as getting your needs met."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And that could make it more fun, too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  It is more fun.  And my sister in law uses one, and she is a lot smaller than I am.  She has a bad back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So if she -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And they're there -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Can use one -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For a reason.  Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If she can use one, then I can use one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just try, you know, not to be too embarrassed even though I am.  I embarrass -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're not the only person your size in the store.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I embarrass -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Very easily, always have.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you're self conscious.  I'm not sure you always see yourself as other people do.  But -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I think, I've always been that way.  I must have been born with it, and then, what happened.  I think my dad is pretty sensitive, although he doesn't let it show very much, maybe only to my mother.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> About himself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I have both of their personalities in me.  But part of me can still hear him saying things like, "What, what's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?"  And scaring me when I was a little kid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.  Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I used to get, when I was very small, I would get so scared, I couldn't talk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but that stopped when I was about [AGE].  And now, I probably, he also thinks I either don't talk enough or I talk too much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  He's hard to please.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  And he's fat, too, but he's a man.  And that's always different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Isn't that a ridiculous double standard?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, you know, health is health, and you are taking healthy measures, and it's going to pay off.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I think, too, like a tree, you know, that's been hit by lightening, even though it develops more layers, it's always going to have that scar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know there's not a lettered stamped on my forehead, you know, "She has had psychiatric treatment and she was molested," and all this stuff.  But I still feel like it shows, even if it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that something I think over time, you know, working on with [NAME OTHER], with the medication, um, I know [NAME OTHER] would like to touch base with you when we're done.  And she may have some ideas about the volunteering training.  So I think you're approaching it from all the right angles.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just feel guilty that I'm not normal and perfect, or m, more perfect than I am now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's been a journey, and I think you've come a very long way.  You've come a long way from that time at [DEIDENTIFIED] and [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was rude to you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, we should, I can't believe that we let that slide when he said it wasn't important what happened to me about the sexual abuse.  He must not have been listening or been lazy.  I never liked him.  He was, he's the son of our former doctor's sister.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's how we, we found him in the first place.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never liked, his voice has always given me the creeps.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I wonder if what he might have been trying to say is, sometimes at a certain point in working through post traumatic stress, you try to just almost go through the motions of living as part of practice with learning to live with the fact that something happened.  But, of course -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But this is the first time I had ever brought it up with a doctor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that sounds very dismissive, then, for him to say that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, yeah.  I mean, that's, if he meant something else, he should have explained himself.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus, he's not very, well, it was, the way he talked to me after I was in the hospital, when I went, he said, "You were infantile," when you were in the hospital.  I was very scared and upset and probably being childish, but not on purpose but I felt so wounded when he said that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I would never use that term, either.  I mean, everybody regresses when they feel very threatened.  You know, um, some people will curl up in the fetal position or hide under the bed covers, but I wouldn't call that infantile.  I'd say that person is either very frightened, anxious, depressed or all of the above.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  No.  I don't think he's very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you stayed alive, he did something right, with everything that was hitting you so hard, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's my, another former therapist, I don't know if you've ever met her, [NAME OTHER].  She used to work at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's a familiar name.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I forget.  She used to be with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and I forget who else in that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], um, uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All those people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I saw her for a while, but I still hadn't figured out that I had to help myself as well as her.  And also, I still hadn't believed at the time that I had to get away from, I would go in the hospital and things would improve a little, but then, I'd go back to the same situation living with my parents.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it doesn't make sense.  I finally figured that out after the suicide attempt when I was in the boarding home and everything.  I, they are not going to change.  They're not going to, and if they need to, they're going to cut me off like a gangrenous limb.  I have to go on my own.  Nothing more horrible could happen living by myself than with them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And when I'd get annoyed with them or something or they don't like it, they can leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or I could leave.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  You having more independence and more distance gave you an opportunity to see the situation for what it was and how much control you really do have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, well, also, um, they do help somewhat financially.  They pay for my car repairs and my therapy with [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I figure that's only fair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Many parents continue to do that with adult children.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's still embarrassing, though.  I don't tell people.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A lot of people, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if many [AGE] women are getting assistance from their parents.  But [NAME OTHER] said, "Not many [AGE] people have been through what you've been through."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> True.  And I actually know several people, um, and I don't know how much it may have a cultural emphasis, but some of them are of the Jewish faith.  And I think wanting to have your children have it better than you did is a very worthy goal.  And people who stand behind that, you have to respect that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always did well in school, but I was unable to relax.  I used to get panic attacks at the beginning of every school year.  It wasn't until I was a senior in high school that they finally, we, uh, you know, took me to someone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I think your panic attacks were there from early childhood if you used to get so scared you couldn't speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And there's a picture of me, I don't have the family albums.  I think they're in Florida or [DEIDENTIFIED].  But there's a picture of me laying on the sofa as a baby looking up at the molester, and I looked scared.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, God bless you.  That's got to be tough to see.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It is.  What really bothers me is that he never was punished.  The only punishment he ever got is when I threw a glass of water in his face in his old age.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And that's the very least he deserved.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it also still hurts me because [NAME OTHER], my aunt, could have afforded to leave me something when she, and she didn't leave me a thing.  And she didn't even write me a letter or anything to say she was sorry.  And she told me it was my fault I can't stand to be touched.  And if I had known, I mean, she embarrassed me in public.  Stuff like, she said things to a waitress when I ordered dessert, and I didn't want whip cream.  She said, "Oh, she's dieting," to the waitress.  And I could have killed her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If I had known she was going to be so mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I would have let someone else drive her around the doctor's appointment.  I mean, I didn't do it all for money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Geez.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It needed to be done.  But still, I can't believe she didn't do something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did she every acknowledge what happened, or was she just in total denial?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she didn't want to know, I think.  It happened once on [DEIDENTIFIED] while she was in the store -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm waiting in the car with my uncle.  And I tried to tell her afterwards -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she said, "You don't let nobody touch you," and that's all.  She wouldn't listen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I told her that later.  My parents didn't understand.  I had brought it up with them when I was [AGE] or [AGE].  But they didn't understand, or they chose not to understand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Gosh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I stopped the abuse when I realized I didn't have to go near him anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good for you.  You've really had to be very self reliant in a lot of ways.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, I did, I told my aunt, you know, because she still kept making remarks about my weight.  And she has been hea, had been heavy her whole life.  And I finally turned to her and said, "You know, I would not be this heavy if your husband hadn't molested me."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Ooh, what did she say to that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, she started to cry a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Mm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But we had many conversations where I'd say to her, you know, "Don't you dare say things like that.  Because of what your husband did, you have no business saying these things."  And I said, "Don't tell my parents about it.  Don't tattle on me to my parents either about this."  And she said she didn't, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just can't believe after all I did for her, and I tried to forgive her and everything.  Then she was so dismissive.  And she could have written me a letter or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Could there have been a blame the victim kind of thing, do you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Blame the victim.  Even my mom said that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because if you think about it, if she dieted and tried to be more attractive and their relationship didn't improve, then it's, you know, he chose somebody else, you know.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Plus, I'm not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not your fault.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The only person that he touched.  He touched my sister, too, although she wouldn't, she has never been in therapy about it.  She told me.  I thought she said she ran away from him.  Well, she said she ran away at first, but she doesn't like to talk about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Maybe she'll be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's another thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Able to address it in her own way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's done so much better than me in life.  I think my parents did better with my second brother and my second sister than they did with the first brother and the first sister.  My sister is a lawyer, and she works for the [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she lost a lot of weight.  She had weight loss surgery.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I failed the breathing test for that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And she looks really good.  She's having more surgery to remove extra skin and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And not only that, she met someone.  And she's going to one of the inaugural balls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I feel like such a crumb next to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is this her first serious relationship?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think it's a serious relationship.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has she ever been married?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  So maybe you're just late bloomers a little bit.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You have an awful lot to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Look at her compared to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Contend with.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's four years younger than me, and look at all the things she's done that I haven't done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you had it tougher than her when you were growing up.  You know, it's not easy being the first, uh, you know, girl in the family or for your brother being the first boy, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's where parents kind of make some of their mistakes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I think there ought to be mandatory classes for parents.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> In a lot of ways, definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sure that I was always scared.  My first therapist that I picked out said is that my central, one of my central problems is that I feel difficult to feel safe with anybody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, I don't think that's surprising.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  And you ended up knowing that you can rely on yourself, you know, take charge of, of where you're living and, you know, certain aspects of, of work and education.  And, and you can do it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I just would like to stop feeling so inferior.  There are a lot of people who don't work and a lot of people who don't have a Master's degree.  But I still feel like, labeled.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you have a lot to offer, you know.  I think even in a volunteer capacity, you have compassion.  You're knowledgeable about mental health, a lot of aspects of healthcare.  I can see you helping people with diabetes, learning to manage it.  You've got a lot to offer.  So 2009 could be a good year -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Also -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With positive steps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every year on the [DATE] I cut out, six days a week in the paper, they have your birthday today and what's supposed to happen -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The next year.  But this year was on a Sunday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And on Sunday, it doesn't happen.  They don't put them in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Your forecast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So no self fulfilling prophecies.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No prophecies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But I think the person who you voted for got into the White House, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Wrong.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?  You voted for McCain?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I voted for him -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Only because I felt he'd earned it, and he's old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he's old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And President Elect Obama has, is a lot younger and could run for president again.  I felt it, you know, five years in a Viet, uh, I mean, six years in a Vietnamese prison and all that stuff, I'd felt he'd earned it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I really respect that service.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think Obama's is a good person.  But my concern is that he has not had, did not have enough time in congress before he became President Elect.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's reasonable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He was in his first senatorial term.  And he's obviously outstandingly bright.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm hoping you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What I had wanted -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'm hoping we all will.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What I had wanted was Hillary as president and him as vice president.  And if that couldn't happen, I would have liked the Roman triumvirate, which is impossible -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Him and Hillary and McCain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which is something I think the, you know, founding people, you know, everyone says founding fathers, yet, count Abigail Adams in there.  But they had that three branches balancing each other.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And the Supreme Court is sort of, it seems like at this point up on a cloud or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Legislative, executive and judicial -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Has been drilled into my head since I was [AGE], you know, in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Exactly.  So that's very interesting.  Well, I'm hoping we'll see some positive.  When you have a smart person who knows to appoint other smart people to do things.  You know, I'm just hoping they can all come together and compliment each other's strengths and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I am jealous of him for one thing, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's naturally very thin.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  I think that is in his genes, actually -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> From whatever I've seen of, uh, senior family members of his.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Maybe he gets that from his dad whom we've never seen.  I don't know if his dad is still alive or not.  I know his mother and grandmother are gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I'm trying to think.  There's one grandmother still alive over in Africa.  I think his father might still be alive, too.  I think I might have seen the father and the grandmother over there celebrating.  I'm not sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I read that his mother had gotten pregnant with him with she was [AGE].  I read that he had gone back to Africa, and then, he tried to, he did something when Obama was about 10, but I don't think it worked out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of course, I bet he's kicking himself now.  "My son is the President of the United States."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.  Well, I'm sure he just stood proud.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's [INAUDIBLE] that you can rise a, he can rise above his environment at least.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> True.  And for whatever reason his father felt a certain way and being present might be, have more of a detrimental effect, like if it's not a good marriage or, you know, his father feels unfulfilled in some way.  Maybe it was better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was wondering.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You never know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Do you guys recycle these or -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Usually not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In that case, I will put it in your trash.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  I thank you.  [PATIENT NAME], do you feel like at this point you want to stay with the medication the way it is, you know, work with -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> With the therapy and -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I, I guess.  I mean, I can't think of any medication you would know better that would make things any different.  I mean, I'm on the Wellbutrin.  I'm on the Anafranil.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's 2.  That Lamictal, I mean, I was on it for a while, but I can't see that it ever helped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know that the Anafranil has always helped.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Yeah.  The Lamictal was never a very large dose.  I think we only were up to, um, 75 a day.  Um, I actually think it, it might be worth, you know, staying for now with the Anafranil and the Wellbutrin, um, Rozerem for sleep.  And I think I have some samples for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, good.  Because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I'm going to be able to afford and send for it until March.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's going to cost me $65.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, my word.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's for a three-month prescription.  And I did ask, I was going to ask you if maybe you could write, take 2 per night.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because then I would get -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's worth a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A 180 pills.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Try.  Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And if 1 doesn't work -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Another thing that you could, um, look into in the meantime is getting generic melatonin from, uh, over the counter.  Because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I could buy that at the grocery store probably.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  And Remeron is a, I mean, not Remeron, Rozerem is a melatonin, uh, stimulant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So a melatonin inceptor stimulant.  So it could be -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I have the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I'll write for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I tried melatonin once in the past, and I think it was helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I always have weird dreams no matter what I take.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you could try taking 2 of those, as well.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll look for it when I go to the grocery store.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah.  And I'll write for the, um, Rozerem separately.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but that could well be worth a try.  It's very odd to write [DATE].  Am I writing that right?  Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I know it's a new year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's so strange.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And also the Wellbutrin, so I think it's 3.  I was wondering, I was going to ask if you're willing to write a script for pain meds.  But I understand -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> If you won't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which one do you need?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I've been, I had, I've been taking Tylenol 3 for knee pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I have a chance to get a 90-day supply of that for free.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> In order to make up for the fact that the name brand copay has jumped so high, they're giving us four free prescriptions this year.  Four free generics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  Okay.  How do you need me to write it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had given me a 60-day supply of, like that, 120.  I would say, like, 90-day supply -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of about 180.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And do you know what the mg are on Tylenol number 3?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's 330, I believe, 300 Tylenol, 30 codeine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Tylenol number 3.  Okay, number 3, and that would be generic.  Correct?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Generic.  Take, and then, how many do you usually take a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or sometimes less.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You could write, take -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So taking at least 2 daily, you would, a 90-day supply would be at least 180, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Would that be okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sure.  That would be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if you'd want to put a refill on it.  It's up to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I'm going to become a junkie.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think so either, considering, uh, you know, you've been taking it for a while.  And -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, once it, uh, treats the pain, you're in good shape.  Plus it will probably help you sleep better and, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It does help with the knee pain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That's another thing.  It's so weird about getting older.  Even if I lost 300 pounds, I have a feeling my knees would still hurt somewhat.  I mean, they would hurt a lot less, it's true.  But nothing is going to stop the fact of your knees aging no matter what you weigh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is true.  Do you have aches and pains any place else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I hear my elbows snap a lot when I've been -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Sitting in one position, and I move.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is it painful, as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.  It's the knees that are painful that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't think I've ever physically fully recovered from when I had the suicide attempt.  I think I gained a lot of weight -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I was so upset.  And fortunately, I have managed to stay about the same for about five years or six years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's an accomplishment in and of itself.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, periodically, I stop eating for a day or two.  And there's something I can't make myself eat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like corn flakes.  I hate corn flakes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I like corn.  I hate corn flakes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now, with that day or two, if you can at least nimble a little bit here and there.  Because if you stop eating for a whole day or two, your body gets the message, "Uh, oh.  A fast could come at any time.  We'd better hold on to the calories."  So it's almost, you know, like imagining how our ancestors designed, you know, hunting, gathering, moving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You know, so just having that steady blood sugar as much as possible, that's really going to help with your goals as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of course, I don't mind a bit that, you know, wholly mammoths are extinct, and we don't have to wear their fur anymore and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Exactly.  But I don't think that our biology has caught up to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What our brains are capable of doing, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> According to Doctor Atkins -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We're designed to eat meat with only occasional fruits and starches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I actually think metabolisms are very opportunistic.  And it's more a question of supply than specifics.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] says that I should always remember that I'm a starvation survivor having been on Opti fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, good point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She tells, she has real skinny clients who want to gain weight.  And she tells them to fast for a month or two.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, Opti fast type eating, and then, they'll gain 30 pounds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yeah.  Because probably there is, a system learns to hang on to the calories.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, that's not -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A day supply.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's right.  I knew I didn't write that right.  Yeah.  Definitely double check these.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm so glad Wellbutrin is generic and Anafranil is generic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.  Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When I first tried Anafranil, it was $80 for a month's supply.  You had to send to Canada for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So it, it really pleases me how cheap it is now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That is a relief.  Two.  All right.  Anafranil, Tylenol 3, Rozerem.  I think I wrote the Wellbutrin down here, but now here yet.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So there's one more.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Your left hand, or your right hand, rather, must be crampy by the end of the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes, yeah.  That is definitely true.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I guess they're not allowed to print your license number on the pad -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For maybe, for in case people steal them or something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They could, actually, because that's more or less a matter of public record.  Um, I'm not sure why they don't.  I think they're ultra cautious here.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I can understand there are some people here that who have some troubling symptoms.  It makes me sad that I don't know how to help them.  I mean, not guilty, but, you know, I just wonder, you know, why does God a, allow these things to happen.  But then, he allows a lot of things to happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's one of the great -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That I don't approve of.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Questions of humankind, you know?  Like, like, you know, how are we going to get past some of our history and you know, not have it happen in the future?  All right, please definitely check those over.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I'm going to see, I think I have some samples in my draw, but if not, we'll swing by the nurse's office on the way to [NAME OTHER]'s.  And [PATIENT NAME], when would you like to meet again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, how about the middle of March?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That sounds fine.  So we'll say about two months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  That sounds about right.  I forgot to bring in a grocery bag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's okay.  I have plenty right here.  It's never a problem.  I hope you don't mind a 5 Below.  There you go.  Okay.  So follow up in two months.  Sounds good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I thank you very much for the drink.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, it's my pleasure.  It's good to stay hydrated, especially with the kind of, uh, challenging weather like this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.  I know everyone who is in school or work is praying for a blizzard, but I'm not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Uh, blizzards, we don't need.  That is for sure.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You said that you thought the nurse might have more of these?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  We can ask on the way by.  Certainly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  She sits back here, too?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, yes.  She's right, she's the last office on the left.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  I'll save this.  We have a recycling bin at my complex.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, good for you.  And there's actually also one, when you come back out and through that, that big heavy door now that has the combination on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you look immediately behind that door to your right, there is a recycling -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There, for cans and, there's another, I don't know if it's paper, though, but there's another one over there.  Okay.  All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's too late for the tissue box.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I hope you don't mind if I don't stick my hand in there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not at all.  That's perfectly all right.  I don't think there's a paper recycle there anyway.  I don't know why.</p>

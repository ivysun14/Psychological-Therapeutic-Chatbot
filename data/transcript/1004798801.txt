<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Slept a lot since yesterday, which is good. Yesterday did not go very well. I kind of collapsed in the middle of the . . . (sighs) We put all of James' stuff in storage and then had to return the truck to a different location because of the returning place. I got halfway through moving things and I just kind of fell apart. James moved most of the rest and I just kind of sat in the truck and . . . I don't know what's going to happen right now or what's going to happen after this. I worry about privacy, in that James and I are sharing a room in an apartment with two other people, which means that I don't have a safe place to go back to where I can be by myself completely anymore. [00:01:26] While in some ways I think James really understands me needing that when I'm really upset, in some ways he really doesn't understand it—like he's okay with it but he doesn't understand it—and so it's hard for me to feel like it's okay to ask because he really, really wants to help and sometimes comfort by being close. Sometimes it's really exactly what I need and it's really wonderful. And sometimes it feels like I have to feel better for him because he's worried about me, and so I don't [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:11) down or I just push it out. I'm pretty scared about what happens next. [ ] (inaudible at 00:02:29) (pause) </p>

<p>I signed on to create a bibliography for a woman who's in the department. Her dissertation is getting squished (ph), so she needs somebody to make a bibliography for her, so I said, "Sure. I'll do that." That will be like a one-week straight push to get it in to a publisher by a date in October. I told her, "I'm anxious that my one concern is that I won't be able to get it done on time, but if you want me to, I will." So, yeah. [00:03:25] (pause) Part of me really wants to deal with the logistics and part of me really, really doesn't. (laughs) It's like, "Well, I don't feel like I have any control over my life, so here are all of these things I can do. Let me do all of these things." And the other part of me is like, "There are so many things to do." (chuckles) (sighs) It's terrifying. (pause) [00:04:25] I'm sharing a bed with James. Ordinarily we sleep very close together and last night I was crying. I was really sad and I wanted him to go away. (laughs) And I didn't really know how to say that. Eventually I did. He's done so much in the last week and two weeks out here in a city that he doesn't really know very well and doesn't particularly like. Looking for a new job and trying to take care of me. It's impossibly hard for me not to try to act like I am well in the ways that he wants me to be well, in that he is trying to take care of me and so I want to say, "Look, you did it." (laughs) (pause) Sometimes I try to tell him and sometimes I can't. Some of it I tell him, but I'm not sure if he understands, (pause) then I worry that he's not doing well. [00:06:42]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:39) "This feels impossible."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It feels like the week before the end of a semester. I just write down the things I need to get done that day and don't look up because I don't think it's going to work. It's impossible so I just keep going. I don't have much in reserve. I did really well in terms of the driving and packing and right up until yesterday. We got it done and if I hadn't been able to kind of be at least a third to a half of the people who are making it happen, I don't think it would have happened. [00:08:06] Or I don't see how it could have. James really needed me to be driving a whole bunch of the time, but also to be awake and talking with him when he was driving and taking emotional care of him and helping him talk about the stuff with Franco and Sascha because that's really throwing him for a loop and he really needed that. I could do it and that was great and I'm totally fried now. [00:08:46]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think you have pretty mixed feelings about coming here. I think you feel pretty guilty about that. I think that there's a part of you that feels like this is a big risk and not what you want and maybe not a good idea. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:09:41] Not so much what I wanted . . . (pause) The risk—the ways that I know how to cope are based on me being alone most of the time. I don't know. I would like this not to be my priTanya way of coping, but in some ways him coming and taking care of me has taken out all of my defenses (laughs) and I told him I might doing really badly for the next few days. Just a heads up. (laughs) I am really scared of this, really scared. I don't know what to do. [00:11:32] (pause) There was one point last night that I was really sad and I kind of felt this was the point where I would normally cut myself. I can't do that. What do I do? I don't know what to do. I've slept a lot the last few days which felt good, kind of like numbing versus open. (long pause) [00:13:32] I'm trying really hard to do what I need, but I don't know what I need and I don't know how to tell him. It's probably not the best week to start early morning with this. (laughs) I'm so tired. [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:12) hard for him to get up the last couple of days. (pause) Then I'll be up and I'll go the whole day. I have to figure out my room. It's set up for one person. There's not really room for two people to move in. I think it's just shifting furniture around and putting a bookshelf or two in the room. That's fine. (pause) [00:15:32] James says my roommates are really the "hang out and talk" sort of people and James's not really the "hang out and talk" sort of person (chuckles) any more than I am. There's a reason we're together. (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's hard for you to talk—even though you're clear to me—about how bad you're feeling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of that is that I don't really want it to be happening. Part of it is that I know it's there and it comes out really violently sometimes, but it doesn't quite register most of the time. I'm just so scared. I don't see how this is going to work. By "this," I mean anything in my life. [00:17:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, (pause) what are you worried more about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [That I won't be looking at jobs. James won't be able to make jobs.] (ph) I won't get better, both in terms of I'll just feel like crap forever and I won't be functioning forever. Other people will just have to keep taking care of me, not in the ways that are good but in the ways of just like [I'm feeling desperate and lean on] (ph) everybody all the time. I feel like I'm not the kind of burden that one is happy to take on. (sniffles) I even worry about money and I don't have good reason to worry about money too much. [00:19:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you the kind of burden folks don't want to take on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sniffles) I don't have much to offer. I feel like I'm so volatile right now and I feel like I am just out of sync with everybody else in conversation. I'll start talking and then feel like, "Why are you saying this? This conversation is not going the way that you . . ." I feel like I'm misreading everybody all the time or not able to really talk with them. (sniffles) I'm really angry a lot of the time and it's just a big anger that touches down on specific people at specific times but it doesn't actually have anything to do with them and (sobs) I'm scared I'm going to hurt people because of it. (crying) [00:19:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you wanted to do that would have hurt somebody?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Yesterday evening was just totally, was just "leave me the fuck alone" and I don't really want him to leave me alone. (crying) Call Sascha and yell at her for hurting my husband. Call Franco and yell at him for being so fucking closed-mouth that he has to control all of the information. None of us know how to talk to each other because we're relying on him to talk to Sascha and he's not doing it. (pause) (crying) [00:22:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:26) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (crying) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Something I think he would not want to be close to.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I know I can just go off and people all over will get hurt and I will be hurting them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there angry things you want to say to me as well? [00:23:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. You're here now so it's hard for me to think of them. I'm sure but I can't think of them. (pause) I don't think so. (pause) This is kind of a lower stress point, I think. I mean I get angry with you as in the other week when I'm really trying to on some level keep it together so that I can do the things I need to do afterwards, and you call BS. Yeah, you were.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In some ways I know that's what this is for. "What is actually going on? What is the truth of the situation? Let's talk about that," but I don't want to give up the ways that I cope that work sometimes. (chuckles) Clearly not very well in the long run. Clearly, but I'm scared to give them up. I don't want to. (crying) I don't want to feel bad. I don't want to be hurting so much. As always, it's not usually clear to me that I am hurting so much when I'm focused on just this. I don't feel it. I don't know. Wouldn't it just be better to stay there? [00:27:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't work that well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (crying) That's the thing. I know it doesn't. I agree with you. It doesn't keep me from being really angry that I have to give this up, that I have to find some new ways. I don't see a new way. It's just like I'll just hurt all the time. (pause) (crying) [00:28:22] It gets really bad I get so angry at all the people who love me who are the reasons that I'm not killing myself because (sobs) I don't want to stay here. I don't want to stay with this. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me how you hurt. [00:29:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It feels like my whole body is just a giant wound. It feels as though anything I say or do or anything anyone else says or does just kind of pokes at the hole and (crying) I just explode in pain. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems the things people do, even if you know different in your head, they don't make you feel held or cared for or sort of treated kindly or gently, but poked and prodded. </p>

<p>CLIENT: They do, but that makes me feel worse. People care for me and it just feels so wrong. I feel like I'm taking advantage of them. It just makes me feel like I'm something horrible. (crying)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. What are the sorts of things that people say at you that just hurt? [00:31:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: At school, my friends there I think e-mail notes saying "Tanya's really not doing well and not getting better and just continuing on," and so they among themselves apparently like organize "let's just send Tanya something nice." It's really lovely and sweet and that's kind of the way they are and we all kind of did something similar when Heather Kate miscarried I think twice in a year and a half. It was really bad. We did kind of the same thing. It's wonderful but I just feel horrible. (crying) It feels like I'm lying to them. (pause) [00:33:37] Yesterday James was saying, "Just take a break. I can do this. You don't need to do this. I can do this." (crying) I did. [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:51) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want everybody to just go off and let you die? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (crying) When things are bad. It's getting to be bad but I desperately want people to take care of me so that it won't get that bad, but once it's here I just . . . (crying) Exactly what you said. I just want people to leave me alone and let me die. (crying) And to have that not hurt people, because I know it would. I don't understand it, but (pause) I know it would—which is why I don't. It feels like I want to care. James mentioned on the drive he said he needed to think of a way for his parents to help us in some big way. They kind of said they wanted to help over and over. My dad kind of says, "I'm going to do this," and then just does it. Sometimes it's perfect and sometimes it's not exactly the right thing, but he just does it. They kind of really need to be asked and James's not really an "asker" so it's like they just do that. I have to be a lot better before I can ask for that kind of help. It feels like they're asking something of me in asking me to . . . [00:37:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I follow. Yeah. It requires something of you to lean on them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is more of an analogy than what's actually going on with that. I think the more of what's going on with them has a lot to do with James and them. I don't care. I care, but I'm not willing to make [ ] (inaudible at 00:37:48) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one thing that becomes clear from a lot of this is (pause) how you want to keep yourself and other people from knowing some things about how you really feel and what your life is really like; and I think it's probably (pause) a lot so that it won't seem as real, like how much you're hurting. I think you kind of play both sides of it with yourself and with other people, where you can feel like a fraud both for feeling like you're making it up or you can feel terrible for keeping people out and not telling them. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:41:20) I don't know. I don't want everybody else to have to live with me. I don't want other people to feel affected. I feel like if I tell them, then they will be there with me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And (pause) clearly you have love and concern for other people, but I think a lot of that is just not wanting to be there with what you feel.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [00:42:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Clearly you grew up with parents who couldn't be there a lot with you with what you felt, and you really worry about other people's fragility or vulnerability to what you feel or they're not being there in the right way which has often happened when people who are caring and smart and well-meaning, like James or [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:25)—I'll put myself in there—but I think there's a bunch in there at the end of the day which is just not wanting to be there with it itself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:56) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it's really there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't quite know how to be there without being [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:34) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [These, I think, are your main ways—sort of not knowing and being angry with people—that allow you to filter out if it's hard to talk about.] (ph) You moved away pretty quickly earlier from the part about being angry with me for the other day or [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:11) </p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:45:15) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. We need to stop for now but we'll talk more tomorrow.</p>

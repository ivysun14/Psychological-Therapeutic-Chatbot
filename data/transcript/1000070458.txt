<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: January 7th, Napolean counselor. Why don't you tell me about what things that you're (ph)...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually, as a matter of fact, this is - you know, you don't have to read it now, but I've got - that's the kind of portions in this letter I wrote to my father. And it kind of explains a lot where I'm at. And also when you read it, you know, the main thing is that he considers, you know, my emotional reactions to things being kind of those of a small girl. You know, he doesn't take me seriously, they have no real significance. And so that's, you know, kind of taints this thing (ph). But the reason I came - well, actually...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll read it, but I'd really like to hear it from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, well, I just thought maybe that would kind of help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>0:00:57.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (ph). I was here for one session with another counselor this summer. And that was kind of brought on by this - well, actually, what's behind most of this - and I realize there are a lot of things behind this plus this relationship I had with guy last spring that was very traumatic. And I think there are a lot of things coming out now. Like, I think what I did was - I went along on a really functional basis. Like, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, you know, I was really cracking up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was this after when you broke up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I was really, really kind of cracking up because, like, I remember one time I couldn't keep track of space and time, you know. I didn't know what time it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had no idea of time at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really felt like you were losing contact with the world?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So incredibly confusing (inaudible at 0:01:58.3) for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and, like, you know, it was like walking - it was like on a treadmill, you know, I would never know how far I'd gone and what time, you know. It was just total, total loss of reality. And, you know, that was getting pretty scary then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>0:02:16.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's funny, I wasn't, like, suicidal or anything. It was like it was a real kind of focus for the whole thing. You know, the tragic, heroic thing I suppose ultimately (ph). Then, you know, I kept going just at a frantic, frantic basis of, you know, getting involved with a lot of things, seeing a lot of people all the time, throwing parties, going to parties. And I have a feeling I just kind of buried that under a lot of superfluous activity, and now it's kind of coming out in really incredible ways (inaudible at 0:02:47.2).</p>

<p>Well, the main problem is that I'm suicidal all the time. And, you know, it's really weird but on this one day - I still remember it was December 14th about five in the afternoon. I just had the strangest, strangest thing of just, you know, totally accepting suicide, just totally, just, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Projecting my own death, you know and it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, you could really see it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I could really - it really happened right then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was really real and there for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, it was like the only alternative. And it really kind of happened; I really experienced it all then. And then, you know, there was this thing of kind of, you know, just kind of making plans or something. That was kind of the only functional use and I was still alive. And I'm certainly much better now, even today I'm than usual. But it's - you know, this - just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, that kind of sounds like it, it's like you could make - all you really had was maybe a little tiny thing to do to live with it. Like, you could really see yourself - there really was nothing there for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I could definitely, definitely see death as a real alternative. I mean, there was just no question. And it was even more than that, it was really kind of, you know, living through - it was really like imagining, you know, taking the pills and whatever and having it happen. Really, really, you know, it was like I was going to go swimming or something. It was no more profound than any other act.</p>

<p>0:04:26.8</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like you could really see yourself doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and, you know, that's why it was definitely so critical that I come. But, you know, the things that have touched off - this kind of impossible depression. It's really kind of an agony are really the smallest, little things, you know, I mean, they're just these kind of constant, small defeats with people. And until now, I really can't function with them. There are only maybe a few good friends that I can really manage to handle and that I can confide in. And I feel like even then I'm straining the relationship by...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:05:08.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, by being this way, and so then I kind of go in my room and shut the door, and that strains the relationship too, you know, and it's kind of little bind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it because you feel like you're a burden?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that, that you go in your room and close the - why does that strain the relationship because it's really hard to share all that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not that hard to share it, in fact, I'm frightened of what I do to other people because I had an experience. I was in the Peace Corps in Eastern Europe, this roommate of mine - I really kind of confided in her a lot of doubts and a lot of, you know, real joys and happiness's and everything too. But she just simply didn't want any kind of emotional dependence. And I accidentally read what she's written about me. I mean, I accidentally hit upon you, you know, I didn't stop reading frankly.</p>

<p>0:05:59.0</p>

<p>And it really blew my mind because, you know, I just - you know, apparently I was to blame for bringing her down all the time, which, you know, I'd never even thought of them. And so I went through this thing - like, this really good, good friend of mine noticed it in Europe, trying to be just super independent, totally autonomous, and that really hurt her. And then when I came here, I was feeling that way pretty much, you got to start getting involved with people and then men, which is the death (inaudible at 0:06:34.6), you know. Just dancing the (inaudible at 0:06:37.2).</p>

<p>But anyhow, I do have a tendency to kind of - to lay bare a lot of problems with people and I don't - you know, I just don't think it's fair to impose on them, you know, impose on their happiness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that feel like (inaudible at 0:06:51.8) problems in the way sometimes (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it definitely does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:06:57.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've come to any other conclusion now that it's a good thing to get along. Like, I just stayed here for Christmas. Because another thing that happened over the summer was that I just completely broke off relations with my parents. And so I feel like I have to accept independence and loneliness, and at the same time I absolutely can't do it, you know, anyway. And, you know, I see just no hope for relationships with men now because a couple of things happened. Like, there was one disappointment in the fall, and then another thing which really kind of - that's what kind of touched off this last fit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you (inaudible at 0:07:37.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, the last thing, this - you know, I've been kind of half interested in this guy in the fall, you know. And, you know, we were pretty good friends. I got along pretty well with him and everything. And then it became fairly apparent that he just wanted to kind of jump into bed with me, and I just was trying to get over this thing in the summer, which I just don't (inaudible at 0:08:04.8). The pain is just never going to go away. But anyhow, I just didn't think it would be a good idea. And he seemed to kind of lose interest but yet, still be friendly.</p>

<p>0:08:17.9</p>

<p>And then, you know, he was sort of flaunting this other girl around to me, which really hurt, you know. And then one time - you know, I just kind of was approaching this. He kept asking me to go to Chicago with him over Christmas. And I just said, "I really was interested in why you asked me because I didn't - you know, it didn't make any sense." I just wondered what his motives were. And just looked at me straight in the eyes with pity, which made the whole relationship seem like one of - you know, he had kind of known that I'd been very unhappy over the summer. And it made the whole thing seem like the only way I could communicate with a man was if he felt sorry for me. You know, that I'm not really taken seriously as a person. I'm not somebody that one can get seriously interested in. Yet, I take life desperately seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can't - I just can't put those things together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really, like you as a person can't be responded to for the person you could be or are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're pitied to be responded to, but that just - can you be responded...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. You know, I've always - like, I really changed in the Peace Corps, like, my junior year I think was one of the worst years, not in real kind of traumatic up and down, but just in this kind of very slow, slow buildup loneliness. And so my very good friend had gone up to Western Europe. And I just lived utterly alone, I wouldn't talk to anybody. I'd look down on the ground when I walked anywhere. I put a newspaper in front of my face. And then in the Peace Corps I just finally, with a lot of help - like, they felt it was really high potential, you know. But they really - it was a highly supportive atmosphere and I gained all this confidence I've never had before, you know. My parents have a philosophy that you raise children the best, you help them by criticizing them so that other people - you know, so they can improve themselves. And they're no source of support at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're just constant, you know, in battle. And so all of a sudden there was this supportive atmosphere. It really totally blew my mind. I would sleep, like, about four hours a night just to talk with people. All of a sudden, you know, it was just - you know, everything I really kind of vainly hoped was in me, you know, miraculously came out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Appeared.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then it was...</p>

<p>0:10:42.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that atmosphere really kind of helped you to come...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of get unlocked from inside you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I kind of knew they were all surrogate fathers and mothers, you know. But at the same time I just totally accepted it because it was such a beautiful kind of thing. And then there was a lot of problem in the Peace Corps with pressure working over there and a lot of things. They had doubts about whether I could go there because I was totally na�ve about men. And of course, Eastern European men put a lot of pressure on the girls, you know. And there were a lot of problems that way and terrible inferiority feelings and stuff. Then what had happened, after I found out what my roommate thought of me, I just went off to Bulgaria on my own, and hitched a ride with my monk up there. And I had a really great time, and that's when I began to think I could really manage on my own.</p>

<p>And so when I came back I got involved - you know, I organized a literacy project, and felt like I really was finally accomplishing something, and got very involved with him, actually, (inaudible at 0:11:40.0) the third year. But then I decided I couldn't really stay around there anymore. And then coming back to a place like Chicago, which almost brutal, it's intensely neurotic atmosphere that just kind of set everything up. You know, I just totally regressed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that kind of like - like, here you are in kind of an atmosphere where really things that fell meaningfully - meaningfully you in a way, and really good things about you really kind of brought out and coming back through this cold, neurotic atmosphere (inaudible at 0:12:17.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like, they all disappeared and where did they go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then when they have had a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of did have the sense of value under pressure, is that (inaudible at 0:12:28.4)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, there were kind of a series of rejections by men all during last year. And, you know, I got - and especially one that I cared for very much in the Peace Corps. After Christmas I got really, really down last January too. And I know it's not just January, it just happens to be coincidental and really funny, relationship kind of breaking up. And I got kind of pretty suicidal then too, only somehow, I just kind of retreated and shut the door in my room, and kind of reconstructed myself without even being aware of it. Just did things that I enjoyed and finally I began to relax.</p>

<p>And then before I really had gotten ready to handle people again, I met this guy that I was involved all during the spring very intensely, and then in a kind of grotesque way all of summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the guy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is the guy, yeah. Not the one that made the remark.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:13:26.0) the guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, the one. And, you know, I was really at my best at that point. I was totally, blissfully happy. And I knew - you know, I thought, okay, this is a joke, you know, when I went into a relationship. And I thought even during the course of it, I thought, okay...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One second, were you blissfully happy during the relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I really was. You know, I'd had these little nagging doubts that I just finally - I just finally totally trusted him. I don't know why, there's no reason to. But I just - what it was, was just a kind of repressed fear of losing him. At that point, I just had too much at stake. And then I really clung, I know I did. You know, it would have been just death to have had the thing just end abruptly totally. And, you know, that just - that really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's okay.</p>

<p>0:14:24.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can turn off your phone, great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I'm sorry, you were saying you desperately clung and it would have been devastating for...</p>

<p>PATIENT: To - yeah, so I just kind of hung on to just ridiculously vain hope. And then...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it apparent that hope was in vain?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty apparent, I just wouldn't pick up the cues. You know, I just - I wouldn't recognize the reality of it. And yet, there were other things too. He's a totally, totally weird person. He's really, really fucked up. Everybody says that, they keep telling me it's not me, it's not me. You know, he's really got a problem. But, you know, I couldn't - I mean, the fact, okay, you know, if he had problems, I was still terribly inadequate, you know, that he could place his trust in me. And that - you know, that just desperately (inaudible at 0:15:18.8). And then another very big problem I know is that that was the first sexual relationship I'd had.</p>

<p>And, you know, I really - I'd been kind of trained to fear sex very much. And he knew that in the relationship. And I found out later that he told a friend this, that one of the problems was that - this is a direct quote, "That's it's really hard to break a woman in." I felt like a horse or something.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I felt like some kind of animal or something. You know, just - it really - well, you know, I'd really had doubts, like when I was an adolescent about whether there was something really desperately wrong with me, you know. I didn't think I was a lesbian or anything. But (inaudible at 0:16:00.2) somehow kind of neuter (ph) because I wasn't interested in it. And I had grown to really like it, you know, and really kind of need it. And that hurt because I thought, my God, as much as I've shown my affection for him this way, you know, that he's still - you know, still somehow just wasn't enough.</p>

<p>0:16:19.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that really make you feel inadequate (inaudible at 0:16:23.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, terribly, in fact...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's, like, you know, here you were feeling kind of (inaudible at 0:16:27.2). You had felt really troubled about sex. You were kind of getting to like it and enjoy it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very much so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know, thought it was okay but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and then all of a sudden...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, he - I talked to the girl he dumped for me, you know. And she said that he - she thinks he has real doubts himself about it, and this kind of rejection thing (ph). But there's a real, real problem with sex because I - you know, I really do need it so badly, you know. And it would have been just such a temptation just to go ahead and gone to bed with this guy (inaudible at 0:17:05.4). But at the same time, you know, it's so terribly frustrating because I feel like something that I will never, never, never have or participate in or something, you know.</p>

<p>And so I can't even - you know, I can't even - I can hardly bear watching sexual scenes in movies because it's - you know, it's a very stimulating thing. At the same time, I feel like I've got to turn that off, you know, this is desperate. Like, it's the most - one of the most kind of passionate energies in me I know, but at the same time, it's something I can never have because I simply, obviously (inaudible at 0:17:47.3). And it's just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:17:51.9).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guess I don't - guess I don't - when you say that very strong - and I don't really understand. It's like - it's very confusing for me. It's one of the most passionate things in you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I mean, it's a really strong kind of drive, you know. And it's a very important part of life I know, a very important part of my life.</p>

<p>0:18:13.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're (inaudible at 0:18:15.5) and you know it's like - not like when you were an adolescent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no, it's part of me I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and it's really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's something I really felt.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you said that, "I've got to shut that off."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because - the overwhelming evidence points to this thing of just simply not being able to carry off a relationship with a man. You know, just like I said, not being taken seriously by men. That I'm always a good kid, I know people really like me. That's what he said himself, "Oh, she's a really good kid." But that's - you know, that's not the same thing as being a woman.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being a woman who's loved?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know, I'm really - you know, I can't take this "good kid" (inaudible at 0:19:00.8) anymore. I'd rather shut off people entirely than go through that row (ph) again, you know. And I know that, you know, people really - you know, I do have a lot of friends. I do have people who really value me. But, you know, and then I think, well, I'm demanding too much, but I know I'm not demanding too much. It is a natural (inaudible at 0:19:19.5) thing, to be involved with men (inaudible at 0:19:22.8). Eventually get married and have a family, and it's just not going to happen and I can't live with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can't live with that it's not going to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why isn't it going to happen?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, right now, I never really could understand before why men would get interested and then go the other way, you know, and find other people they like better. You know, well, I could understand, I knew there were a lot of things really wrong with me. But now I know deeply that, you know, there's a real kind of sickness in me, where I just - you know, I cannot respond to anybody right now. I just can't, I'm really withdrawn from people right now. And until, you know, I kind of get out of that, there's definitely no chance and, you know, I can't set myself up for another disappointment right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's kind of like you really do feel very withdrawn and, like, don't feel like you really could relate to someone (inaudible at 0:20:26.3)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right now, and then the thought of being in a relationship right now, what the hell would happen if you really got hurt again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's just - it's terrifying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, that would just, like, be the end that I could have sex?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, it would be beyond the end, it would be just a living hell, you know, again. And - you know, and I can't - I really - I'm just much, much too depressive, you know, even being around people, you know, I would just bring them down.</p>

<p>0:20:53.9</p>

<p>And I don't dare sacrifice my image. You know, because I can bring off this really very super social role, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really get the feeling that, like - it's, like, you're living, carrying on and keeping up an appearance, but, like, (inaudible at 0:21:16.8) inside you're really hurting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. It would be more blissful if it were just the dead inside, which it was kind of for that (ph), you know, for a couple of days after that. A real - that experience of death, you know, I thought (inaudible at 0:21:32.6) to your death. But it really - it's a terrible - that's I what I mean, it's really kind of an agony. It's a kind of excruciating thing inside all the time, just a gnawing fear of being alive, of facing anything. And yet, I'm the kind of person who doesn't get really (inaudible at 0:21:53.6). I do in a kind of...</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:21:56.0), like I don't get totally lethargic and sleep through it, which a lot of people do. Which would probably be much better, inside I tense up and I get super functional, and lately, I haven't even managed that. I can't organize myself at all. Things are just chaotic. I can't do anything, I just kind of flip from one thing to another, start thinking about something and I can't concentrate on anything. You know, so I'm just not accomplishing anything that would be like positive reinforcement. There's nothing I'm doing as a person right now. And, you know, I know that I've got to find something that isn't, you know, as pressurized as Chicago. You know, I know I could do the academic work in another context if I went home to some kind of emotional support. But you really have to fight here to...</p>

<p>0:22:46.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:22:50.3)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, absolutely not. They really expect you to do it on your own. They expect me to do it on my own because I've shown that I can. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I really kind of get a very strong feeling like - I guess it's on the same thing I was saying before, like, you've shown you can, but, like, you feel like you're going through emotions in a way (ph), (inaudible at 0:23:14.5) your emotions behind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's the definite feeling. I felt that very much. I'd really made up my mind at the end of Christmas to leave school last year. And then I kind of hung on when I met this guy and I wouldn't have even thought of leaving New York. And I definitely feel now, I mean, that I'll never trust a relationship to be something that I can hang on to. And I've to be doing something that really, really, you know, find some kind of core in me, you know. And it would have to be outside of school right now, I know that.</p>

<p>And I've already talked to people about taking a leave of absence. And I could definitely get on for one quarter, so I thought I might hang on till next quarter then I could get the spring and summer together, six months away to really think about it, to do something else. And, you know, I have ideas of other things I could be doing and stuff too. But, you know, I don't - I find great joys in academic life, you know, when they're able to be expressed. But the whole idea of graduate school is to suppress enthusiasm that's unprofessional attitude. You have to be careful, you have to be scholarly.</p>

<p>And enthusiasm just dwindles at that point, there is no more emotional identification with what you're doing. And also, I'm tired of living vicariously, you know, like I'm history (ph). I can get a lot of excitement about greeting people who have been - in fact, there's a great kind of comfort in a sense in knowing what other people thought (inaudible at 0:24:53.2). And, you know, I mean, just the whole human experience thing, you know. That is a vicarious thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Touches home (inaudible at 0:24:59.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does touch home and it is a very, very important thing. But it's not the same as living out my own life, you know, like, I've been getting so old now that there's really - that I'm just too old to have any hope left, you know, for having what I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I really - I really sense (inaudible at 0:25:21.4) like, I know there were things I want to (inaudible at 0:25:24.7) wanted (inaudible at 0:25:26.7). Like, I see myself getting on, getting older. It just seems like I'm never, never going to have (inaudible at 0:25:45.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I just (inaudible at 0:25:49.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a relationship with someone, (inaudible at 0:25:53.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, I can't.</p>

<p>0:25:56.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Agony (inaudible at 0:25:58.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like, those feelings are inside you I really sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not even sure that I'm capable of even responding now to a man, you know, as an intimate relationship. I think it's just all killed inside because it was such torture over the summer. And then these other two rejection things (inaudible at 0:26:24.5) right in the road just did it, that really did it. I just would never trust a man again. And I have these real, you know, desperate fears now about a sexual relationship. And obviously, you know, I can't live without it and I can't live with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say "a sexual relationship," what do you mean? Do you mean just a sexual relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I mean, I could never carry off a sexual relationship unless I was really very strongly attached to someone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you mean by strongly attached?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, what (inaudible at 0:27:00.1). I want you to say more about that you can't carry off a sexual relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that's part of carrying off a relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And somehow, it's a special (inaudible at 0:27:12.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think - you know, I think that I could probably become very friendly with a man right now. But to me a sexual relationship represents what I was saying about being taken seriously, because I think it's really the most, you know, infinitely valuable part of that kind of intimacy, you know, of knowing somebody that well. And I just - I don't think I could trust a man to take me seriously (inaudible at 0:27:45.3). I just - I can't afford to let myself get into this myself, and then kind of be played with, you know, like this little girl toy or something.</p>

<p>0:27:55.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:27:56.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I kind of - in a way, at the time I was very glad that I heard what he'd said because it kind of put more of him in perspective, you know, some things that I had to realize about (inaudible at 0:28:12.6) person was. But for myself I'm not glad that I heard that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I kind of sense, like, you feel like you've had the last straw and then some with respect to men?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, like, you really just - it's almost like you've ruled that out as a potential source of happiness for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and yet I know that it's the situation where I really most fully express myself, you know, I know that because I've never been better than when I was with him, you know. You know, I really, really did love the guy, you know. I found out later was still involved with somebody else. And I don't know what the relationship...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This time when you kind of said, "I really love the guy," it's like, (inaudible at 0:29:06.1) picked up a - I think you had kind of sense of the loss and the sadness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, it was a combination. Yeah, if he died or something, I think it would have been easier to handle, you know, it would have been brief. It would have been the loss of him, but it wouldn't have been the rejection of myself mixed with it, you know. And if I were, you know, a stronger person, which I'm definitely not a strong person, you know, I could have handled the rejection and it would have been more of a reaction of grief. But now it's just so intensely combined both feelings because he is in a sense kind of irreplaceable, you know. You know, I just haven't met - I have met somebody that I was that excited about and he just was crazy. You know, giving me all these incredible compliments, and then he just never called back. I just - I never understood (inaudible at 0:29:59.0).</p>

<p>0:30:00.2</p>

<p>Except I think maybe he thought I was maybe too demanding, I don't know. I really don't understand why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:30:08.1), I mean, I don't understand - I mean, I guess what I don't understand - I mean, I hear you saying that I really think I just can't - I'm incapable of having a relationship with a man. I guess I don't understand that - why you feel that way. Maybe you could say something...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, from evidence and then from the building fear that's been a result of the evidence, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you can't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't you say something - why don't you talk to me, tell me about what your relationship was like with this guy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I should kind of go through - again, I've never really been - like, I had kind of a crush on this guy while I was a senior in college.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you here for college too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was in California. And then in the Peace Corps I - you know, I really got pretty involved this other guy, a very, very gentle, very funny - just a really good person. And that was, like, the first sexual involvement at all I'd ever had. And that was kind of off and on. I was still in no position to really understand the depth of the relationship to really respond to him that way, you know. It was kind of like, you know, good buddies thing. And then I saw him again in September when I came back because he lives, ironically, very close to where I (inaudible at 0:31:42.7).</p>

<p>And then again when I went home at Christmas, and by that time, you know, we just spent a lot of time together at Christmas. And by that time I was really kind of falling for him. And I knew when I came back (inaudible at 0:31:56.0), you know, (inaudible at 0:31:57.9), you know, a joke.</p>

<p>0:32:01.8</p>

<p>And so then I didn't - and I'd already gone - you know, I'd already gone out with a couple of guys that I really liked during fall, you know, between September and that Christmas. And they just didn't bother calling back after Christmas. And then I met this guy, he's a really incredible person. Have you seen "Five Easy Pieces?" Well, he's very, very much like the character, Bob (inaudible at 0:32:27.3). He kind of - it's kind of like jumping into the abyss, he negates everything. And I was just talking to somebody last night, and I realized I'm kind of - for some reason that I absolutely do not understand, I'm really attracted to that kind of nihilism, (inaudible at 0:32:47.7) nihilism. Because, you know, the very thing that's kind of his own sickness somehow attracts me.</p>

<p>The fear of restricting yourself means a loss of freedom, and therefore, you just get lost in the freedom. You know, I mean, that by not committing yourself really to anything, you never really define yourself either. And I really set myself up for, you know, destruction, self destruction with people like that. But that just intrigue me because they seem like bottomless pits, just these really deep (inaudible at 0:33:21.3). And there were - I mean, they were really very wonderful things, but I mean, really beautiful things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That kind of person - it's like they feel (ph) terribly deep in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they're so intriguing and - is there also the hope that you can shine through their nihilism (inaudible at 0:33:39.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sure that's it, yeah, I'm sure that's (inaudible at 0:33:42.7). In a way maybe it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've given them (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe it's like competing with nothing else because there is no (inaudible at 0:33:51.0) real interest (inaudible at 0:33:52.4). But, you know, they were very, very beautiful qualities, but I knew that he could be very compassionate. I'm sure that his political convictions, you know, stem from a real compassion for the underdog because he - he came over from Russia when he was 10, so I think he always felt kind of out of it in American culture, and as a result he was critical and yet, very sympathetic with people left out - been left out.</p>

<p>0:34:20.9</p>

<p>And I really admired his whole political outlook, you know, he's very radical but in a very thoughtful way. And that was, you know, by no means the main attraction but that was - there's kind of a reflection of his compassion, and I felt he's very warm and affectionate when he doesn't feel threatened, you know, when he doesn't think he's getting in too deep. He's a free - a person who's very active physically, you know, he's by no means a (inaudible at 0:34:50.3), although he's very, very bright, extremely. And I guess it was all that just kind of - you want to be (inaudible at 0:34:59.8) thing, you know, and he was just alive when we met. And that just really turned me on. And at the same time, you know, he's not able to make - I guess, you know, he made a commitment to a girl, he lived with her for a long time and then was engaged to her, and then something happened. Well, no, he's just, I guess, never gotten over it. I don't think he'll trust a woman.</p>

<p>And he doesn't trust his own emotions (inaudible at 0:35:27.5), you know, he gets bored with them. He gives himself a three month time and then he automatically gets bored. And he sets up defeat in a relationship before the thing ever really gets started. Because when I started thinking back about the beginning of it, he was always constantly bringing up the idea of marriage and love, and what totally ridiculous things they are. And then everything turns to shit. And I think he was trying to warn me, you know, in his own way. I mean, he - you know, he kind of made an effort that way. But of course, I didn't pick it up and I thought, oh, this is just this gruff thing that's covering up. And I still believe that it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The gruff...</p>

<p>PATIENT: A defensive thing which covers up a tremendous capacity in love, I know, you know, I know this thing. And, you know, it was very intense for, like, two or three months and then - well, I found out later that he'd actually - his (inaudible at 0:36:25.1) gets frantic (ph), and he's deeply into drugs. I don't see him coming - I see it getting either critical before he'll come out or else just something really disastrous. But, you know, he just totally escapes in drugs. And he admits that he just creates his own world, you know and that he's happy that way, he doesn't want it to change.</p>

<p>And I think he is - I don't know if he's fearful about what's going to happen in the future. I just don't think he is (inaudible at 0:36:55.9). And what else - I forgot what I was going to say about him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said a lot of about him (inaudible at 0:37:13.6) relationship.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, yes, one thing I found out about him was, yeah, this kind of schizophrenic thing where he was actually carrying off the relationship with this other girl at the same time he was with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: While he was engaged to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this was another one, the other thing that happened, like, two years, three years ago. But I remember, like, we went on this camping trip together and we had just a totally beautiful time. And he was, you know, very, very close with me. We were driving back and he kept saying, "It's just so good to have someone to talk to." You know, to really talk to. And then I found out later that the very - like, the very next morning he called up this other girl and said, "You know, I just wish that you'd been there all weekend so I could have talked to you." You know, kind of just totally divided himself up, you know. And I think was kind of legitimately involved, you know, at the same time, and didn't seem to see any kind of conflict at all.</p>

<p>0:38:19.7</p>

<p>And he does definitely kind of live in the moment. And the way it ended was terribly, terribly traumatic because I - all the way through, I'd never - I'd always been underneath very afraid of the way he felt about - yeah and not being taken seriously (inaudible at 0:38:40.0). And then I heard him say on the phone once, like, we'd had this absolutely beautiful, about four days together, just a completely beautiful, probably the closest time. And, you know, this other girlfriend called him, the one that he'd had before at some point. And I heard him say on the phone, "Well, it's all sweetness and innocence, but somehow, I just don't think it fits." And I just automatically assumed he was talked about me, you know, my place in his life because he is extremely worldly. He's into everything, you know. He kind of - he just experiments with everything.</p>

<p>And, you know, I was very na�ve with him and innocent and sweet, you know. But that was it, you know, kind of very childlike thing. And so I just totally blew up at that point, you know. And I - my God, what did I tell him? (Inaudible at 0:39:41.3) already forgotten. And I just told him that I knew I was a fool to care about him, you know, if that's how he regarded me and stuff. And I still really don't know if he was saying it about me or not, you know, of course he denied it. But in the back of my mind, I still kind of think so.</p>

<p>And then he quit talking to me, you know, he just - he got kind of pale. He was really, really shocked. And he just - you know, he just started doing other things, kind of taking (inaudible at 0:40:13.8) around the house and he wouldn't look at me, he wouldn't talk to me. And he never touched me again, never. You know, he wouldn't - well, yes, he did, you know, there were a couple of times when he kind of let loose and was still very affectionate. But for a while I kind of kidded myself by believing his excuses, you know, that he knew he was leaving for Europe and, you know, he had to kind of break it off and cut it off, you know. And I would just kid myself into believing it.</p>

<p>0:40:42.3</p>

<p>And then, you know, it really hit that there was no chance. And he told me there was never going to be a chance, and then kind of went off. And, like, you know, he would keep - I guess he didn't want to hurt me by letting it break off that suddenly. And I could never comprehend how the relationship could have been so intense one minute, and then over the next. You know, it totally blew my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like all of a sudden, it's, like, maybe, you know, it was only in retrospect that you could see the cues or the signs before (inaudible at 0:41:18.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Care for you the way you thought he did care for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That Jordan just couldn't see them (inaudible at 0:41:25.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like, all of a sudden to kind of realize your fallacy and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just how wrong you had been in - and there it was, the evolution of that fear that you (inaudible at 0:41:37.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really must have (inaudible at 0:41:41.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was just too much to take. And so I guess, you know, he knew that I was - that it was going to really break me up, you know. And then I - you know, he made it seem as though - you know, he'd been building it up and (inaudible at 0:41:57.2) whole relationship, I'm not sure he consciously does this, but he sets it up so that the woman will be guilty because he's always letter her know that he's been terribly hurt by women before. That, you know, he has real trouble trusting them; that they always turn out to be bitches. So all of a sudden here I was, I'd yelled (ph) at him I was a bitch. And, you know, of course it was my fault. So then I just went - I killed myself for two months to try to make it up to him, you know, try to show him, try to, you know, let him know that he could trust me and stuff.</p>

<p>0:42:25.9</p>

<p>And of course, that wasn't it at all. He was just trying to kind of tactfully let me break it off. So what he'd do would be very, very - you know, he would be really very warm. And I'm sure he does have a real affection for me, not as, you know, a love relationship but at least as a very close friend. And so he - you know, there would be this - still this real closeness and then I think he'd regret it, he'd be afraid of what I, you know - what I would think. And then the next time I saw him, he'd just be obnoxious. And it was just this constant up and down and up and down and up and down after.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Back and forth in a way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With respect to the closeness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, and it just was utter confusion to me. I just - I couldn't figure it out. And then, you know, finally - like, I put my all into proving to him, you know, that it was really okay and then after all that, you know, it turned out that it would never be a serious relationship (inaudible at 0:43:27.3). And I just, you know - I really can't get over that feeling, it was just such hell during the time. I just can't really get well inside.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you see, I guess it's really hard for me to get - from the way you talk about it, just to get the sense of what that feeling was really like that you can't get over it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I really can sense from what (inaudible at 0:43:52.5).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's like it's very painful and hard to really get the sense (inaudible at 0:44:01.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:44:02.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so I know - you know, what I thought was okay, I've just - the only way I'll get over him is to just meet other people and get involved. And then there were these, you know, possibilities. And I suppose, you know - if I were really using my head about it, these people would not be all that attractive, you know. It's just like maybe a kind of clinging to some kind of a distraction in a way, which is obviously not fair to them. I know with one person that there was definitely a real, you know (inaudible at 0:44:32.6) thing. But I don't know, right now, I just feel totally, totally hopeless about this thing with men.</p>

<p>Like, you know, I couldn't comprehend that I gave everything I knew how to give. And it was rejected, it was thrown back in my face, it was just not enough, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's like, you really gave inside in the most meaningful way, it really, like, felt like you came from (inaudible at 0:44:57.9), like, the very parts that are alive.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, exactly, exactly, I was most...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And, you know, here you were just being totally coming and acting on your innards in a way in the most real sense, and they just got thrown in your face and stepped on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, exactly, and then since then, you know, I've responded to people pretty much in that way. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, in the way, you know, which was successful, you know, in relating to them before. And of course, you know, that was thrown back in my face too, you know. And apparently, the aura I created with this one guy - I don't know what - maybe how much defensive reaction it was or not. But was one which elicited pity of all things, pity, you know. I mean, how dehumanizing reaction to somebody. You know, I think he was just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't feel pity (inaudible at 0:45:59.1)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I thought I was really doing okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was not, you know, self-pitying, you know, I confided to him. He happened to be living in the apartment; he was just using one of the rooms that had been vacated for about a week. And he knew a little bit of what was going on. I'd never really said that much, but we talked really closely, you know, about, you know, he'd gone through a thing, you know, of wanting to marry a girl and her refusing. And I thought there was this real understanding, and a kind of, you know, a personal kind of respect, I mean, a mutual respect thing. And instead, you know, I came off like this little girl, this poor little match girl thing, you know, and, you know, I just - I didn't really understand that reaction either.</p>

<p>0:46:49.7</p>

<p>And by that time I just totally gave up. You know, there was nothing because right before that was this guy that I really, really liked very much. I was really attracted to him the first time. And, you know, for some reason he just didn't call back. He obviously really liked me and was very attracted and didn't call. And, you know, that kind of threw me for a loop and then to have this. And with this other guy, his reaction - like, I'd gone to Chicago and he'd come too because I knew him vaguely in the Peace Corps and he just happened to come here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, like, you know, these are very good friends of mine in Chicago that I had known, very close, you know, and we were just talking quite honestly about things, you know, and about women's lib, and I was kind of for it at that point, you know, in psychological terms because I just didn't think that women should be stepped on (inaudible at 0:47:42.1), you know, like has happened - not to me but a lot of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:47:46.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not only to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:47:48.4).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And, you know, I was just saying things quite honestly, and don't worry about getting used to loneliness, getting used to - if you have to be free, then be totally free, you know. And apparently, that kind of blew his mind. That was like a really deep, personal revelation. And he told me that I was beautifully honest, it was true but it was really frightening to other people. So then I tried to be pretty casual with him and not betray too much, not making (inaudible at 0:48:15.2), not setting him on edge. And then he'd start asking kind of probing questions, you know. And I was just really at a loss at what he was trying to get at.</p>

<p>0:48:24.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What he wanted from you, or what - put it this way, what way you knew he would respond to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think he has a funny idea about women basically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, I basically (inaudible at 0:48:38.0) hear you saying that, like, (ph), I (inaudible at 0:48:41.3) how to be, I don't know how to be with a man.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, because in a way I feel like the way I've been has been the way - the way that's most real for me to be. And it's stepped on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I haven't been cared for and loved (inaudible at 0:48:56.2) that way to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, (inaudible at 0:48:59.4) I think - well, I know that this guy did not get interested in me just out of desperation or loneliness, so I guess he was, you know, trying to carry on a relationship with another person at the same time. Now I know there was real sincere attraction. And I know things were - I know he really was very, very involved for a while. But, you know, at the same time, I feel like maybe I was kind of a filler or something gap, you know, which is all just basically part of this thing. I mean, if you're not taken seriously as a human being, when you yourself take other human beings that seriously, take life seriously, I don't mean grimly by any chance, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know what you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Laugh a lot too, you know. When life really means tremendous, you know, thing, that when you mean nothing in other people's lives, that there's just nothing, there's just no point. I guess it's kind of (inaudible at 0:50:04.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:50:03.9). You know this is a 20 sessions?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you want to come twice a week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:50:16.8), it might be more beneficial, you know.</p>

<p>(Crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:50:18.6) critical.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's up to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I can do that for a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is this time with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as I know it's okay (inaudible at 0:50:33.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, why don't we set this - I mean, why don't we set it up for this time on Tuesday, we'll meet at that time. I'm not exactly (inaudible at 0:50:43.2) schedule is exactly set yet. (Inaudible at 0:50:46.1) we have to adjust the time or anything like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So Tuesday at 3:30?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, fine. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, how've you been?  I haven't seen you in a while, [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Talk to my mom, since [INAUDIBLE] talk anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I should talk with just your mom?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much, um, how did you do in school the last few—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Months, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good?  Able to pay attention well?  Are you off your medicine today, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have no clue.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You seem to be—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, she's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A little on the hyper side.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, she's not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, she's not?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No, but the only thing is, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's just happy to be here?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She did want to come see you on Monday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And talk to you she told me.  So I thought she would be talking to you now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but you're talking.  You're talking about something else besides me.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, no.  We're talking about you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Would you want to talk to me about private about something or—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been seeing things.  First I saw a, um, spirit of a cat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then at night, I was awake, and then I saw an alien, and then I saw [INAUDIBLE] really bothered by it, but it was shipping in from [INAUDIBLE] so I didn't really get bothered by that, just like the alien.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're going to sleep when these happen, or it's happening during the day as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's happening during the day.  When I saw the spirit cat, it was that day that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I took my walk.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what did it look like?  I mean, was it—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It, it looked like my friend's, um, cat—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And were, what were you doing when all those starts, thoughts started happening to you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the cat I saw in the daytime—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I was just walking, and it was like moving its head, looking at me, going like this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now, how did you know it was a spirit cat?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it wasn't alive.  It was like all spirally and clear.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Just like a ghost almost?  A ghost image?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did it scare you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I went—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Running, besides me going all the way back to the house.  Instead of me going all the way up the hill, then I went straight back to the house.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  How about at night?  Are you sleeping?  Are you having bad dreams?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I was awake 'cause for some reason I couldn't sleep 'cause I was all hypered up on candy or something I had, and, um, I saw the alien at my window.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What was he doing?  Looking for new victims?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nod.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  He nodded at you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did you get rid of him?  Did you wake up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  In the morning time, he was gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's scary.  What did he look like?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like he had this brown mouth with these sharp teeth all around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ew.  Was he looking for a lunch?  Maybe he was going to eat you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He better not eat me.  I got my whole life ahead of me.  I still want to do that.  I don't want that to happen to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, you seem, your imagination seems to be pretty fast this summer, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think 'cause I'm hyped up on candy and sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  What happens when you have those?  You get more nervous and—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, actually I get all hyper.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But you haven't been having that much candy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She's been the Adderall, though, and that does help the hyperactivity levels?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But she has been extremely talkative and lively, but we're at the pool, so it's not as noticeable, I think, you know, that if we were trying to sit and get her to concentrate on something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And she's still taking the Risperdal—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	For the behavior, and the—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The Trileptal for the moods—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What does that thing go to?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't remember her complaining about visual hallucinations before.  This seems to be new.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Way back when we first came to you—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She did, but since then, she hasn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This is the first time in, in years that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is she being stressed at all by other kids or social situations?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Actually, she's been getting along much better with the kids when we go to the pool this year.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She's actually making friends and playing and, and the other kids are even getting excited when they see her, you know, happy to see her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  [PATIENT NAME], that sounds pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is high up.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So that's why I, I was surprised when she started saying this on Monday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, you're not telling your friend you're seeing stuff, are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, she's not 1 of my friends anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, because you'll lose your friends faster if they think something's wrong with you, you know?  Have to keep these things to yourself.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Now, she did tell my cousin yesterday.  My cousin—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Came over, and she asked me, "How's [PATIENT NAME] been?"  I said, "She's been doing pretty good".  She said, "Well, she told me she was seeing things."</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Who cousin?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I didn't say anything.  I did tell [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's like a, an unusual situation.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then he must have told his mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you feeling depressed at all or just hyper?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you sleeping well at night, or you—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Find that you're not sleeping?  Good.  All right, and you're happy with yourself?  You're getting out with people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I'm going over to my cousin's after this appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Going to my cousins. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  There was a clap of something out there.  It could be thunder.  It looks like we may be getting some storms.  All right.  [NAME OTHER], are you comfortable with the medicines she's on now?  We'll just leave them that way for the summer, and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	For the summer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I don't know what this is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Hey, that guy looks just like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know either.  It's like, she said these things Monday and Tuesday—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And then the rest of the week, she didn't mention anything anymore to me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  Yes, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Look.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That, um, guy right there in the small picture looks just like you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In the small picture?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Which one?  Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This one right here.  You're all twins.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, it is me.  That's a picture of me signing the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was going to say is that George Washington in that picture?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it's Benjamin Franklin.  I was at a, um, a seminar in [DEIDENTIFIED], and it was around the bicentennial time, and they took these pictures, and they would get you dressed up in costume, so there's me signing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cool.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thought it was a cool picture.  I actually had someone saying "I didn't know you signed that.  That was a long time ago.  How old are you?"  I worried about that person.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now, you're kind of regretting from that, now people asking you all those questions.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no.  That's all right.  Do you have any questions you want to ask me?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No?  You look happy.  You've been out in the sun.  You got a nice tan, right?  You're enjoying your summer?  There she goes again.  All right.  We're going to leave all your meds the same, [PATIENT NAME] rather than changing anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My name's [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I mean [PATIENT NAME].  I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm wondering why you keep on calling me [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You look like a [NAME OTHER] today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.  I look more like a [NAME OTHER] today.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	An [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	When you saw her, I would say we're doing fine—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	An [NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Her talkativeness and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  She's outgoing.  She's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Very, been extremely outgoing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh God, that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	The lifeguard at the pool just gets a kick out of her all the time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I bet he likes you too, huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Too bad he's not going to be here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is the lifeguard at the pool?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  You like him, don't you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He's my friend.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ew, sharks.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  He's been letting her help out and sit by the lifeguard seat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, [PATIENT NAME]'s very active so she probably—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stop calling me that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Can see people in the water.  I mean [PATIENT NAME].  You're very active.  You probably—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You must have a girl that looks just like me named [NAME OTHER] or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Actually, I do have a, a patient that looks like you named [NAME OTHER].  I'll probably call her [PATIENT NAME].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You better not.  I was wondering—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh, at least he's not doing like I do and call you [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so.  I'd rather be called [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right, and is she, uh, she's still taking the, the active Adderall later in the day when she gets it, right?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Ew, why is it all the way over here?  [INAUDIBLE].  What's this?  It's all dusty.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If this, um, gets worse or gets to be problematic, give me a call.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll probably have to change her Risperdal, but—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tell him about what?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Could it be the switch to a generic brand?  Could that have any—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's right.  They just went to generic in Risperdal.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.  Could that have had any effect?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It could be.  There're supposed to be equivalent, but it might not have enough Risperdal in it.  Um, what do they charge you for a name brand?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I'm not changed anything with, with our medical insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want the name brand than on that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See if it works better.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	If you can—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	'Cause maybe that's what the problem; we started it on the weekend.  I think it was, uh, Saturday—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Look at this, look at this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She started on the, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Look at this.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Generic brand.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then this all began with the visual halluc—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Maybe that could be it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I got this pretty hat.  My mom had [INAUDIBLE] this free hat, and I love my hat.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She is very happy.  She's been, uh, the only thing she said she was sad about, she couldn't wait for school, and I was thrilled to hear that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it's coming up.  What grade are you going into, [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  How come it's not moving any water?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably needs more water in that fountain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How do you get more water in it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I have to put some in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where do you put it in?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Under those little, um, shells, and then that will take care of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Mean this one?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Look at that pretty shell.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In this shell right here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Isn't that pretty?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's like a secret [INAUDIBLE] tube that's invisible, you know, and it goes.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	This [INAUDIBLE] looks like it's straight from the tropics.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It probably is.  All that stuff comes in from China.  I'm sure the shells—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	China.  That's a new word, China.  China.  I make everyone crack up for some reason.  I crack myself up.  Oh, if I'm bored, all I have to do is say stuff, and I crack myself up.  I went underwater once.  Mom, tell him how much I cracked myself up with just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know you do.  I think that's why you like the lifeguard so much 'cause he laughs at everything you say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know it is, and he does; he lets me sit up there 'cause he's my friend, and 'cause I've known him for a long time.  China.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He really likes [PATIENT NAME]'s personality.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Probably relieves the day of boredom.  She keeps her eye on everything too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yes, she does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I make him crack up—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.  She watches what the other kids are doing.  If they're not doing the right thing, she lets him know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Lets him know.  That's good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	China.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  I'll see you, [PATIENT NAME], after school begins, so—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let me know, and I forgot, um, when we did this that there's something I have to read, so let me read it now, it's um—</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) It's funny about being late.  If I am, I feel I can't be here and not say anything at all.  And when I'm on time, I'll let myself lie here for quite a while without saying anything.  And it's almost like I get to a point and then I think well, now I'd better start talking, almost.  (Pause) And I also was thinking about the fact that while I was coming, that there was nothing I could do, after a certain point, to get here faster.  And some things happened that made me even slower.  And I just, the nervousness just built up and, and the tension and almost, the more I couldn't do anything, the, the more tense I became.</p>

<p>And I don't feel that way when I'm — well, I do, to a certain point, when I'm late for just meeting a friend or something or MSCZ.  But if I'm late for school or for any kind of a job or commitment where I feel almost a duty then I, I've had this same reaction if something has happened and it's made me later.  But I'm also inclined to plan things so that, or count on things taking less time, so that, in a way, I don't know whether it's in a way trying to avoid going.  Like very often if I'm meeting MSCZ or some o—, somebody else, I'll plan on leaving at a certain time and it's, and then I'll do a lot of things right before.  And even if I leave at the time I'd planned it isn't enough time to get there and, and be when I said I'd be there.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you want to avoid coming here today?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not, not, I wasn't aware of it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't — I mean, this, it was sort of out of my hands.  I was, uhm, at the hairdresser's and it was an appointment I'd made earlier, quite a bit earlier.  And I was told that I'd be through by a certain time.  And, and it just didn't work out that I was.  And, and I don't really know what I could have done to s—, to be out sooner except I have this feeling that I could have done something.  And I also, once I was out and then the subway was late and just it seemed like everything was happening, I just had the feeling again, I guess, I would feel ridiculous coming this late.  And, although I wouldn't have done this, it almost became, I began to think, well, maybe I shouldn't come at all because I'll be so late.  And the time I'm late will be greater than the time that's left.  And this disturbed me too.  And I think it must be because it just seemed ridiculous, which is the thought that so often comes to me about things.  (Pause) And I suppose too, this being late because of something like being at the hairdresser's seemed to me ridiculous. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  After I left yesterday I, I don't know, I just suddenly felt almost as if the whole feeling of tension and whatever else it can be described at, as, about my relationship with MSCZ, just seemed like it just went and I really, I was very eager to see him when I got home.  But then, but then it came back again.  And he was late getting home, which always annoys me, although sometimes I don't think of it as annoying me.  But I think at times like that I think, well, if he really wanted to get home sooner he could.  But even when he came home, he, he was very nice to me.  And, and I was trying also not to just be moody or something.  Because if I'm feeling that unhappy about things often I just get very moody.  And that's equally unpleasant.  And so today, I still don't feel that wonderful about things and I still have this feeling of being so tired that I've been feeling lately but somehow I do feel a certain relief.  And it just seems like, well, we're just kind of going back into that same pattern again of almost just being roommates or — (sniffle) and so, so then that bothers (laughs) me.  And I try not to, I don't want that to happen, either.  Although it is a relief to me to have it happen. (Silence)</p>

<p>And it's almost like right when I'm feeling the way I am now, I want MSCZ to be sort of fatherly to me.  (Pause) But a while ago it seemed to me he, the, the position I wanted him to be in was more s—, kind of brotherly position.  But I was just thinking now that the thing I liked about how he treated me last night was being sort of understanding of how I was feeling and just being very nice to me and, and in a way really giving to me without asking anything to be given in return, almost the way a father would if a child were in some kind of trouble.  Or I sort of want him to be, have, I don't know, "Sufficient enough,"  that's not really the word, but to be strong enough so that he can give without needing to receive too, the way a parent does appear to a child.</p>

<p>And it just struck me again that something I've been aware of in other contexts but I don't think, in a way, that that's anything my father ever did do.  Because once I became aware, could really judge, what he was asking from us, it became very obvious that he was very dependent on us in a way, and, and needed to have a lot of love from us and a lost of respect and (sniffle) admiration (clears throat).  And if he was that way when I was in my teens then he must have been that way right from the beginning.  And it is almost, I don't, I don't know whether this really is a parallel but it just occurred to me too that this need for respect from me was, I think, one thing that made me fight him so much.  Or anyway, just feeling somehow that he was asking something from me and sometimes they were things that I couldn't give to him.  And as a result, I used to argue with him a lot and just pick a fight with him on purpose.  And in a way, the times I have to fight against MSCZ are times when he seems to be asking something from me the most.  And then when it, when he indicates he's not going to ask anymore then I can give to him or I can turn to him or I can feel I need him.  But I can't when he's asking it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And then it just came to my mind — but even if that is it, and I don't know that it is, I still can't see how that can make any difference in my response to MSCZ.  And I suppose in a way it's my great need to feel that I'm controlling the situation and that with, ah, any new awareness that then I can use it to better control the situation.  And this made me think of the fact that after I left here I kept thinking about the mother who seemed to contrast so much to me.  And my thoughts then centered more on her seeming ability to cope with her, her whole situation and that this was really what was disturbing me so much about comparing myself with her, that I couldn't imagine ever coping with it.  And I made some comment about this to MSCZ and just using the word coping bothers me.  Just like it used to bother me to, — or it still does — to think of the word piles with connection with all the things that I keep or my job, sometimes that bothers me.  And MSCZ said, "I think sometimes you put too much on coping with things."  And just the emotional reaction I had to the word made me feel that probably this is another thing I do do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did you feel when you heard the word, when he said it: coping.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Annoyed, almost.  Well, annoyed that, I knew that was the word that expressed what was on my mind but annoyed that it had to be that word.  And not ev—, well, more something else, too: I didn't want use it but I still had to.  (Pause) Or almost like I was debating with myself when I was saying it, well, what's so good about coping all the time.  And yet it is a value that I've been taught.  So on the other side I'd argue that well, of course it's one of the best values to have.  And I think sometimes I've had a great desire just not to cope, not to cope with a job and therefore either quit it or just come in for a while or just be irresponsible and not control yourself, myself.  And it's funny the attitude I have about crying, too, because one day I was talking to MSCZ about the fact that when I, I was crying, that this bothered me very much to be crying because first of all, it's something I said here too, that at my age I felt it was ridiculous to cry.  And it just made me feel I wasn't being what my age is.  And he said that I really don't cry that much at all.  And I, I don't know, I feel as if I'm crying all the time.  Almost as if crying at all makes me cry too much.  It means that I'm crying too much, that somebody at my age wouldn't be crying at all.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, now, our time's up.</p>

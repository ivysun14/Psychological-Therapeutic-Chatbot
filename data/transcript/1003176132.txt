<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></b></p>

<p>Susan M. Johnson, EdD, is Professor of Psychology in the School of Psychology at the University of Ottawa and Director of the Ottawa Couple and Family Institute, Ottawa, Canada. Widely published, she is the main proponent of emotionally focused couple and family therapy, which she teaches extensively in North America and internationally. In 2005, she received the Distinguished Contribution to Family Systems Research Award from the American Family Therapy Academy. The website for Dr. Johnson's work is <a href="www.eft.ca">www.eft.ca</a>.</p>

<p>In this transcript, Dr. Johnson works with a couple on the brink of divorce. Leslie says she can't take Scott's explosive temper anymore; Scott says he thinks Leslie sees him as "just a mean and nasty guy." Johnson helps Leslie communicate that it is not Scott she can't be close to, but his temper that keeps her away. As Johnson helps Scott explore "softer" emotions hidden underneath his anger, the couple discovers how difficult it is to traverse this foreign territory. Nonetheless, Johnson's persistent and gentle coaching helps them to take risks and begin to connect in ways they've never experienced before, providing a spark of hope that they can reverse their downward spiral.</p>

<p><b><u>JOHNSON'S APPROACH</u></b></p>

<p>Carlson: Well, let's first talk with Dr. Sue Johnson and find out just what emotionally focused couples therapy is. Sue, welcome.</p>

<p>Susan Johnson: Hi.</p>

<p>Kjos: Hi there. Welcome, Sue.</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, you and Dr. Greenberg were the innovators or the developers of this approach. Just what is it, in, kind of in a nutshell?</p>

<p>Johnson: In a nutshell. Okay, well, basically, it's a humanistic approach. And it's an approach that privileges emotion. I sort of think of it as kind of like, it's sort of like as if Carl Rogers sat down to tea with Salvador Minuchin, and they kind of agreed to sort of put an approach together. So what we sort of do in this approach is we try to listen to people's emotions, because we believe that emotions really tell us what matters to people. They tell us how people, their needs in the relationship, and they basically organize how people interact with each other on a very basic level. Emotion comes from the Latin word "to move." And if you read the research on emotion, it talks a lot about how emotion is a basic motivating force. It sort of pulls us to move in particular kinds of ways. So we're focusing on emotion because we feel that it organizes people's interactions and because often it's the, to help people sort of move and talk about and develop and expand their emotions is the fastest way to help them move into new stances with each other.</p>

<p>Carlson: How did you ever come up with this idea of bringing Minuchin and Rogers together for lunch? How did you become...</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, my couples taught me how to do it, actually, in fact. But the sort of academic answer to that is that I was trained as a Rogerian individual therapist, and I had also done family therapy using a Minuchin model. And then I started to see couples. And first of all, I was a little dismayed at how difficult it seemed to be to work with couples, because there was all this incredible emotion. And so I found it quite difficult. But after a while, I started to let them teach me how to work with emotion and how expressing new emotions and dealing with emotions in a different way could create new interactions. And that started to get really fascinating. That's the academic answer. Perhaps a more real answer is I grew up in an English pub, and if you, if you are a child in an English pub, you stand all the time and you watch people interact, and you watch how emotional expression and the communication of emotion immediately organizes the dance between people.</p>

<p>What's interesting to me is that research now, you know, John Gottman's research is really saying the same thing—that emotional engagement and communication is what defines relationships. But I could see that in the pub, I think.</p>

<p>Kjos: What about cultural differences? Because we think of emotion, of some cultures as being more "emotional" and having different... What about cultural differences here?</p>

<p>Johnson: I guess the way I think about that is I think that... And again, the research talks about the fact that if you look across cultures, there are certain basic emotions that go across cultures. I think that emotion therapists, researchers have come up with something like six basic emotions, things like fear, sadness, right, joy, right, go across cultures. But how it's expressed, and the rules around expression, are different. For example, we found when we worked with Chinese families—because EFT is used with families as well as with couples—that they would talk a lot more about shame than, say, some of the couples that we, the Canadian couples that we saw or the families we saw. And they would talk a lot about that there were certain expectations of certain roles in the family as a father and as a mother, and expectations of, you know... Also coming into therapy, they would talk about that it was shameful for them to be in therapy. So we would have to attune to that. And we would have to, you know, sort of follow the client. This is a very collaborative approach. You follow the client a lot. So we would have to attune to that expression of shame and slow down and let them talk about that, right.</p>

<p>Carlson: So you really tailor it depending upon the cultural group that you're going to be working on?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, we do.</p>

<p>Carlson: Since this is, and as I referred to before, a manualized approach, then it would have some set steps that you would follow.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you take us through the steps that you would use when you work with a couple?</p>

<p>Johnson: Basically we, we developed the approach by looking at videos of couples and us working with couples, and sort of looking at the process. So we came up with nine steps. Basically they go into three stages. The first stage is a deescalation stage.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay.</p>

<p>Johnson: And what we're doing is we're trying to look at the cycle of interactions the couple get trapped into and get stuck with. And we're trying to look at the emotional realities that sort of underlie that cycle and organize that cycle, and access them a little bit, and deescalate the negative patterns, and create safety in the session. And the second stage of the therapy is really, then, not just moving beyond deescalation and trying to create new patterns of interaction that act as an antidote to that negative cycle—and new patterns of interaction that aren't just new and different, but are specifically creating a more secure bond. So then we go into working at creating a more secure bond. And last stage of therapy is consolidation—that we try to consolidate those changes that the couple have made, and talk to them about how they've repaired their relationship and how they did that.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that's like hope and encouragement?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, and also sort of creating for them a real coherent image and story and version of how they managed to move from this negative cycle that created so much emotional distress for them into a more positive cycle of security and bonding and...</p>

<p>Kjos: What would be the average length of time, then, that you might work with a couple?</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, in our research, it's, it's really down to 10 or 12 sessions.</p>

<p>Kjos: Okay.</p>

<p>Johnson: But some of that depends on the couple. For example, there's going to be a book coming out next year with Guilford on working with traumatized couples with this approach. And then you have to be much more flexible. And so some of the very distressed couples that we would see at the general hospital in Ottawa we would see maybe 20 times. Those couples would have other problems—they would be depressed or they would be having post-traumatic stress disorder, things like that. So some of that depends on the couple, but I would say between 10 and 15 sessions, something like that.</p>

<p>Carlson: Is there homework that you have in this last step? Is there any kind of assignments you give, or is this more of a dynamic approach?</p>

<p>Johnson: Mostly in EFT we assume that you're going to create change in the session, but sometimes we give homework assignments. Often they're... But they're sort of, then... In a way it doesn't matter if you do them or not. There's no failure... You can't really fail here, because it's just as interesting if you can't do the assignment as if you could, because you follow the process of what happens to the client. Sometimes it's just as interesting when you ask a client to do something in therapy— like if you say, "Could you please turn to your wife and talk to her about that?" If the client says no, that's actually just as interesting and just as useful, sometimes, as if the client says yes, because then you can help that person explore, "It's so very hard for you to turn to your wife right now and talk about this," and the person says, "Yes it is." "Could you tell her, ‘It's too hard for me right now to turn and talk to you about this; it's too scary'?" And the person does that.</p>

<p>So often the homework is about, "Would you notice when you get stuck in the cycle this week? Would you notice a time when it's very hard for you to let your wife in and to talk to her the way you do here?" And then people do that, and they come in and they say, "Yes! Do you remember the time on Wednesday morning?" That kind of homework.</p>

<p>Kjos: That would be one of the sort of techniques that you would use. Are there some other things that we might watch for in terms of interventions or techniques that would be significant or key?</p>

<p>Carlson: Or really unique to this approach?</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, basically if you look at the basic techniques, what you're going to see me doing, say, on the tape, is you're going to see me reflecting emotion. And Rogers used reflection. It can sometimes seem like quite a sort of superficial thing, but actually a good reflection better organizes somebody's experience—that's what we're trying to do—so that they grasp it and deal with it, and put shape and form to it, and deal with it in a different kind of way. So you're going to see me do a lot of reflection. Sometimes I take a particular emotional response and heighten it to kind of put it out so that everybody can see it and look at it and... You're going to see me using simple language, using the client's language, using images whenever I can, asking evocative questions like, "What's that like for you?" And this is all about expanding people's emotional experience. And then you'll see the EFT therapist creating interactions, like... This is a very active therapy in that we create interactions all the time. So you'll see me work with somebody's emotional experience and then say, "Do you think you could turn to your partner right now? Could you tell your partner what you've just told me?" So you create a new interaction all the time. So we're tracking interactions, tracking negative cycles, tracking positive cycles when there is, there are positive cycles, and creating interactions, and then going back and helping people process the emotions in those interactions.</p>

<p>Carlson: Is there... And I can see that this is going to work really well with some highly verbal people, some highly functioning people. Does it work with everybody, or are there people it just doesn't work with?</p>

<p>Johnson: That's an interesting comment, actually, because the, some of the research that's been done on EFT suggests that it works very well with people who aren't so highly functioning and aren't so verbal, perhaps because they stay in touch with their emotions and they stay more concrete. The only people we really don't use EFT with is we don't use EFT with violent couples. I think there's a lot of literature saying that that's not a good idea. But sometimes you have to adapt the model to the client. You have to slow the process down. But we used EFT with depressed clients, for example. It works very well. But sometimes you have to slow the process down, then, and give somebody more time. Sometimes you have to stay with somebody while they struggle with formulating their emotional experience. But our experience, in the research, even, says that this model works very well with, for example, men who've been described by their partners as inexpressive and unable to talk about their feelings. The research on the predictors of success in EFT said that it worked very well with those guys.</p>

<p>Carlson: I think that's most of us.</p>

<p>Kjos: Men, yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: I think, yeah. I saw that look in her eye.</p>

<p>Kjos: Looking right at you, right?</p>

<p>Carlson: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Kjos: You've talked about the research. Do you... Talk a little bit about where you see that going in the future.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, the research on EFT is very promising and very encouraging. What we're doing right now is we're trying to look at impasses in therapy. And we've identified a certain impasse that we call an attachment injury, where somebody's been basically abandoned at a time of deep need. And we're looking at how that impasse comes up in therapy and how you help people work through it. So we're trying to focus on the process of therapy. But we're also applying this approach to different people, say, people with post-traumatic stress disorder. We're starting to do that. So I think that's where the research is going. But so far, more and more data is coming in. I mean, the research on EFT is that right now we get 70 to 75 percent of couples recovered from distress after 10 to 12 sessions. That's incredibly good. That's not improved, that's recovered. And also what's interesting about EFT is that we don't seem to be having the same problem with relapse as some of the other approaches. The research that's coming out on EFT now is that, for example, we did a study in Ottawa with the parents of chronically ill children who have very high marital distress and depression. And all the results stayed after two years. They were all the same.</p>

<p>Carlson: Wow, that's a significant time, too.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah, and I think that... The way I understand that is if you do actually help people create a more secure emotional bond, that actually has a sort of self-maintaining effect on people. That can sort of, that is an antidote to negatives in the relationship, and it sort of helps people maintain that change when you've created it.</p>

<p>Carlson: You said that this approach doesn't really work or isn't, and emotional approaches really don't work well with people who are violent, and yet in a minute we're going to watch you work with a couple—</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: —and one of the complaints of this couple is that this man is very angry and he's very aggressive, and... which is often a description of someone who will then move into violence. And yet you seem to work quite well with this man.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, my assumption when I'm working with this man... EFT uses, sees relationships through an attachment lens, through the lens of attachment theory, right. And my assumption is that at least some of this man's touchiness and anger and inability to talk about other feelings is to do with his insecurity with his wife. And so what I'm doing is I'm assuming that his anger's not so much out of control that he's hitting—which I'm, which he isn't—and that if I can help him expand this narrow, rigid, angry response into talking about other feelings, he can create new kinds of interactions with his partner. That's what I'm trying to do.</p>

<p>Carlson: So he's got more than a hammer in his toolkit, right?</p>

<p>Johnson: You've got it. That's a beautiful way to put it. And all he's doing is using his hammer right now, and that he can't talk about his other needs and his other feelings. That's all he ever... So he's stuck in one rooted response. So I'm sort of... And there's lots of research that says that angry, coercive partners in relationships are, in fact, very insecure in their attachment. That's part of what's going on for them.</p>

<p>Kjos: Is there anything in particular we should watch for as we review this session?</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I hope that what you're going to see is you're going to see me talking a lot about the cycle, because I'm trying to get the context. I'm trying to get the sense of what actually happens in this problem-dance. So you're going to see me sort of following the sequence of interactions and finding the sort of circular cycle of how they get stuck in a dance. And then you're going to see me trying to move into the sort of attachment realities of, you know, how safe they feel with each other, can they connect, is there any security in the relationship, and to move into a little bit into underlying feelings, particularly with him, to sort of see if I can expand that anger into, you know, some of the feelings that he can't talk about, some of the more vulnerable feelings. We end up, in EFT, moving people past the sort of reactive emotional stances into their more softer, vulnerable, attachment-related feelings and needs. That's where we sort of go.</p>

<p>Carlson: And this is a session that's about fifty minutes long, and you usually work a little bit longer.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: And as a result of compressing this a little bit, is there anything that's lost that...</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I think sometimes I would go a little slower.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay...</p>

<p>Johnson: Emotional responses take longer to process, and sometimes you have to give people time, and you have to repeat, and you have to stay with people. I'm not talking about catharsis when I talk about emotion. I think emotion got a bad name from catharsis. I'm talking about helping somebody go to the leading edge of their experience where they can't quite articulate it, and move into processing it further, and then being able to communicate that to their partner. And that takes time. But my experience of this couple, actually, is that they, they sort of came along with me pretty well.</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, I thought that, but...</p>

<p>Johnson: Maybe it was just me that felt like I was a bit squeezed. They didn't seem to. They did come along with me pretty well, I think.</p>

<p><b><u>COUPLES THERAPY SESSION</u></b></p>

<p>Johnson: So, what you're telling me, Scott, is that you know you've been having problems in the relationship and you don't want to lose Leslie. That's what you're telling me?</p>

<p>Scott: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't want to lose her and the kids. I don't want to be a weekend daddy.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. And as I understand right now, what's happened is that you guys have just separated for a little while. Is that right?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah? Okay. As we go on, if I... I'm going to sort of reflect back some things to you that I might say. And if I somehow get it wrong or get a slant that isn't quite right, or I put a word in that isn't quite right, I really want you to correct me and help me with that. Okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Okay.</p>

<p>Johnson: Can you do that? Is that all right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay. Because I'm going to try to sort of understand your relationship. What I'm going to try and do is kind of understand some of how you guys interact together, and some of the ways that you kind of get stuck with each other that stops you being able to be close and create safety in your relationship. Is that okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: All right. So you're saying that you don't want to lose your wife, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. And you understand that, Leslie?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes.</p>

<p>Johnson: You understand that he, he really wants the relationship?</p>

<p>Leslie: I, I do understand that, yes. That's what he says, anyway.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's what he says?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Do you sort of find that reassuring when he says that? What's that like for you to hear him say that he really wants the relationship?</p>

<p>Leslie: I would like to see it in, in actions rather than words, really.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay. Because the relationship's been pretty painful for you, that's, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. So, it doesn't really matter where we go in here, so why don't we go in there? What would, what would it mean for you, how would you know that Scott was really trying and really valued you, and really wanted to keep this relationship? How would you know? What would change in the relationship?</p>

<p>Leslie: If he, if he acted... I shouldn't say acted, that's not the word I'm looking for, but we'll say acted.</p>

<p>Scott: Was more of an adult.</p>

<p>Leslie: Acted more of an adult, there you go, sure. If he would change the major problem I have with him.</p>

<p>Johnson: Which is...</p>

<p>Leslie: His temper.</p>

<p>Johnson: You guys, I just read a couple of things that said something about that Scott, you get caught in temper.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scott: I've got a bad temper. Very short fuse.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay.</p>

<p>Scott: I, I don't want to outright, how do you say, I would never just come out and hurt one of my kids. Our kids.</p>

<p>Leslie: Not intentionally, but when he starts losing his temper I don't think he really pays attention to what comes out of his mouth, what he says to them.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's kind of the main issue that comes up in your relationship, is, and you're saying, " Sue, I would know that Scott was serious about keeping this relationship—</p>

<p>Leslie: If he actually...</p>

<p>Johnson: —if he could, if he could change the short fuse," right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Leslie: All right. I understand people have short fuses and that's not something... that's part of somebody's personality, but at least take the time to step back and think before he acted or, you know, said something.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. So help me—what is that like for you, then, to be living with Scott and knowing that somehow he's got this short fuse, and hearing that he wants the relationship, but somehow having this sense that he's not going to be able to control it? That must be very hard for you.</p>

<p>Leslie: It is very hard. It's very difficult, you know. And it's been hard... Like we just recently separated—if that's what you want to call it—it's been, you said almost two weeks, a week, you know. And it's been hard because this is not where I wanted the relationship to go. But I've been, we've been having the same argument for many years, and I've been asking of him the same thing for a long time, and I haven't, he hasn't changed that part about him—I don't want him to change as a person, just that part of him.</p>

<p>Johnson: So when he has this short fuse and you keep trying to get him to look at this and somehow your sense is that nothing changes, that gets real difficult for you. And what do you do then, when Scott gets caught in having a short fuse? What do you do with that?</p>

<p>Leslie: If he's having the short fuse with one of the children I, I interfere. I step in.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay. And is that all right? Do you, can you sort of defuse it then? Or does it just escalate?</p>

<p>Leslie: No, then it turns into an argument between him and I. It escalates.</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm. But she, a lot of times, will step in and watch out so I don't go and get myself in trouble with my, with my temper.</p>

<p>Johnson: You step in and you try to tell Scott, you try to give him the message, "Hey, your temper's sort of taken you over and..."</p>

<p>Scott: And that's, that's, that's not, with just say, at home, I mean, in general.</p>

<p>Leslie: Anywhere.</p>

<p>Scott: Huh?</p>

<p>Leslie: Anywhere.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. Anywhere. And I appreciate that...</p>

<p>Johnson: And you guys get into an argument...</p>

<p>Scott: Well, I appreciate that part because it keeps me from going to jail. You know? Because...</p>

<p>Johnson: You appreciate that. You actually see her as trying to support you when she steps in, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: In some things, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah? But somehow it's still hard to let go of the anger...</p>

<p>Scott: There's other... Oh, there's, there's, there's, the, the, the anger part is real hard to let loose. But...</p>

<p>Johnson: But you see her as trying to help you when she steps in, so.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, in certain cases. Not in all the cases, but...</p>

<p>Leslie: It usually takes him a while, until after... It takes him until after he really calms down to realize that, you know, that's what I was trying to do. But we usually end up having to go through our argument first, before he realizes what he has done.</p>

<p>Johnson: So Scott starts to lose it, he gets a short fuse. You point it out to him. You, on one level, you somehow know she's trying to help you not be taken over by the anger, but it sort of gets going and...</p>

<p>Scott: She kind of runs a, she runs as a blocker when I'm going, when it's, when I'm there. I've got the short fuse all the time. It's when I'm ready to blow up is when she starts to step in, and she's running, you know, as a blocker to stop me. And a lot of times I can hear her telling me, "Hey, knock it off, stop it," and stuff like that. And in a couple of instances I've heard it, and...</p>

<p>Johnson: But it's still hard for you, it's still hard for you to let go of it at that point. Yeah.</p>

<p>Scott: Of the anger? You just about have to have a temper to understand what I'm saying. It's just not like you can be way up here and just turn it off.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. It's real hard for you to let go of... You get caught in that, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And you try to tell him, "You're losing it, you're losing it." You step in, and then what happens, guys? I'm trying to get a sense of that, the sort of negative dance that happens between the two of you, right.</p>

<p>Johnson: After I step in, whether it's something with somebody outside the home or one of the children living inside our home—because he's had problems with, you know, people, whoever, a neighbor or whatever. It can be any instance, but if I say something, at first he takes it and gets defensive about it. You know, like I'm out after him or something. And then, like I said, the argument starts between him and I then. You know, he tells me not to tell him what to do, and...</p>

<p>Scott: Don't make me look bad.</p>

<p>Leslie: Don't make him look bad, and...</p>

<p>Johnson: You somehow feel criticized, is that what happens?</p>

<p>Scott: Sometimes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah, you...</p>

<p>Scott: Sometimes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay.</p>

<p>Scott: We had a, just for instance, a problem with a kid. And it was several problems, and I finally went over and I told him, "You come over here, you do this—you mess up again, we have a problem." And then I talked to his father and I told him, I said, I wasn't going to talk to the kid or his wife or anybody else, so I was coming over here and I'm going to deal with him. And needless to say I got in trouble for telling him what I did.</p>

<p>Johnson: But although one part of you somehow knows that she's trying to help you...</p>

<p>Scott: Well, she was not there when that happened.</p>

<p>Johnson: What you're telling me is that when this sort of thing happens, you end up getting kind of sensitive and hearing your wife being critical of you, and that's pretty hard. You don't want to look bad. You don't want to hear that she is disappointed in you. Am I getting it, Scott? Can you help me?</p>

<p>Scott: It's almost like she's trying to discipline me. It's not like she's so much disappointed, in my eyes. She's trying, it's like she's trying to discipline me, like I'm the kid and she's trying to discipline me for something I said.</p>

<p>Johnson: You feel sort of like you're being told what to do or that you're...</p>

<p>Scott: Sometimes.</p>

<p>Johnson: You're somehow being told that you're not measuring up. Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Measuring up, maybe.</p>

<p>Johnson: You're being told you're doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: And that's pretty hard for you?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah, being told that I didn't measure up by her, yeah. And you know, I try to, I try to do everything that I can, you know, for her and us. And even, even in going off on a neighbor because they did something, whether it was to my kid, to my wife, disrespected anything that I have anything to do with, you know. I'm wrong sometimes in doing it because I've gotten P.O.'d.</p>

<p>Leslie: It's how he does it. It's his approach.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. Okay. Can... Forgive me, I'm going to sometimes interrupt you because I'm going to, I'm aware that we don't have much time, so I'm going to... Forgive me for leaping about.</p>

<p>Leslie: Okay.</p>

<p>Johnson: I'm going to make a little leap here, okay. I want to know what happens then, what happens when you try to tell him, "Hey, your anger is taking you over. It's getting too big here. I want, I don't want you to do it this way." You start to feel somehow like you're being talked to like you're a kid, like you're being criticized—</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: —like you don't measure up. You know on one level maybe she's trying to help you, but you're getting caught in it. Then what will happen between the two of you? So you're having a hard time hearing her feedback. Then what?</p>

<p>Scott: Then we're arguing.</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, then we argue. We end up arguing for a couple hours.</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh, wow. A couple hours?</p>

<p>Leslie: A couple hours, we end up arguing for a couple hours, and...</p>

<p>Johnson: And how does that go then? You're trying to get him to see?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, I'm trying to get him to see what he doesn't see in himself when he's acting that way, and when he's saying what he says. I don't, I think, I actually believe if he could ever see a videotape of himself, or even an audiotape of himself, when he's acting this way, he'll be shocked. He will absolutely be shocked.</p>

<p>Johnson: What would shock him, do you think? Leslie, what would shock him?</p>

<p>Leslie: I think seeing himself in that rage. And I don't think he really pays attention to the words that come out of his mouth when he gets that way, and how violent he can be.</p>

<p>Scott: And it's, and it's... That's exactly what it is, it's a rage. It's not just getting mad, it's rage.</p>

<p>Johnson: Help me, is that scary for you? Is it...</p>

<p>Leslie: It's scary for me. He doesn't, he... Well, we argue, but he hasn't physically turned on me. But it's scary for me in the fact that when he does this to one of the children, one of our children, is damaging to them. They're too young. I mean, the name calling...</p>

<p>Johnson: You need to protect them.</p>

<p>Leslie: I need to protect them and...</p>

<p>Scott: I don't, I don't get physical with them either, like...</p>

<p>Johnson: But it's also scary for you. Yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes. And I'm also afraid he's going to get himself in trouble also, if it's somebody in the outside world, you know. We've had the police called on him before.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right.</p>

<p>Leslie: And...</p>

<p>Johnson: So you're trying to get him to see, and you have a hard time hearing. And then how does it go then? How does it, how does it end? How does this two-hour fight end?</p>

<p>Scott: I usually leave.</p>

<p>Johnson: You leave.</p>

<p>Leslie: Well, actually...</p>

<p>Scott: I walk out of the house...</p>

<p>Leslie: ...nothing gets solved after the two-hour argument. Usually the argument goes the same way and ends the same way, and nothing has ever gotten solved. He, you know, he'll just say, "Fine," you know, "I'll never do this again," or "I'll never do that." And "I'll try and change." But up till to this point, he hasn't changed.</p>

<p>Johnson: And then you leave. And then what do you do?</p>

<p>Leslie: I just go about my life. He usually comes back fifteen minutes later. He doesn't leave for really...</p>

<p>Scott: I don't mean like move out of the house. I mean just—</p>

<p>Johnson: No, I understand.</p>

<p>Scott: —leave the situation.</p>

<p>Johnson: But can you guys talk about it then, or what?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, later. Yeah. Usually after he comes back or towards the end of the argument, it simmers down to a conversation. But I always try and show him, and he gets defensive about it, how he acts. And you just, you can't go through life acting that way and treating people that way. And I don't think he's ever really...</p>

<p>Johnson: You want, you're somehow trying to... Help me here. I think what I'm hearing you say is, part of this is a big struggle on your part to try and get through to him that this is too hard for you, that you can't, you, you know, can't live with his temper—</p>

<p>Leslie: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: —with him doing this to you or to the kids. This is too scary. This is too difficult for you. But somehow you feel like he doesn't hear that, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: And so you'll try for two hours. And then you'll leave. And then when you get back together, I guess then it's pretty hard to be close or supportive with each other, is it? Or do you manage it in spite of being...</p>

<p>Leslie: It is. It's hard, it's hard to be close.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is it?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Help me, how does that work, then? What does that look like for you, Leslie? It's hard to be close, it's hard to, to... what? Be held, or be...</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, exactly. I have been...</p>

<p>Johnson: You withdraw, do you?</p>

<p>Leslie: Well, you'd call it withdrawal.</p>

<p>Scott: Don't want me to be around her. Period.</p>

<p>Leslie: Pretty much.</p>

<p>Scott: If she's laying on the sofa and I lay on the loveseat and I put my head by, on the same end as where, like this, she'll put her head down there. She don't want to be there. I have to come over and apologize, want to get a kiss, and "Get out of my face!"</p>

<p>Leslie: I can't, I can't, I can't be close. And the apologies—after you've apologized for seven years or eight years or nine years over the same thing, pretty soon the apology doesn't mean anything, if it continues to happen. So to me the apology means nothing. Prove it with your actions, really.</p>

<p>Johnson: So somehow you get to the place where you're just sort of standing back, and it's too hard for you to then really connect with Scott, right? You're just kind of sort of protecting yourself. Am I getting it right? And then that's, and then that's hard for you, Scott.</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: You go and you try to connect with her, but the message you get is somehow the thing again about that you've blown it, you didn't measure up. Am I getting it?</p>

<p>Scott: Pretty much. I guess you'd say it would come across as "I blew it," yeah. You know. "Yeah, you screwed up, now I don't want to be around you" kind of thing with her.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, how do you deal with that? How do you deal with it when you get the message from Leslie—</p>

<p>Scott: I don't like it.</p>

<p>Johnson: —"You've screwed up, and now I can't let you close." What do you do with that?</p>

<p>Scott: Pretty much just leave it alone. Just leave it alone. Sooner or later she's going to turn around she'll give me a kiss.</p>

<p>Johnson: So there are times when the two of you, in spite of you getting...</p>

<p>Scott: The next day. The next day she might give me a kiss, but if I'm over there trying to apologize today, she wouldn't, she wouldn't give me a kiss today for nothing, right now. Tomorrow...</p>

<p>Johnson: Even though this, you guys get caught in this thing we're talking about here, there are times, there are little islands when you can be close, and you can connect....</p>

<p>Leslie: They're very few and far between. And when they are, they're very short lived.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes.</p>

<p>Scott: I'm generally a mean and nasty kind of guy.</p>

<p>Leslie: I have a hard time...</p>

<p>Johnson: You are?</p>

<p>Leslie: I have a...</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't... I didn't hear your wife say that. Is that...</p>

<p>Scott: Leslie?</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that... Is that what you...</p>

<p>Leslie: No, he's not.</p>

<p>Johnson: Are you worried that that's how she sees you? As a nasty...</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: You are?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm. Sometimes I feel that's what she, what she figures—she doesn't want to be around with me because I'm mean and nasty.</p>

<p>Johnson: Gee, Scott, that must be hard to feel that way.</p>

<p>Scott: Sometimes it is.</p>

<p>Johnson: I guess—</p>

<p>Scott: Sometimes it's just, "Oh, well."</p>

<p>Johnson: —it sort of hits me—you help me here, but it sort of hits me that if I was feeling that way and I really valued my relationship, it would leave me kind of raw and it would make it all the easier to have a short fuse and get caught in being angry again.</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah, it's pretty easy, yeah. If, in just that instance, if I come over...</p>

<p>Johnson: So you feel sort of rejected, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah. If I come over and we had an argument, and I try to apologize and give her a kiss, "Get out of my face!" "Fine!" There's another argument. You know, "I'm coming over here trying to apologize," and then she's like, "How do you expect me to be close to you when you've went off like that and you did this? And now you want to come over here and get in my face and wanting a kiss!" And you know, that's how it goes. And it's like bam, bam.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay, guys.</p>

<p>Scott: Right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay, guys. Let me see if I got this right. So I'm sort of parachuting in, here, okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: So you help me when I get it wrong, okay? It sounds like what's happening in your relationship is you've got caught in a particular kind of pattern, a particular dance together where—whatever comes first doesn't really matter, let's just start anywhere—you have a short fuse, and you get angry, right? And you're a big guy and you get, your temper gets really powerful. And that gets pretty scary and pretty difficult for you. And you get caught in trying to have him see that and understand that it's scary and difficult for you. And you can't get through to him somehow, right, and that must be real frustrating for you—</p>

<p>Leslie: It is very frustrating.</p>

<p>Johnson:—apart from anything else. And you try to get him to see, and that doesn't work somehow, right? And finally you get caught in that kind of argument. And you end up somehow feeling like what you're hearing from her is that you're a nasty guy, and you've blown it, and you're not making it with her, you're not... And you just end up feeling that way, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And then somehow you leave. And you'll try to come back and connect with her and then you feel rejected, which leaves you feeling raw and likely to blow up again, and leaves you feeling like there's no safety in the relationship.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. That's pretty much that the relationship is doomed, really. Yes.</p>

<p>Johnson: I'm getting it?</p>

<p>Leslie: You got it.</p>

<p>Scott: You had it straight on.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's a hard one, guys, because that kind of keeps itself going there, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. It's a circle.</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And the thing that strikes me is that that's painful for both of you, right? That's sort of... Now I'm going to make some little guesses here, and you help me, okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: The thing that hits me about that that you've said to me so far is that that leaves you feeling frustrated and unsafe and like you can't really be close, like you've got to protect yourself. Right? And you can't kind of depend on him, yeah? That must be pretty lonely for one thing, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Leslie: It is.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that all right? That word? Is that okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Sort of.</p>

<p>Johnson: And it leaves you, I'm hearing it leaves you feeling like basically your wife's really somehow disappointed in you, and sees you as kind of a nasty guy, and doesn't really want to be close to you. So it sort of leaves both of you kind of alone and unhappy, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's a hard one, huh? That's what you're, that's what you're going to try to work on in therapy. That's what needs to change, because it really makes it impossible for the two of you to be close and be safe and learn how to trust each other, yeah? So am I, so I've got it, right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: All right. Scott, do you think Leslie knows about what happens for you when you do feel rejected, and when you get the message that she basically believes that you're kind of a nasty guy and...</p>

<p>Scott: When she does it, she don't care. She don't care what I feel. That's it. And she'll tell you. She don't care. If I've been acting the fool or however you want to put it, she don't care what it makes me feel like.</p>

<p>Leslie: That's not true. Because I wouldn't have been dealing with it for all these years if I didn't care.</p>

<p>Johnson: So what you're trying to do is, when this starts, we're talking about you're struggling to try and get him to shift, right? And you're saying, it's almost like you're saying, "I wouldn't be struggling if you didn't matter to me." Right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, that's very true. If he didn't matter, I wouldn't have been dealing with this for all these years, I would have just gone on.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. So, in a way, you're sort of struggling... By giving him this feedback, it's almost like you're struggling to have the relationship, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: But he kind of hears it that you're, you're telling him what's wrong, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Right, yeah. He doesn't, he definitely doesn't see it the way I'm trying to tell it.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Leslie: He'll switch the words all around, and...</p>

<p>Johnson: He doesn't see you as struggling to be with him and to kind of get him to put his anger aside so there's a space for the two of you. He hears it that you're disappointed in him.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. I want to go back, here, a minute. I asked you, "Do you think your wife knows what it's like for you when you feel like you're not measuring up?" And you said, "Well, I don't think she cares at that point." Right?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: But I guess I want to know, do you feel like, maybe at that particular moment in time she doesn't care—that maybe in the heat of the argument, you feel like she doesn't care? Although she's saying she does care, right? But do you feel like she does really understand what it's like for you to get the message that you're disappointing her and that she just sees you as this nasty, angry guy? Do you feel like she does understand that, Scott?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes. Most of the time, no, I don't think she knows. You know. Because I'm, I'm trying to get things straight between her and I. And that's just like, forget it.</p>

<p>Johnson: You somehow get the message that you're not going to make it, it's not going to work.</p>

<p>Scott: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: So you're not sure whether she really knows what it's like for you to somehow get this message that... You know, what she's saying is, "I'm trying to tell you to stop the impact you're having on me, I'm trying to tell you that your anger's scary," but what you hear is that you're disappointing her, and you're not sure she really understands what's happening for you at that point.</p>

<p>Scott: She has nothing to be afraid of by my anger. I would never hurt her or the kids.</p>

<p>Leslie: But you have. And...</p>

<p>Johnson: Sounds like you do hurt her by, by being so big and scary, huh?</p>

<p>Leslie: And it's not, you don't have to be physically hurting somebody to hurt somebody.</p>

<p>Johnson: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. But the...</p>

<p>Johnson: Do you hear her saying she's, she gets scared of you then? Can you hear that?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't think she's afraid of it, afraid of me. I think she's more afraid of the temper and what could be said verbally.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay, maybe we go back to that in a minute, okay. I just want to stay here for a minute. Have you ever actually tried to explain to Leslie, at a point when you're not in the heat of the moment, what happens for you, why it's so hard for you to hear that feedback, what happens for you when you're hearing from her that she sees you as this sort of big, nasty guy, and you feel real rejected, and you get the message you're not going to make it with her? Have you ever really tried to sort of explain, talk to her about that?</p>

<p>Scott: No, because usually before we ever get to that we're arguing again. Correct?</p>

<p>Leslie: Not always.</p>

<p>Johnson: But what you're telling me here is, "Sue, I get really... All I start to hear after a while is that she doesn't want to be with me and I'm just this big nasty guy and I'm not going to make it with her." That's what I'm hearing you telling me.</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's what you... Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: But you don't get, you're not used to talking to Leslie about that.</p>

<p>Scott: No, because I don't matter. It's what I'm feeling, and what I feel about it is, you know, I've got to work it out, and...</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. It's something that I've got to do—not necessarily what she needs to do. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing now.</p>

<p>Johnson: Do you think that you could... You're talking to me here, right? But actually what's important is between the two of you. Do you think that you could help her understand a little bit right now what that feels like, when you start, when she's trying to get you to see that she's experiencing you as scary, and she's trying to get you to look at how the anger takes over the relationship and gets in between the two of you, and what you hear is, "Oh, Leslie just sees me as this big nasty guy, I'm never going to make it with her," and you just end up feeling rejected?</p>

<p>Scott: Well right, now...</p>

<p>Johnson: Can you help her understand a little bit of what that feels like?</p>

<p>Scott: Right now, I don't... It's, it's beyond that now. You're fed up with me already. You don't want to be around me.</p>

<p>Leslie: It's not you. I told you that I can't live with your temper anymore. It's your temper. It's not you.</p>

<p>Scott: How am I, what am I supposed to do with my temper—just leave it on the front porch?</p>

<p>Leslie: If that's what you have to do.</p>

<p>Scott: That's kind of hard.</p>

<p>Johnson: You're saying, "I really want to be with you, but I can't... Your temper is too much for me."</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, I can't do it anymore. It...</p>

<p>Johnson: "It pushes me away," right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. Yep.</p>

<p>Johnson: "It pushes me away, and it scares me and it hurts me." That's what I'm hearing you say.</p>

<p>Scott: At the same time, I don't know that she wants... You know, there's no, there's no way to know that she wants to be with me, you know, because everything, everything that we've been doing so far has been so negative.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Scott: You know. And even if I did leave it out of this, if I did just say... I wouldn't. And couldn't. And if I could just take it and go pfft, leave it over on the porch and come in, it's still going to be negative. It's only just today. And, and—</p>

<p>Johnson: Scott, we're going to...</p>

<p>Scott: —if it doesn't work out, why...</p>

<p>Johnson: I'm going to stop you. I want you to let me stop you, okay? I'm going to slow it down a minute, all right? Because this feels really important, okay? Can you help her understand a little bit of what that feeling of kind of, "I've blown it, she's rejecting me, she just sees me as a nasty guy, she doesn't want to be with me anyway"—can you help her understand what a little bit of that feels like right now?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't know how.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't know how. You don't know how to tell her that.</p>

<p>Scott: No. I am... Other than just telling her, straight out, and telling you that you make me feel like I'm some monster and you don't want to be around me.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay.</p>

<p>Scott: That's, that's...</p>

<p>Johnson: I'm going to, I'm going to change that a little. You see if it works. I don't know if she makes you feel that way, but you do, you end up somehow getting the message from her that you're a monster and that she doesn't want to be with you, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p>Johnson: And what's that like for you to feel that way?</p>

<p>Scott: It's no good. It's no good at all. Why, why even hang around if she don't want to be around me, there ain't no need for me to be around.</p>

<p>Johnson: What's it like for you to tell her right now that that's how you feel in the relationship?</p>

<p>Scott: I pretty much just did.</p>

<p>Johnson: What's it like for you to tell her that? You said, "I don't know how," but you just did it. You did it fine. What's it like for you to tell her that right now?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't know. Kind of numb.</p>

<p>Johnson: Kind of numb?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, I don't know what to expect and, you know...</p>

<p>Johnson: That's not the way you usually talk. You don't usually talk to her about those feelings of rejection.</p>

<p>Scott: No, usually we're arguing across the table.</p>

<p>Johnson: So it's kind of strange and kind of... You feel sort of numb, right, when you say to her, "I just get this message that I'm a monster," right? "I somehow, when we get caught in this dance I get the message that I'm a monster." You end up feeling kind of numb, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. And when my temper is going, yes I am just that, I am a monster. You know? And I don't, I don't like it.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to be caught in that rage—</p>

<p>Scott: Right—</p>

<p>Johnson: —and you know that it pushes her away from you.</p>

<p>Scott: —and at the same time, I've said it... There's times where you have to be able to have somewhat of a temper.</p>

<p>Leslie: No, you don't. I disagree.</p>

<p>Scott: And I, I...</p>

<p>Johnson: I'm, I'm going to butt in again. What's it like for your to hear that he, that it's sort of strange for him to talk about his softer feelings and about how he's scared that you see him as some sort of monster?</p>

<p>Scott: We don't talk about my softer feelings.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't talk about your softer feelings.</p>

<p>Leslie: No, he don't, but I don't see why he does. I feel anybody should be able to.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. I feel anybody should be able to reveal their softer side and their real emotions.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I hear you. I think it's helpful if people can, because then they can soothe and comfort each other and support each other. My sense of it is actually that we've taught men in our society that that's not okay to do that.</p>

<p>Scott: You're not supposed to be soft and weak.</p>

<p>Leslie: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: In fact, it's almost like you're sort of a wimp if you do that, so...</p>

<p>Leslie: I feel that's very damaging, though.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. And so, actually it takes a lot of courage for most men to be able to tell their wives, say, "I'm really worried now that you're telling me that I'm disappointing you and I'm not making it with you, and I feel really rejected." Takes a lot of courage, right? And you just did it here, which I think took a lot of courage. But what you said when I say "What's happening for you," you said, "Well, I sort of, I numb out when I do it," right?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, because I don't know what kind of a response I'm going to get, and usually the same response...</p>

<p>Johnson: You're worried about what she's going to...</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, probably going to get the same no-response.</p>

<p>Johnson: So can you tell her?</p>

<p>Scott: Same old no-response.</p>

<p>Johnson: That's really important, what you just said, Scott. That's really important, what you just said. Because if I'm hearing you right, what you just said to your wife is, "I don't tell you my softer feelings 'cause I don't know if you're going to respond. I don't know what response I'm going to get."</p>

<p>Scott: That's true.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that what you're telling her?</p>

<p>Scott: I am.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: And, and, and I don't, I don't tell anybody anything.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't tell anybody your softer feelings?</p>

<p>Scott: Nope. I don't have soft feelings.</p>

<p>Johnson: The only thing that you let yourself show is anger, then.</p>

<p>Scott: I don't have any soft feelings.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right? So when you get hurt...</p>

<p>Scott: Soft feelings are for girls.</p>

<p>Johnson: Soft feelings are for girls. So when you get hurt and you feel raw, I guess the only thing for you to do is to be angry, then, right? It's not possible for you to go to your wife and talk about your soft feelings. You don't know what she's going to say. What was the worst thing that could happen? What would happen if you went and talked about your softer feelings to your wife?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't know.</p>

<p>Johnson: Talked about how worried you are that she sees you as a monster? What would happen?</p>

<p>Scott: She could tell me, "Yeah, you are a monster."</p>

<p>Johnson: Ah. So if you, if you...</p>

<p>Scott: And she would. She would do that.</p>

<p>Johnson: If you went and told her your softer feelings—how difficult it was for you to be worried that you've blown it with her and that she doesn't want to be with you—you're worried that what she'd say to you is, "Yeah, that's right. You are a monster." That's what you're scared you'd hear?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah? Then it must be real hard to talk to her about those things, right?</p>

<p>Scott: I don't talk to anybody about any of it. I don't.</p>

<p>Johnson: Would you like to be able to trust your wife and to talk about those feelings?</p>

<p>Scott: I trust my wife. You know? But I just, it's this...</p>

<p>Johnson: You trust her with your anger. Would you like to be able to trust her enough to talk about these softer feelings too?</p>

<p>Scott: There's no need to talk about them.</p>

<p>Johnson: No?</p>

<p>Scott: No. Why talk to her about that?</p>

<p>Johnson: Why don't you ask... What's it like for you to hear him talk about these softer feelings? Maybe you could tell him...</p>

<p>Leslie: It's a very, it's very frustrating because everything in life isn't about having a temper and being angry. And no, I don't see you as a monster.</p>

<p>Johnson: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Leslie: Okay? But it is important that you express your, your feelings.</p>

<p>Johnson: What happens—</p>

<p>Leslie: Why does everything have to be so hardcore?</p>

<p>Johnson: What happens for you when Scott is able—even in this strange setting here, with, this is all real artificial, right—he has the courage to talk to you about his softer feelings when I ask him, right? What happens for you when he does that? What happens for you when he tells you, "I'm scared that if you, I do tell you those softer feelings, that you'll tell me, ‘Yeah, that's right, you are a monster, you are...'" What happens for you?</p>

<p>Leslie: It's a little upsetting, because he's never given me the opportunity to respond to that, so how would he, how would you know how I would respond? You wouldn't know. And you're just, you're afraid of rejection and...</p>

<p>Johnson: Would you like him to be able to talk to you about those softer feelings?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: You would?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah. I would like him to be able to talk about his softer feelings rather than revealing the angry side.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. Forgive me, but—it seems sort of artificial, but could you tell him that? I think it's important. Could you tell him what you just told me?</p>

<p>Leslie: I would you like you to show your softer side rather than always showing your anger, and your rage, and your temper.</p>

<p>Johnson: What would, what do you feel, what would happen for you if he... Do you... What would it be like for you if Scott could share... Because there's all kinds of feelings he has, and he just gets caught in the rage, right? And if he can't talk about hurt or disappointment or upset or his needs, then, you know, I guess if he gets frustrated, it's just going to be anger that's kind of sitting there waiting for him. That's the one, right? Sort of—</p>

<p>Leslie: Yep. Yep.</p>

<p>Johnson: —the one that he goes to, yeah? So you feel like it would help a lot if he could talk about his softer...</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Then you'd feel closer to him?</p>

<p>Leslie: And then maybe... Mm-hmm. And then maybe he'd be willing to listen about everybody else's softer side also. See, he gets in the anger and the rage, but then...</p>

<p>Johnson: Then you can't talk to him about your softer feelings.</p>

<p>Leslie: No. Even, even the kids. He doesn't hear what you're saying when you start talking about the softer side, and people's emotions and feelings, and how they feel in certain situations.</p>

<p>Johnson: So if he could talk about those softer feelings, then maybe there'd be space for you to talk to him about your softer feelings?</p>

<p>Leslie: If he could set the anger aside, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Uh-huh. Then you could—and I'm going back to what you said before—then maybe you could talk to him about the fact that you do get scared, right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Well, possibly. Yeah. He knows I'm not happy about his temper and his anger. I have expressed that. I am not afraid to say that.</p>

<p>Scott: No. She... She's little but she's wiry. She'll come back...</p>

<p>Johnson: She's wiry? She's a strong lady, right? She can take you on.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah, she's got... She's got her own little attitude going on. She don't take, she don't take much out of me.</p>

<p>Leslie: My fear with his temper ain't necessarily for myself, it's for the kids, because they can, they're going to grow up with this.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Leslie: Whatever damage is being done, they're going to carry this into their adult life.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want them to be hurt.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And you don't want...</p>

<p>Scott: And I don't want to be the one that hurts them.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to hurt your kids.</p>

<p>Scott: I don't want to be the one that hurts them physically, mentally...</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to hurt your wife.</p>

<p>Scott: Emotionally.</p>

<p>Johnson: You just get, you guys get caught in this cycle and you get caught in this dance, right? And so it's sort of like, anger comes between the two of you. Right? And you can't share these feelings that you've talked about here.</p>

<p>Scott: No, because that's just, I never have. I never have. I never have. You know, people before her, no, just, there was no need. There's no need for it. I don't know, maybe there is a need now because I'm going to lose my, my marriage.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right.</p>

<p>Scott: I'm going to lose ten years of—</p>

<p>Johnson: Right.</p>

<p>Scott: —trying to make it work. And...</p>

<p>Johnson: So maybe there's a need for you to be able to talk to your wife on a different kind of level and create some safety. And then maybe you can create a whole level where the two of you can talk about feelings, and you can also hear her softer feelings, which is that you're a big guy and when you get mad she gets scared, huh? For her kids and for her. And also we, we... What we haven't touched on is something else that you said earlier—actually, it was my word I think, but you picked up on it—which is, it leaves you feeling alone in the relationship. Yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. Yes, it does. You know, I, it's very hard being close to, or wanting to be close to somebody who acts a certain way, with the anger. It's not an easy thing.</p>

<p>Johnson: So you end up wanting to be close.</p>

<p>Scott: No, she does, she ends up not wanting to be close.</p>

<p>Johnson: Hang on, hang on just a second, Scott. You end up wanting to be close, feeling alone, like you can't be close because somehow you feel like you have to walk through all this fire. You have to walk through, you have to risk Scott's anger to be close, and that's too hard, right? That leaves you feeling frustrated and lonely and like you can't get close to him.</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, well, it's not that I can't. I probably could. It's a want. The want isn't there. You know, if he, if he...</p>

<p>Johnson: It's too hard if you have to deal with anger.</p>

<p>Leslie: Right.</p>

<p>Scott: Like I said, she don't want to be there.</p>

<p>Leslie: Right, right. Because...</p>

<p>Johnson: But you hear her say she doesn't want you. I'm hearing her say she doesn't, she can't deal with the anger, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: The anger's sort of defeating both of you, right? It's robbing both of you of what you want.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. That's why I'm trying to get my anger under control.</p>

<p>Johnson: What happens for you when your wife says that she does want to be close to you? Did you hear her?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Does that...</p>

<p>Scott: I think actions sort of speak louder than words.</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay, I don't know what that means. I want to know what happens...</p>

<p>Scott: Show me.</p>

<p>Johnson: So...</p>

<p>Scott: She should show me that she wants to be around me or be close to me or...</p>

<p>Johnson: Prove it? Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>Scott: Pretty much. You know, if I wanted to...</p>

<p>Johnson: So does it touch you at all... You had started off this whole session with me by telling me, "Sue, I want this relationship. I do want this relationship." Right? "I don't want to lose this relationship to my anger and this—"</p>

<p>Scott: Right.</p>

<p>Johnson: "—pattern we get caught in." Does it touch you at all that your wife's sitting here saying that actually she feels alone and frustrated, and that she does actually want to be with you—it's just the anger that gets in the way? Does that, do you let that touch you at all, Scott?</p>

<p>Scott: I'm trying to get the anger under control. It touches me enough to try to get it under control.</p>

<p>Johnson: Do you hear her saying that...</p>

<p>Leslie: I don't think he does. It's like that all the time. He doesn't hear me.</p>

<p>Scott: I heard exactly what you said.</p>

<p>Leslie: But, you may be listening but you're not hearing it.</p>

<p>Johnson: You're telling him, "I don't think you hear me when I say that it's, that I would, if it was up to me, I would choose to be close to you. I do want to be with you. I don't think you hear me." That's what you're telling him?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. Can you tell him that again, please?</p>

<p>Leslie: I do want to be close to you, but you don't hear me saying it. And it's not you that I don't want to be with. It's the anger. So therefore, I can't. It's hard to explain, but I can't.</p>

<p>Johnson: Can you hear her?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: Can you really hear her?</p>

<p>Scott: I think so. It went right in.</p>

<p>Johnson: Did it?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. Well, I'm trying to get my anger under control.</p>

<p>Johnson: I think what I'm saying is, did you, when you... Is it comforting for you? Did you let it in when... Because the basic message you're giving me, Scott, is, if I'm hearing you right, is that you don't want to lose this lady.</p>

<p>Scott: No, I don't.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. And you're telling me, which is something pretty huge, considering, you know, especially considering we've never met before, you're telling me, "Sue, sometimes I get scared that my wife sees me as a monster." Right?</p>

<p>Scott: She sees me as a monster more, more often than not.</p>

<p>Johnson: But here, what she's sitting here... I'm hearing her say....</p>

<p>Scott: She sees my temper as a monster.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. And your temper gets in the way, right, and defeats both of you. But what I'm hearing her say is that actually she does want to be with you. It's the temper that gets in the way, and the fact that she doesn't see these softer parts of you, all these other parts of you. She just sees the person who's going to go off into a temper, right? But what she just told you is that she does want to be with you. Did you hear her?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And do you find that comforting?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: You do. What's that like to hear that?</p>

<p>Scott: It feels good.</p>

<p>Johnson: Does it?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah. It means I've gotta work a little bit harder in getting my stuff straightened out, so.</p>

<p>Johnson: You feel more hopeful when you hear that.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Because in fact it's incredibly important for you—</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: —that, that she is still fighting for the relationship and she still wants to be with you. Yeah? Because you don't want to lose her. Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Right. I don't want to lose her. Got too much time invested, and I still, I love her, I love the kids, and I don't want to lose it all.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to lose it all to this anger, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Right. And I don't know what I'll, I don't know what I'd do if I ended up losing her because that was a, I was a monster. So.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to be a monster.</p>

<p>Scott: The monster's going to check out.</p>

<p>Johnson: You don't want to... You want to learn other ways to be with your wife besides getting caught in all this anger, right? And maybe one way is to be able to talk in some of the ways that we've been talking here, which is... There's all kinds of other parts of you besides the angry part, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: There's the part that gets touched when she says, "I do want to be with you," yeah? I mean, I'm looking at your face right now and it feels like...</p>

<p>Scott: What?</p>

<p>Leslie: Nothing.</p>

<p>Scott: You looked at my face and what?</p>

<p>Johnson: I guess I really had the sense that it was really moving for you to hear that she does want to be with you.</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah. I'm glad that she...</p>

<p>Johnson: And you get real scared that that's not going to happen. Yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: And the more scared you get, I'd imagine, the easier it is for you to be, have a short fuse, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right.</p>

<p>Scott: If she doesn't want to be around, there's no, no need to not have it.</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes, there is, because there are children that you would like to be in their lives, right?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Leslie: Okay, then there is a need to not have it.</p>

<p>Johnson: You really need to know that he sees that he has to change this, right? You really need to know that he's seriously going to take on not letting his anger get between the two of you, right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. I need to see it.</p>

<p>Johnson: You need to be reassured that he's really going to take this on. Yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yes, I do. He's told me he likes the way he is.</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh.</p>

<p>Leslie: And that he won't change the way he is and that he can't change the way he is, so that's all... He's definitely going to have to show it.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. Well, what do you think about what he did just here today?</p>

<p>Leslie: Very impressive. Really. You know? So, it's a start.</p>

<p>Johnson: I hear you, though, when you say, "I have to be able to see that you really do see that your anger is a problem and that it really is important, and that you are going to take it on," right? "I need to know that that's important." But in fact, what he did here today was to talk about a whole bunch of other things besides his anger, right?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. Right. And that was impressive for you?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah, I'm glad that he came and talked, really, and at least you got a little bit of his softer side out—</p>

<p>Johnson: That's important for you.</p>

<p>Leslie: —that he never shows.</p>

<p>Johnson: He never shows that softer side. You want that softer part of him, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Did you hear that, Scott?</p>

<p>Scott: Uh-huh. I don't know how to do it, though.</p>

<p>Johnson: You did it right here, with someone that you never met before. I'm some strange lady from Canada—you did it right here. Didn't you?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: But I hear that it's hard and strange for you, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: It's kind of strange for you to think about that she wants those softer feelings, those parts of you, right, and that this sort of big, angry part of you, which is the part of you that you were always taught was the thing, the way men should be, is actually the thing that gets in the way of her coming close. That's hard for you to hear?</p>

<p>Scott: Mm-hmm. I was brought up one way, and she was brought up another. But we don't mix in the way we were brought up.</p>

<p>Johnson: But if that's...</p>

<p>Scott: I was brought up to be the enforcer.</p>

<p>Johnson: The enforcer. Oh, wow. Okay.</p>

<p>Scott: You know. I guess that's what you'd say. You know. The...</p>

<p>Johnson: Right, I hear you.</p>

<p>Scott: I don't know.</p>

<p>Johnson: And that's... So now it must be pretty strange and hard to hear from your wife that actually she...</p>

<p>Scott: She don't want an enforcer.</p>

<p>Johnson: She doesn't want an enforcer. What she wants is a man who can turn and talk to her about his feelings and is willing to look at...</p>

<p>Scott: She wants someone to cry to her. I'm not that person to cry to her.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Scott: How many times you ever seen me cry in 10 years?</p>

<p>Leslie: That's not what I'm asking for.</p>

<p>Johnson: It's hard, it would hard for you to cry, right? You wouldn't let yourself cry.</p>

<p>Scott: I don't. I refuse.</p>

<p>Johnson: Do you?</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: That would somehow be too hard for you.</p>

<p>Scott: It's the showing of weakness.</p>

<p>Johnson: Is that right?</p>

<p>Scott: That's the way I look at it sometimes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, actually, my experience of you in this session is that you did talk to me about some of your softer feelings, and I didn't experience it as you being weak. I actually experienced it as you having a lot of courage. I wonder if you want to ask your wife if she's experiencing it as you being weak when you get to talk to her about your fears about how she sees you.</p>

<p>Scott: Do you see me as being weak, as a sissy?</p>

<p>Leslie: No.</p>

<p>Scott: What do you see?</p>

<p>Leslie: I see, I see you being a man. But you want to know something? When you have your anger and your temper, that's the way I see you being weak. So what you might think is cool, ain't...</p>

<p>Scott: I didn't say it was cool.</p>

<p>Leslie: No. You, you like it. But you know, that's a weak individual. Somebody who cannot control their own emotions to the effect they go and take it out on everybody else.</p>

<p>Johnson: So somehow when you see him as being taken over by his anger, then he doesn't seem strong to you, right?</p>

<p>Leslie: That's a major weakness, yes.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. And that leaves you feeling alone and scared and unable to come close to him, right? It gets in the way. But when you see him—even though it's strange and the opposite of what he's been taught—as having the courage to talk about his softer feelings, how difficult it is for him to feel that he's not measuring up and how maybe he's scared of losing you, you see that as strong.</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Johnson: And that pulls you closer to him, yeah?</p>

<p>Leslie: Yeah. It would, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: It would?</p>

<p>Leslie: It would. If the anger wasn't there. If the anger's still there, no.</p>

<p>Johnson: I know. Because that's so difficult, right—</p>

<p>Scott: But the anger-...</p>

<p>Johnson: —to stand in front of that flame, but that would pull you closer to him if Scott could share those parts of himself.</p>

<p>Scott: As long as the anger was, had checked out.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, you know, short fuses... There's a lot of feelings in a short fuse. And sometimes I think we just focus on the anger part of it because we feel more in control there. But you've talked about a lot of other things besides anger here, right now in these last few minutes, right? Maybe if you could talk about some of those things, maybe you wouldn't get so caught in the anger. And what I'm hearing... And what I'm seeing today is you can do that. It's just that it hasn't really been part of what you're used to. And what I'm hearing you say, Leslie, if I'm getting it right, is that that would pull you towards Scott, right? If he could share some of those feelings, yeah? And I see you still fighting for the relationship. I see you both fighting for the relationship, actually.</p>

<p>Scott: I hope she's fighting.</p>

<p>Johnson: You... And what I'm hearing is that you did hear for a moment that she is still fighting to be with you. And what I'm hearing from you is that some part of you knows that you have got a problem with your anger and is willing to fight your anger to be close, yeah?</p>

<p>Scott: Oh, I know I got a problem. There's no doubt in my mind about it.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right, right. So guys, I'm hearing that there's all kinds of hope for this relationship, and that you're fighting for it, and that you're, with me already here, you were doing some totally new things.</p>

<p>Scott: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: So I want to thank you for being so open. I'm honored that you were so open with me. I think maybe we have to end, I'm getting the sense that we do, we're out of time.</p>

<p>Scott: I think they'd let them cameras just roll, just to listen.</p>

<p>Johnson: I want to thank you two, thank you for sharing so openly with me. Okay?</p>

<p>Leslie: Mm-hmm. Thank you.</p>

<p>Scott: Thank you for—</p>

<p>Johnson: You're welcome.</p>

<p>Scott: —listening.</p>

<p>Johnson: You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>END SESSION</b></p>

<p><b><u>GROUP DISCUSSION</u></b></p>

<p>Carlson: Sue, is this a good example of emotionally focused couples therapy?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, in some ways it is, although I mean, I guess I would probably take a little longer... You know, I was trying to connect with them very fast. But to create a safe alliance is a very important part of emotionally focused couples therapy, to create a collaborative alliance. And so, in a way, I might have gone a little slower if I'd had a little more time, and not focused so fast on their cycle—focused more on them, and how they saw themselves, and their upbringing, and their story, and the way they got together. And this was very focused. But it was a good example in that what I'm trying to do here is really track and delineate the cycle that they get caught in, and start to put that cycle into an attachment frame, talk about how that cycle interferes with closeness and trust and caring and soothing, and then start to go for some of the underlying feelings and expand some of those unacknowledged underlying feelings a little. And to create some hope for them. You know, I think it was very important, the bit that she said at the end about the fact that she feels she's fighting for the relationship and he sees her as just criticizing him and telling him that he's failed and that he's a monster.</p>

<p>Carlson: And when you talk about this attachment—and I think it's called the holding environment, a safe environment—do you actually teach that to the couple at some point in time? Is there like an educational component to this?</p>

<p>Johnson: EFT isn't directly educational, but I think it's more like you create the experience in the session...</p>

<p>Carlson: Like a modeling or...</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, my favorite quote of all time, if I can remember it now, is, Einstein said, "All knowledge is experience; everything else is just information." And what I try to do in EFT is to give people an experience of what... Like this man, what I hope would happen with this man, is that he would actually have the experience in this session of being able to talk about how scared he is of his wife's criticism and how scared he is of hearing that he's a monster, and talk to her about those softer feelings, and actually experience that that pulls her closer to him and that she actually validates that and that she wants that part of him, and that that does not end up with him feeling rejected and awful and so it actually ends up with him feeling more connected with her. I'd want him to have that experience.</p>

<p>Kjos: I was noticing a lot of subtle emotional responses on his part, less on hers.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, he put his...</p>

<p>Kjos: But he, the arms bent, it would come up and then it would go down...</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Kjos: It just, yeah, and you sort of... And I wondered how much that influenced your pacing or your interaction, or were you aware of it? Probably you were.</p>

<p>Johnson: I was aware of it. I noticed one particular point at the end where he was holding his, his arms like this, and I, I emphasized the fact that she does want to... I can't exactly remember, but I emphasized the fact that she did want to hear this part of him and that... to talk about his feelings, to encourage. And then I noticed that he put his arms down at one point. And I said to him, "Can you hear that? Do you hear it's comforting?" And he, I think, then he also dropped his arms. So I mean, what he's basically showing you with his... People speak their emotions through their body. Emotions are a body experience, and what he was showing me, I think, was how he wants to defend himself a lot of time.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yes, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right.</p>

<p>Kjos: And then his outbursts really are a form of his own defense rather than...</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, yes. I mean, if the only emotion he can show is anger, you know, and he shifts his anguish, or what I would think of as all his attachment insecurities, into rage, if that's the only comfortable way that he can express it, then ironically that's the only part of him she sees.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: And then, of course, she cannot accept that and gets scared of it. And you can really see here where the way he is constricted in terms of how he processes and expresses his emotion then turns into constricting the interaction between the two people, and you know, really only showing her one part of him, right? You can really see that in this session.</p>

<p>Kjos: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: You guys were talking about awareness a moment ago, and I've become aware of the fact that we have an audience here with us.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: And we have a group of, of professionals and professors and students who have been waiting patiently for some questions, or some answers to their questions, so let's get them involved.</p>

<p>Johnson: Ok.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: Sue, it seems that you very successfully navigated some difficult emotional waters with this couple. What will you do in session two?</p>

<p>Johnson: What I would do in session two is I would go back and try to recap the territory we've, we've gone over. I would reflect back on what, the last session we had. I would ask them how did they, what happened during the week, did they talk about the session, what were their responses to the session, right, I would go in there. And then I would do what I've done again. I would go back, and I would go back into the cycle. I would go back into talking about that when she gets scared, right, she tries to get through to him, and she maybe uses a particular tone of voice and what he hears as criticism. I'd flush out that cycle more so that they can actually start to really see it and, you know, own it and integrate it. And I would go more for his underlying feelings that he's a monster and that, you know, and also that if he expresses anything other than anger it means that he's not male. And he's, and that, you know, somehow if he's not the enforcer... There were a lot of images of control he had. At one point he's, she actually said to him at one point, "I want you to be more adult." There were child-adult images that I would want to play with. And he somehow implied that if he wasn't the enforcer, he was some sort of pathetic, weak person. So I'd go, I'd basically go back and do more of the same, because you're, it, people have to own it and process it. You know, it's not like you can do it once. They have to sort of start to... I start to know that we've gotten to the end of the first stage of therapy, for example, when people have put their own, are describing the cycle in their own words, and they start to talk about it as the common enemy that's defeating both of them. So instead of trying to decide who's the saint, who's the sinner, and pointing to each other as the problem, they start to come together and talk about the cycle without me doing any of it, and talk about how the cycle is defeating them both, and how they both want this bond and how they can't get this secure bond because of the cycle, and talking about the cycle as the enemy, right? Then I start to know that they're really owning it, and they're... So I basically do a lot more of the same and I'd slow down...</p>

<p>Carlson: So they need repetition.</p>

<p>Audience Member #1: If you were going to do something differently, that would be—move at a slower pace?</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, because, you know, if you're going to take somebody to the leading edge of their experience... Like he said, "I'm numb, I don't know how to do this." I mean, he's telling me, "I'm in new territory, I'm in new territory." If you're going to take somebody to the leading edge of their experience, then you have to give them some time. You have to stay there with them and give them the time to do that, right?</p>

<p>Kjos: You kind of explore that before they go on.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: And repetition, though, is an important part of this approach?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes it is. You know, Gendlin wrote a book called Focusing and...</p>

<p>Carlson: Eugene Gendlin?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: And he came up with a nice image that I like, about if you're going to work with emotion, you've got to have what he calls a working distance, which is that you're close enough to touch it and form it and experience and articulate it, and look at the meaning that the emotion has for you and what that says about you. And you're close enough to do that, but you're not so close that you're overwhelmed. And some of what I'm doing is I'm, by repetition, I'm structuring the, I feel like I'm giving people a frame for the emotion so that it becomes more manageable, more tangible, more able to be talked about, right.</p>

<p>Carlson: Thanks.</p>

<p>Johnson: Welcome.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Susan, I loved watching you work with this couple and how respectful you were, you know, to both of them and explaining the cycle. But I noticed that Scott seemed to be really invested in his anger to a certain point, where there was almost that fear of leaving it on the front porch.</p>

<p>Johnson: Absolutely.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: And how would you work with that?</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I think I would start by validating that. If that's the only way he's known how to be, and if that's the only way he knows how to be a man, then, you know, to start to think about letting go of that, part of that would be a loss for him. And what I would try to do is validate that, start by validating that. And, you know, if he can sort of like... Almost like, if you can validate that people need their defenses—you don't try to take people's defenses away from them. If you validate that they need them, they have a damn good reason for them, probably the... I would guess that the context this man grew up in, it was very functional for him in many ways to try to be the enforcer and try to do this male... He needed that to survive, right? So I wouldn't want to try and take that away from him. What I'm going to try and do is expand so that's not the only thing that he can do, and that he can start to look at the consequences for his attachment relationship of always staying in that one narrow territory called being angry and being in control, right, which is, he pushes other people away from him and it hurts them, right?</p>

<p>Carlson: Do you ever go and help them understand that their solutions are the problems?</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: I mean, that's the kind of insight that a lot of other approaches would use.</p>

<p>Johnson: I wouldn't necessarily use that language, but I think yes, that's right. There are ways of, their ways of protecting each other and themselves, the ways they're protecting themselves end up being the problem. I might not use that exact language, but yes, I think I would work with that.</p>

<p>Carlson: From an Adlerian point of view, all, all solutions, there are, these solutions are problems. He thinks his anger and getting tough is what's needed to structure this home, and she believes her policing is important to save everyone.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: And it's her attitude and his anger that really is the issues with each other.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. The fact that she's trying to change him all the time is, exactly, yes. I agree with that. I guess where I might be different is I don't actually have a whole bunch of faith in insight.</p>

<p>Carlson: I guess that what I was wanting to...</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. I actually do believe that, you know, you need a new emotional experience and you need to help, have somebody help you process that to change.</p>

<p>Carlson: So his insight to you, at the end that his, I think in attempting to do with the issue of what strong means to her is so different than strong means to him...</p>

<p>Johnson: That was a... Yeah, and that was a real shift for him. And I thought that was useful, that he might start to hear that, right.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay.</p>

<p>Johnson: But I would actually think that for that to really take, he would have to have some more interactions with her where he would actually experience that when he allows himself to be vulnerable, he looks up into her face, and instead of seeing what he's scared he's going to see, which is contempt, he actually sees her eyes go soft, her smile, and he experiences that she gets accessible to him. That is, that will, it might start off as insight but it needs to get there for it to take... That's...</p>

<p>Kjos: So he really needs to have the emotional experience in order to understand it.</p>

<p>Carlson: So it's not the psychotherapy home run. It's just the single for you, it's a base hit. It's just to first...</p>

<p>Johnson: You got it. You got it. Yeah.</p>

<p>Carlson: All right.</p>

<p>Johnson: But it was good. You know, I mean, I don't know...</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah, he's on base. I got that. We're moving.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah. There were a couple of nice frames there that, you know, I felt like he was starting to learn.</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah. I did too.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: I thought you did a wonderful psychoeducation beginning on the male scripting stuff. He's beginning to learn, but I'm less sure what she learned from this. And I'm, I'm, I'm interested in this dynamic where he has this enforcer and then he turns it over to her to be the policeman, which is another enforcer, which to me fits the common male dynamic of "Let's try to take care of my anger by controlling my anger," so you put control on top of control.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: Your whole style was against that, that is, you're helping him expand it, move into other feelings. But is there a piece where she can have some expectations of what would be new for her that would help?</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh, for sure. Actually, as we were sitting there, my experience of her is that... And at the end of the session, my experience of her is that she has all kinds of sadness and fear. But, you know, there's a certain timing thing where I didn't, I felt like I tried to validate some of that, but I, you know, didn't have the time to really get into how her attempt to always try to control his anger backfires and is actually part of the cycle, right? But yes, for sure, there would be a part for her to really sort of... We really focused... When I'm talking about underlying feelings, I really focus more on his, there, than... And I agree with you. What I was trying to do was use the gender training that he had to validate that he, he was caught in this stance—that it didn't mean he was a bad person, it was that he, he was... And the other thing that hit me about that was it wasn't just the gender training. They were a very good example of what Gottman talks about with, he talks about the cycle that he calls the horsemen of the apocalypse, which are...</p>

<p>Carlson: Four horsemen.</p>

<p>Johnson: The four horsemen, where you get one person criticizing and expressing contempt. Actually, she didn't express that much contempt here, but... So you've got one criticizing, expressing contempt. The other person distancing, defending, and stonewalling. I mean that, you could see that that was going on and that keeps them stuck, right. The thing about that one is that for me, what Gottman does there is he describes the behaviors. I always then go back to the fact that the emotions organize those behaviors and that, what's going on there for, you know. He's, he's terrified that he is a monster and is unlovable, is my sense of what's going on there, right. So it's, if you really believe you're a monster and you're unlovable, it's incredibly hard to come out and show anything except this facade of strength and enforcing. What an image that is, the enforcer. You know, it was, it's almost like you're watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.</p>

<p>Carlson: A Canadian hockey game.</p>

<p>Audience Member #4: I was, every time you would ask her, or not every time, but when you would ask her, you know, how she felt lonely or whatever, he was so attentive, and it felt to me like he was giving a gift when he would say throughout the session, "I know I have, I'm working on my anger, I know I have to work on my anger." And later he said, "I don't know how to do that," and when you asked him to talk about his feelings, he gave the gift of "I know I have to work on my anger" rather than talking about his feelings. So I was curious that... Because you go after the feeling, that he is working on his anger, how is he working on it, or what is it like for him to work on it, or why is it hard? And you didn't go there—</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, you could've gone there.</p>

<p>Audience Member #4: —very particularly, and I was curious about that.</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh, for sure, you could go there. You could talk about, you know, I'm not sure, I would go into, more into, you know, what happens to him when he gets angry. You know. Some of it is the process. Like I can remember one man who also had a problem with anger, where he talked about the fact that he went to a party and saw someone talking to his wife, right—a very good-looking man. And the point is this man was losing his hair, and this man his wife was talking to had this full head of hair, and he was very clear about this when he was telling me this story. And he walked across the room and started shouting with his wife about what was she doing flirting again, and they got into a big fight. What we did was we went back into that situation and I slowed it all down. And I talked to him about what happened to him when he looked across the room. And sometimes people exit. If you noticed here, they exited sometimes from the... And I just go back, right? Yes. A lot of therapy is about keeping your focus. So with this man, he would say, "Well, she was flirting." I say "Yes, but what did you see? Help me." And you slow down and you use very simple language and concrete language to get people to connect. And what he starts to talk about is, "It was her smile. It was her smile." "What did you see in her smile?" "She hasn't, she..." and his face starts to change, and he says, "She doesn't smile at me that way anymore. She doesn't smile at me." And I talked to him about what's happening for him. And what we get to is that three seconds before, he rearranged all his emotion into rage, and he did that in the three seconds it took him to walk across the room. What he actually felt was deep anguish, terror that he'd lost his wife already, fear that she didn't want to be with him anymore. And then he starts to talk about that, right? So I would talk to him about how hard it was to control his anger, but I would also talk to him about that process of how he translates all his other feelings into the one that feels safer, which is rage, right? But I want to go into that on a process level, not on a talk-about-it kind of level, if you understand what I'm saying.</p>

<p>Kjos: While I was watching her, there were times that her expression was, "Yeah, well, this is, you know, you're talking this way but you're not going to do anything about it, and..."</p>

<p>Johnson: Of course.</p>

<p>Kjos: She was giving him a lot of that piece that would encourage...</p>

<p>Johnson: That's right. And you know, one of the things that hits me, that is hard for some of my students sometimes when I watch them learning, is you work with a couple, and somebody starts to do something different, they start to move out of their pattern, and somehow when you first start doing couples therapy you have this sort of wonderful idea that the other person's going to say, "Oh, wow!" You know, that's not what happens, of course. One starts to shift and be different, and the other person says, "Yeah, yeah, yeah right." And what I, what we talk about, what I talk about with my students is you have to go in and support that person there, because the way I think about it is, "I'm suddenly married to this dangerous person who looks like an enemy, then that person does something different, and now I'm married to a stranger. That's not necessarily an improvement. I've got to have time. I've got..." And the therapist has got to be able to say, "It's hard for you to really believe that he's working on his anger, even though he's... It's hard for you to really trust this because you've been hurt for so long and you've been so disappointed and, right. It's difficult for you to really hear that he's really changing." In other words, you have to support the fact that it's hard for her to really believe that anything's going to happen.</p>

<p>Carlson: Maybe I'm still stuck a little bit on this insight sort of thing.</p>

<p>Johnson: Are you?</p>

<p>Carlson: But does your approach talk at all about why they would choose this kind of partner? I mean, why they would choose somebody who has that potential to be such an enemy. And why would this nice girl marry this awful guy, you know? At least that's the way they appeared when they came in.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I think we focus more... EFT focuses more on the present, but what we do do is we... Sometimes the past comes roaring out of the past and it's not the past, especially if you work with traumatized partners. But what we do do is we use the past to validate the stances that people take. So for example, I would talk to her about how she'd experience attachment in her family a little bit. And it would be very interesting to me if she had experienced that actually all men were like this, and that she'd just thought that was the way it was, and so she wasn't particularly watching for his anger—she'd just accepted it in the beginning of the relationship, perhaps.</p>

<p>Carlson: It was very comfortable.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes. So I might touch on that.</p>

<p>Carlson: The familiar.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yeah, familiar, yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: Familiar's better.</p>

<p>Johnson: But you know, I don't focus on it that much. I focus more on the ongoing process, right. I don't actually... Let's be clear here. I do not believe that we actively seek out our father and our mother and that we have unconscious impulses to repeat our family of... I don't believe that. I think it's, in some ways it's much simpler than that. It's that I meet somebody at a party at a point when I'm particularly looking for a partner, and this person touches me somehow, and I allow myself to get intoxicated and involved.</p>

<p>And suddenly there are patterns, and then when things start to get scary, then I go back to the familiar ways I have of protecting myself or expressing my attachment needs. They might come from my family of origin, but I don't actually believe that we sort of seek out...</p>

<p>Kjos: Try to recreate.</p>

<p>Johnson: No, I don't believe that. In fact, that's a stretch for me. It's a bit abstract for me.</p>

<p>Carlson: Some people believe you only get intoxicated by certain kinds of people who... We won't go there.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: I was wondering, there are some other family therapy models that would use a total opposite approach to you—</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #5: —in that, instead of focusing on the emotion and encouraging people to express more emotion, especially in someone so emotionally volatile like Scott, that they need the opposite: that they need to maybe incorporate more reason or more cognitive sort of ways of looking at things. So I'm kind of wondering how you would respond to people who say that approach might be more useful with a couple like this.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, I think you could try to teach Scott some skills of containing his emotion, perhaps. But my sense of that is that, what I believe about that one is that that might work in some situations, but I'm not sure that it's going to work when he gets really sparked off and vulnerable, and he is going to get sparked off and vulnerable. That's what happens to us in close relationships, okay. If we're going to be vulnerable anywhere, that's where we're going to be vulnerable. And we could get into a whole thing about attachment theory, which I'm not going to talk... I haven't got time to talk about, but... So my concern about teaching him skills is that it's only going to work when he's not really emotionally plugged in. That would be my concern about teaching him skills, right. I would think he needs to experience a whole new way of being with his partner and they need to create interactions here... You know, it really struck me very much when he said, "I've never..." This is beyond anger. You know, anger is just the tip of the iceberg here. He said, if I'm hearing him right, he said, "I've never actually shown myself to anybody." What I heard him say was, "I've never actually let anyone in, actually." Well, then, you know, that is a, that is a, a real issue for this man, right? And also I heard him say... you know the thing about intimate relationships is we define ourselves in them. One of the things that fascinates me about couples therapy is you, in some ways I feel like I can work on people's identities working with couples therapy than I can in individual therapy. And he's saying, "I've never let anybody in, and what's more, if anybody, if I did let anybody in, what they would see is how monstrous I am."</p>

<p>Kjos: That shame piece, yeah.</p>

<p>Johnson: That shame, yeah. So I think that it would be rather sort of a superficial approach to sort of just focus on skills or to just sort of try to give him insight into that, right? I mean, it's, I mean, he's already showing that he can't just "control it," right. Yeah.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: I was wondering, is it ever appropriate within this approach to focus on taking responsibility for Scott's behavior and for his anger?</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh, yes, I think so.</p>

<p>Audience Member #6: I don't feel like we did that as much.</p>

<p>Johnson: Well, my sense is he's saying, "I do have a problem," that actually I didn't feel that it was... What I heard him saying was, "Yes, I do have a problem. Yes, I do have to work with it." And at one point in the session she said, he said, "She makes me feel" or something. And I stopped him, and I was very aware that, "No, no, no, no, no, we're not going there. That's not... you know, this is your thing, okay?" So yes, it's very important for him to take responsibility for that. But I have the sense that he would, and that he was, and that he was working. But I really heard him saying was, "I don't know how to, I don't know how to move away from this. I know it's a problem. I know... And I don't know how to do that."</p>

<p>But what's interesting about your question is I think when people are going to take responsibility, my experience is the best way for me to get them to, for me to help them do that is to be very collaborative with them, and try to validate the dilemmas they are in and the fact that this is the only way they know how to be right now, and talk about what it's costing them, and to be able to stand with them and look at that, so that they don't experience me as somebody coming outside and judging them. They experience me as somebody as somebody who's standing, looking at how they are in the world, and how that causes them pain, right, and helping them access other ways of being, right. So, but yes, I think it is important that he take responsibility.</p>

<p>Audience Member #2: Susan, I don't know if you answered part of this when you were addressing the skill set, but would you ever recommend individual for your couples, or do you strictly like to stick with couples?</p>

<p>Johnson: No, I think there's a place sometimes, like... You know, I think, with this couple, that you could work with them in couples therapy, okay. But for sure there would be people who would come into our hospital clinic where I would say, "No, we are not going work," because then somebody isn't taking responsibility, and that this person needs to go and... You know, part of our assessment would be, "You know, we really feel that you need to go and look at your anger problem and then come back in six months' time if your partner sees that you're working on the problem," right.</p>

<p>And also with trauma survivors, sometimes there's so much work to be done... Sort of... I always think of trauma as a dragon, and that's just my image for it. When you're fighting a dragon, it's kind of consuming, and you need a safe place to fight that dragon. And then, hopefully, when you have a sense of what the dragon is and you have a safe place, your partner can come and stand beside you. Of course, then, that's a whole different bag. Then the couples therapy comes in when your partner stands beside you. Fighting a dragon alone and fighting a dragon with somebody standing beside you is a totally different thing. But there is a place, especially for trauma survivors, for the individual therapy. You can't do everything in the... You know, a couples therapist has to balance between the two people's reality. There's so much going on. It's hard to give the, say, the trauma survivor, for example, the space they need to work on how the experience this trauma coming for them.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: In your book, I think it's Getting Connected, you talk about partner...</p>

<p>Johnson: Creating Connections.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: Creating Connections.</p>

<p>Johnson: The Practice of Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy: Creating Connection. Ninety-six.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: You talk about primary versus secondary and other kinds of emotion you want to get to.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes.</p>

<p>Audience Member #7: And that the primary... The secondary is more the reactive, and the primary is underlying loneliness, whatever, and it's related to attachment theory. Would you say a little bit about, about that, that you have a certain limit to... I mean, you have... I thought it was very interesting that you were very lucid on almost a small universe of attachment issues that you're usually looking for.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes. Basically, my sense of it is that what couples therapy as a field hasn't had is it hasn't had a theory of love. It hasn't had a real sense. And my sense is that what attachment theory does is give us a sense of what the territory called love is all about, okay? And what that does is it gives me then a certain... it helps me target my interventions, it gives me a focus, it gives me a set of goals, right? And the way I look at relationships is that I look at people's interactions, and I look for whether they can create in their relationship what John Bowlby talks about as a safe haven, a secure base. What I assume is that we all need, that it's a basic universal need to have a very limited set of close emotional connections with attachment figures. These are people we touch. These are children, parents, lovers, right. We all need this. The isolation is inherently traumatizing. And that we look to our intimate partners as adults for this sense of connection and security and attachment. We look... And it's about accessibility and responsiveness. We need this. And when we do not know how to get this sense of connection, felt security, right—we do not know how to be accessible and responsive to our partner, we don't experience them that way with us—then it is inherently threatening for us as human beings. And I think that's particularly true now. You know, my granny lived in a village of 300 people and she knew them all. If you talk to most couples who come into your therapy session now, most couples live in a community of two. And if they can't find that connection with that other person, that's inherently threatening for them. So I use that as a lens. And what I find is when you help people create that secure bond—and the research says this, too—when they can create that secure bond, then they can use the problem-solving skills they already have to deal with other content issues like money and things. We found in our research—the first research project we did on EFT—that the people who were able to create that secure emotional connection were then, their problem-solving skills improved as much as the people who'd been taught eight sessions of problem-solving skills. Because if I feel safe and connected and I know I'm important to you and I feel loved and special to you, then whatever skills I have, I can use. You know, if... Well, the best example I give is me in a plane. I don't like flying—I'm terrified. So if you met me in a plane, I wouldn't be able to talk to you about hardly anything because I am busy dealing with terror.</p>

<p>Carlson: Your belief.</p>

<p>Johnson: My belief that the plane may drop from the sky any moment. That's right. So...</p>

<p>Carlson: Now we're getting somewhere.</p>

<p>Johnson: I don't know if I'm answering your question. I'm trying to encapsulate attachment. I'm assuming that attachment and people's attachment needs and security is a basic substrata of everything that goes on in a couple—that really all arguments are about how this relationship is defined in terms of attachment security. And if you address that level, then, I have seen so many couples come in with massive concrete problems and no skills. And they create a secure connection, and in the last session solve those problems in 20 minutes, because suddenly they can collaborate. You know, I can't collaborate with you if I don't feel safe. I can't see things from your perspective. I mean, this man hasn't got much empathy for his partner because he's so busy protecting himself and being the enforcer.</p>

<p>Audience Member #8: You also do this in 10 or 15 sessions, which is the part that sort of is amazing to me because these are such deep issues and so, you know, pervasive.</p>

<p>Johnson: I think that's about the power of focus. You know, it depends on how you think about brief therapy. We can say brief therapy is constricting, or we can say, well, maybe the idea of brief therapy is good, because what it challenges us to do is be on target. And I have a set of beliefs about that: that, you know, if I'm on target, if I'm focused, and I follow people's emotions because emotions tell me what matters, right, and I go for people's emotional needs, you can make a lot of headway very fast. If you have a map, right. And couples therapy is growing. We're starting to have a map. We're starting to know what are the important elements in marital distress. I think as a field it's very exciting now, so.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: I'm curious what you see as the role of some ancillary work, particularly around the gender issue with Scott, because in contrast to some theories, you don't, you don't have this theory that these two got together to cure each other and be each other's therapists, and Scott doesn't have a model of what it would mean to be a mature man and have a range of emotions and so on. Is there some way you would like that in a co-therapist in a men's group or some other place?</p>

<p>Johnson: Oh, I think that would be great. That would be... I can see that as being a useful ancillary. You know, so sometimes, though, you can find images and models that are in people's lives that they don't access. For example, one thing that always hits me about men like Scott is, sometimes they'll say, "Well, I don't know how to be caring and responsive. You know, I never learned that and I don't know how." And it's, and you can hear that maybe that's true: they never did learn. But there are some things that are almost wired in. If I remember with one man, I said to him, "Well, weren't you telling me about how you are with your daughter?" He said, "Well, yes." And I said, "Well, didn't you tell me that when your daughter fell down the other day, that you picked her up and you..." And he gets into this: "Oh, well yes, you know, I picked her up and I held her and I said, ‘It's okay, sweetie, it's okay sweetie,' and I held her and I stroked her back, and I talked to her softly..." And you can see him starting to... And he... "Ohhh." So I said, "Ohhhh. So you do..." But of course the difference is his daughter isn't threatening to him and his wife is.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's an exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Johnson: It's an exception. And I think actually all good therapies deal with exceptions. It's just we might frame them slightly differently, but all good therapies find strengths and validate people and deal with exceptions—you know, when that man suddenly got that he did actually kind of know how to be caregiving, except when he was terrified out of his mind—which is what he was with his wife—and getting ready to deal with what he thought was going to happen—which was she's going to get mad at him.</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: That's true with Scott, that his wife could take over being the enforcer.</p>

<p>Johnson: Right. Well, in some ways it's ironic because they're having an argument about who's going to be the enforcer, aren't they? She's saying, "You will change your anger," and he's...</p>

<p>Audience Member #3: Yeah, because she doesn't have a different model either.</p>

<p>Johnson: And he's saying, "I won't be, I won't be weak," and, you know. Right.</p>

<p>Carlson: I would be tempted with him just to start with something that he might be more comfortable with, I mean like, say, an exercise program, or a meditation program, or maybe even drugs. Does that fit into your approach as a way to help him deal with his anger and aggressiveness? We know that meditation reduces it, we know that exercise does, and certain drugs will. It might give him a step up on things.</p>

<p>Johnson: Personally, I wouldn't do that with this client. I experienced him as very workable, so I would go with him. I would love to see this couple. I wouldn't do that. Some people, particularly trauma survivors who have debilitating anxiety, who wake up in the middle of the night and who are just beside... Then yes, we'll say, "How can we help? Are there other things you can do to... Let's help you contain." You have to help people contain the anxiety then. And anything that helps them do that could be helpful, right. But the bottom line is I still come back, even with that situation... I had a client who would wake up in the middle of the night and then go into the bathroom and cut herself. That would be the only way that would stop the anxiety. And I still think that the best intervention there was actually for her to be able to talk to her husband about that. He didn't even know she did that. And what we came up with was that by the end of the therapy, she could wake him up in the middle of the night and say, "It's come for me." And the agreement was that he wouldn't say anything. He would simply turn and hold her. And when that started to happen, that changed so much about how this woman felt about herself, because she was worth holding, right, she could make this connection. Changed how he saw her and how he felt in the relationship—he saw her as somebody who can help his wife. And it changed so much about their interaction. And of course then she didn't go and cut herself, so she wouldn't spend a week in shame. So it was that that really changed things for that couple.</p>

<p>She started to feel that he was standing with her. But yes, those other things can help too.</p>

<p>Carlson: We are at the time that we need to change our interaction here, too...</p>

<p>Johnson: Okay.</p>

<p>Carlson: Any final comments that you might have, or any thoughts that you might have for our viewers?</p>

<p>Johnson: Gee. Well, I'm massively biased, but, because I love working with couples, I think that couples therapy is an incredibly exciting field at the moment. I think we're starting to take "individual problems" like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and put them in the context where they naturally occur, which is people's intimate relationships. And we're starting to know what marital distress is all about and understand love. And I just think this is just the most exciting time to be a couples therapist and that couples therapy is just going to take off, and...</p>

<p>Carlson: And if I'm correct, you have a website that actually has studies on it...</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes, that lists our studies...</p>

<p>Carlson: That gives the research that supports. Not only is it exciting, but it sounds like it's very effective.</p>

<p>Johnson: Yes. And the website is <a href="www.eft.ca">www.eft.ca</a>.</p>

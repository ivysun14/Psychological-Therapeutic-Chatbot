<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How have things been going since I saw you last?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Work, job hunting.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had an interview, the fourth one with a company this morning.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I got the note from the [DEIDENTIFIED] that you decided, for now at least, not to have a sleep study done.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Correct, because it was on my out-of-pocket, it would be $1400.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Whoa, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well, at some point, if you have better insurance coverage, it would be a good idea to do that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay? And how are you doing on this combination of medication, now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right now, I’m just doing the Zoloft, the 100 mg.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Although, occasionally, I do the 150, depends upon what’s going on.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and you have tried Lamictal?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Boy that was really bad.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> What did it do?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I can’t remember what kind of side effects I had with it.I only had taken it about two or three days and that was…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Unusual?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Was it psychological or physical? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Physical, I just wasn’t feeling right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I stopped it. It was like the third day that I had stopped it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Now, you still on Trazodone for sleep?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yes.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and it’s still 200, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Correct.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so Zoloft is 100.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s between 100 and 150.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so it fluctuates.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And then the Trazodone is 200. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Are you sleeping well at night?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> With the Trazodone?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Any hangover?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In fact I haven’t had it for three days now so I haven’t sleep for two.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But normally you don’t do a three month mail-in or do you?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, now my insurance allows me to do three months at a time.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. All right. Now, [NAME OTHER] had written a script on [DATE] for you with…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> That was for thirty of the Trazodone.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, I see. She wrote it as a hundred eighty but my guess is you took it to the pharmacy.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It was only for thirty.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh really, I wonder if she made a mistake. The Zoloft was for one hundred thirty-five.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No, I only had one month.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> One month.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I had one month of the Zoloft and one month of the Trazodone.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And both of the bottles said no refills on them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and you took that to the local pharmacy, right?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I always go to, over at the atrium, the [DEIDENTIFIED] that’s in the atrium.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because the way that [NAME OTHER] wrote this was that she had given it to you with a years refill. I don’t know, maybe it went to the pharmacy and they can only, at the pharmacy they can only dispense a month at a time anyway, so that’s possible. I’ll rewrite it though because you’re going to be mailing it in or do you want one month to take to the local pharmacy and then mail-in?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Actually, I don’t do mail-in anymore.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> At all, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-uh., no, not at all. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So everything will just be low co-pay then.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah in one month I can get up to three months at a time with two months co-pay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, even at the local pharmacy?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So we’ll just do that then.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But what I had picked up on the [DATE] was, for a one-month supply.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how is your energy and motivation?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m tired.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re tired?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> School full-time, work full-time, it just kind of has me worn out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Do you have any sense that you’re stopping breathing at night, at this point?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not really, no.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Snoring? Who knows?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You’d have to ask my dog.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. No thoughts of suicide at this point? Black hole’s gone?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Totally.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Great. And what about mood swings, because last time you talked about maybe there being a mild psychoviolent type. Maybe a little high once in a while?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Once in a while.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Nothing that’s interfering…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And you’re not having any trouble or spending things too much?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so no need to adjust anything or change anything at this point. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t think so.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So, what type of job are you looking at?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s a newly created job that I saw on the market. It’s a breast health coordinator.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, cool. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, I’m interviewing with up [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Near [DEIDENTIFIED] kind of area and I’ve also had an interview up in [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So will you be working with physicians to help them with follow-up and stuff?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, what it….</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Education?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s working with a woman as soon as they enter the area with an abnormal mammogram and then working with them through the biopsy of that, working to get them into the surgeon, into the oncology physicians, keeping track of them for follow-up appointments, and having one contact person instead of one from this office, one from this office, one from this office, they are trying to consolidate it to one person.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Contact.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And my recommendation would be that you also involve spouses.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because that’s what I find is most often ignored in relationship issues.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Very true, very true, because I went to a seminar in September so I’d have my certification and they had, there is actually a book for the mate.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. I have it at home. They gave us all the books to go with it.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Would you mind calling [NAME OTHER] with a copy of that, with the name?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Sure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So I could get a copy of it?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Sure, sure. Oh, it’s wonderful. I’ve read all the books that they provided and it is just an excellent, excellent program. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’ll tell you, when I went through it there was nothing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It was just…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And it handles everything, you know, with your family, how to tell your children, working with your mate, working with people in the community, spiritual issues, are all kind of pulled into one.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. I think that all of that is just really important.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Because the men have been usually been locked totally out of this, no counseling whatsoever. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There is, even support groups.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There is no support groups out there for men.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Nothing.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I think that’s very damaging to relationships to not have that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I agree because it’s hard sometimes for a man to understand exactly what the wife is going through.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, and….</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And even if you can understand that, it’s difficult to understand what you’re going through as a man.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Very difficult.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I call with that when I get home a little bit later today, I’ll call with that name of the book.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that would be great because I feel men in this practice whose wives have gone through that, then they are like…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They are broken. Yeah, where do they go if there’s nothing for them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s a mutual loss.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It is.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And, yes, the spouse is supposed to be very support and usually is but…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s hard when there’s no support for them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Definitely.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, it’s like putting a whole program together from the ground up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Even psychotherapists do not have the skills to deal with this. They don’t know what the issues are, they have no conceptual framework to approach it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I’m glad to hear there’s a good book out there like that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then establishing support groups would be really good. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, you need them both. You need them for kids, you need them for the woman, you need them for the husband, you need them as a couple. There is so much out there that can be done that’s not being done. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I’ve seen the effect on my kids and I think it had a tremendous impact on them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> We were all in a state of shock.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, yeah, and always wondering what’s going to happen, is mom going to really be okay or, you know, worrying every day.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then you’ve got that, well in five years you’re out of the woods and now it’s twenty years.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And every time you go for your next follow-up appointment, there’s the worry if they find something and your mammogram creates all the anxiety, no one out there to help them with that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s kind of what this job is about.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s fantastic. It’s got to be done. And you’ve had so much experience in surgery with that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we deal with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] probably about 80% of our patients right now are breast and breast cancer. We are seeing them as young as 27.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then they have to be put, the kids have to be put into genetic counseling.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It really, it is a complicated disease, it requires a whole team approach.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It affects the whole family, not just the woman.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And right now everything is just so focused on one area but these poor ladies are being lost.I mean they don’t know where to go. They don’t know who to talk to.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the kids are not getting adequate counseling, genetically, they’re not getting, I know there are some blood markers that…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh the BRCA. Uh-huh, they’re just starting to do that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So but it’s rough, I know we started doing a couple of BRCA screening for family members on down the road.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now is being done by [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I’m pretty sure that he’s doing that also. Um, like I said we just started doing it there, you go through [DEIDENTIFIED] and you’ve got like mega paperwork to fill out.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then they have to go into a lab and get blood stuff from a draw and everything goes to [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And is that considered like a research protocol or does insurance cover that?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Most insurances will cover it but [DEIDENTIFIED] has a program that, if your insurance doesn’t cover all of it, they have a program set up to try and cover what the insurance does not. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Or like those that have either Medicare or Medicaid providing the funds, the test will be covered because it’s like $3200.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now with the results of that, are people having prophylactic surgery?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s brand new, so I’ve got two gals coming in right now to talk about prophylactic. So, but you know, you look at the mother had it, the grandmother had it, two sisters have had it…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean the gene is there.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Why take the risk?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Very true, very true. But then you know there’s other coping and stuff that goes along with that, you know, there’s a lot that goes with it. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And the duration of the reconstruction is just incredible.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> A lot of people think it’s a one-stage procedure and month, after month, after month…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s not. It never is a one-stage and there’s always the scars, you know, to deal with the scars. There’s always a scar and you always look at yourself and you always see that, you know. So for some ladies, it totally detrimental.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. The outcome of some of the reconstructions are not all that good and…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Depends who you go to. I’ve seen fabulous.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I also think it depends upon what tissues been left and, you know, I haven’t seen any abdominal reconstructions.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, fabulous, fabulous. You’d never even know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Really.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They’ll do from the back, they’ll take part of the latissimus dorsi bring it around in front, so, but the one with the belly, oh, it’s so major. You know, their off work eight weeks because they’re in so much pain. They have all the belly pain plus all the chest pain and…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that’s a huge sacrifice.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> An 8 hour procedure.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well it sounds like you’d be the perfect person for that job.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think it’s exciting.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know, there’s so much out there. Just to be able to share it, you know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Now, are there other programs like that around the country?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> There’s other programs around the country and the program that I took in [DEIDENTIFIED] is called, I’m certified as a breast health navigator.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And, unfortunately, in [DEIDENTIFIED] they don’t really want anything to do with it. So, I want to do something with it. I’m not going to let it hold me back.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Is this [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I interviewed, it’s [DEIDENTIFIED] in the [DEIDENTIFIED] area with [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And then the other one was, and I’m waiting to hear back from them, they’re starting a program fresh in my field.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> They’ve got a major referral center. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s huge and that’s where I went to school, so I still have friends and everything up there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s cool.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So that’s good.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And they have very good continuing education there. I’ve been up there to lecture.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Have you?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And I was just shocked at the number of physicians who attended the lecture. It was standing room only.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I would believe that. They built that huge auditorium.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and in spite of that, I think this was, I’m pretty sure it was a CME lecture.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But it was just packed.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’ve been to a couple of things that have been up there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it’s very rare for any type of psychiatric program to be packed.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And it certainly wasn’t because I’m well known. I was just going up there to talk about social anxiety disorder. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But they have a big program with the residents. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> They do a lot of residency up there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right and they announce it over the intercom throughout the hospital.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So everybody knows it’s starting.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah and their campus has just gotten bigger and bigger. In fact, this particular job is at [DEIDENTIFIED] which is between [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED]. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Brand new facility [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I had a friend who was hospitalized up there and the care was superb.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, very nice area up there.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m kind of waiting to hear back from them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Well I hope that you get hired for that. It could do a lot for your mood.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I think so, I really do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In terms of long term prevention of relapse</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. And, you know, it’s time for a change.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> How many years have you been doing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> With [DEIDENTIFIED], 17.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> 17?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah. And they are pushing me more and more towards administration.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I miss the patient contact.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I miss it so much.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean that’s really your forte. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And not everyone who is, like I would never want to take an administrative position.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Well, it started early on, it was just my department, and right now I’m up to twenty-seven people. Besides working with [DEIDENTIFIED] I’m supervising, so I miss the patient contact.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s an awful lot of personnel conflict to deal with.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Especially when you deal with all women. You get little clicks going and it’s like oh come one, this isn’t grade school.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh. I’ve talked to dentists who work with women. And many, many women have told me that when they work in offices that are all women that’s it’s much harder for them.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It is.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Much harder.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Some people, they do a lot of back biting, backstabbing but that part is hard.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All it takes is a couple of people with personality disorders or untreated depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD and they can bring an office staff down.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And everyone has family events that are occurring, one gal, her son just had a bone marrow transplant and it failed and then he had stem cell transplant which has taken, so she was off for four months and our receptionist just had a stroke, the other receptionist just had a detached retina, so you know, there is so much stuff that happens on the outside that effects what’s going on on the inside. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right. And then is it your job to find someone to take their place?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. That I can’t. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> But otherwise it’s going okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good. I’m really glad that you’re moving in this direction and I hope that goes through for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m hoping it does.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That would be fantastic. And you have stayed out of this black hole for how long now?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I was in probably, I’m going to say probably about six to seven months ago I had a little bit of a black hole but I didn’t fall deep into a black hole like I had done.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So, for the most part, other than that episode, you’ve stayed in remission for? </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Since ’95.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That’s really good.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So it’s been like twelve years.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So, not going to work. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Exactly. Yeah and you’d been through therapy too.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Which I think was very helpful for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And then you’ve been very fortunate with the Zoloft, continuing to work, back in 1999 you were on Lithium, Pamelor, Risperdal.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I know I was on a combo of three of them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah and then for a while, let’s see, 2000 on Depakote, Nortriptyline, Zyprexa, Restoril, and Trazodone.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Down to two.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> A lot more simplified now.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. As far as the diagnosis goes, I think we’ll just keep it at major depression, recurrent, we entertained the thought of cyclothymia but, or bipolar disorder rather than cycling type 2. But I think our best bet would be to keep you on what you’re on, find out eventually if you can get the sleep study done if you can afford that, that might be one of the things…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It would be more cost effective; they’re trying to get someone, a pulmonologist who also specializes in sleep study.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Because right now they don’t have anyone.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right, he left.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And that’s why, in order to go somewhere that has someone who is certified in reading them, the out of pocket is quite expensive.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, so if it’s on campus it’s less.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> If it’s on campus it’s less, so. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Who is it [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] His wife was an endocrinologist, [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, [NAME OTHER]?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> [NAME OTHER]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they left.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they moved back to I think [DEIDENTIFIED] or wherever they come from.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That was a loss to this community.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, you know that, especially with endocrinology.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Although we do have, who used to be the hospital administrator? An endocrinologist who moved back to town? [NAME OTHER].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he’s back in town now and he also works down in [DEIDENTIFIED].</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay, I didn’t know that he was back in town.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, he has a group that runs from here to [DEIDENTIFIED] So, at least we’ve got that, but we don’t have a sleep specialist anymore.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> No. And I want someone who is certified in it, not someone who reads one or two a week.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And has absolutely no certification in reading them.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> The problem that I’ve had in referring to those people is that it takes weeks to get the results back. It’s not a high priority and then the recommendations are minimal and the follow-up is not there. They expect it to be totally managed by the referring physician, so I refer most people to [DEIDENTIFIED] or down to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] in [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. And, unfortunately, it’s all out of pocket right now.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> You’re not falling asleep at the wheel or during…?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh no, oh no.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. Because I wonder if some of your mood swings may have had to do with some oxygen desaturation at one time.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Probably a high probability that it did.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. I’m kind of reluctant to do the bipolar diagnosis. I’m just going to switch it back. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And briefly, I gave you that but until that other issue is settled, I think we ought to just leave it at major depression, recurrent.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And now with the Lamictal, it’s pretty unusual for people to stop that for other than a rash but I have seen it on a couple of patients and…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t know if it was my anxiety about.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Steven Johnson syndrome</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, you know, I wasn’t finding myself having to look in the mirror, am I getting a rash anywhere, it was just me I think, probably more than what the med was, it was just…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I also had a couple of patients who felt strange or dysphoric on it. I had one patient develop a bobble-head from it.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hmm.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> I talked to the neurologist in [DEIDENTIFIED] who’s got literally three thousand patients on it and he said he had seen it three times, so….</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Wow.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It had to be stopped because of that.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> That was a very strange neurologic symptom that had kept her head bobbing with this, just like a bobble-head doll.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Can you imagine, I couldn’t imagine though. If you’re head is bobbing like that, what your eyes are doing trying to read something or do anything.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, it was a college student.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Oh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Thank God it stopped when the drug was. I hope I never see that again.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh, that would be terrible.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. In many ways it was far more disabling than tardive dyskinesia.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. Can imagine that.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yep. Zoloft is safe, Trazodone is safe, because I don’t think you’ve had any problem with those. I’m going to write prescriptions. So you’ve got them two months at a time, no refills.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, because right now I know I am totally out of Trazodone.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> And sleep [INAUDIBLE] a good thing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ve got a couple of, oh well, it, yeah, I’ve got I think maybe four of the Zoloft left.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I’ll still write it for one and a half tabs a day because you’re going back between 100 and 150.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh. It kind of depends what’s going on, like if my schoolwork gets to be very overwhelming.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> You know.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Can these go on the same script? I would imagine since it’s not mail-in anymore.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’m sure they can.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So when will you hear about the job?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Hopefully within the next week or two. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I interviewed with the oncologist, the surgeon, and the radiologist who are heading the program.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. So there’s enough there for three months with three refills. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So enough for a year and if you need your records transferred…</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I’ll let you know if I do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Whatever, you know, whatever your decision is on that. Do you have family down here at all?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> In the [DEIDENTIFIED] area?</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> In [DEIDENTIFIED]?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Not in [DEIDENTIFIED] but they’re all in the [DEIDENTIFIED] area.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> So…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> All right. I certainly would be happy to continue seeing you or if you want to get someone up there, whatever works for you.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Otherwise, I’m not going to schedule any return appointment. You’ve generally been on a six-month schedule, although this was three months because of Lamictal.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> But, um, until you find a psychiatrist though, I will be your psychiatrist.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. I don’t happen to remember the names of the doctors up in [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> I don’t remember the ones that are up there either.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, now let’s see, as far as [DEIDENTIFIED] goes, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. I know he lives in [DEIDENTIFIED], a very well respected neuropsychiatrist in [DEIDENTIFIED]</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> So if you need any referrals up there, just let me know.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I’ll let you know. Depending upon…</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, whatever. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Which way, whatever which way the jobs go.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Good, well, I’m really happy that this is developing.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s a brand new field.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Brand new field. So, it’s putting together a program from the ground up.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> It’s really exciting. </P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s about time. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> It’s long overdue. </P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, well, just give me a call either way in six months and let me know how you are doing, okay?</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Will do.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, great.</P>
<P><B>PT:</B> And I’ll give [NAME OTHER] a call with the name of that book.</P>
<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Yeah, that would be real helpful.</P>

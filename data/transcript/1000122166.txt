<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 20.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is session 20.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty wild. Pretty wild. We'll call you if there's an opening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, just for that part, though, that's all I'm counting on. Yeah, well, needless to say, a lot's gone through my head, by virtue of the fact that it's the last time. And I must admit that the major feeling is one of relief. Because, you know, you always remember the bad parts, and you know, if you...if I go back and start to list all the things that have happened, I am...the ones I first list always, are the times when I had to come and really hadn't had things thought out. And I didn't really want to talk about things until I thought about them myself more. And things like that, and so that's emotion number one, which is, kind of, you know, really (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's over?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Number two is, well, I find it interesting, and that's, my gosh, what's happening, I'm still the same guy, I still pick my nose the same way. There's no real difference. But then I think, well, now wait a minute, the things that bothered me when I came in here are much different than the things that bother me now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And the...I mean, it's definitely a dynamic process, there's no doubt about it. Now, so that idea, the thought that, really, is not that much different, was is very soon, you know, not, just by investigation of what's happened. So, then there's the third, another thing that one notices, and that's the fact that, well, just as I have changed, indeed, I haven't, but I haven't in a good sense. That may be confusing, but if you give me a minute. I haven't changed, hopefully, in the investigatory sense. That is to say that maybe I've learned how to investigate my own head by myself. And that's number one. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've kept that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, I've learned that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've learned that? I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I hope. And really, I find that, I think, the most gratifying part about it. That...I mean, if we hadn't done anything, if I still was really bothered with an encounter with a person, you know, it really felt bad, following meeting new people, but I had learned, you know, how to work on it, then I'd be happy. So, in that sense, I'm pleased with what's happened. Now, I figure you're not going to like this, because it's going to fit right into my answer I had for everything, and that's the fact that I sort of accepted as a challenge and something to do with it that's well-defined, and that is, now that I have accepted something, and even though you won't be around, at least in your eyes, the fact that I'm still investigating, and you know that's it's a dynamic process with me, well, it's continuing process is a better word, that makes me happy. Well, that is the type of thing I'm working for, just as I'm working for recognition in other fields, you know, in academic and many other...</p>

<p>[0:03:49.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. The fact that I will recognize that you're doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it's, you know, there we are, I have mold number 328-B, and I fit into it. Great. And I think that's kind of true, because...and I really want to, too. Just like something else that becomes an obsession with me. And one of the reasons that something else becomes an obsession with me is because other people are...can be...I feel can be pleased by me accomplishing that particular feat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Outside of my accomplishment to myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it will make other people happy, as well, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, that it should be pleasing. Well, I'm...yeah, that I think it would, rather it would or not. You know, you see, whenever I...before I work on anything, I think the ultimate thing way back in the...well, that's pretty general, isn't it? Whenever I have worked on some things in the past, I think if I really examine my thinking, the ultimate justification, the only drive, the thing that really was driving me, the supreme driving force was the fact that in the long run, once this goal was accomplished, someone else, not myself, would say, "Ah, this goal has been accomplished by him, therefore that's good."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, it's the same sort of thing. If I am going to sit down and think more often and sit down and talk to myself more often, I'd certainly be doing it for my own good, but I think in the long run, I'll be thinking, wow, that's what I learned here. And therefore, that's...I mean, that's going to be a moving and driving force (inaudible) there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the fact that I'll know that you learned it here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that you're doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, you might forget me tomorrow, I don't know. But that doesn't matter in my head. It's just like if I'm working on something and yet I don't get any recognition. That does not detract from the fact of the driving force during my working for it, my working on it, was the fact that I assume recognition would be there by someone else, rather than myself. Which simply boils down to my values not being well-defined by myself, and my values not really being my own. As far as particularly set. So, that's where it fits in, too. Then I got to (inaudible) go try and make the (inaudible), and you got to figure it out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Don't be so sure what I'm...</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right, I won't. Well, it's just that that supposes you got the Rod Steiger (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the one thing I said last time. It didn't mean forever.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, probably not. So, who knows? But it...you know, it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can see it stuck.</p>

<p>[0:06:46.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah. Yeah, because, you know, I'm going to change, too. I'm noticing changes now, lately, and I think I've gone through a growth spurt the last six months, I mean, both physiologically and due to my hormones, or something, because I...I just sort of think (inaudible) that. I guess that happens in the mid-20s, sometimes, doesn't it? The last 20s or the early 20s?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, I...that doesn't matter. It might matter in my head, actually, I don't know. Now...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you getting taller?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've grown a little. And I've sprouted hair on my body where I never had it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's happened on several occasions. I have a funny jaw that always goes funny when I have a growth spurt, and therefore, it got me out of the army. Had to have braces. Well, anyhow, that's neither here nor there. And then, finally, the...the other thing that I...just to think about is the...well, I wouldn't really call it a problem. Yeah, the sex problem, it was a problem in my mind, so therefore, it was a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And how, well, how was that treated? I pretty much, if you remember, one of the time...the second time I really brought it up, the first time I brought it up, way back...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Three or four sessions, five, maybe. And you gave me a nice comforting pat on the head, and I sort of accepted that, and I said, "Well, I've got the answer," (inaudible) minus something else. And then I really got my feet into other things, but then you know what? I got laid. Sort of got back to it again, and now, you know, I kind of...I kind of wondered if...oh, if you remember, also, when we got back to it again, I said, "I know that when I leave, when it's all over, no matter what happens, I'm going to say, "Well, that's solved.ï¿½" I said that, I know I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You predicted it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And so, well, it's hard for me to say, "Well, that's solved." It's very hard. However...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: However, it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I wouldn't say it's solved. I would say, I think, well, I think I can deal with it as what I did feel it as a problem, and take care of it as any other problem that I...not that it's necessarily solved right now. At least, I know how to handle it and what to expect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I feel more comfortable with thinking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. You feel more comfortable with dealing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, no, I can't say it's solved, and (inaudible) before, but, yeah, I think I feel much...well, I feel much more comfortable about it. As predicted. But, yeah, and then I also have enjoyed many sessions. Despite the fact that I said (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of times it's, well, the things that fit together nicely. It can just make...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's neat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, for about three days, it doesn't matter what goes on in the lab if everything else is squared away.</p>

<p>[0:10:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then of course, it happens the other way around, if something goes bad in the lab, I come in here and tell you all about sorts of bad things (inaudible). Yeah, I...I think in the long run, though, when I look back on it, but I think right now, that the feeling is a kind of exhausted relief, but I think, you know, years from now, I will look back on it more as...well, as two kinds of experiences, number one, as learning.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not necessarily solving but learning how to try to begin to solve.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And number two, it's somewhat enjoyable. I can't say completely enjoyable, but it's kind of been, you know, hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But sometimes fun?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when things do work. I really...I really wish I had might, maybe I don't (inaudible), but something like that where at the end of each session I had...you know, what conclusions I came to. Because if I am not mistaken, I really got off in some dead ends sometimes. I don't know. Maybe I'm at dead ends now. But it doesn't matter, you see. As long as this is just a session I'm recording with you, and not a session I'm recording with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. You can go on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean, the fact that they're 20 sessions, just ends with the tape recorder. Someday maybe (inaudible) greater. I should tell the person on the tape recorder I've enjoyed his presence. I hope, you know, he's enjoyed mine, or she, whatever. It's been fun. I think...I think, though, that way back gnawing in my head, that that...that it would have been much easier if you had hidden that and kept it secret and I didn't know about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course that would have been kind of dishonest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it really got in your way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, a lot of times.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: From expressing yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Does that bother other people?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Often, yes. Sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, which? Often or sometimes? Well, it could be both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know. Sometimes, though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because it...you have the idea, you know, that there's a class sitting somewhere and there's three or four people in that class that you've met knowing that they're going to hear it, even though, despite the fact, you know, maybe only one person, or maybe you're going to hear it. But nevertheless...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nevertheless, you're worried about who might hear it, people that you're acquainted with?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't, first of all, I don't see where it can...well, I don't know anything much about the research at all thatï¿½s going on. But I think if anything should be done with it, I think that should be illuminated as like a positive. Why couldn't you take notes afterwards, you know? Write things down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, did I tell you this before, if you ask me about the research after the testing, I'd be glad to tell you that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, great. I enjoyed the testing, by the way. It was interesting to see what testing is like now. I mean, halfway through the...what I considered a creativity quest, I don't know whether it was or not. Halfway through I realized what it was, so then I got in my mind and said, oh, creativity, let's create. And then you approach it differently and I'm sure I did better on the second half once I realized they were testing. I didn't have any idea what it was about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which...what was the test about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, 17 ways to use something. And then they had some stories that you had to give a title to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see. I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And things like that. So, if you really let your mind go, you can come up with, you know, you can be creative. But if you want a really good practical use and want to be pragmatic about it. You know, all I would need is a pencil. It wouldn't be the right side and I'd have to use a dowel. Well, you know, it's not the laboratory where you're trying to do something correctly, you're just trying to create some crazy things so you can have 17 ways to use it. So...yeah, and I think, think back, one of the initial reasons I came here, a person had sot of helped me with any new problem I have had like this, moved away to New York and I really couldn't handle it myself, and then when I went to see him, I've told you this before, sort of grown apart, it was hard for me to really relate. But because we had been really tight before, it was easy for him to give me advice, he said, "Well, why don't you..." he talked about the school and the center here, and that's why I initially came here. And so I think, wow, now wait a minute. Maybe, you know, maybe I won't be able to handle it alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it will be the same after you're here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In this...</p>

<p>[0:15:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so I, you never know. I kind of wonder, you know, if, I doubt very seriously if people when they get married and start living together can do this type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can do what type of thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can really explore deeply and say exactly what's on their mind. I haven't seen anyone that's been able to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you're saying it, are you hoping that that's a relationship...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it would be interesting if you...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could have if you could do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and I think it would be very...well, I, I mean I'm not, I don't share the bed with a lot of married couples I know, but I just have the feeling that even in the most intimate moments, they're not really expressing their, you know, exactly what they're feeling about something. If it were the case and everyone were expressing their exact feelings, you know, all the time, or married couples were, I think there would probably be either fewer marriages, or fewer divorces, one or the other, I'm not sure which. But I mean, the minute you start to question, the instant you start to question whether or not, you know, you love a person anymore, then you start to say things, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Gee, what would happen then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I don't think there's any hope in my finding, you know, a "life mate" that would serve the same function that you and Kevin have. I really, I...that would be nice, it would be great. It would be ideal.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd really like it, but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it just...it just appears to me that that's not what has happened. It's, of course, what should happen.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is what should happen, did you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I would say so. You see, in order for that to happen, you'd either have to, number one, begin with 100 percent honesty or number two, reach a point where you say, "Okay, let's start right now being honest." When, by definition, it's either got to be...the first time it's got to (inaudible)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's got to start sometime.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's got to start.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, let's take the first...how many people do you meet, on, with absolutely no barriers, you know, completely open right from the start?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like any.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it sure doesn't. I mean, there's always something that's cluttering your opinion on it. I mean, the minute you look at someone on the street, you think, well, is this person, you know, is he, does he act intelligent? Does he act like he knows what he's talking about? Is he arrogant? Does he care about his personal appearance? You're thinking about those things. But you don't think out loud, well, let's see, I think I can analyze this. Little sloppy. You know. You don't say that. So, the minute you've got some opinion in your head that you haven't, you know, said to that person about that person, then you've already put...there's your first barrier. So, I think without too much fear of being wrong, we have to say that people, unless they've like grown up from infancy together and get married, that they're going to have barriers. So, assuming now that you're going to meet someone and you're going to break down the barriers, then you have to find the point where, this is the point where we're breaking down.</p>

<p>So, if you do that then the whole relationship could really change, I would say. Not necessarily appreciably, but to know what a person felt, you know, I think it's a point in the past about something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would really change the whole thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much disturb...it might disturb it for the better. I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be bad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But really alter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I don't know that I ever come to that point with anyone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean, our first relationship was (inaudible). So, that's different. And with Kevin, I think he was sort of a father figure, and the first couple times I met him it was in a group, and we were both really concerned with...was it the meeting? We were both really concerned with the meeting, and that was primarily on our minds and very few personal things and reflections. Mine to him and he to me. And we were really intent about that, before we really got to know each other on a personal level. Matter of fact, my first images of him were not necessarily what he looked like, what he acted like, how he...but rather, how, what his opinions were in this meeting. So, that there was a real good opening there, for an honest relationship and I think that...that happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but by and large, it was quite hard.</p>

<p>[0:19:59.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, well, it sounded like you were saying, though, that, like you felt that your relationship with me had been honest from the beginning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, by definition. I mean, it's ridiculous for anyone to come in here and lie. What you're going to talk about is lies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying that wouldn't happen in other relationships?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it was very hard, yeah. But I don't think that's necessarily my problem. I think that's the way the world clicks, you know, all the gears. So, I mean, this (inaudible) idea would say, "Let's all be honest," and then someone says, "Oh, I like your dress," well, then you know you mean it, you know? It's not as though, so compliments would no longer then be non-meaningful, or comments at all would no longer be non-meaning. But that ain't going to be so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, even in the best of worlds, if you (inaudible), I'm sure there's something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although you think you'd really like it if were that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It would be interesting. It would be interesting to set up a community, a community of two, or you know, a larger group where that would be the case. It would be much easier for us if it was more than two people. But I don't know, it would be very hard to do. Well, at any rate, so, all this comes...because of all this, I've come to the conclusion that any work that...I call it work, any investigation that I do of my own life by myself, will probably have to be done without help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'll have to do it on your own?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Inside yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, unless, there is some sort of thing that happens again, but I think that, well, there's two ways to look at it. You can say, well, twice in one life, that isn't too many people to know...and one, by virtue of the fact that that's the way the relationship was going to be because you initiated the relationship that way, that is with you, that is a very good statistic. So, you'd have to say by chance once in one life. But then you also can look at it the other way, and say, "Well, ever since I've been mature, ever since I've been really able to think about what's going on in my head, I've had someone."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You had someone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I've had Kevin, and I've had about a year when I...groping, groping, and I came up with you. So, it...both ways, either way, you can say, "Well, I'll continue. Maybe I'll have a little limbo time now, maybe in a year or so, and I'll find someone again." Or on the contrary, you can say, "Well, there's only one in my life, why should there be anymore?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it depends on the way you look at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it depends (inaudible)ly where you are. So, I'll just let it ride. I don't know, if I get into trouble again, you know, and really start to not enjoy myself or the way...where my head is, then I'll have to probably instigate something like this. But that's no big deal. So, I go away with a comfort...comforting feeling, you know. I don't think I'll ever come to suicide because I can't live with myself, you know, but I can see now where if I get to the point where I'm distraught about living with myself I know what to do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, go get help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, that's pretty cool. That's...you know, that makes it all worthwhile. Well, those are all the observations I have, so that's, I've concluded that. Yeah, I've...I've...I try to think, too, well, one other thing that, well, one time I had to go to the lab, and, I mean, I haven't told, I've mentioned to a few people that I'm coming to see you, just because it got to the point where I had a meeting, and (inaudible) when I just mentioned, and so a few people know that, you know, that I have been coming here, and I wonder if they notice anything different, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder if they can see if you changed anything, if they can see it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if they know anything, one guy, my roommate, maybe you remember the name Bob, and I don't know if you do, it doesn't matter anyway. One time, I saw him on the street and I said, "Well, I have to go now." "Where?" "Well, I've got an appointment. I just have to be there." And he saw me a day later, he said, "Oh, you got your head all straightened out?" Kind of jokingly, (inaudible) I've changed. I kind of think, you know, does he notice any difference?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. You wonder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think not. Because the things I've brought up in here haven't changed much. I mean, I'm still doing the same type of thing, outward, that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. It still looks the same, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, there's very little (inaudible), I think, for people who have stayed in my life before and after anything could be done. But I think in the future, there may be appreciable changes. Well, that's stupid. Of course that's the case because one of the basic problems, the basic problem, I think it was, was with new people, was. So, how (inaudible) those and changed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. So, no, I don't think...think any (inaudible), unless they're with me when I meet new people and they see that I'm behaving differently. They see...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I'm going to have a hey day when I go to France. Wow, the whole place is going to be full of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Everywhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's like, well, it's really, really sad, in some sense, and it's going to be great in another. Number one, the sad respect is the fact that I...well, I spent ï¿½67 in France, and I went through a two-month complete cultural shock. I mean, really, there was simply no one around that spoke English. And that, of course, is the big thing, the language. I think it would be less this time because of the fact that I spent ï¿½67 out there. Probably (inaudible), so right at the point when I should really be thinking about, you know, how I'm behaving and really trying to be honest with my behavior and honest with myself, I'll be going through a real trauma, and I think that I would just...I'm too occupied with the cultural trauma and maybe I'll have to...because it would be too much work to handle both problems, I fear that it might be easier for me to slip back in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You fear the honesty might go?</p>

<p>[0:27:07.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In that extra tough period.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I'll just have to work on it that much harder. We'll see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then again, on the contrary, it might be the case that because I will not be communicating well, I might not be communicating at all, I might not find an honest or a dishonest relationship. (inaudible) to find any relationship will be all right. Well, we'll see. I've really been looking forward to sort of being over there. Well, I actually meant, I was going to say, for that reason, for the reason of meeting new people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, actually, it's because I'm going to buy a motorcycle when I get over there and I'm very excited about that. No, no, I shouldn't say that. It's because I'm going to meet new people, that's why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It works for both reasons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, fine, it works for both reasons. I...one relationship I haven't mentioned, it might be interesting to examine briefly, and that's with Dr. Heitz, the professor, that I'm working with. He's quite empowering, and yet, well, he's my idea of a good physicist, because anything he...you know, there are Heitz models and (inaudible) explanation and the FOM model. But any time he does anything like that, it's never high powered stuff, I mean, high powered mathematically or theoretically. It's always something he can bring down to a base level, and yet, it's explaining something that had been heretofore unexplained.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I'm really in awe of the guy. The fact that he can take, use the basics to describe something way the hell up there. So, with this in mind, you know, I kind of joined the group and I really quake in my boots when he enters the room, I really do. Because I'm afraid I'll say something wrong. And he just won't let a sentence go by that's not right. I had a sentence in which the entire intent and purpose of the sentence was quite clear but I exchanged one word for the other. And I was two paragraphs past it, I was talking to a group, and he stopped me, and he said, "Now, wait a minute, that sentence that you said..." and he repeated the sentence verbatim, he didn't even have to (inaudible). And so I'm really scared of the guy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like you have to watch every word.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And that's...that's not so good. Well, I don't know that it's possible to be any other way with him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, maybe it's really the kind of person he is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, you...this was a new relationship. I hadn't known him well. I'm working for him. So, it's new and it's a developing relationship, which is, again, my problem. And I think, right now, it's, I'm just avoiding any development, really, I'm just trying to just, say exactly what's right, and get it in his eyes. Well, that's not so bad. That's physics. He's s good physicist. It's a hard relationship to examine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that's all that you focus on when you're with him? Is trying to say what's correct?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you see, the thing is, generally, when you're with anyone else in the lab, if you've got a problem where you're discussing something you just throw sentences together and the idea gets across in a paragraph.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And you'll miss a word and the thought here and there and you've got a misplaced modifier, but you know, you get the thought across. Not so with him. You know, he's got to follow, like today.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very logically, or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, so it's...yeah, it's rough and it's...it's not a relationship I can go into freely. It's not a relationship where I can go into not thinking about how I'm reacting, rather, just reacting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel a little stiff with him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't feel a little stiff, I feel very stiff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A great deal. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I...I'm aware, almost exclusively of how I'm behaving. And to the near complete exclusion of what I'm saying, or (inaudible) getting any ideas.</p>

<p>[0:31:49.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all power in my saying it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, and you know, am I impressing him as being a reasonable physicist? So, it's really a bad relationship in that respect, in that it's formulating into, all the bases that I've been saying are real, are not working should be done. But on the other hand, it is a complete professional relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, it's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Very personal. Now, you can work with people where the opposite is true, where you develop a very personal relationship, and there's certainly not in this case. So, you know, it's sort of bittersweet. I can feel bad about the fact that, I'm building tremendous fences, that I'm not really myself, and on the other hand, I can consider a professional relationship. I mean, I'm really never going to get tight with the guy, that's for sure. I don't even know if his wife is. His wife is a very intense, high powered ACLU lawyer. And they're really quite a pair. They're both...really do well in the work that they're doing and are very concerned with. But I can't feel bad about the relationship because of the fact that it never would have (inaudible) me personally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel...you can't feel bad about it because it's professional?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That makes it less bad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but I don't know if there are many other relationships. I see the problem, most everyone else in the group, well, everyone else in the group that I'm working with now, I either knew them beforehand, so, either number one, all the fences are built, or number two, they're not, depending on our relationship. Or they're...you can't communicate with them anyhow because their English is so bad. So, there are very few chances in this particular endeavor for me to develop relationships. I would say half the people in the English, in his department, when they come they can't speak English, literally can't speak it. Somehow they've gotten through the exams so they can read an English physics book, they take the test in physics in English. Wow, there's (inaudible) that can't get along. So, you don't have a chance to develop a good, close type of relationship, at least, initially with a lot of these people. But that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're a little (inaudible)?</p>

<p>[0:34:31.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I mean, well, I should be talking, you know, within a year, the shoe is going to be on the other foot. Someone is going to say, "How did he get in here? He can't speak any French." But we'll see. I think eventually people that come here can develop personalities because they've been here (inaudible). And hopefully, I will be able to...well, I know it's going to be a super crisis, because they have (inaudible) Americans over there, at least in the sphere of people I'll be working with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: At least in what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The sphere of people I'll be working with. I can go out of my way to find them socially, but I'll try not to...once you get past about two months, you're all right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just those first two months?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, at least it was for me last time. There was no way last time I was going to find any comfort in a personal relationship that was based on communication, oral communication, because I was working way out in the hills, and I was working with Italians, too, and French, but still, there was sort of a, I don't know what the word to use, a primitive way of communicating, developing personalities without words. It can't be done. But if you consider spending weeks with a person, you know, 12 hours a day working with them, and trying to communicate with them without words, you certainly would develop, you know, a relationship with him, you're going to know his foibles and you're going to know what's going through his head a lot, but consider you've done that with a person, and maybe you know a dozen words that are common. Wow, that's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's amazing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sure is. It got to the point eventually, where we were communicating fully. But it just goes to show you that all communicating is not done...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Verbally.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Verbally, yeah. There are other ways. I also might mention here, there have been times when, well, I think you asked me like the first or second session if it would bother me if you were blind, and that never has crossed my mind, except in one instance, and that has occurred again and again, that is, where you reach a clichï¿½ or you come to something I used once, "out of sight, out of mind," well, you know, it's hard to use that. You think for a minute, oh, well, that doesn't necessarily apply here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see what I mean? There's another one. "You see what I mean?" It's just the only time I've ever thought about it is then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you use those phrases.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you consider the fact that they really don't apply. But otherwise, it hasn't crossed my mind. Do you always ask that, by the way?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Has it ever bothered anyone?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes. Sometimes people are uncomfortable with it for various reasons.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I at first, was slightly interested in it, but then I got more involved with what we were doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Didn't pay much attention?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The first time, if you remember, you fumbled with the microphone. I thought for sure that was to show me. But I knew it when you walked in, because I'd seen you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd seen me before, I remember that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you'd passed me at the (inaudible) many times. Walking along. Yeah. I wonder, let me think now, that's one, one barrier that I haven't mentioned. Now that we're in session 20, maybe I can think of some other things. I don't think there have been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Barriers? What are you talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, things that I haven't been honest about, 100 percent and exclusively. I don't think that mattered too much, you know. I don't really think there have been.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In here, you're talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah, but that, well, the two things I think, the only thing that has crossed my mind much that really might have mattered, maybe just a little, number one, the tape recorder, and number two, watching what I say, the clichï¿½s, well, saying earlier what I said, well, earlier this session, when I was mentioning, I said, well, you can communicate, when you walk to someone on the street if he acts arrogant or if he looks sloppy, well, I thought about saying if he looks sloppy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those are the only two things I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, just for my own curiosity, I'm curious, do you mean you wouldn't say, if you thought about it, you wouldn't say, "He looks sloppy."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no I had to say it, because that's what I meant, because in my world, that's what matters. No, it's just that the thought is there. Looking sloppy, to me, it means something. To you, it can't.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't mean anything to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so, I don't think it's mattered much. So...then the tape recorder, I think the things that have crossed, those things have crossed, that I haven't mentioned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course I have mentioned the tape recorder on occasion, haven't I?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you have mentioned the tape recorder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not every time that it crossed my mind. If so, I'd just be mentioning (inaudible) be most...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it crossed your mind a lot?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, Sony would be the most frequently mentioned word no those tapes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, a whole lot it crossed your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My recollection is that you said at first, you liked the tape recorder?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I liked it that in a sense, that I had a record. And also I (inaudible) in a sense that I haven't talked about any sexual problems. There's something about the way I've grown up in 20th century America, that it's taboo to make that public.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's particularly what you didn't want on the tape recorder?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so that, granted it is a record and it was a record, but that was before I really decided to get into any sexual problems. To get into them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That made the difference?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, certainly. I think it might have been a difference to me, I think it really might have, had it been sitting on the other side of the desk on the floor, even though I knew it was there, and only the microphone was showing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because every now and then I'll glance over and I'll see them turning and it will come back into my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where it would have been more (inaudible)...you know, you could have said to me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I would have been perfectly willing to put it on the floor.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know. I just thought of that now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. You hadn't thought of it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hadn't thought of that before. Yeah, I don't...I don't think that, except in the case of any...any discussion of my sex life, it would have made much difference.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the one place where it inhibited you?</p>

<p>[0:41:53.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and initially, I was, you know, to have a record was...wouldn't be good, without question. For instance, if...well, yeah, it makes it more...it makes it more official. Yeah, it doesn't make it like something if, well, if you don't feel well and you come in, or you're just a little bit tired. By the way, it's amazing, you've only yawned once.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today, you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, in 20 sessions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You counted?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was just amazed by the fact that the stuff I did say would be at al interesting, at times. And one time, you yawned, and I said, my God, I've never seen her yawn before. And I haven't seen you yawn since. Not counting them, if it only happens once, it's not that hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You watched to see if I was bored?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, I never watched, but when you did it, I thought, well, this is the one that's boring her to tears.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then, it never happened since then. No, I never really watched. I've all the way had a feeling that, despite the fact that deep down inside me, I don't really, I can't really seeing you being excited about it, and I've said that before. I still get the feeling you do have a really strong professional interest. Well, professional is a bad word there, because professional and personal you are really one and the same, at least I think so?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just like, for me, professional is physical. Both professional and personal have to do with physical things. But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you feel that I'm interested in what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it baffles me. It really does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I walked off...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It baffles you, did you say?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, to think that you could be dealing with someone that's, you know, schizophrenic, you know, something that's really got something that's weird, way out? Here's a guy who's just got trouble meeting people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How could I possibly be interested in that, in you, you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, again, everyone's got their exclusive problem and if that's the problem that's bothering me at the time, that's the most important thing for that person. So, in other words, the problem for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be it not so...for the fact that it's not so spectacular, I mean, that shouldn't apply, as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you figured that it would. You're surprised that it doesn't apply, as far as I'm concerned?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm not saying that it doesn't apply. I'm not saying that there aren't sides to that. I mean, if you've got, you know, a guy out there that's got a potion that changes him into Dr. Jekyll when he comes in...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or someone that's a nymphomaniac and is married to a eunuch or something like that. I mean, I can't see you poring over this tape and trying to solve my problem when you have those people (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, but nevertheless, I don't get the feeling that I am in any way being neglected, but yet still...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Still, there's some feeling there, and I'm not quite sure what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it just doesn't make any logical sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. How could I be interested in what you're saying when you can't hold a candle, as far as being spectacular to other possible people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, but, you know, not certainly not ever been in a crisis state. I think the most critical thing that's happened to me is just being very, very displeased with my own behavior, after the fact, after the behavior has taken place. And, well, that's, you know, certainly not to the point of being anything but depressed, and not even severely depressed. I can still go on, you know, acting that way. So, if that's as critical as I got, you know, (inaudible) where I'm not marrying a eunuch or whatever. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not doing anything dramatic, (inaudible), really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Some people just don't lead dramatic lives, I guess. Oh, by the way, I think I told you, did I mention England, the guy I trained, didn't tell you about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you did tell me about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I got the movies back, and it's really amazing, because I'm just shocked and awed at the...you know, when you're with someone and they change, the child grows up and you're with him all the time, you don't notice, right? Same thing on the swim, you don't notice a person deteriorating, and getting in bad shape physically, and yet, when you have movies, I have 100 feet of movies and you have an excerpt here and an excerpt an hour later. Wow!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can sure see it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, this guy was...he swam his way into the hospital. You know? I told you that. And then after seeing the movies, I still had to go back and do it. Had this strong desire to go back and do it, and if that can't deter me from...</p>

<p>[0:47:27.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then it feels like nothing can?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So, I think my motivation has been pretty well established and I think that's the thing that's driving me back is that when I do perform, when I look at it, like I'm behaving like a circus animal, when I do perform, I've got 20,000 people there yelling and cheering me, that's recognition. That's what I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what my life was all about. So, it's worth it, to spend a year in training, getting out, getting in shape for that, for those few moments. And, boy, if anything was going to determine it, it was the movies. Because I can't see (inaudible) myself like that, if you just looked at it on that basis.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just kind of shocked?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know if anyone's died from it, but boy, really deteriorated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Serious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, really deteriorated. So, that just reaffirms my, you know, the major mold that I have, that you on occasion, mentioned that maybe I shouldn't try to put everything into this just because I want to put something into a mold.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I guess you're saying, I think, the fact that you've seen those movies, and are shocked by it, you still want to do the same, is (inaudible), you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, looking at the movies, there's just no question of what my immediate reaction is. Poor soul, just think what that guy's going through, and for nothing that's, sure, he might win a couple thousand dollars, but geez, and still, there's no question in my mind, but I'm going to do it. No question at all. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The fact that there's no question, have I (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it just reaffirms the fact quite strongly, really there, it's going to be very hard for me, at least now, where I change much, to not look at any given, (inaudible) my behavior and say, "Well, that's how he gets into this particular mode."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm, but it makes your behavior seem fixed because you saw them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but yeah. That might change, and I realize that. Major motivation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We'll see. As I said, I've been changing a little bit. The fact that I'm (inaudible) doesn't necessarily mean that. That's, and it's quite curious, by the way. I should have gone through this physiological change, this (inaudible), not necessarily psychological change, but a psychological awareness.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and that awareness is a change, all right, fine, so physiological and psychological at the same time. It might very well be that there will be some strange little changes in my head, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did the physiological things start after you started coming to therapy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it's hard to say, you know, I just notice things. I notice that the pants that you haven't washed and they haven't shrunk, but they have been hanging way in the back of the closet, are suddenly a bit shorter. And then I noticed that I was growing hair in places that I didn't have hair before. And I noticed that my tastes have changed, too. Somewhat. I don't know if...yeah, I really despise perfume now. You know, I can't...I'd rather have a girl smell like Ivory soap than Chanel No. 5. Sweet smells no longer, I just don't like sweet smells anymore. So, there are definite physiologic...and also I don't think I have as strong a sexual appetite as I used to. I'm not sure. That could be because I'm busier, you know, busier away from home. Before I was busier, but I was always busy at home, so...you know, you're always...you're always have a (inaudible) thing, but if you're really in public, you know, and you're busy, then it's a totally different. At any rate, it was interesting to see if there are strong psychological changes (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was my last growth spurt. I've been through so many of them. See, my mandible grows, my maxilla doesn't when I have a growth spurt. Therefore, my bite changes. Whenever my bite changes, I either have to have it corrected and shave off part of my bone or I have to get my teeth straightened with braces.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Goodness, every time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah, I've had it on and off four times. It's all right. Kept me out of Viet Nam, which was just fine. But I hate to be...I still have them on, (inaudible). I was hoping to get them off Christmas, but now I had another growth spurt. It's interesting that the, both changes, major changes, (inaudible) so, it really is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm. But they go together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it will also be interesting if because of any physiological changes, there are psychological changes and therefore because of my newfound way to approach my own problems I can cope with them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, it's sort of like well, I've realized how to do a problem and then, hell, here comes one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) now, this work.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, I'm going to try it out. It will be interesting. I don't know whether it will or not. We shall see. We shall see.</p>

<p>[0:53:34.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm curious about these growth spurts, I guess because I usually think that when people are 25, they're through growing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, they knew I wasn't. What the orthodontist that I have, who is also an MD, he just liked to go to school, I guess, well, when I was 12, I had my first growth spurt, and then I had one when I was about 16 or 17, and he X-rayed my hand, and my bones in my jawbone, he X-rayed my hand, and you could tell by the cartilage between the fingers whether or not you're going to grow again. "Oh, you've got a big spurt coming..." And sure enough, when I was about 20 or 21, another spurt. Okay? And then he X-rayed my hand afterwards and said, "I can't guarantee it, but it looks like you're not through growing."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this is the first growth since then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, hopefully. I'm 25. I can't grow anymore, I just can't. Hopefully...there were, I mean, there were psychological changes in those spurts, too. One of them was post-puberty. That was 21. That was earlier. And of course, I behaved much differently. And I don't know if there was much of a psychological change when I was 21. But it will be interesting to see what happens now. So. See if I can handle it at any rate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, (inaudible) skill.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's been (inaudible). The three of us have enjoyed it, haven't we? So, I guess we'll see you again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, good luck.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might be back. You never know. Next week, if I was (inaudible) jumping off of a building, you never know. I doubt it very seriously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what our number is if you want to call it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I have it down and I'll be around another year, so that if I can't handle things. I'll stop by...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's better to call than stop by.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Frankly...well, that's what I mean. That's what I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Frankly, I...I it's going to take a super major crisis because I really want to handle it myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really want to, and you really want to try?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I want to see what I can do. Although initially, I had a few sessions, really, I was worried about the amount, but everything was resolved. I realized resolution was not necessarily the purpose of these sessions but to be able to understand how to handle it yourself was the perfect...and in that sense, it would not make much sense for me to come back right away. If some problem bothered me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it would make sense to see how well you can handle things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and if I can't handle them on the first set, I'll try two or three times, to re-examine and see too much of what's messing me up. And it is interesting to sort of think about my head changing a little, believe me.</p>

<p>[0:56:46:0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although I think what you're saying is what you've learned here isn't...the most important thing is not necessarily the solution to X problem, but what the process of handling the problems is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Although still there's the idea in the back of my head that there should be a solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know that you said that earlier. One time I asked you, "How do you look at your work?" And yours was not necessarily finding a solution but how to deal, work with the problem. And I don't know that I see it exactly in that sense. I see, you see, I see it in another sense. What we have done is not necessarily a solution to any of my problems, but making me learn how to work on the solution myself, whereas I see the ultimate goal as being a solution.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, I wouldn't disagree with that. I just meant like the short term goal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what I mean by that, well, let me explain that. It's like if I can't, you know, I'm not going to be spending all your life with you, so what seems to me most important is to help you figure out a way to work out things for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Rather than just do these specific things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. I think we can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, well, thanks again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, well, I've enjoyed it, too. I really have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, when do I find out about this test thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I will tell Mr. Rosen to call you and I'll call you. (inaudible) thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he'll be able to get in touch with you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, bye bye.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: How's it going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a question before we get started. I meant to ask you this a long time ago and I don't think I did. I found it in my car when I was cleaning it out. Compensatory narcissistic personality disorder—obviously you know what that is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know narcissistic personality disorder. I've never heard compensatory used with narcissistic personality.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I listened to this podcast called "What the Fuck?" with Mark Maron. It's a really awesome podcast. He's a comedian, but his podcasts go really into deep stuff and they're funny. He's quite a neurotic, kind of narcissistic guy, but he's very thoughtful and smart. He was saying how he was like, "I just found out that this is probably . . . "</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What he has? [00:01:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, "Should I ask her about this?" because the things he was describing about it—this was a while ago—but it sounded similar, kind of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To what you [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:13) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So say more. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is I don't remember. This was months ago, months and months ago. I don't remember. You feel like everything is about you, kind of. You're highly sensitive and you over-react or you under-react. Stuff like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: My guess is he's including—compensatory is not usually a word that's used in the formal diagnosis, but he's also probably speaking to the way it's a compensation for feeling insecure deep down. It can look like a kind of grandiosity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That really deep down it's like self-hatred. Yeah. That's what he was talking about. I'm not really making a complete comparison because he was into drugs and he definitely sounds way more wound up and fucked up. He's the type where he's very honest about it. He'll have throw-down yelling matches with women he dates and stuff like that; and I don't do shit like that. It was just interesting, some of the stuff. I was like, "I wonder?" [00:02:30] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it is what we've talked about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's kind of what I figured. It's just a label but it's kind of similar to some of this. (pause) I'm still feeling pretty good. (sniggers) I'm seeing that chick tonight. That's nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gwen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. It's kind of cool because I'm nervous, but I'm not worried. I don't have any weird scenarios going on in my mind. I have butterflies, I think. I'm excited to see her. So that's good. [00:03:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You say, "Things are still good," and then you laugh. What's the laugh for, do you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's still kind of unsettling a little bit. This is very unusual. I guess I'm just constantly surprised like, "Wow. I feel good today, too." (both laugh) Oh, shit, I did fuck up one thing and I feel really . . . Dr. Carlton? I had a fucking appointment with her today and I put it in my reminder but I didn't—I have things like alarms, and I fucking forgot. That really, fucking pissed me off because I was like, "God damn it," because it's not like before where I was sleeping. I was working. I was doing my thing. I was doing my Kickstarter thing, but I didn't have the alarm thing so like around 12:30 I got a message and I was like, "Mother fucker." Anyway, that pissed me off a little bit; but then I was like, "All right. This is more normal. I just forgot to set the alarm." (laughs) I wasn't curled up in bed sleeping until noon. Did I tell you—that's totally different now? I'm up at 8:00. I might snooze a little bit more if it's rainy or whatever. That's one of the nice things about working from home, but I usually don't. Definitely at the latest by 10:00, usually I'm out of the house if not earlier. [00:04:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's such a difference. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of it is all of this, but part of it is Cecelia. How could you resist a little—like today, she was curled up between my arm and my chest with one paw—how do you not? Who has time for sleep? There is so much love. I get up and give her some food and pet her. We just laid there a little bit. She gets on my chest and we look at each other. It's just awesome. I think that she's made me have a routine a little bit; but I think it's everything. [00:05:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've also started this process.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. (pause) It's good. I'm the best man at my friend's wedding Sunday, so I wanted to have my pants taken in or—whatever you call it—altered. My mom's two closest girlfriends have a tailor shop, so she hangs out with them. A couple of times a week she goes there and they have coffee. I went there today for them to whatever. It was kind of cool. Normally those situations would make me a little shy and I would feel a little awkward and just want to get out of there kind of, but I felt very comfortable. I was joking with them and I was like, "All right. Now that I know where you guys are I'm going to come and hang out here." </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Pretty cool. (pause) So, yeah, it's good. [00:07:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This may be hard to stay with, but I do wonder if a piece of it is you used to describe coming here and you could build things up to talk about and come in and could be anxious and nervous about it, get through with it and then leave and then it sort of disappears for the week. The fact that you have to sort of be yourself more often in here is not the chance to escape in the same way. You're having to grow more comfortable with who you are and where you are in a given day, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't follow. You're saying in the past I would come here like as a refuge or an escape? [00:08:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or just as a kind of blip on the radar screen. You could come in and it would be fine whatever would happen and then go back to life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then back to the chaos, yeah. I think the difference is everything feels like . . . if I think of it like music when we record. In Protools or whatever program you use you see the wave; do you know what I mean? The sound. I think before it was just all over the fucking place. Now I feel like whatever I'm doing it's the same soundwave pretty much. I go to Starbucks and I feel the way I feel right here. I come here and I feel the way I feel in Starbucks. I go to the tailoring shop and I feel . . . Like now when I go home it's not so much like, "Oh, God, I just want to stay up late because I'm dreading tomorrow, so I just want to watch Netflix all night." Yeah, I watch Netflix, but now I watch it because it's funny. I just watch The Office because it's fucking hilarious and it's just passing the time. It's what people do. You zone out for a little bit. You have a sandwich. But I notice now if I watch too much, I get very restless, like something says, "All right. What am I doing here?" [00:09:18] So even if it means it's 10:00, I'll go for a walk to the Dunkin' and I'll just get some air and come back or I'll go for a quick drive. Something in me is just like . . . do you know what I'm saying? So even that, those things are different. When I'm home I'm happy. I'm happy to see Cecelia. My mom doesn't bother me. It's totally different. (pause) I still don't like this . . . see now, again, until next Friday I feel broke and I don't know how it's happening. I even have an app on my phone; I can check my account. What am I not going to go to Starbucks? That kind of annoys me. I barely buy things for myself. You see it. I generally recycle things I'm wearing. I just do a shit-load of laundry, add soap. That's annoying me. I feel like, "What the fuck?" I can't even go out. When I go out I just drink Bud. I'm not getting fucking martinis and shit or scotch or whatever. That's kind of annoying me a little bit, but it's not doing me under. I think of it but I'm working on it. I'm like a lot of other people. Other people are more broke than I am, actually. I just have to start doing the grant, writing things somehow. [00:10:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The way you describe it, it sounds like you're not quite sure where the money goes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. I do check it and I do see where it's going. I guess what I'm saying is where it's going, there's nothing I can do differently unless I literally stay at home, eat mayonnaise sandwiches. To me, that's not acceptable. There's got to be some kind of quality of life. I don't give a shit. I'm very "thing" about that. That's just the principle of the matter. I just feel like, "What the fuck? That's how you become depressed." That's a nice thing to me. I get out of the house. I do some work. I see friendly faces. You feel uplifted; and, even there, I get a fucking half-blonde roast/half hot water, so it's like only $1.50 they charge me for a short or whatever the fuck they do. I don't get any sweets. I bring my own banana. Even if I'm hungry, it's like what the fuck? That's starting to rub me the wrong way. I've just got to start doing the grant writing and just keep doing what I'm doing. I'm doing the best I can. [00:12:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you tutoring still at all? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just feel like the tutoring is not, again, is like a principle thing. I just feel like I need to make money in a different way because when I do the tutoring, I just get locked into that and it takes away time and energy from, let's say, this grant writing. I think sometimes you do need to make a break so you're forced, especially if you have an idea. You know what you want to do. You've just got to sit down and do it. You can't keep getting sidetracked by, "I could make an extra $60." That's nice, but I need to make a bigger switch than that. [00:13:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the grant writing is a sure income source? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Once I get going, yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not at first, as you're describing it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not a known quantity as a grant writer, so I'd probably have to do some stuff much cheaper—like I said, that journal. Do some stuff and not get paid until they get some money, until we actually get a grant. Or, just thinking about it, I told Dave, "Maybe once or twice a week I'll just come with you and work construction." $15 an hour. Dave's one of my best friends. Knock down some walls. Paint some shit. It's money and it's mindless and you learn shit. I have a house. I like to keep learning, so I don't know. Just thinking, so we'll see. (pause) [00:15:07] It definitely is a big change. Now when I sit, I just think—well here, of course, because I'm especially thinking of things. It's weird. My mind is kind of like weird. I don't know what to think about it. Music? I'm pretty excited about that. Even when I think about my writing, I'm like, "Well, right now I'm doing music and when certain things are done there, I'm going to finish my book of poems." So that's that. (chuckles) You know what I mean? My mind doesn't know sometimes what to do; but the good thing is that when I'm not here, it doesn't worry about it. I just don't focus on anything. I'm just kind of like, "This is what I'm doing. I'm driving right now." That's kind of cool. [00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I wonder if you were just worried about it here, just now a little bit. "What do I say?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I don't want to say things and make something when there's nothing just because I should say something, because this has never happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In many ways, it indicates you're ready for analysis. If there isn't always some pressing crisis, the next external thing that has to get resolved, there's actually some space opening up inside. There's a question of "then what? What's in the space? What comes up?" That's part of where we may get there sitting up and it's part of where the couch can be sometimes helpful for people in relaxing that space. [00:17:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can kind of see that now. I can see that. I think there's maybe something where you're really quiet, but if you're making contact, it's awkward or something. You don't know what to do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that we can't. I mean I've sat here in silence for 30 minutes at times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you serious? I'm too shy for that. I'd feel really weird. Things like that, my shyness comes out. I'd feel very uncomfortable with that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And sometimes for people, they can tolerate some silence, but then they start getting anxious in the pressure to find something. Lying down allows so you don't feel quite as pressured to come up with something, and then things start to come up that surprise you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I can see that. You can at least close your eyes and not feel weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a little more room to be contemplative together, just be. (pause) But . . . [00:18:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But what?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (sniggers) I can see that—I don't mean today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe eventually. Maybe eventually. I'm open to it. I started to connect with this Assyrian chick on Facebook. Somewhere that's still kind of like . . . because that's not just a woman thing, that's a cultural thing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she new?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Just within the last two days. This is the thing with these Assyrian chicks, she's attractive but she's definitely not . . . she's a little more fancy. She's—I don't even know how to explain it—fancier in a way that, not this kind of fancy. A little more make-up. She has an MBA, shit like that; but she's cool. She seems to really enjoy talking to me. I don't know. I need to either let that go or just not be wishy-washy. I need to say, "All right. I'm not going to date non-Assyrians. I'm going to find an Assyrian chick and get serious." Or I've got to let it go because I think it's probably getting in the way on some level. I don't know. [00:19:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It always ends up sounding like you talk about finding someone, connecting with someone from that culture who fits the bill in some ways, but not in some significant ways, usually. You haven't had a very serious relationship with someone Assyrian.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that one that I was almost going to marry in my 20's. I went to L.A. and all of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But even her, if that was now, I never would have hooked up with her. That was a different person. Back then is one big—I've told you before—it's just beige, some kind of weird beige. I have memories but I'm like, "Wow, really? I totally remember that intersection." Like what the fuck? That was me? She was awesome, but if it was now, I don't know. Even though she was inthe closest; she was artsy. Even her, there was something kind of girly—not girly. I don't know how to fucking describe it. There was something that I just didn't like completely. It's hard to explain. Maybe what it is, is they're never as quirky enough as I want, and I hate that word, but they're never eccentric in the right way. [00:21:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too mainstream kind of conservative?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Exactly. They might not be conservative, but there's something in their demeanor that bores me. It's a bummer. I think in L.A. that person probably exists, but that's neither here nor there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's also, sometimes, been important that you haven't ruled it out so far. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I sometimes actively seek it out. On Facebook I'll find chicks that look kind of cool and I make effort. Or the opposite happens; I'll just get annoyed. There are these two Facebook friends I have that are Assyrian who are in the city, and they both look really hot or my type—or, at least, very close to my type—but I can't get a reaction out of them. So I think what happens is that the ones who know they're like that are already with non-Assyrian guys. It's like this awful cultural nightmare. It's like Assyrian chicks hook up with non-Assyrian guys because they're like, "All these Assyrian guys are kind of like mama's boys." All the things I'm not, but it doesn't matter. Most guys are like that, so they get souped up. Also, it is that I have that, too. It's that, "Oh, this Irish guy is into me so I must be hot. I'm cool now." There's a lot of that. I have that, too. I understand that feeling, but I've been trying. No, if I meet a really cool Assyrian chick, I'm down. It's a bummer. if I meet a really cool Assyrian chick, I'm down. It's a bummer. [00:23:40]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would it mean to marry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'd make effort. It would be awesome. What am I going to do? How am I going to speak Assyrian? That's important to me, man. I'm lucky. I can read it, I can write it, I speak it fluently, and I speak Turkish and Greek. That's it? I'm just going to be, "Well, that was good while it lasted." No way. It's got to be someone that either really understands that and wants to learn some or whatever, or—I don't know. That's worrisome. But like I said, (chuckles) the years go by. If everything else is great, then you've got to make up your mind. You've got to just decide on something and stick with it. (pause) [00:24:44] I think a lot of times what it is, is a lot of immigrants, it's small. It's almost like you feel like you're dating your cousin. I think that's what happens a lot. People feel too claustrophobic. It's a very odd thing and I can understand that. I don't want to just start blaming girls, but it is kind of annoying. I have a lot of Assyrian guy friends who make effort and they're not typical Assyrians; but all these chicks are just sleeping around with non-Assyrian guys and then being prudes with the Assyrian guys they go on dates with. Or they've already decided on some non-Assyrian and that's it. Remember that one I hooked up with that I was really into? And then she went back to that guy and married him. That's fine. Maybe that's just meant to be and she loves that guy. There's something messy, like something's not . . . [00:25:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're so aware of the [ ] (inaudible at 00:25:54) feeling that, "We're the outsiders so if I get accepted by someone who I see is on the inside, then I get to be on the inside, too."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I think it's also even physical. I think these chicks feel like, "This tall, blonde, Irish guy is into me. I'm hot in a normal way, not some swarthy Mediterranean way." I'm sure I've had that, too, of course. It's just fucked up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like inner prejudice.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. The ones who know that they're very attractive and cool or whatever are like, "Fuck. I'm going to leave you in the dust. I can be accepted in the real world with really cool people." And maybe it's because women are so much harder on themselves and so much more . . . do you know what I mean? Because a lot of the dudes are more like, "No. I want to try to find some Assyrian," (chuckles) but the chicks are like gone. In that caliber, they're done. I haven't found one. 99 percent have non-Assyrian husbands or boyfriends. (pause) [00:27:24] The other argument, though, is so what if your kids speak Assyrian? What does that even mean? You're American. You're not moving to Assyria. Logically, what's the conclusion of this diaspora? Eventually, one way or another, you keep assimilating generation after generation. In some ways it's kind of absurd—not absurd, it's illogical. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also hear you talking about wanting to find a home and a partner for this part of you, too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess what I'm saying is that I've had lots of girlfriends who are totally into it. They're like, "How awesome that you speak all of these languages." They latch onto that shit because they don't know their own background, so they want to start learning some Assyrian. But what I've never liked about that is that even though I'm born here, it's as if I'm not born here. I have this feeling like what the fuck? I'm not your hubby. I'm not your little American diversity. "I learned to make Assyrian meatloaf." Something about that annoys me, too, so it's like fuck me. (chuckles) Both annoy me. The Assyrian chicks are either too motherly and boring or something—too much makeup or something—or the non-Assyrian chicks when they're into it, I almost feel like saying, "You know what? Don't even worry about it." Don't take it up as some kind of pet project. It's so much deeper. So I feel like it's really me. I need to let some of that stuff go in a way. [00:29:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was thinking about how you've had the kind of opposing pressures from very opposite things on you in your family, especially by your mother. And, on the one hand, you're supposed to be as much like them, with a capital "T", to fit in and to be acceptable and to be beautiful and you're in the in-crowd then; on the other hand, it also sounds like you've gotten this pressure to be in the culture. Assyrian. Stick to Assyrian. There is a kind of devaluing of the "Them", too, and if you were to marry someone outside or drift outside culturally and start to assimilate too much, you also get criticized for doing that; so you're in a bind. I think that's sometimes where picking a relationship is—you're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't. Either way, there are internal people inside you who are criticizing and feel humiliated, in a way, by either option. [00:30:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) You can reverse it, too. When I was in Russia with Julia, she didn't have an issue with me wanting to learn Russia or going to the church with them when her niece got . . . So in a way, I'm being too harsh. It wasn't a pet project to me and I wasn't trying to be all "Oh, Russia culture is so fuckin' interesting," I'm genuinely interested. It's fascinating; but at the same time, I know I'm not Russia and it's all good. It wasn't about proving anything to her or that she'd like me more. If you care about somebody, you just care about everything about them, so I think I'm a little harsh about that. [00:31:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't have to be that that's actually what's happening, that they're thinking of you as a pet project, but I think you're saying that it starts to feel that way sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's just because they can't understand emotionally, like if I talk about the genocide, I don't want to hear people say, "That's so awful," even if they mean it. They can't go that extra mile. It really is like Malcolm X; it's like all these white kids trying to help out—you kind of can't. If you don't want to be racist or whatever, do what you're going to do; but don't come to me and try to be buddy-buddy and "we're the same", because we're not. I shouldn't feel that way, and I don't even know why I do, but I do feel this like, "You know what, dude? You don't know what it's like. I'm here because my whole family was wiped out. Why do you think I'm here?" That's, to me, still very real. What a weird thing. [00:32:31] It's like those unspoken things you can share with someone who understands, just like I'm sharing unspoken things with Americans—that side of me. That's awesome. We have unspoken cultural things. We just understand. We don't have to explain to each other about American stuff, so that's more of what it is. It's like having to explain, "Oh, where exactly is Assyria? I went home last night and looked it up on a map. I didn't know it was right next to . . . " That's cool, but . . . I don't know. [00:33:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're saying, "I don't want someone to say this" . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just want a chick who's very American, but who's (sniggers) really cool and Assyrian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is Assyrian?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ideally, it would be awesome. Are you kidding? Totally. Imagine a Samantha. To any one of these chicks, if she was Assyrian? That's it. I would have been married years and years ago. What's more beautiful than that? You're totally in this culture, not an issue, no weirdness. Then sometimes you have your own little language, you understand things, you don't have to explain shit. [00:34:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The idea of a place or a person where all parts of you could be known.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. The problem is like you said, there must be someone else like me out there, but I think mine is just really unusual. I think other people my age who were born here, it was one or the other more. They either stayed mama's boys, mama's girls, and they just stayed in that thing and married a dentist and that's that. Or they don't really speak Assyrian that well, they're way more Americanized, so the Assyrian thing, even to them, is more like a hobby. My mom makes pilaf every Sunday. I don't get those Assyrians, either. I just feel like I got raised in this really extra-peculiar way. [00:34:49]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's almost like you're really Assyrian and really American at the same time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Exactly. So when I'm with my Assyrian friends they're like, "How weird that you were born here. You talk like you're from the streets of Assyria." Then I go to Mike's wedding and no one has any idea. My family might as well have been here for 80 years. (pause) I guess it's the one thing I did like about Gwen. Maybe that's what I want. She's not Assyrian, but she cares about her background. There's a deeper understanding of what that means, so that's, I think, as close as you can get; because that's different. If someone's like, "Oh, yeah. My family came from Ireland 80 years ago, but I still totally know. I'm in touch with all of that. We go back to Ireland." They know about Irish history. They understand. I think that's different; but when it's just these kind of like mutt type people who, their backgrounds are kind of like pet projects—"My mom did a family tree and we're part Hungarian. Who knew?" It's like that's nice, but it's not coming from somewhere deeper. [00:36:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's something about you Gwen could get—just get—in her bones and understand the importance of ancestry and hasn't lived here very long. Even the different cultures; it's something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) There is a lot of stuff I should write about, I just don't know how to write about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I also think when you've had a development where so many parts of you are not known and didn't have a home, people who got it, just did. You knew in their bones that they understood who you were—that it can make finding that in a spouse even more important. I hear you running through the checklist of things that they would be able to get that, in a way, is in some ways like having a mirror of yourself. It's the fantasy of someone who, because they are so much like you in every way, therefore would understand everything. You wouldn't have to explain much at all. It's not that—I'm sure people more or less meet the checklist—but I think there's something you're also still trying to make up for. [00:37:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not a realistic . . . yeah; people who get together are different. Some things they don't know about each other, some things they learn about each other, some things they—whatever. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been traumatized by having been on your own, so I think there's a way finding someone who is just like you but is missing this part, it's like a re-traumatization almost—but they just won't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so no matter how much you're with someone, you're still kind of alone. That's a feeling that I end up having.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which you had as a kid because the people who mattered most didn't understand everything. They understood some things, but not a lot of hurts in you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (long pause) [00:40:03] I wonder if I should just write this stuff like a report, because I don't know how else to write about it. Maybe that would be the best way to start it, just literally write whatever I remember as fact, not for any literary thing, just kind of . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say "whatever I remember", what are you thinking of right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mostly like L.A. To me it's really amazing that there are these periods like that's so weird. I feel like that's something very weird. Something happened there, to just back up the car and drive away. I didn't have much money. I didn't know what I was doing. My dad had just died leaving my mom. She was a mess. I was a mess. I was having panic attacks. I'd cry. Wow. What the fuck? Really weird. (pause) [00:41:12] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm also continuously surprised in myself how little I remember of your early life, including that period. It's not that you haven't told me the facts and you say you dated this mean woman very seriously and I think, "Oh, yeah. Of course, yeah. I remember that now." I think there is a way that, in so many of these periods, it's not without a lot of feeling; it's kind of like the nuts-and-bolts bullet points, so it doesn't get integrated in your memory—in my memory. I think that's how people remember things about people. There is affective valence that makes it settle in as meaningful. I feel like I know the bullet points, but there is so much more that feels very fuzzy to me about this period of time. [00:42:14] </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just wanted to not go there, I think. It really bums me out. It's kind of unnerving to thing about it. (pause) That was just—wow—an insane time. I was so insecure. I hated myself. And Shauna, of course, was on this pedestal. I couldn't believe that any of this had even happened. Oh, man. I was kind of needy. I would get needy because of my panic attacks and because of everything. I was traumatized and—(laughs) L.A, like the worst place for a 19-year-old, traumatized kid to be. Not good. Not fucking good. [00:43:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Too much to come back to. So Tuesday—do you want me to write it down?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nope. I'm good. I'm going to write it in my phone.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tuesday at 11:20 and thereafter Mondays at 3:10.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Tuesday at 11:20. Bye bye.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hello.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So how are you doing today?  What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's a nice recorder.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah it is.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not like your other one you had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.  Well this is, they, the company actually gave me this to use for the study.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh that's nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yours was like a [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah a little one yeah.  It worked for me but this is, this is better.  I guess the new technology comes out, you know.  Well you know.  You're into technology.  You look good.  Your skin has cleared up.  What happened?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We try to hide the sugar from him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Boy it really is so much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She put a padlock on the fridge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah well it's helped your skin dramatically.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's all you did?  No medicine?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We, we blocked it.  No.  No meds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Plus I got into the alcohol room and—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Alcohol is sugar.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We'll, we'll discuss that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I don't think—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's why, well that's why the padlocks are on the cabinet and the, ah, cupboard.  I caught him when I, something woke me the other morning about four o'clock.  He's sitting in bed eating ice cream.  The next morning he's having himself a cocktail for breakfast so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you ever drink before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just small amounts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You shouldn't drink.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  He shouldn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially with all the medicine you're on.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's what I tried to tell him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So now we just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's dangerous.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It taste good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So now we locked everything up and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well can't you drink without the alcohol?  Can you, do you give him something that he can drink that tastes like it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Oh yeah.  We've gotten him the daiquiri mixes and that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't taste the same without the alcohol.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah it does.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does.  Alcohol doesn't, I don't think alcohol has much taste.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not, some of it doesn't.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not the one you made.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well mine's a different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well you and [NAME OTHER] don't drink do you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not a lot.  Social, socially a little bit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] likes wine and he likes scotch and beer and that and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I like more margaritas and fruity wines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not the wines, ugh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You don't like that?  Too sweet?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's tried the, well [NAME OTHER] likes Shiraz and very dry reds.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How does he like that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  I can't, I can't drink it myself but yeah I thought—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wait, his mood, his mood is good, though.  He looks bright and happy.  What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And now I feel like crap again cause my, my—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He thinks he, well we got to go have them take a look.  He got hit at school yesterday and he says his nose has been bothering him.  He's having problems breathing so I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did he get, what happened at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some kid threw a rock at me so I told him not to and he decided to do it again.  So I went off at him because he wouldn't stop and I punched him.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But today it says that there was conflict and you did very good at, um, ignoring the, the negative behavior.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well because it was during the whole gym period and [INAUDIBLE] I just couldn't take it anymore.  I was like, I've been picked on all my life.  I cannot take it anymore so I went.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I broke his pinkie too.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That's not funny, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that true?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  I—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was in a cast today.  I'm like, what the heck did I do to him?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well, see we don't get a whole lot of correspondence back from school on [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But they said it wasn't my fault because he started it.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right but anyway.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He says that he hit me wrong and broke his pinkie.  I'm like, no I'm pretty sure that I broke your pinkie when I twisted your arm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't they stop this at the school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well 1 kid broke it up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  A kid broke it up not a teacher or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A teacher was trying to.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But I don't, you know, we don't get phone calls from the school on things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So there wasn't any, he didn't get suspended or anything?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  Not, he didn't and as far as I know they don't tell, they won't tell you what happens to the other kids and that if things are happening.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well if he came back the next day, he wasn't suspended?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  No not if he was there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When do you finish for the, well you go all summer?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well he goes, yeah.  He, he'll have a week or so in June and a couple of weeks in July and a week in August and every so many weeks he gets a little bit of time off, and then we're taking a 2 week vacation in July, end of July, first part of August.  And we talked to them last week at his IEP that he'll, he's—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's going.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And they said that wasn't a problem cause we had gotten a note earlier from them saying that if you took time off during the summer then they're not going to bring them back in the fall.  Well when we talked to them at the IEP, they said that it wasn't a problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He has 1 more year until—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They meant if you didn't go all summer long.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Actually his credits basically is like a freshman if that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh really?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why is that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Cause his grades.  He's not doing what needs to be done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He technically could only, he could have a year left but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	With the grades he's got, he doesn't have enough to graduate.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm going to talk to the school but they said that they don't do it at this school, [NAME OTHER] said, but if I go to my home school to get more credits I probably can do community service for the fire department.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well you'd have to talk to dad and stuff on that but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like help them out like wash the trucks and.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why do you need community service?  Community service is if you're punished for something?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean to bring up my credits.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Hello?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They have no community service [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	We're in the doctor's office right now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I see.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Can I call you back?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that your sister?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Or you got anything you need to add?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You recognize the ring?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay bye.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  I can hear her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh you hear her?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah that was, she's working.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah but his mood looks good.  He looks happy.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You asked me to bring him by.  He's been trying to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	He's talkative.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He's been trying to keep his, his sugar levels.  [NAME OTHER]'s been checking them.  They've been slightly high so we've been trying to watch them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last time I checked on Monday it was, ah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh you check them at the fire department?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well when [NAME OTHER]'s working, he has me bring him over.  He, they have, ah—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A pricker.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah they have—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of those—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One of those things they to give people that—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Diabetics that check the blood count.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Diabetics.  They poke their own finger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you call it?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He just called it a pricker.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It takes this little thing and goes, presses down and it's like, ah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.  Grandma used to have to do it to herself twice a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who did?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	My mom.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They take a little, little pincher thingy—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I know.  It's a little pincher thing that just comes up and just pinches you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well I want to know why you're in such a good mood.  You just seem, he seems so up today.  Is this—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  He wasn't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did something happen at school?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Last night him and his sister got into it but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, overall how has he been doing at home?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Overall not too bad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not too bad?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Not too bad.  We've just had, like I said we have to watch the sugar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	At night.  What about does, does he sleep at night?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He, some, most of the time he does.  The night he was up eating the ice cream he wasn't sleeping so hot, but generally you sleep.  A lot of nights he's falling asleep downstairs before I have him go upstairs.  But he'll go up and look at his books and things and he's got a movie on.  Every so often he'll find that he can't sleep so he puts a movie in, but he's been sleeping at school again, though.  He's been, he's sleeping in school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why do you fall asleep?  You get bored at school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No I was just tiring.  I fall asleep and I think it's too cold, too hot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Too hot?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No actually it's really cold so you try and I guess—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I told you to wear a sweatshirt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You're supposed to be—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Even with a sweatshirt on it's like really cool cause I'm right underneath the, the ceiling vent.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thing that blows down.  Me and [NAME OTHER] are right underneath it so I'm just like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then I curl up in the corner and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well to keep me safe she has me behind her desk in the, um, corner so she has her desk in front of my corner and I have the whole corner to me so I can be safe.  [NAME OTHER] is retiring.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  You like her too, huh?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  See [PATIENT NAME]'s got a problem.  He has told some of the kids at school that he feels that he's bi.  So there're certain kids there are kind of—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Teasing?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well they tease him.  Some of them are, have like a phobic I guess.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One kid has a phobic.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So he gets—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well that's not true.  You're not bisexual, are you?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You are?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	He says he is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You never told me that before.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause I don't feel comfortable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?  You don't feel comfortable talk—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not around parents.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Around us.  Around dad he doesn't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to talk alone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Cause dad [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You want to talk alone about it?  Maybe next time?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	You, I really think he needs to talk to somebody.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  He, he doesn't see his therapist anymore?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	No.  He just sees the, the school therapist.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you talk to the school therapist about it?  You do?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	But that's, like I said they don't talk to us about anything so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well cause—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	And he won't talk to him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's confidential.  It's—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I understand that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	If I say it's okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Then he can talk to, but if you say it's not he can't.  I understand that but I'd really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well let me do this.  Next time you come why don't we spend a little time alone just, just to talk?  We don't have to do it now but that's.  Medicine wise do you need refills?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I do need some refills.  Um, um, [NAME OTHER] did talk to [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  She was here.  I met with her.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	That what you said yeah.  So they—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She called?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	She, they sent some information out but now, um, when we had his IEP last week and brought up some of that and they brought up a couple of other camps too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we're looking at others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [NAME OTHER].  She knows a person—</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well she, I don't know if she knows the same person but she knows somebody in this area that does horse therapy too which is the, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh yeah.  I could refer you for that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What's your name?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	I don't—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] she said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	She does it here in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But there, there's a person in [DEIDENTIFIED] County that does it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That what she said.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  There's somebody else—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who is this woman?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER].  She's the school, um—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Her husband's, ah, sister.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Social worker.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well why don't you look into that?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Well she's going to.  Actually she's got us filling out some paperwork for, ah—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Ah, have you heard about [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It's kind of like a respite.  Is it respite?  Is that right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	It, for [DEIDENTIFIED] County, they call it [DEIDENTIFIED].  So she's got us filling out some paperwork that maybe they could help pay for him to go to this camp or something.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	So we'll look at that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah cause you said, you said last time you like horses.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Yeah and she also has a friend that—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Does stuff like, to that effect so we're—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Let's look into that and then, ah, next time we'll explore that other issue, but let's go get your medicines.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b>	Okay.  This is basically what I need.  Those things there, the Adderall, the Depakote 500, and the Seroquel.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah let's go out there.</p>

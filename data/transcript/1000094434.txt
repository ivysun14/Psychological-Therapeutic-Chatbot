<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Consult with MP. Therapist Betty Johnson.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I forgot my collage. I made it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, did you make it! Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I will bring I next week it. I had it. It was really nice. I had a lot of fun. And I told my lab mate that I was making one. And she looked at me, she's like, "With scissors and magazines?" And I was like, "Uh-huh. And she's like, "Huh." And the next day, she's like, "Well I made my own mental collage." And I was like, "Okay." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So did you take it into work or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No no no no. I just told her that I was doing it. No I did it at home. I left it there-I forgot. I have been so busy this week. I'm leaving tomorrow for the weekend. Going to New York.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To visit a friend. Tomorrow is my birthday and it's also his defense-thesis defense? So I'm going to go there and...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's exciting. New haircut or?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I always haircut my hair before my birthday. It's like my treat.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I always do it. I really like to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're going for the weekend?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm leaving tomorrow morning and going to his defense. And then we're going to go and have dinner at a Portuguese restaurant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh wonderful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. And then-and then have-and then go to a party on Saturday. I don't know. And then go out to the city on Saturday too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now are you going home for Christmas? [0:01:49.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, when are you leaving?</p>

<p>PATIENT: On the 15th. And I'm coming back on the 14th. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's a nice amount of time. How do you feel about going back to Portugal?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm so happy. I'm kind of-there's just one and a half weeks, that's it!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm so happy. I'm so happy and I'm planning what I'm going to do there. Now I have to go and visit my aunt, the one that has the cancer. They did the chemotherapy and I'm going to go-my other aunt. I'm going to go and visit my other aunt. I don' t know if I told you. She was married to this guy for I don't know how many years. For 30 years and-35 years and then he found himself another lady.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, wow. "35 years - I can't be married." [0:02:34.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So she was devastated to some-I think my family needs. So I'm going to go and visit them for a couple days. For three days. They live in another city so I'm flying there. That's all. I'm going to go - I'm going to go out, have a lot of fun. Eat a lot of good food. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm so happy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Visit my friends. One of my friends is getting married on the 8th. Friends from high school. Really good friend. So I'm going to go to his wedding. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well great. (inaudible at 0:03:11.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. I have like a list in Excel. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good!</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of the things that I want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Good for you, good for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm really happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well great. Hopefully that will work out for you and you'll have a good time. And you'll touch base with people. Something I want to tell you, too, before we get going further. I just wanted to let you know there have been some unexpected things that have come up in my own life and I will no longer be here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Really? After today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have to leave. So, actually my last day here at the clinic is-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh no, not today. Is the 3rd of January though. And so I just wanted to let you know that. I've been really thinking about what therapist to transfer your case to, and I have one that I think will be perfect for you. She's a really wonderful therapist, very empathic, very compassionate and just really does good work. And I think, you know, that would be great for you, if you want to continue on. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so when I come back next year, I just schedule an appointment with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I wanted to know if next week before our appointment, on next week, if you wanted to be introduced to her. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah. That would be nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I can do is have her come in here for maybe another session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have introductions and then you all can work out from there what you do once you -  if you want to see her one time before you left. Or if you just want to wait until you came back. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I can come back. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Are you moving out from Whitehall? Are you leaving? [0:05:15.6 ]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But everything's fine. I'm fine. It's just some things, come up and I don't want to burden you with all the details of it. But things happen and so I have to make this decision. So I'm fine. And things are great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what are you, you having thoughts or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I - something really strange happened yesterday. I was analyzing this data from a student at MSU. She works with a professor there that, we have a collaboration with them. And she sends me this e-mail. That I should've brought in. Well. And in the e-mail, no-so I am analyzing the data. It's like nothing makes sense. It's like what is this? This is not what the paper said. Because she sent me the raw data, and I was looking at the paper. And nothing makes sense. I'm like, "What is this weird thing?" [0:06:22.7]</p>

<p>So I went to my boss. He's like, "What is this? This is weird." So he's like, "E-mail her." So I e-mail her. And then she replies and answers some questions, which are-I don't know. I was one of the questions-one of her answers. I asked her, why in the paper are only 40 compounds, if the files have 45 compounds. Where are the other 5 compounds. She's like, "Yeah, I just left them out so the story makes some sense." Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can you just leave out...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was like, this is not ethical. So I asked-I have-I went to talk to my boss and we were just going to the point of I was going to tell him, what did he think about this. Because - so in two parts of the e-mail. One she says she left the compounds out so the story makes more sense. And the other part is that-is that, what am I saying? Oh the data-she didn't analyze that data because - I don't know. She didn't like it because the background was too high, so she picked one. I'm like, this is not a scientific reasoning. </p>

<p>This is weird. This is definitely not an ethical decision. This is something-and it's been bothering me since yesterday. I went to bed and was thinking about it. I woke up this morning, having this feeling. Like this cannot be true. This girl cannot just, you know like-a) she's doing unethical decisions. You cannot omit data. You cannot manipulate your data so you get a paper. If you have bad data, you have to explain your bad data. You just don't-omission is as bad as lying.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure! [0:08:21.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if how it is, in this area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But in our area.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And she just puts it in the e-mail. Like nothing happened. So a) she's not a good scientist, b) she's stupid because she doesn't understand that it's not-you know, like she -  I mean not stupid but like non-educated. No one told her this. So this has been bothering me. I woke up this morning feeling weird. It's like, "Oh right. That's what happened yesterday." </p>

<p>This weird e-mail, where someone tells me that-research I'm doing. Because I'm involved in this research. It's not that just like-it's their research and I-I'm involved in this. I have to do stuff with their data. And if they don't-you know if the data is like-and the paper is not right. It's done. I'm screwed. Because then I'm going to publish and they're going to see a) the old paper doesn't say this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's some responsibility on you that could be... [0:09:18.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm like, this is not right. So I went to talk to my boss. And we were just right-going, like going to the point and he had an appointment. I was like, "Aah." So I left. But I'm going to talk to him today. And I'm going to tell him that I'm not going to stay working with him. I mean, that I-that I don't want to work with, in a place where people cheat or omit stuff. And that he has to know that I'm not going to do work-I'm not going to write any paper, put my signature on any paper if there's things you-you know like mistakes. Not mistakes because you can have mistakes. Omissions. Or like you're lying about stuff. This - I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so do - when you initially talked to him, does it seem as though he's in agreement with this one lady or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No he hasn't-she sent him the e-mail too, which I thought was like, "What is this lady sending?" You know, that says she omitted data. Like it wasn't a-it was -  like if it was normal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But he didn't read it because he saw the e-mail was for me. He got just like a copy. [0:10:31.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So you're-so when you say that you're going to tell him that you can't work with-</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, with him, if he's going to make me - -. If - I'm not going to be like a grad student in his lab, if he pretends that I'm going to do this thing. Of course I'm going to do it in a nicer way. That I'm really concerned about this and I don't agree with it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that he would tell you to continue to do whatever you can do with this piece of work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm just going to do it with the real data. I'm not going to use fake data.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he would encourage you to use fake data?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I don't think so. I just want to make clear that I'm not going to work with crazy data that doesn't-that is not right. And that if I stay there as a student, I'm going to say-I'm just going to say. And when I'm-ah. Shoot. If I stay here. I have to say, "If I stay here." As a student I'm not going to-I'm not going to be, allow this to happen. I'm not going - I'm not like that. </p>

<p>I'm not going to cheat just to have a paper and a great journal. I'd rather have a real paper with true data and a small journal than have it in science with fake data. He cannot pretend. I don't know. I'm so concerned. What if I like, do the advisors really expect you to lie so you can get good papers? I'm-I don't know. [0:12:10.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a big dilemma for some. Yeah, they want to publish in the big journals or they're being supervised and advised by...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because this student she didn't even care about writing something like-it happens in her lab. It's common because she says "Oh, we just omitted the data." Like a normal thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. It's just-happens. (ph)</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's because it happens.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Every day and it really-it's not really a big deal.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I didn't like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That didn't sit well with you at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then it's like, yeah. The schools here are so famous, so good, but then these things happen. I'm like, "Oh, well."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It will be interesting to see how your supervisor, how - </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm very interested.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stephan would respond to this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's good that you're able-now what does it feel like to be able to put your foot down and say, "I'm not working with this bogus data. And I'm not putting my name on anything that isn't ethical." How does that feel to be able to make those type of statements, those type of things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's scary, but I mean this is something good, not like me telling him, "Don't yell at me." Something like... I know it's so - but yeah. I know it's so wrong. So wrong for everyone, it's not just from someone's point of view. It's so wrong that I really think that I have to make this clear. I'm not omitting any data. I don't care if the data sucks. I'll just do it again. I'll just try some-but I'm not going to-I'm not going to-if I stay here as a grad student or even with this work, I'm not going to fake any data. [0:14:03.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like it's more acceptable to be assertive with him in this area, because this is blatantly wrong, I mean. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's unethical. But then it's different talking with him about the personal issues that you have. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I know, I think his personal skills are not that great. He doesn't understand-he should and I will tell him, like what we said last time. I have to tell him. He cannot go and yell at me. I really have to tell him that. But the problem is like, I know he's quite crazy, so, I don't know. Yeah. I should tell him that he shouldn't yell at us. Like the same way I'm going to tell him this today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that just as scary, as telling him about this unethical issue that you're seeing? (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh this is not as scary as telling him that he cannot yell at us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I was thinking too? Like no one ever told him that was not right. And he's been there for six years. And then I come here. And I decide that's not right for me. So that's why it's kind of scary. I think that he's going to say that I'm being-you know, that it's from my point of view, that he yells. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That it's only your problems. Your problems, not really... [0:15:39.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's why I would-that's what I think is so scary because I know he always blames other people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And there's a good chance that that might happen.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm going to have sure that I have another....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Another reason?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No no no no no. that I have-that I know exactly what to tell him and that I, like-like my future is not at risk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I want to apply to the Ohio State, I want them to tell me "Yes." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like they promised. And after that I can just....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to take care of you, too, right? So it's either you talk with him and you let him know how you feel. And hopefully the situation can be corrected. Or you find some way to put up with it until you get accepted. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Yeah, until I get accepted. After that? I know myself. It's going to-I've never put up with so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so how do you-if you decide that it's too great of a risk to talk with him now before you get that acceptance. How do you put up with it until then. So that you're not stressing out. So that you're not feeling really bad about yourself. So you're not on the verge of quitting and those sort of things. How can you continue to work with him and his issues without those things happening. Is it possible? [0:17:16.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, a) We're all going on vacation, which mean we all come in January completely renewed attitude. He does it, I do it. Everyone in the lab comes [back in spirit]. (ph) b) I'm going to have to work, twice as hard. You know, spur him to - for him not to yell at me stupid things. I'm going to have to be patient. I need the acceptance. I cannot go and tell him that he has to stop yelling at us. I cannot risk my future. Once I have an acceptance letter from any school? I don't care. From any of the schools I applied, I'll go and talk to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. [0:18:12.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But before that, it's too risky.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you think about your life, when has there been a time where you've taken a risk like that and it backfired on you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What is it-what is it, backfired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, backfired means like how're you saying if you go and talk to him, you may not be able to get accepted to these schools. Or he may not want to work with you, and those sorts of things. So like you do something but then it doesn't work out. So, when in your life have you taken a risk on something and it didn't work out for you. In fact it made it worse or made it worse for you? You understand what I'm asking?</p>

<p> PATIENT: Yeah, with him, exactly with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay. What happened.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When was this-like August, last year, in 2005. He sends me an e-mail telling me that I should apply to schools. And I was like, "Yeah, I'm applying." But not for this year. For last year. And I went to his office and I told him, "Yeah, I want to apply to schools. But I want to apply for 2006." And he-and I told him, "I'm preparing my exams and stuff like that." And he's like, "Well, you're not good enough. And you will never make it into any school. You're not as good as Asian students or-" so he started pulling all the application packages he was reviewing, or he had reviewed a year before. </p>

<p>He's like, "Look, your GPA not half as good as this one. Look your GRE is not half as good as this one. Your classes are not as good as these people. So you're no one. No one is going to accept you. What do you think you're doing?" He was so mean that they-it's like-I was like, "Okay. You could have told me 'No. You have to do it first.' (ph)" But he was humiliating me. Really bad. I have never felt like that. I was like-trying to run away from his office because I was going to start crying in front of him. I was like, "This is too much." Because I told him I wanted to apply for 2006 and he made a huge deal about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so, because you didn't want to apply when he wanted you to apply. [0:20:48.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He wanted me to apply for 2007. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay-oh, so you were applying earlier than what he-okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: He was yelling like a monster. I remember that day, it is like the worst day of my life, here. Because he told me, you're not good. And I'm the same person I was a year ago. I don't think - a year and a half ago-I don't think. I mean, my GRE scores they went up by 20 points. Nothing else. TOEFL, the same thing. Everything was the same thing. It's just that-he just didn't want me-didn't want. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so you didn't apply. [0:21:28.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You waited until...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I apply-I waited for another year. Like I was-I was looking for a different job. I talked to some professor-Portuguese professors that work in different universities here. And they're like, "Marta, you have to put up with it and work for him another year. And get his recommendation letter. That's all-I mean, you really need it." Because different from a lot of people that come from China and Korea, they're professors were classmates with professors in different universities here. They have lots of contacts. </p>

<p>But in my case, it's not like that. No one-my pro-only one of my professors came to the US. And she went to Virginia Tech. I'm not applying there. I don't have any contacts, with anyone in the United States. If they-my chances of getting into any schools were zero. And then I took the GRE and I didn't do well. So I was like, "Eh, this is it." </p>

<p>But that day was really bad. Then another day, I went to his office to show him something I did. And then-you know like to tell him this item thing, this is working. And he found two mistakes and he told me that I was sabotaging his work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, I remember you telling me that. [0:22:53.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it's like, he's crazy. I mean, you never know what to expect with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's really scary to face him, to be able to share anything with him, because you really don't know how he's going to react and-</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then one day he told me that I was handicapped. And I was like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So to avoid the humiliation and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I cannot yell at him and tell him to shut up. I can't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. (chuckles) No, you can't do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not like with your parents. That you can just turn around, and it's like, "Don't bother me! I'm going to my room!" Or you yell or whatever. With him, you just have to sit there in his office and wait for him to be tired of talking. And he's from Portugal. He's like me, he loves to talk. So he talks a lot. And humiliates people a lot. So yeah, that's why I'm scared. Because it already happened three times I think. I went to talk to him and then I ended up being like... or in lab meetings that he tells us that we're schizophrenic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, but you have to do what you feel comfortable, with doing. [0:24:11.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and once I got any acceptance letter. Ac-accept-how do you say, acceptance letter? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-hm, that's right. That's it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Letter, I will talk - I will go and talk to him, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so let's get back to if you decide to do that, how do you deal with it. Like say you come back in January, you're refreshed, he's refreshed. But you still -  a week later into the new year, you know, he's right back at it. With screaming at you or deriding on you or making these statements that make you feel, like you're less than or inadequate. How do you deal with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do with that. Have you ever dealt with someone like this before where you had to-where you couldn't really say anything about it, or do something in a situation. How have you coped with it in the past that worked for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Go to therapy. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so just being able to talk about it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that help you, be able to say, "Hey, this is what happened with my boss today." And get some of that out. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That helps. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can go to therapy, be patient, think-try to reason why the person is like that. Sometimes he has problems outside the lab. And he just goes in and yells at us. And we're not even guilty. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah so sometimes (inaudible at 0:25:53.1).</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes it's, you know, think that he's crazy. He has his own problems. He just like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Takes it out on you all. (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: On us, yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like displacing that. Where somebody outside makes you upset. You can't do anything to them, so then you go and you take it out on, you know...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's what he does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Somebody else. So for you to be able to see that, "It's not me. This is something that he's going through. And I'm just the, you know, guinea pig or whatever. Maybe it's who is on the other end of it. It's not about me personally." And maybe you keep repeating that in your head. "It's not that I'm stupid. It's not that I'm handicapped. It's not that I'm sabotaging his research. This is his own stuff. As long as I keep that in my mind, this isn't' really about me."</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like, yeah. And like what we said that last time. Every time he said-yells or something. I'm just going to send back and e-mail saying, "You shouldn't yell at me." Or "You shouldn't tell me this or that." You know like, "I'm really sensitive. Don't treat me like that." I told you that I sent you an e-mail once when he told me I was sabotaging. I told him, "I really appreciate being here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I can't remember-how did he respond to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, he said, "I'm sorry." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He sent an e-mail saying like that, back saying, "I'm sorry." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So maybe as they come, you can shoot out those e-mails and he'll continue to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Apologize or maybe. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I think, sometimes it's easier with an e-mail. Instead of going to his office and-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you're face-to-face.</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Facing him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, so sometimes I- [0:27:41.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is what I was thinking of last week. Maybe if you didn't even talk with him face-to-face, maybe a letter. And even if, this is something that we talked about last week too. Even if you don't give him the letter. But if you-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just write it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just write it. Whatever you would. If you could, say this is acceptance day letters and that sort of thing, and you know, know I'm going to talk to him. This is what I would say if I had nothing to lose. Right? Just write that out. You don't have to give it to him or mail it to him. But just for you to be able to get that off your chest and to kind of, put that out there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've done that before. With my ex-boyfriend. I think, I tried to break up with him three times. And the three letters, I sent them to his house. And then I have to go there and pick them up. It's like, "Run over me!" </p>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. This was in Portugal. And it happened-two times, the three times I sent it in the mail. And I had to go there and pick it up. The other time I just kept it in my notebook or something. Yeah, you know, it works. It worked before, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so this isn't something new that you probably have dealt with. So use what has worked for you in the past. Because you have the answers, Marta. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's just about getting in touch with what has worked for you before. And it's helped you feel better, feel good or not. You don't take things to heart or affects (inaudible at 0:29:25.1). </p>

<p>PATIENT: So, I'll just do that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What time is it? 1:36 (ph), okay. So I just want to ask you. Do you have any thoughts, or what are your feelings, about my leaving or not being able to see you, after next week. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What is what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What comes up for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just. (laughs) I just think that I have to go back, again. (cries) Say... all that . You know, go back and say all my life again. The sad stories, but. I have done it a couple of times before, so. But does she get to hear what we record or not?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I don't have to go back and tell her everything again?</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm -she may have questions about it. About what I write in my report or, you know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But it's not that we're starting, starting from zero. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't believe so. She'll have the report. And if she wants to listen to the tapes, she can do that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, okay. [0:30:54.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We haven't talked about the specific details of, if she can really pick up where we left off. She may have questions or she might ask you about the past and things. But I can see how that could be-well let me ask you. What is it about going back over the sad stories and things and looking-as that being a possibility. What comes up for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't know. I just think it's, eh. I don't know. Well I just think that... it's not fun to have to go back again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And say everything again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You've shared a lot with me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Since we've been talking, right, and so I can see how that would (inaudible at 0:32:10.8). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And the one thing I was thinking about Marta, is I have no (inaudible at 0:32:19.4 .) I have a whole lot about you. A lot of what you've shared. One thing that I've gathered is that it seems like you have experienced a lot of loss, in your young life. Right? And, some clients may experience transfers, a transfer from one therapist to another as a loss as well. And so as we're talking about, even like with you boss saying things that really want to say but may not know how. I want to be able to give you the opportunity while I'm here, in your face. And for this week, next week if there's' anything you would like to say to me. </p>

<p>I want to open that space because it seems like with the different losses in your life, you may not have always gotten that opportunity. We talked about your previous therapist and how you didn't go to the funeral. You didn't know that she was dying and these sorts of things And there are things that maybe you would've wanted to say to her that you didn't get a chance to. </p>

<p>People come and go, out of our life all the time, whether it's because of tragedy or because of good tings or just circumstance or we move on. You know, whatever the case. So I want to be able to give you the opportunity to say whatever, you may want to say, to me. Positive, negative. You know. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't have anything negative to say. (cries)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even if you did, that's okay. You know. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't have anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just like. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it feel with me asking you that. Or opening that door. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Normal? I don't know. [0:34:56.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What are you thinking?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't know. It's just like... no. It's what you say. So many come and go. I don't know. And everyone I know in Whitehall is-is leaving. Or will leave next summer. So I really, I mean. It's like all the - when I came here, all the friends I had. They're all leaving or they already left. Two of them already left and now I have three more that-four more that are leaving in the summer. So I don't know if it's going to keep being like this all, you know like, all the time that I'm going to be here? Because it's like the same thing. </p>

<p>It's annoying again, to have and make friends. You don't really put a lot of effort into making new friends and then they leave. And you have to put again, all this big effort, to make new friends. So it's like just-it's quite weird. People don't move that much. In Portugal, people don't-I see here, and people is like, "Oh yeah, I got an offer like in Texas." You know a job offer. And they all leave and move around the country. </p>

<p>So this is not normal in Portugal. Yeah, people go outside and study. But you have-everyone stays in the same city, in the same house. You go to college in the same city. Everything is the same, so I think that's been hard for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. [0:37:24.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like all this... All this moving. Yeah, people come and go every day. And you don't even really know what, where you're going. Yeah. I don't know. I think it's hard. And I was talking to my dad on the phone. And he's like-we were talking about this. How people here move and then you're lonely-no, then you're alone and you feel lonely. And I was telling him this, and he's like, "Yes! The thing is that young people in Portugal are very independent-dependent, like they depend on their parents. They always have the same friends." </p>

<p>And it's true. I have my friends since I was ten years old, or nine years old. So then we went to high school and we went to different colleges or whatever. But we kept living in the same city, doing the same things. Seeing each other, once or twice a week. So it's like, I was talking to him about that. About this. We are very-we depend on a lot of people. And here - and then I come here, it's like... Yeah. Everyone goes and... but oh well. (cries) [0:39:03.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That has to be tough. Talk about culture shock, huh? </p>

<p>PATIENT: (cries) And I was thinking that, when I was sick. The thing-during the weekend. I was thinking why I was having this cultural shock, right now. And I've been here for almost two years, and I've never had it. Then I realized, well, I got here and I made all these friends. And they were all here. And six months ago, they all started leaving. And I broke up with Jose, which was like... When you're dating someone from your own country, it's... you still feel that you're at home. And you have so many thing sin common that you don't have to explain. You don't have the language barrier. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure. [0:40:11.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you kind of don't understand that. And my problem is that I started dating him, after 7 days of being in Whitehall. So I was never by myself. I never-I don't think I ever. I think everybody goes through the cultural shock. But they do it at t the beginning. I just like-this is delayed one. </p>

<p>Because I - I had all these Portuguese friends. I also had all my friends from school here. I had him. So, I think that it's-I'm a little lonely now, so. And it's hard to learn to be by yourself. All the time. For us, because we're used to never being by ourselves. But oh well, I think. </p>

<p>Yeah, it's like- it's really funny because I realized everybody is like, "Oh! I would never be able to live with my parents." I was like, "I'm still with them." (laughs) "I want to live with them." And I - we have a lot of problems, but I just it's-I need to learn how to be okay. If I'm alone. But oh well. </p>

<p>I'll just learn. I just think-yeah, what I told you. I never went through this before because I was attached to a lot of stuff. So. So in the same way I think about making new friends, "Oh. It sucks. I don't want to." Is the same thing about when you tell me, "You have a new therapist." I'm like, "Uh, I don't want. I don't want to tell someone again all my life." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you put a lot of energy and effort into that. You shared a lot. A lot of your story-</p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It sucks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of yourself. [0:42:38.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But oh well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what is so, I think, amazing about you, Marta. Is that despite, you know, the feeling that comes up when you have to separate from people or separate from you, for you to still be so giving of yourself and your story. And the amount of energy and effort that you put into that, I think, is truly, truly awesome. And it helps build relationships and these sorts of things. </p>

<p>So, I'm looking forward, I think, like I said, the therapist that I have lined up for you. I think it'll be a great fit. Because she's very open. And hopefully you will find it less challenging to, be able to open up with her and talk with her about. Because you have a great story. You do. And although there's some sadness in that. You also told me about some really fun times. And some great things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I mean. I cannot complain. I had a really good life. I mean, my life is right now. It's hard but-wait. I compare myself to other people and they're really in need. I'm like, "Oh my God. I'm so lucky. I'm just crying for stupid stuff." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's not-I mean, you can't say it is stupid stuff. </p>

<p>(crosstalk)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No but it's just - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just your stuff. Marta, it's your life. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it's my life. [0:44:28.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: People have different variants of, things that happen in their life. So if it makes you cry, it makes you tear-then it makes you cry, it makes you tear. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, but I mean. Yeah. But I don't think-you know, I cannot complain. It's been good. And it's good. I could be in Portugal without-complaining about my boss. That would be worse. Not, not even having the opportunity to go to grad school. That would be worse than being here and complaining about the crazy guy. So yeah. So it's bad, eh-not that bad. It could be worse. Always could be worse. Okay. I have to leave. It's almost 2:00. [0:45:37.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Well. Next week, same time. And before we get started-her name is Julia.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Julia. Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so I'm going to bring Julia . And she'll probably be able to join us for the first part of the session. If you have questions -  and you can even ask her. [It doesn't have to start.] (ph) I'll be able to answer them. And we can talk more about that. But yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I definitely enjoyed working with you. And...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I said, between now and next week. If anything comes up, questions you have or things you want to say. You can definitely bring those to the session, next week. Okay, so next week I guess, will probably be our last session. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Tuesday. I can come on the 12th. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So if you wanted to come on that Monday, we could have...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before going home. My boss not going-my boss is leaving on the 12th. So. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay, so we'll meet Thursday. And then we'll have a final meet on the 12th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [0:46:47.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can-Can I - I always forget. I think I don't forget them, but I always forget about, your clinic. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The clinic?</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So—- actually I should start today. There's an issue with Blue Cross, not with you specifically but with me specifically. Blue Cross terminated me as a provider on March 23rd of this year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good question. I think the problem is—- and I've been on the phone seven or eight hours this week—- it looked at first like it was partly on my end, but now it's pretty clear it's on their end. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So psychologists like me, I think, as well as other providers for them, have to re-credential with them every two years which just means going onto a website and saying "Yes, my practice is still in the same location and no, no one has tried to sue me in the last two years," you know, stuff like that. </p>

<p>[00:59.4]</p>

<p>So that's supposed to be every two years. The last time I did it was in August of 2010, which is not two years ago. But they terminated me for not having re-credentialed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they—- what happened is they moved up my re-credentialing date without telling me, by five months. Then they said "But we sent you a certified letter in March saying that you had to re-credential or you are going to be terminated." That's where I thought that a part of it was my fault. I was thinking geez, I try not to miss things but everyone makes mistakes, and maybe I got the letter and blew it off or something. And they said "Look, we have your signature on the receipt for the letter, so you signed for it. That's why we send them certified, to make sure you get it." </p>

<p>[01:58.2]</p>

<p>I said "Okay, you're probably right. I wouldn't have thought I'd do that, but maybe I did. But for my peace of mind, could you just send the receipt that has my signature because I'd like to see it." So they sent me the receipt and it doesn't have my signature, and it was not delivered to my address. You can tell from the way the receipt looks that it was signed by somebody else, and there's a stamp saying it was not delivered to the address it was supposed to be delivered to. It was delivered somewhere else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Fantastic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So I was never notified about the change and really couldn't have done anything. I could have pre-emptively updated my information, which they like you to do, but it's certainly not their policy to do that. So it's really on their end and not mine. I said "Look, I think this is on your end. I'm happy to be reinstated and make like this didn't happen. I could effectively lose my patients, but it's really up to you." They said "No, no, we've been looking into this a lot and you know, we're not going to do that." </p>

<p>[03:06.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've heard my parents complain about insurance companies all my life.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what does it imply?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. So I think you're currently on the HMO and require an in-network provider. However, often in cases like when somebody leaves the network—- I was planning on leaving the network at the end of the year anyway. I thought about doing it in the fall, but I was going to switch it to the end of the year anyway. So I know that what I have to do is submit what's called an out-of-network request for you to get you grandfathered to be able to see me because I used to be in-network, but I'm not anymore. I've already submitted that. Like in the middle of all this, I figured I didn't want to wait on that. So I've already submitted that. I sent a letter explaining what's happened, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them about it. </p>

<p>[04:08.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Just keep me posted.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I will. Yes, I will certainly keep you posted on what I hear. I know that The university offers Blue Cross plans that allow you to see somebody out-of-network, and I know those typically don't cost a lot more. Like if you switch to, it's probably called a Blue Choice plan or a PPO plan or a POS plan—- I mean, I see other employees of the university who have plans like that where they can see somebody out-of-network. Often you'd need to switch—- I mean, you probably know more about this than me—- but just what I hear from people is that you often have to wait for an open enrollment period to switch, which I think for most people is in December, although I think there are exceptions to that. I don't know how that works.</p>

<p>[05:07.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, well, I can look into that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, if there's anything I can do, I'm happy to help you work it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I should do that in case this whole trying to grandfather me in doesn't work?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can do it any way you want. You can wait until I hear back—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I can start looking into it in the meantime.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- start looking into it in the meantime.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever you want to do. I submitted all the forms on Monday, and actually one of your pieces of paper didn't go through correctly which they told me about today. So I sent it back and it went through fine. So it should be within a week or two from today. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. But in the meantime, can I still come in for sessions or do I have to wait?</p>

<p>[06:02.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My inclination would be like—- how about this. You know, we're talking about a couple of weeks. Keep coming. If it winds up that they don't cover it, we'll work something out that you can reasonably afford. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can pay me in a timeframe that is reasonable for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. That sounds good. That's good with me, and we'll figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my feeling at first with this is that when it looked like I had blown off the letter from Blue Cross, I was feeling pretty responsible for taking a hit financially—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: If you needed to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- if I needed to. But where it really wasn't my fault in any way—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then why should you have to?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. Why should I have to for Blue Cross' sake? So, you know, that said, frankly I don't want to sound like a dick about it. (laughter)</p>

<p>[07:05.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) No, we'll work it out. I'll talk to my parents anyway, and if need be they'll help me because they understand that this shit sucks. I'm sure it's happened to them plenty of times and they've had to take hits, so they'll understand and it will be fine. I'm not too worried. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, no I'm not. Okay, sounds good. So just keep me posted. Meanwhile, I'll look into other options with my health plan, just to kind of have a back-up plan, and that's great.</p>

<p>So I'm actually across the street at the Center for Communications, taking an all-day training that is cutting a little bit into the overage of lunch, but I told them I had [to come]. It was sent to me by the union as a pilot—- like you had to do a survey to be entered into the lottery to be selected for this pilot course on supervisory skills training.</p>

<p>[08:03.8]</p>

<p>The union and the Center for Communications are working together jointly, because there's nothing really in place right now for an overall supervisors' training for non-exempt employees. So there's that kind of gray area where you're responsible for managing this person and giving them duties, but you're not responsible for disciplining them, for hiring them, for firing them. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. So like they don't report to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they report. Well, in some cases, no. It's like a whole mix of people. I've honestly seen like the person who is most directly—- she's like "This is my role. I supervise this person. They assist me." And everybody else is like "I don't know. I have students. It's weird."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, anyway, there's nothing in place and they're doing this pilot thing, and I was chosen. End of story. (inaudible at 08:56.3) Diet Coke, complimentary. Did I tell you that I started Weight Watchers again?</p>

<p>[09:04.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, so I did Weight Watchers in 2010, lost 20 pounds, great. Gained a bunch back. I don't even know, whatever, it doesn't matter. It was four years ago. And I've kind of like been loosely doing it because I became a lifetime member because I was at my goal weight and I maintained my goal weight for a certain amount of time. So a lifetime member, you can go weigh in if you're at your goal weight, whatever. </p>

<p>So anyway, I knew all the tricks of the trade and I had this free app I was using. Apparently that wasn't enough motivation to actually do it. So I decided to buy a three-month online subscription so that I could actually have the mobile app for Weight Watchers that has all the food lists and all that stuff. I've really been successful at it in the past. </p>

<p>So anyway, this is week three and I've already lost seven-and-a-half pounds which feels really good and is a great way to kind of kick-start myself back into working out. I did not lose any weight this week, but I'm choosing to be okay with that. (chuckles) I mean, whatever.</p>

<p>[10:02.2]</p>

<p>But I've been doing really well, and it feels really good. I think it's been hard to—- I really like to eat and I really like macaroni and cheese, so that's been difficult but definitely worth it. I think Franklin (ph) has been disappointed because, like for instance, last night we went out to see my friend from work's boyfriend play. He's in a band and he plays the saxophone. </p>

<p>We went to go see him play, and we had some dinner. It was already late but we were hungry, so we had some dinner. I didn't want to have any drinks because then I'd be over my points because I already ate my points. (chuckles) And I think for Franklin (ph) it was a little bit like—- because he wanted a drink, so he had to drink alone and it was not so fun. On the weekend mornings, I'd like some cereal with blueberries and he wants to be cooking eggs and pancakes and ham or whatever. So there's the trade-off.</p>

<p>[10:59.8]</p>

<p>I was very straight-up with him. I was like "Listen, I know it's fun to eat meals together and whatever, but tough." (chuckles) Like right now we can eat one a week maybe and that will be good, and the rest will be brown rice and grilled tilapia. But it feels good. </p>

<p>My mom has actually been doing Weight Watchers for a while, and she lost 40 pounds and then stopped when Michael moved home and was kind of living with her and not getting a job and all this stuff. She hasn't really been doing it anymore, and I'm hoping that I might be able to motivate her to see that I've lost weight and to get back on it because she really needs to lose weight. Yeah, but it feels good.</p>

<p>And speaking of last night also, I got really irritated with Franklin (ph), and I don't know if this is fair or not. Well, like I have an issue with how much he drinks, and it's just a constant thing that I'm trying to figure out how to work with, right? He knows, and I've talked to him about drinking less and he wants to and all this stuff. </p>

<p>[12:08.1]</p>

<p>But anyway, we were going to go out and meet them. He had two beers before we left the house. I rarely drink beer. It makes me feel—- whatever. But he had two beers. Then we went and he had two [inaudible]. That's like his favorite drink. He loves it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like rum or something and gingerale. It's basically rum and ginger beer and that's it. And for some reason, the rum was so strong or something that it made his breath smell so bad. I literally couldn't even talk to him, and I felt really bad because I kept leaning away. He's like "What, does my breath stink a little?" I was just like "Well, that rum smell is really strong and it's bothering me." Then I felt bad, but then he understood and didn't seem to feel too bad about it.</p>

<p>[12:58.8]</p>

<p>Like I was annoyed at being annoyed by it. Or I don't know. I guess maybe it also made me think gosh, do other people—- like, is it just me? Am I hypersensitive to the smell? Like I am hypersensitive to smell in general, but am I just hypersensitive to this because of him and, I don't know, maybe talking more closely with me. Maybe it has to do with me not liking the smell of alcohol. I don't know. But it really bothered me. </p>

<p>Like it was literally like as soon as we got home, I was like "Go brush your teeth." He's like "Immediately?" I don't know. Maybe it's petty. But it wasn't a big deal. It wasn't like he was offended by it. I wasn't offensive in telling him. And I don't think it was like "It smells so bad, are you drunk?" It wasn't that kind of drunk breath. It wasn't drunk breath, it wasn't like that. It was just not pleasant, I guess. Whatever. I guess it's not a huge issue. </p>

<p>[14:02.0]</p>

<p>I think I addressed it well, actually, which I feel good about. But there's something else. So he had told me that he messaged with—- okay, wait, back up. So I told him how I didn't like him liking pictures. Like when we had our conversation, I told him "I don't like you liking pictures of girls on Facebook that are random because it makes me feel uncomfortable and it's unnecessary." He said "I won't do it anymore." </p>

<p>There was this one particular girl, Betty Golstein, so she's obviously a Jew. So he liked some picture that she was super-cleavagey in. I don't think on purpose, whatever. It doesn't matter. So I said "For example, that random girl, I don't know who she is or how you know her. I don't know who she is. But I felt uncomfortable." He said "Well, she has only two or three pictures up and she liked all of these pictures of me doing photography stuff, so I felt like liking them in return." And so that sprung up a conversation about how that's not necessary. If somebody likes your picture, let them like it. You don't have to go and like theirs. </p>

<p>[15:03.5]</p>

<p>So then he tells me that she messages him, because I guess she's the ex-girlfriend of this friend of Franklin's (ph), this other guy, who moved out of the apartment he was living in with this girl and needed a place to stay for a week and stayed at our house last summer. There was some issue with him and the girl and money—- the friend of ours, the girl, and money. </p>

<p>So I guess Franklin (ph) said that she messages Franklin (ph) to say "Hey, you know, I just want to ask if he really did stay with you last summer because we're having some money issues, and I'm not sure if he's trying to screw me out of money." So he told me about this interaction, and when he told me I was like "Oh, that sucks for her" or whatever.</p>

<p>But then I see last night that they're texting, and it's like saved in his phone with her name. Or maybe it's—- no, it's saved in the phone with the name. He has his number on Facebook still and he's already talked about how he needs to take it down, which he can do in two seconds but he hasn't yet.</p>

<p>[15:57.4]</p>

<p>I have really, in the past like nine months really, stepped back from trying to check his phone, trying to do any of that, trying to be nosy about who he's talking to, because it's either a frustrating conversation, one of us gets defensive, whatever it is. But last night I—- whatever. I said "Oh, when did you start texting with her?" or chatting with her or something like that. He was kind of like—- not defensive, but it was very much like "I don't know. She just texted me. I don't know. I don't know. I didn't just start texting her. I don't know. I don't even know." That was kind of how it went. So I just really didn't say anything. </p>

<p>He was texting her like a couple more times, and first it was irritating because of that super-big response. Like he really could've just said "Oh, she started texting me because my number is on Facebook, and I've just been responding." Like that would have been acceptable. </p>

<p>[17:02.5]</p>

<p>First of all, that bothered me. Second of all, he's texting with her while we're at this thing. I'm like "I'm not on my phone. Maybe you're bored, maybe you're uncomfortable because Betty (ph) and Anita (ph) are here—-" Betty (ph) is the girl whose boyfriend was playing—- "and we're speaking a little bit of Spanish and whatever, but you don't need to be texting."</p>

<p>Second of all, a text comes up and I happen to look over in his direction and I see that he makes a face, like checks the message and clicks back quickly. So I don't know if it's—- and so that automatically made me think like well, did she say something that he just wanted to pretend that he was confused about or thought was dumb, but he really didn't want me to see? Because he'd been responding the whole time, and then all of a sudden it's just like back-back-back. I don't really want to press the issue again since I already just asked a little while ago and it was awkward. </p>

<p>[17:57.9]</p>

<p>But it is a little bit unnerving because like what do you—- first of all, it's again the same scene that I've struggled with through this entire relationship, which is why do you have to be talking to so many girls? Like why are the majority of people you talk to, whether it's Facebook or texting, are females? The majority of which are single females. I don't know. I'm not sure how to feel about it, you know? </p>

<p>And because we've had the discussion so many times in which he's assured me that they're just friends, and he's just a friendly guy, and he just responds when people text him, and he doesn't want to be rude, and as much as I want to believe him that that's the case, I don't—- it still makes me feel uncomfortable. I guess let's put it that way. It still makes me wonder why. Like why? Like what kind of conversation did you have with this person at 10:30 on a Thursday night, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>[19:05.6]</p>

<p>And girl—- honestly, at our age, I feel that a girl who is single isn't necessarily going to—- if a guy is responding to her, whether or not he has a girlfriend, if he's responding to her text messages and being attentive and talking to her, I don't think her first reaction is going to be "What a nice guy. His girlfriend is so lucky." It's going to be "Wow, I really like this attention. Let's see where this is going." </p>

<p>So I'm not really sure how to reconcile this with all the good things that have been going on since we kind of got over this little hump and pushed the reset button, and we have been so lovey-dovey and enjoying each other's time and dealing with conflict better than we have been and kind of communicating better. </p>

<p>[20:02.5]</p>

<p>I don't really know how to reconcile my feelings of doubt and a little bit of mistrust with what else is going on and how he's expressing himself to me. So that's kind of what I've been thinking about since yesterday. And I've thought about it a little bit, in terms of everything that has been going on and how he does still chat with so many different people. But I think it was just more in the forefront, just noticing how many people he's still texting and talking to that I don't know and that don't know me. That they don't necessarily talk about our relationship, you know? And I'm not really sure what to think. (pause)</p>

<p>[21:00.3]</p>

<p>And I know it's not because he's not getting enough attention from me. Like he's getting plenty of attention. There's no—- I can't see him being "Oh, I need to reach out to other girls for girl talk." (chuckles) I don't know. That's not it. (chuckles) It's kind of a perplexing one at this moment. (pause)</p>

<p>I mean, he's even told me before that he has felt guilty at times for sometimes reaching out to others, whether it's girls or guys, for support and advice when he should be reaching out to me. But, okay, he recognized that. I said "We talked about it and you said you didn't want to do it anymore, and I told you I'm here for whatever you need. If you do want to talk to your friends, that's fine but don't talk to people because you think you can't talk to me."</p>

<p>[22:01.0]</p>

<p>So we have that whole thing. But again, I don't know what I'm supposed to think about it and if I should investigate or just let it be. That's what I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I guess that's what you're asking me about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit. I think I'm asking—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) The universe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The universe. Right. (chuckles) Because I've been in the whole checking-the-phone thing, and I don't want to do that. It's so stupid. I don't even have the time to like do that and misread or misinterpret whatever, or see how many girls he is arbitrarily texting and be upset by the sheer number, even if it is just like "Hey, how are you doing? I ate a popsicle today. It was good and cold." (pause) I don't know. I mean, I know what my friends would say.</p>

<p>[23:01.8]</p>

<p>They'd be like "What the hell? Why is he fucking texting people? Are you serious? You're not texting guys. What the hell is he thinking? No, that's unacceptable. You need to find out who it is and what they're talking about." That's exactly what all my friends would say. I'm sure of it. Or "That's not right. He can't do that to you." But I'm not sure if that's the situation. (pause) I really can't—- I don't know. I don't know. Because I don't have anybody, same sex or opposite, that Franklin (ph) doesn't know or doesn't know about or whatever, that I will have an hour-long text conversation with. Like even my girlfriends. It's like we're texting about a plan or like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's more kind of like logistics and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Or like saying something real quick to them, or sending a picture or something. Yeah.</p>

<p>[24:03.4]</p>

<p>Okay, I just remembered something I saw last week. So I went into my phone bill because we were looking on how to upgrade our phone. I looked at usage, and I used to have the habit of going into usage, going to his text messages, seeing all the numbers, and looking for the ones I knew were girls that I didn't feel were appropriate for him to talk to. That was an issue. I didn't do that—- I don't do that anymore. Literally for a while I was like calling these numbers and seeing who picked up and being like "Oh, is this so-and-so?" and they'd be like "No, this is so-and-so." Not healthy. And I told him about it and we talked about this whole thing.</p>

<p>So I'm going into check usage because we had a higher bill than—- no. Well, whatever the reason was. And he had literally like triple the number of texts and picture messages that were sent and received than I did. Like even received. Lots of received. Like pictures.</p>

<p>[24:58.3]</p>

<p>So I said to him like "Babe, what's up? Are you sending lots of pictures back and forth? You have like 900. What's the deal?" He's like "I don't even know. Just mine?" and I'm like "Yeah." He's like "I don't even know what that could be from." I'm like "Me neither, that's why I asked." (chuckles) It wasn't running up the bill, it was just kind of like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: "What's up?"</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like 600 picture messages received? What the fuck? Or maybe it wasn't that much, but it was a lot. His text messages were like way higher than mine too, the texts sent and received. He couldn't answer it, and the conversation dropped. I just remembered because we're talking about this. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm also going to put out there that I really don't—- I really feel confident that whatever is going on with the text messaging situation, I don't believe he's going out and meeting up with—- well, who knows when I'm not around, but the times when I'm in town, weekdays, weekends, whatever, we're together too much for him to have time to do anything. (chuckles) </p>

<p>[26:10.7]</p>

<p>So I'm not feeling like he's cheating on me and that's what these are. It's just a little curious. Like why so many texts? Why so many girls? Why so many pictures? Why this random girl now? Like you may be a nice person, but just because you're a nice person doesn't mean you have to like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does sound like maybe you're doing things again a little bit where you don't want to have the more critical view. Like you kind of give it to your friends a little bit, or in a way you're looking for a little reassurance from me like "Well, you know, this is just—- how can he be sending that many text messages and even if he's not, you know, screwing around with anybody, this is inappropriate and he really shouldn't be doing it."</p>

<p>[26:58.7]</p>

<p>Something that like makes you feel—- I guess we've talked about sort of there being two reasons for your wanting it to be that way. One of which is that it sort of creates conflict in the relationship if you feel critical. And I guess the second is that it just helps you feel more confident about the things you feel critical of, because you're not so sure how to see the situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. For sure. I think in this situation also there's definitely a kind of "What if I'm right?" kind of thing. Like what if there is something to be suspicious about?</p>

<p>[28:00.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I guess in a way it's like you don't really want either half of that. You certainly don't want to be right. You also don't want to be wrong either.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Right. Right. And every other time I've brought it up, it's like I've ended up wrong. Like I've misinterpreted something or—- but—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think part of what it is, based mostly on what we've talked about before, if you're factually wrong I think you tend to feel emotionally wrong. In other words, if he says "No, I'm going to read you 15 of—- pick 15 text messages at random and read them. You'll see there's nothing to be worried about, blah blah blah, so you're wrong." I think you kind of wind up feeling as though you didn't have a right to be upset or to bring it up in the first place. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Similar to my friend talking about my friends in that situation. Absolutely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>[28:58.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure why that is in that—- I mean, if it's enough to upset you, it's enough to upset you. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I don't want it to feel like—- I don't want him to feel like he can't have friends. But I also—- I don't know. But I also don't want him to feel like these girls are his friends just because they're texting him day and night and they never hang out and they never—- you know what I mean? Because there's something else going on there then, I would think. Like what void is that filling for you, or like what is this doing for you? Like when I've tried to address that in the past, like say that, he's kind of looked at me like I'm crazy, like "What do you mean what is it doing for me? Like I don't know, I just respond." </p>

<p>[29:58.2]</p>

<p>And like even one time when there was a text from some girl that we've had issues with, because she talked inappropriately to Franklin (ph) and I saw the message, and then I told him to stop texting her and he told her "You can't talk to me that way," then I found a text the next day where she was like "Sorry, I was drunk" and he's like "Oh, it's okay." </p>

<p>And then I found months later a picture that she had sent, like "new hair." And he was like "I actually like—-" and I was like "Wait, you're talking to her? Like I thought you stopped talking to her." He was like "Yeah, I actually left that out because she just randomly texted me and I haven't talked to her for months, but I left that out because I wanted to see if you would go through my phone and see that text and accuse me of still talking to her." Sounds a little convenient, right? </p>

<p>But again, then I have that doubt like maybe that's true and then I'm the asshole who's checking his phone, you know? But I mean, he's talking all this stuff about how he wants to get married, and he's so happy things are better, and how he's so excited about everything we're planning and doing and bettering ourselves and da da da. Like that's great for him that—-</p>

<p>[31:07.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't understand. I guess it seems pretty clear to me that one reason he could be doing this is he likes attention.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But you haven't mentioned that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. I've sort of been saying gosh, I keep thinking I wonder if it's just the attention and then I think why (voices overlapping)—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm surprised I didn't say that. No, that's interesting. I'm surprised I didn't say that because I've said that to my friends in these conversations before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like maybe he just needs the attention. I don't need that kind of attention, and this is how he gets that kind of attention. So I definitely do—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. Yeah, yeah. For some reason (inaudible at 31:52.0). I mean, yeah, you said before there was something about looking for support, although that hasn't sounded like what it feels like now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, there's like—- I think it is—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But who knows. This is him.</p>

<p>[32:03.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. There's definitely an attention thing going on. I guess I'm just not sure why, and I guess I just don't feel like it's appropriate regardless. Like okay, the attention, big whoop. I could like the attention. I could be texting with a million dudes right now who would be telling me I'm pretty and "Oh, look at that," whatever. I don't breakdance, but you know. But I'm not.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Look at that woman who does belly dancing."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right or whatever. Like "Oh, I saw your job on Facebook." Whatever. It doesn't matter. But I don't do that. If I want attention, I'll go to my parents or my boyfriend, quite frankly. Maybe it has to do with his upbringing and not getting enough attention as a child because there were so many kids and problems, I don't know. </p>

<p>But I don't want to enter into a situation where he's so excited about wanting to get married and da da da, and now we're engaged and whatever, and I'm mistrustful still of why there's so much texting and whatever going on and why so many pictures also.</p>

<p>[33:06.6]</p>

<p>That's another thing. Like what are you doing, sending each other pictures of your cats? I don't know. I'm not sending pictures—- I don't send pictures to anybody. I don't know. Like it seems even more personal, that much more personal, especially if these are randoms that he doesn't see but he just met on Facebook, and they live across the country or I don't know what. Right? </p>

<p>So yeah, I think it's something that I can't—- it's going to have to come up because I had the thought it was squashed with the whole talking about Facebook and taking his number off, but apparently it's not because I still see him constantly checking text messages, constantly checking Facebook messages on his phone all the time. So I feel I'm going to have to figure out how to address it differently than I have in the past. </p>

<p>[33:57.3]</p>

<p>It just feels like—- it's hard because like last night I kind of tried to like address it in a way like "You had told me you had messaged about this thing. When did you guys start texting on your phone?" I totally got the brush-off from him. Like it was a total "I don't know. No I didn't" Then back-back-back. It was just totally like [I'll avoid this]. And that doesn't feel good either, you know? </p>

<p>Like just straight up, like "I don't know. She just texted me out of the blue, and you know how I am. I text back." But the fact that he didn't say made me very uncomfortable. So that's kind of what's been on my mind since last night, and he was being all lovey-dovey like "Oh, I love you so much and I can't wait to get married one day" and I was having a hard time responding because I was feeling—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're upset [about the texting]. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And he had bad breath. (chuckles) Which wasn't the biggest part, but it was really—- </p>

<p>[34:58.8]</p>

<p>So I don't know. I've got to absorb and think about it a little bit more, I think. Because I think in the past I've acted like "What the hell is this?" and I don't want that. Like I actually want to have a conversation about it so that I can either feel comfortable with it because I know what's going on. Actually, no, that would be the ideal option. (pause) </p>

<p>And yeah, just like you said, there's a part of me that's kind of like well, maybe I shouldn't even be complaining, other girls deal with cheating and this is not cheating, you know. Or maybe I'm making too big of a thing of it, you know. Maybe there's some crazy explanation that I never thought of, you know. So dealing with that kind of issue that I have with bigger things—- (pause)</p>

<p>[36:17.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess I almost feel like you're in sort of two different modes about some of these things, where in one mode you're like, at least feel like you're kind of emotional and reactive and more sort of aggressive. So like something will happen or you'll see something, and you'll jump on him for it. And then the other mode where you're sort of like, when you're not doing that, when you're sort of stepping back more, less sure of yourself, more inclined to sort of like put it out there with some other person, hear what their view is and are kind of more distant from your own feelings and frustrations about it. So it's kind of hard to sort of put these two together or something.</p>

<p>[37:14.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in one, you can kind of be as assertive as you need to be and express how you're feeling very directly, but it can feel bad to you because it feels like it can be a little impulsive and not as thoughtful. And the other one, you sort of feel too easily shut down and not so sure of yourself. Somehow, yeah, it's hard to put these things together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did a good job of it, I mean, in terms of the big relationship talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so we've got—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm not saying this is something you haven't done work on (voices overlapping).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I think I just want to continue that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that took so much effort and time and thought and kind of planning, and kind of scripting almost, I'm kind of like oh God, I don't want to do this whole thing again. That's kind of why I was thinking I don't even want to deal with these girls.</p>

<p>[38:20.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I just dealt with that, and especially if I use—- like do I really have to deal with the relationship talk again right now? That I have to do something that maybe bothered me, but maybe he'll get defensive about, and maybe he'll say that I'm wrong, and maybe he'll convince me that blah blah blah, but maybe he's lying. And that's tiring. (chuckles) </p>

<p>I'm just not ready to deal with it yet. So, you know, that happened and I'm filing it away and seeing the text message, like how many were sent, and filing that away. Maybe it was an abnormal month. I don't know. Maybe he was sending people pictures from—- I don't know. And then kind of move forward from there.</p>

<p>[39:06.3]</p>

<p>Yeah, because I'm not—- I don't want to address anything right now. I'll just kind of observe. I just don't want to enter into a marriage or a long-term relationship in which I am constantly like well, I don't want to check his phone because I don't want to be that kind of girl, but really I don't want to check his phone because I don't want to see what's there. And that, I think, is something that I am having those fears about right now. </p>

<p>Like what if I hadn't gone back and what if there was something like "You're really sexy" and that's why he quickly backed up his—- you know? And like I think of what I would say to somebody. Like if I were texting with a friend and he went over the line and said "Oh my God, you're so beautiful and I would love to kiss you" or whatever. Like automatically my response in my head is like "Well, gee thanks, my boyfriend thinks so too," or something like that. But I'm not so sure that he would respond that way. All the little things like—- so yeah, there's some stuff still.</p>

<p>[40:08.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's okay that there's stuff still. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you do have this idea like I sort of know better, or that I would have advice, or that I could have some thoughts about what you should do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, I think I do. There is a sense of authority that I feel. I think I've always felt that coming into therapy, and maybe that has to do with my very very early experiences with therapy where—- well, I don't know. My first therapy experience was when I was eight years old. She would feed me soda and candy bars, let me play with Barbies, and ask me questions while I sat on the floor, about how I felt about daddy sleeping in the other room, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) [Who was she?]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh God, I don't remember. Her office was by the Reservoir, in her house. She was good. I forget her name. She was good. I really loved her. I actually saw her for a couple of years. I mean, maybe I loved her because of the Barbies and the candy.</p>

<p>[41:16.5]</p>

<p>I don't know. But she was a nice woman. But yeah, I think that I do have this kind of like—- and maybe it also has to do with my parents and them always kind of taking that, because they were my parents but they were also counselors, that they were able to give me advice or say "That really shouldn't be happening. This is how you should react." And I think it was their profession mixed with their parenting that created that result. Where it was like professional parental advice almost. (chuckles) So maybe that's why I have that inherent—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 41:53.2) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I'm going to go to my therapist, and we're going to figure it out, because he knows stuff that I don't, obviously, or else I wouldn't be in this chair. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yes and no. I guess part of the question is what kind of stuff?</p>

<p>[42:10.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean, like obviously I don't expect you to be like "Well, you should go look in his phone, obviously. Like if you want to know the truth, you look for the truth." (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, but the part about it that I'm interested in has to do with how this relates to your, at times, lack of confidence. I think in a way you can do some of the same thing when you're talking to Franklin (ph) which can be really frustrating because then you feel shut down. So that's why I'm—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: —- making noise about it. We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we'll talk more next week, and I'll keep you posted of any new changes with Blue Cross.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, sounds good, and in the meantime during the week, I'll try to make a call to the health plan and see what other options there are.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright, good. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care. You too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...29-110, Interview Number 12, 1971, Therapist Dayton, Interview Number 12 with Client Number 114, 29-110, Therapist Dayton. </p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:00:29.1) </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was making a fondue dinner last Saturday, and it's weird...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You fondued your fingers?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I fondued the thumb and these two and my wrist, so I really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The pot spill?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Weird, you know. That's one of the things I have to talk about. This is really another kind of a hectic week. I don't know, like I couldn't comprehend it, you know. I really couldn't figure it out. It was like for five seconds I can't account for, you know. </p>

<p>What happened was I had two people over, two of my good friends, husband and wife, and I had a date, and so I was going to have this fondue thing, and we were all hungrier than hell. And all afternoon, like, I'd been buying stuff and, you know, we were just going to have a nice evening and we were going to watch the hockey game a little later.</p>

<p>And I had everything ready and we were all set to eat, had all the shit done, everything sitting around, and the only thing we were waiting for was the - you know, you heat it up on the stove. Okay, I heated it up and I did the same thing I did last time, I forgot it, and it got so it was smoking, the vegetable oil. 0:02:06.7 </p>

<p>So I says, "Oh, yeah, I forgot and I bet you it's smoking, and so I went back, and sure enough, it was that hot. And then I - I haven't been able to work this through, I can't figure it out. I took it off in this hand, you know, the dish, and I had the fondue pot in this hand, and I held it over the sink - and here it gets hazy - and I poured this hot fondue - the other time I let it cool though - but I poured the stuff in the pan. And then the girl's name I was with was Anne; she was in the kitchen, and my kitchen is kind of small. And I turned, and honest to God, you know, for five seconds I don't know what happened. I must have put the hot kettle where it was originally on the stove, because when we came back from the hospital she said that the thing was sitting on the stove.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The hot pot.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the one that had been on the stove.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, originally, on the stove.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. She says it was sitting there very neatly. But when I turned - I think I turned to go into the living room, and she was right beside me, and I don't know if the grease spattered or what. All I knew is I had been nervous that day and, like, my right hand was real shaky. And it was all of a sudden, like I knew I was going to spill it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was already in the fondue pot at this point.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. I was holding the fondue pot with this hand. What I can't remember is I still had both pots, like if I was trying to decide whether to pour more of it into it. And as I turned, Anne was standing right beside me, and I don't know if I knew I was going to spill it or not, but all of a sudden she darted away from me, because I think she sensed I was going to spill it. You know, it was just - it's as hot as it can get. And then I must have panicked and thought I was going to spill it, too, but then it was like I went up like this is the only way I can reconstruct it. 0:04:45.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it spilled out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The stuff came shooting out and it went all over my hand, and my first reaction was just complete calm. All I did, I dropped the pan and I jumped back, and the first thing I did, I just opened the refrigerator and stuck my hand in the ice tray, you know. And I looked at it and I said - I knew it was bad. And I stuck my hand in there, and then my first reaction was, "Well, I can't go on the ski trip," and then I thought, I says, "I don't think I did that on..." I said, "I think I did that on purpose," you know. There was something about it. It was like I knew it was going to happen and I stuck my hand in the refrigerator. And I had this funny feeling, like, did I drop it on myself? Because I had been kind of nervous. And then I said, "Did I drop it on myself because I was afraid I was going to drop it on Anne, or did I really want to throw it at her or something like this? You know, it was weird, it was just weird. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to figure out what happened, why...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, because I knew, I knew when I handled - I'd handled grease, you know. It's not like I'm a dummy around the kitchen. I've handled grease. You know, it's not like I'm a dummy around the kitchen. On Vicarage (sp?) I had French fries twice a day for 365 days. I know what I'm doing with grease. 0:06:13.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you cooked them yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, you know, this thing about like last week. Well, I mentioned, when like I stuck my hand in there and then my first thought was, you know, I says, you know, "I think I did that on purpose." Then both the girls that were over there, they just - they were trying to reassure me that it wouldn't be so bad and all this, which was just irritating to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, because you knew you had to go to the hospital?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Oh, I knew - well, the first thing we did, right, I went to the hospital and they treated it and they said that - the last time I was there - I can't go on the ski trip. I was just going to go to ride along, but no, they say that it's a huge blister here and they're going to open it on Saturday and then if it doesn't heal then we've got to do skin graft on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I couldn't shake this feeling, you know, that I had done it on purpose.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you might have done it on purpose, Johnny?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. That's why when - I think it had something to do - well, like last week when I was talking it got to the point where - I was talking about why the kids were always chasing me at home, and I answered that I had a big mouth, that this was why, and how that's one thing, but I don't know how to explain like on Saturday. Friday night I was with a different girl again, and when I came back I don't think I really wanted to be with Anne. 0:08:38.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On Saturday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I had - it was like a kind of a guilty feeling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would rather have been with the girl you were with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I didn't want to be with her either. I didn't really want to be with either one. But it was like when Anne came I was nervous and she was like, you know, just helping, you know, getting stuff ready, and she bought a bunch of stuff, but I couldn't shake this feeling, I mean, you know, being - uneasiness or guilt or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That she was there, you had invited her, but you didn't really want her to be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I was too uptight to enjoy myself really and I had feelings like - just like negative, negative kind of thoughts, and there was no reason for it, there's no real reason for it. And the only thing I can think of with the grease thing is that it maybe momentarily flashed in my brain to drop it on her and maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As a way to save yourself, you mean, or that you just purposely wanted to do it? 0:10:10.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was like maybe this is what I wanted to do, but I can't admit that to myself, that I even had that thought. And then it was right after - if that happened, then boom, you know, it came splashing down on me, you know, as though it's almost like to pay for that if I thought that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I'm just (cross talk).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To punish yourself for having that thought.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I'm concocting things or... It's like I almost have to conclude - and I'm trying to think if I conclude this. I talked to one of my friends at the bar and she said - you know, she said, "You really hate yourself," and that's what I thought too, you know, I had thought this before, but it scared the hell out of me that I hated myself to the point of really messing myself up good. I don't think I wanted to mess myself up that bad, if I did. That scared me, because that's the first time. You know, I went back and I was trying to - it was about 3:00, 4:00, when I got to sleep, was into bed. 0:12:01.1 </p>

<p>The only thing I can compare the remainder of the night to is when I had rheumatic fever when I was a little kid and my grandmother and my mother and everybody - I was in the hospital and they were sitting around me. And my grandmother kept saying, "Brace up, brace up," as though she was trying to strengthen me. and I had a 105 temperature or something really high. And I told all those people, "Don't look at me that way, I don't want you around," you know, and I started yelling at them, and then they thought I was out of my head and I knew I wasn't out of my head. </p>

<p>And I kind of had that feeling, too; I didn't want anybody around. I wanted, well, the guy, Mitch. Mitch was okay. I mean he called the hospital and didn't make a whole lot of talk. But the girls, I told Anne, I had a date with Anne last night, I said, you know, I'd just as soon never (ph) see you all around then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you were in such a vulnerable position, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, or they didn't understand that I - they dismissed the idea as ridiculous almost, that it could have been on purpose, because I couldn't shake it then after that. You know, I'd keep saying, "I wonder if - what unconsciously I was trying to do there." But they just - that's not the way people think. You know, you don't do things like that intentionally; it's an accident.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they wouldn't admit that as a possibility. How about Mitch? Did he happen to know it was a possibility?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He didn't say too much. Mitch is the kind of guy that will listen and not say too much about something most of the time, and then I didn't press it after that. I figured, you know - because I was so confused about it. But you know, what it wound up doing was really scaring me, and like I thought, well, if that's so, you know, what is to keep me like from making an idiot move in the car? It was like I wound up distrusting myself almost in regard to two different people. I know this like last...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, are you talking about being destructive to other people now? 0:14:43.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well, I can't separ - I can't figure it out. Maybe I really am. Maybe that's why, you know, I reacted so strongly. Because there was absolutely - you know, I did not get bumped. It was spattering a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your own nervousness was there a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, underneath, you know, it's like underneath.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, but that doesn't seem to be the real thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, no, because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like somehow or another you really wanted to burn Anne.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't want to admit that, because I wound up burning myself, and to admit that I did have potential to do that... And actually, some of the grease things, when they hit the floor, might have splattered on her leg so there could have been... But then why would I want to do that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think that that's what you wanted to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was irritated with her all night.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, irritated with her, or with yourself for having invited her?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought it was against her, but then I said it doesn't make sense, though. She's not - you know, she is in every way not being an ass, not making an ass out of herself. 0:16:21.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem fair to take (ph) it with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it didn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. To me, logically, there was no reason to be irritated with her. And the only reason it struck me as so weird, I guess, was because I had somehow - somehow I had a guilty feeling, because I was with somebody else last night and then here I was with her. It was almost like I had a - it was like a social convention, I needed a date, and I had asked her out for the previous Wednesday when Mitch and his wife could not make it, and then we had delayed once more, and then finally we could all get together and that didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why was she even your date? </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a good question, right? I said it was a social  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you say occasion, or obligation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Convention.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Convention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The way it came about was that I had asked her over for a fondue dinner. Then I remember, ah-ha, I talked to Mitch and Kim about coming over; I'll combine it. So we combined it with a movie on a Wednesday. But their little baby got sick, so we postponed it until Saturday, so it was actually like a hanging-over thing. But I do have a feeling, like when I go with them I always have a date. 0:18:47.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And always a different one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And always a different one. I don't think I've ever - oh, no, yeah, two years ago I did; I was dating a girl solidly back then. That's the only time you've ever seen me with a girl I think more than one (inaudible at 0:19:07.4). So I don't feel...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess what you're saying is that they expect to see you with a date.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or you want them to see you with a date.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's like some kind of - fulfilling like an image they have of me; you know, a new girl every time. Kim always chuckled about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't let them down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, almost that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you appear once without a date, that will ruin your image.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually when I'm with a date, you know, with them, I'm sure the date must get the idea that she's just an appendage, a real (inaudible at 0:20:16.2), because most of the time I'm paying attention to either Kim or Mitch and talking to them. And I'll try to include her once in a while, but most of my experiences are common to those two, and the girl has to feel outside. 0:20:30.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why do you do it all the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some of the time because I was dating a girl, like when we went to a social - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, outside at night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, Saturday night was a different thing; it came by coincidence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it was arranged for Wednesday night, though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but then we postponed until Saturday, and since I had asked Anne I said, "Okay, we'll make it Saturday." It's not really like I - I sometimes ask out girls like it's either just to be with somebody... It's like I don't have that much interest in them and then I feel bad about that. I found with Anne last night - and I'm sure I indicated something to her that I wouldn't be seeing her again for a while, too. I mean she picked that up, and actually last time we had a fairly decent time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she served a usefulness; she was your date for Mitch and Kim to see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I didn't (inaudible at 0:22:23.6) to me. Now, that wasn't then. That was even embarrassing. I get embarrassed just thinking about it. It's like a girl's got a fifth on how I assess a girl. She's got to be perfect in every category.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But no girl ever is if she...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's the same thing I do, you know, with - well, like I really explained last week, with most people, you know, I assess them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, mostly women.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, men, too. I assess you, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But you can tolerate more in men, I suspect. You can tolerate more imperfections.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think that's so. Because with women, unless I can find some area of weakness, something that bugs them more than - they're not strong in, I start feeling uncomfortable and I usually will give up rather quickly if I detect that immediately, bingo, and then detect no areas of whether uncertain or, you know... 0:24:29.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Cross talk) You've got to be stronger than a woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe because I'm so much afraid of being weaker. Yeah, I have that. It's like always a contest, you know. I guess I never thought of that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you always win. There's no contest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, how do I win when the girl is stronger? If I perceive her as stronger, she wins.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, you call her by her last name and you cast her aside in some way or another. She becomes a man. Isn't that right? Now, what happened with Sylvio?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, Sylvio, yeah, but Sylvio...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're really looking for a strong, perfect woman, but when you find one, something happens anyhow. You get turned off and fighting with her or something. But when they're not perfect, they're not worthy of you, and when they are perfect, sort of too much challenge. 0:26:29.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, that comes close, because... That thing you said, I never lose though...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, maybe it's not that you never lose, but if there is too much of a challenge you withdraw from the contest.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I've done that a hell of a lot. I've only truly felt like I've lost once, and that was with Jackie, because the only time anybody ever told me face to face without a whole lot of pressure from other sources, you know, that she didn't want to date me anymore. That, you know, just about annihilated me. That was really hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the girl who opted a couple of weeks ago to go out with some other guy and kind of got...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, no. Just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But she told you she didn't want to go out with you also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, I excused that because (inaudible at 0:28:11.3) but I didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But Jackie wasn't going out with anybody else at the time. 0:28:12.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, she was, one other guy, who she was infatuated with, but you know, she was dating other people, too. You know, I must be getting close to something, because I'm trying to keep it away and then, you know - I can't fit it together because if - if the woman is strong, it's almost like I react like a little boy, almost across the board, but if she's weak I do the same thing, too; I react like a little boy both ways... 0:30:11.7 </p>

<p>Well, like with Anne, another feeling I had last night was that it's almost impossible for me to allow myself or to let someone like me. But since I quit my job people, you know, like my friend upstairs, we're in a (inaudible at 0:30:52.1). You know, he has come down sometimes, and I know he's coming down just to make sure I'm not going off some deep end. And yet, it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes you think that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, just, you know, he before - you know, we'd get together on social occasions, like maybe once every two weeks. But now, like, sometimes he'll call up and say "Would you like to go out, you know, to eat," or something like that. Or I've got friends down from Hyde Park, you know, and usually if I'm reading or something I almost would rather read; it's like I don't want to be bothered.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean? You can't tell them no when they call? 0:31:36.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I can. Sometimes I do. Most people I can tell them. I've got this other guy I met at a bar - well, this is Jay - and he'll call a lot. But you know, a lot of times I just don't want to be bothered and I'll just, you know, think of either an excuse or I'll say I can't tonight or something like that. You know, it's like almost impossible for me to accept, you know, like feelings that somebody cared. Just, you know, it doesn't make sense, because on the one hand I ask people all the time for what shall I do and all this sort of thing, I don't want it to do that. And on the other hand, you know, it's really hard for me to believe even that anybody really cares. And I don't know, maybe it's myself, too, that... You know, I can say with my mind, like I really think I don't feel very good about myself or I even hate myself; I can say that with my mind. </p>

<p>Emotionally, I came close to believing it, you know, to feel it, on Saturday. And in a lot of ways I'm starting to think that that is a theme that is pretty constant with me in some way, shape or form, you know, but I can't picture it together now, because it's not very consistent, you know. If it's consistent, then I don't know how it's consistent. And if I do, you know, why do I? 0:34:21.2 </p>

<p>I can push it back to when I was, you know - it's like Flo; I can push it back to high school. I can push it back to grade school. And I remember that I was even teased and kidded there, or else I'd react by teasing and kidding other people, belittling them. </p>

<p>And I thought about this last week: At one point in high school I said to myself that in order to be accepted reasonably, you shouldn't belittle people; I shouldn't tease them so much. And at another point in college I said you don't always have to be a clown or a comedian.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should think of yourself as being worthy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You should be able to think of yourself as being worthy and good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, without always having to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Belittle yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, belittle or like in anything that I did it was always - you know, when I really did something well, I've done a few things well, and when I did, the smaller I was the more I just couldn't accept it. I'd just say, well, you know, or else I'd get embarrassed. I just couldn't say "Thank you." I could never say "thank you." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was like accidental that you did it well. 0:36:04.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was a fluke. It was a fluke. I can't really do that; it was a fluke. And I don't know why it is I can't - like what I'm trying to do is remember. Maybe that's not the way you do it. I can see it now in waves; I don't know that I can feel it that much. I have a - like one of the things I think I fear about therapy is feeling something. I don't want anybody seeing me feel anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have to recognize, you know, that's one of the things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, but how about you don't want yourself to see that you feel anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know myself like, I guess, feel I equate with tears, you know. I don't want anybody to see me cry. I cry, I cry maybe twice a year, but I only cry alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You even have it counted up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:37:50.9)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When, in January and June? 0:37:55.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I haven't marked those down on my calendar. But you know, when I cry I've got these weird things. There is a record by Joan Baez, and it's one of these - what are some of them? The green, green fields of home. You know, it's about a guy that's in a - about a guy in a prison, and he comes home, and I always think about going back to my home town and it always makes me sad and I sometimes cry. And in the last five years I cry about - maybe even before a lot. </p>

<p>Like I feel bad for myself, and usually I get - what my usual thing is, what I want to do is join the army and become a master sergeant like my dad and get killed. You know, I think that - like that would be a solution I think. It's like a feeling about myself that all I'm good is to be - you know, all I'm good for, really is to be like a joking, dumb sergeant, like my dad was, and yet I can't be that even, I really can't be that. And sometimes now it's this crazy thought that comes to me. It's like getting shot off the top of a cliff. I'll be walking along and for some reason that thing comes to me, getting shot off the top of a cliff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Better to die when you're on top than to let the people see that you're not on top, or if you are sitting not on top.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if it's that so much, or maybe it is, but it seems to me like - almost like since I'm no good anyway... I guess that's all it seems like; since I'm no good anyway. I remembered another thing. When I was about in ninth grade I got in a fight with this kid, and I talked about this before, but I remember a thing I said was that "You haven't been through the suffering I've been through," as though I had suffered a lot. And also, he was bending my arm and I said, "Break it off, break it off," and I really...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make me suffer more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Make me suffer more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Where the hell had I been through this suffering? I mentioned that I didn't have a father then, but that wasn't the thing I ever actually thought about, that I can remember, that I didn't have a father. So where the hell... You know, I can't... It seems to me that it's somewhere there. 0:42:41.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you not having a father is meaningful; something is in there for you. The fantasy that goes from my head is something like "Without a father I don't know how to be a boy and how am I going to learn how to be a man?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, actually I think that is what's happening. You know, why do I feel like - see, I don't even know - why do I feel like shitty about myself then? Why do I feel - why do I do things - like for what? I was set up in that job. You know, I'm going to try to get back in there. I'm going out there today to pick up my check, but I don't want to go into that now, I wouldn't even try, but, you know, why am I so afraid... 0:44:35.8 </p>

<p>Like this job I've got, it's a bitch of a bad job, but yet, it enables me to see all of the things which I supposedly am interested in. Everything: The school system, the judicial system, psychology, sociology, bureaucracies, the way things are done, everything in the whole goddamn world. I looked at it and I says, "Everything I claim to be interested is there. I am debt-free. Why can I not put myself together to benefit by it? Now, I'm at a point where I could actually benefit. There's nothing in the world, you know, that is keeping me from it, and yet, I can't. I am so afraid of trying anything," and I don't know. If I'm afraid of - I think what I'm really afraid of is the whole cycle repeating itself, unless I can understand, you know, why...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me like you always were busy proving to yourself how manly you are to kind of make up for that loss of not having a father. Your job as a social worker isn't manly enough, because the men are supervisors and administrators, not case workers. Maybe that is what makes the job less palatable to you. 0:46:33.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never thought of that. The first part I've thought about, not really, you know, the part about proving what the hell it is to be a man, one of the things I thought about was like a man must work. I says, okay. Technically, you know, that's one thing I think is for real.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But not in a woman's job, which I think is the way you see it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A woman's job. Yeah, that's really a  - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to accept, because that's not the way it really is and you don't want to think of it that way, but maybe that's the way you see it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I never thought of that. I've heard it described in those exact words: "It's a woman's job." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: By whom? 0:48:04.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: A policeman, a woman. This is a year ago. She described it to another person as thinking about it as being a woman's job. I guess what I think of as a man's job is something, you know, like competition, business, stuff like that, but I hate that, and maybe I don't, but I've always thought of business as the shittiest thing I could ever get into; I hate it. I says, what do you come in on, what are you coming out with, products or something like that. You know, this is the way I've always thought. </p>

<p>But you know, in your work, like the way I picture work, there should be something you want to do, and yet when I go there, when I come home, you know, supposedly, I'm supposed to - I could read something to try to help me with what the hell is going on there, and I don't do that, rarely do I do that. And when I come home I don't fuck around. I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's shit (inaudible at 0:49:56.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't know what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you don't know what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was going to go back and see if I could get back on that job. 0:50:14.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know where my slips are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I rationalize leaving and I rationalize in going back, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To this damn job. And if I don't, my goddamn hand is going to come off. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a good one, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a good night.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I hope it heals all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it - I asked one of the interns about it and he said that he thought it would; that (inaudible at 0:51:50.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there any pain on it at all?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Well, the P&C staff director that first night, you know, it's a nuisance.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. </p>

<p>(Inaudible at 0:52:11.3) </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi, come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How are you doing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good, thank you. You?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I wish I could say everything is going good. This week is kind of tough. You know, there's a lot going on. And for the first time in a long time — it's actually not the first time it's happened, but my girlfriend and I went out on Friday night. We met up with some friends. And I don't know what it is, but when she drinks, she just drinks a lot. Like, she loves wine and she just slugs wine and gets really intoxicated.</p>

<p>[01:07.3]</p>

<p>And I know it's weird, but the more and more she drinks of it, the more and more I can feel the rage coming into me, how upset I get with it and how pissed off. And I know in the past, I've exploded on her about how she needs to cut the shit with the drinking, about how I really don't like to babysit her. I don't like taking care of her, because she does drink an excessive amount and then thinks that I'm attacking her. You know, but really I'm not. I'm just trying to help her. And I'm trying to understand with myself, with these feelings. It seems to happen all the time.</p>

<p>[01:59.1]</p>

<p>Like if I'm not there, she gets mad at me if I monitor her, like "stop drinking." And she gets mad at me like "I'm an adult. You don't need to tell me what to do." And I think that's what fuels the anger and the hatred that I have, because she does have an alcohol problem. I know the problem that she's had. She's lucky she hasn't killed anybody, killed herself. Just because in previous [plans] when she drinks so much, blacks out, and is driving. You know, that's the one thing that scares me. Even when we'll go out and I'll be the responsible person, I still get angry and upset that I've got someone in my car who is passed out on the ride home. And it kind of pisses me off a lot, because in a way I think it's hypocritical where when I was coping with marijuana and doing all this stuff, she tells me that I'm too old, I need to cut the shit, I need to move on.</p>

<p>[03:00.8]</p>

<p>Well, when I address the issue of her drinking so much and needs to stop getting plastered and blacking out and doing all that stuff and "It's getting old, me taking care of you," she takes serious offense to it and continues to do it. And it is a very big concern of mine, because the more and more she does it, the more and more angry I get. I've been good at controlling it and playing it off, but she knows I'm mad because it always happens and she goes "What's wrong?" and I say "Nothing" and I try to play it off, but she can see the look in my face. She can see the anger in my face of how pissed off I get. And it irritates me to a point, because there's only certain things that she drinks where she gets that way.</p>

<p>[03:57.4]</p>

<p>When she drinks red wine or any kind of wine, she gets that way. When she drinks a specific kind of beer, she gets that way. But yet when my family goes on vacation and we drink a lot that week, she never gets like that. She's always in control, coherent, always being the responsible one. But it's just like certain other places when she's had a lot going on and this, that and the other thing are happening to her where she's really stressed out, she turns to the liquor. And I'm not going to lie, I still to this day get — and I can feel it. I can feel the rage coming into me. I can feel the anger. It just engulfs my whole body. And before, I just let it out and I would attack her. But now, I just let it come in. I don't say nothing. I get very quiet. You know, we were out with this couple having a good time. They had a good buzz going. My girlfriend had a great buzz going, and she knows I get mad because I stop drinking when this happens. I start drinking water and I get very quiet.</p>

<p>[05:08.1]</p>

<p>You know, and she doesn't understand this. She doesn't know, but she slurs her words. We're outside talking, and she's falling over. I have to catch her. And her excuse to me was she was really tired, she couldn't keep her eyes open. I mean, that's the stuff that really pisses me off. It's like, here I am, a recovering drug addict, trying ways to better myself, and I've been through the rehab process. I'm still going through rehab. In my eyes, I think I'm in rehab every day. And to have someone like her who doesn't do it, who doesn't think she has a problem or tells me she does, and is not taking the necessary steps to solve them, I think that kind of irritates me a lot too.</p>

<p>[06:05.5]</p>

<p>I have mentioned in the past to her that if she wanted to go to AA, I would go with her. I've been. I'll support her. I think it would be good for both of us. Yeah, yeah, you know, her work schedule is too busy. And then that engulfs the rage a little bit too, where she's always making excuses not to do things. I understand I haven't been the best person. I understand that I've hurt her a lot. But I also understand that I'm doing a lot of things to change my life, to put them in the right directions, and she's done a lot. I commend her for doing a lot. But there's more to do, and she's not doing it. And I've said this since day one, since we first started dating, that I have a concern for her alcohol abuse. It does bother me. It's the one thing that really does bother me, is her consumption of alcohol, because alcoholism does run in her family.</p>

<p>[07:07.1]</p>

<p>Her sister has it. Her brother drinks every time he can. Her cousins have it. She has it. So it's like I mentioned before at Easter, everything they do is they turn to a bottle. It's like I tell her, I go "You know, it all depends on the situation you're in. If you're in an uncomfortable situation, you just put a nipple on the bottle and you're drinking it like a baby. And it bothers me. Well, if you're uncomfortable, why are we going? I understand it's your family and I don't want to cut you out completely, but can you move past it or we go and we just don't stay for a long time. Instead of staying there for three or four hours, maybe we only limit it to an hour. Maybe we limit it to an hour and a half, 45 minutes, I don't know."</p>

<p>[08:08.3]</p>

<p>Because the longer she's around this negative environment, the more susceptible I know she is to drinking. And the more she drinks, the more angry I get. And I don't know why. And it's something that I'm trying to figure out. It's something that I'm trying to work on. I'm not lashing out at her anymore. Again, like I say, I go into my shell and if we're drinking and doing whatever, I'll stop drinking. I'll stop talking. And she'll know something is wrong, even after she's drunk. And then we'll wake up the next morning and she'll say "I feel this, that and the other thing." I may throw a couple of shots at her, but it's just like it's over. I want to move on from it, but it does bother me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you feel like you can't reason with her?</p>

<p>[08:58.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, because I feel like I have no stepping stones because of what I've done in the past. Because of my lying and my saying "Well, I need this to cope." I understand it's a coping mechanism, but I would like for her to find some other way to cope. You know what I mean? I mean, we talked about it, my coping mechanism was marijuana, cocaine, prescription drugs, you know, mushrooms, all those fun things. Those were all my coping mechanisms — alcohol — all my coping mechanisms. Hers, when she's in an uncomfortable situation, is alcohol. It is tough. It does bother me, because I do worry that I'm going to snap. I'm going to say things I don't want to say because I get the rage that I got before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think you're so angry at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Angry at what?</p>

<p>[10:02.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you feel very angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so it sounds like you feel angry at her, but what about her behavior that makes you angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The fact where she just — perfect example at Easter. We sit there, she wasn't drinking, it was fine. Her cousin comes in, her aunt is there. Her aunt makes her cousin and her very comfortable. Her cousin goes "Do you want a drink of wine?" "Sure." Next thing you know, it's a half hour later and they are a bottle and a half deep, the both of them. Her cousin is not slurring words, but my girlfriend is slurring her words. My girlfriend doesn't like to eat when she drinks. She just likes to drink and continually drinks and drinks and drinks. Her cousin does kind of the same thing, but she drinks at a slower pace. My girlfriend reminds me of me in ways. When I do things, I do them in excess. There's no pace myself, I'll do it this way and let it go.</p>

<p>[11:05.0]</p>

<p>No, it's like if I'm really in an uncomfortable situation, it's no I'm not snorting one line, I'm snorting two or three. Or I'm not smoking just a nugget of marijuana, I'm smoking like three or four. You know, everything I do is to get as messed up as possible so I don't feel anything. And I kind of feel like that's how she's going through. I know that's what she's going through. I know that's how she copes with difficult situations. But the anger part, I guess it just pisses me off because there's other ways to deal with it that she's not doing. She's constantly making excuses not to do things to help herself out. And to me, it pisses me off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The excuses.</p>

<p>[12:04.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The excuses part pisses me off. Or she'll do it, know I'm mad, and say she's not doing it again. And then two weeks later, she does it again. You know, there's no balance, there's no follow-up on it. And I can understand, like I'm not a perfect person. But I will not put myself in situations that will allow me to act the way I act. Part of my recovery when I first overdosed was when I was in rehab, to eliminate the people that would put me at the most risk to be present in front of drugs, present in front of anything. Any awkward environment that would present that case, I had to eliminate it from my life. And that was kind of one of the hardest things I ever had to do because all my friends from college, all my best friends from college who I lived with for three years, I had to make excuses not to hang out with them.</p>

<p>[13:06.1]</p>

<p>I wanted to hang out with them, you know. And as I get older, I'm finally explaining to them why I didn't have to do it. Because I'm hoping that they're hopefully over that stage of the drugs and all that stuff. Just because for my own health or my own safety, I couldn't be associated with it. The temptation was too much. And I think that's kind of what I'm trying to explain with her with her family. I understand it's tough, but when you are put in a toxic environment, when the solution to any environment is there on hand, what are you going to do? I know we can't avoid them all the time, but you know what? Maybe we don't go to every one. Maybe we go to one or two of them. I'm just trying to find a balance, and I do feel she's working hard. I know she's working really hard at it, but I don't think she's exploring enough of what she can do.</p>

<p>[14:15.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel like she's doing so far?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's doing fantastic with her counseling. She's working on that. She's working on her anger issues with her mom. She's working on our relationship. She's working on trying to be a better person with herself. She's working on trying to not be so emotional when people attack her at work and to let it go, that it's only work, they're not really attacking you. She's worked so hard at all those things, but there's other things that she needs to work on. Like she needs to work on her self confidence. She needs to work on her self-belief. Because constantly she's always been told that she's a failure. She has always been put down. And for me that's tough, because I used to do that. I used to put her down when I was upset but now I don't do it. I'm trying to make her upbeat. I'm trying to make her feel like she's more.</p>

<p>[15:15.8]</p>

<p>And that's why I get in these rages and I don't say anything. Where before, I'd just lash out and she'd really feel bad about herself. Here I just eat it and I let it go inside. And I just get nervous that some day it's just going to explode because it's not going to have anywhere to just filter down into. And I don't want to do that. I don't want to yell at her. I don't want to criticize her. But if there is one thing that I do not like about it is the drinking. And I've had this concern for a couple of years now, and I've addressed this concern.</p>

<p>[16:01.9]</p>

<p>And, I mean, I'm no angel. I put her in difficult situations, but she doesn't act like the way she does when she hangs out with certain people. I just don't know what it is. And for some reason, it's only when she gets really drunk it pisses me off. I'll go a bar and I'll see a guy or a girl with their drunk partner and I'll laugh. But usually — and then I look at myself and I'm like most of the time that's me. I mean, there's times when we can go out and have a good time and both of us do it. But there's also times that whenever we go out together and I know we're drinking, I'll take a back seat. And she just goes balls to the wall, which is fine. I believe every couple should have that, but you know it's to the point where she gets so drunk that I have to babysit.</p>

<p>[17:04.6]</p>

<p>And I think that's the one part that is starting to irritate me, is when she gets so drunk she can't speak and she can't stand up. For me, at this point in our lives, it shouldn't be happening. I mean, once in a while but for me, not all the time. Not more than three times a year, four times a year. It shouldn't be happening. And it bothers me, I think, more and more because she calls me out for my drug addictions. But she never witnessed my drug addictions with my hard drugs. She's only witnessed my marijuana addiction, and she sees how bad that can turn out. Because then it turns into an everyday thing and I'm constantly making excuses of why I do it. I'm constantly saying "Oh, this is the last bag, this is the end of it," and I continually have more.</p>

<p>[18:07.5]</p>

<p>I kind of see the same thing happening with her drinking. "This is the last time I'm drinking, this is the last time," and the next thing you know, there's more. And then here comes more. And then she makes another excuse why she can't do this or that, and then there's more. I guess I kind of see myself in her. I see the struggles that she's going through. I see the problems that are happening. When I look at myself and I think maybe I get angry because I was in that same situation, and I didn't have anyone to help me take control of it. Now I want to be that support system, but I want to be positive support. I don't want to be a negative support. I'm having a lot of trouble with that because when it happens a lot, negativity builds up inside of me and I get — it's amazing, I can feel the rage coming on. I can feel the anger just building and building and building.</p>

<p>[19:15.2]</p>

<p>And I know it happens, and I have to go out. I think, unfortunately, when I had friends that are smoking, this happens. I think that's why I'm smoking a lot more marijuana cigarettes. I think that's why I'm doing it, because I need to let it out and unfortunately I don't want to let it out on the drinking. I let it out on the cigarettes, and here comes my dependence issues where I depend on something. I can't just sit down and let it go and think I need to — I don't know what it is. It's actually hurting me because I've actually smoked more cigarettes now when I'm sober than I ever have. I don't crave cigarettes. I don't like cigarettes, but when I'm in uncomfortable situations, I want a cigarette.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it calm you down?</p>

<p>[20:07.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At times. I mean, it's usually not one, it's usually three or four. I wish it could just be one. But I don't know. The one thing that used to calm me down a lot was the chewing tobacco. I'm just scared to go back because I was so addicted to it. That's the one that I could do with no problem. And that's the one thing that I'm scared of because I know if I have one, the next thing you know, I will be buying ten and it will all be over. Believe me, I've thought of all that a long time. When I'm in a lot of stressful situations and all that, the first thing that pops into my head is "I know what to do. A chew. I'll have a cigarette. I'll order a drink. Now a line. Now a puff of marijuana or eat shrooms or pop a pill." It's how I deal with things. I mean, I'll have a dip and then I'll want to go to the gym. You know, that used to be my routine for a long time. When I was pissed off, I'd have a dip or I'd have a dip and work out at the same time, because both of them would soothe me.</p>

<p>[21:42.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does (inaudible at 21:44.8).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think it's got the nicotine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. I was wondering about the relationship between that and exercise. Like it would give you more energy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It doesn't. Like when I get angry and I get pissed off and I was younger, I used to go to the gym. There's nothing better than releasing a lot of the stress and the hormone intensity I was getting by pumping iron and working out hard. I mean, there were times when I'd be at the gym for three hours, just because I needed that much time to cool off myself. I remember getting into a fight with one of my buddies in high school, and it was the most pissed-off I think I've ever been. Instead of just getting into a fight and yelling, I just went and worked out. He was like "Where did you go?" and I was like "I was at the gym." And this was at like 7:00 at night, just random (inaudible at 22:40.9) why are you in the gym at 7:00 on a summer night?</p>

<p>[22:46.1]</p>

<p>I needed to blow off some steam, and that's what I do. I'll go to the gym and I'll blow off steam that way, or I'll just have a dip and think about things and blow it off that way. I just don't know what it is about the tobacco that relaxes me. I know it's kind of a cop-out, but I don't know. There's just something about it that just — it calms me down, it soothes me, and it just, it's how I do it. It's how I relax. And, you know, I don't want to turn to it at this time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it seem like when your girlfriend is drinking, she doesn't have self-control? Is that what bothers you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Only with certain drinks though. If she drinks vodka, she's fine. If she drinks beer she doesn't like, she's fine. If she drinks light beer, she's fine. It's red wine, white wine, full beers, all the heavy stuff that she can't do. I mean, I told her the hardest thing I had to do was I had to give up tequila. I had to give up drinking whiskey because I knew if I drank that, I'd get violent.</p>

<p>[24:07.2]</p>

<p>And I still do. I mean, not as much. I can have a drink of it, but that's it. Because before, I used to drink a whole bottle of it at night, and that's when I'd get the blackout and get myself into trouble. But when stuff really gets me into trouble, it's not a good thing for me, I cut it out of my life. I've asked her "Well, maybe we can cut out drinking wine. Maybe we can cut out drinking these beers." Or if she's good, I'll let her have a couple things, like "You can have a couple of the Seasonals. You can have a glass, maybe two, of red wine." But the problem is, after the glass and the two glasses comes, it's too late. And I don't want to restrict her from everything because she is an adult. She can make her own decisions.</p>

<p>[25:02.4]</p>

<p>But I'm kind of running out of resolutions. I can't tell her to cut it out completely because I know she won't. I can only ask, like I've been doing, for her to control it. And unless she's really serious about controlling it, there's nothing really I can do. But it just makes it more stressful on me because I do get the rage. I do get the anger. And that's what scares me the most. My body shakes because I get so mad. It's not a good feeling for me. I don't know if she does it because she knows it pisses me off, or she does it to hurt me in a way because she knows how I've hurt her. I don't know if she does it unconsciously. I don't know. I don't have an answer for why she does the things she does. And for me, it's frustrating. It's frustrating because I feel like I can't suggest anything to her.</p>

<p>[26:06.4]</p>

<p>I feel like I can't give her solutions on what to take. I've used AA on her a lot of times, and I felt she's turned me down a lot. Because I think the self confidence in her, admitting she has a problem, would really hurt her. Because she seems to think she wants to have everything in control. She wants to put on a happy face and move on even though she's dying inside. And that's what hurts me the most, is that she's using these coping mechanisms that only hurt her more. I can totally relate with her, because I have those same issues, except my choice was drugs. Mine wasn't alcohol. My choice was mainly drugs. And I can totally see it. I'm sure people used to do the same with me. They used to get really pissed off when I did drugs.</p>

<p>[27:13.4]</p>

<p>Maybe I can see it now, how she used to get really pissed off when I was smoking marijuana. She used to tell me all the time she thought I was childish in doing all this stuff, that I didn't need to do it, and didn't see the point in getting high and doing all this stuff. She used to call me out. She used to be really mad, and I can understand that. I can understand her anger. I can understand her madness of like me doing this childish garbage, but not knowing what I was going through, [what I understand]. I mean, she told me last week she finally understood why I was doing the drugs last year, why I was going back to marijuana, because I was in an uncomfortable situation. I needed that coping mechanism.</p>

<p>[27:59.6]</p>

<p>It was telling me why I — you know, it was validating why I needed to do it in my mind, was the situation that I was in, the work environment that I was in, the people that I was exposed to. She sees that because it's the same thing with her and the drinking. But it's just — it seems to happen more often than not that it will happen. And it's just been recently where I've just gotten really angry. I've gotten really in a rage, and I have to do other things to walk away so I don't snap on her, so I don't make a scene. Because I don't want to put negativity in her life, especially when she's already feeling so negative about herself.</p>

<p>[28.53.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if you were to snap at her, what would you say to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: You want me to be honest?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. This is a good place to be honest.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "What the fuck are you doing? Why are you drinking so much? Why are you slurring your words? Why can't you just put the fucking wine down? Why do you always have to do things in excess? Why is that you always have to do this?" I'd tell her to grow the fuck up. "You're 29 years old. Why are you getting so bleep-faced? Do you think it's fun for me to babysit you and carry you around, knowing that you can't even stand on your own two feet? You think I like that?" I go "I'm embarrassed by the state that you're in." And then I'd attack her about how she complains about her friend. When we go out with her friends, she gets that way. I go "You complain about this one, and you come out with me and you're just as bad as her." I take real shots at her, you know.</p>

<p>[30:00.1]</p>

<p>It's something I don't want to do any more. It's something that I don't — because it's not helping the situation, I don't think. But it really does bother me. It bothers me that she does that, you know, and then I get in my rage and this will go on for about 20, 25 minutes, maybe a half hour. And then she'd be crying and then I'd apologize to her. And I tell her "I'm only saying these things because I do love you unconditionally. I do care about you, and I'm sorry for what I did in the past. But I don't know what I can do to prove how much I love you." And I guess that's mainly why I get mad. Because I am, I'm very protective of her. I don't want anything to happen to her. I don't like it when she gets taken advantage of. That really bothers me.</p>

<p>[30:59.7]</p>

<p>And I also don't like the fact how her mother can just shit on her and she doesn't stand up for herself. And that bothers me. I do know that there's a terrible history between them two. And to be honest, you know, they're moving in the right direction. Well, my girlfriend is. Her mother is not. Her mother is not willing to go to therapy, to counsel herself, to figure out what the issue is. And her mother is the one who constantly puts the blame on my girlfriend. And maybe that's the rage I'm getting too, is because I see all these people attacking her and she's just taking it. And maybe that's just me boiling up to when she gets in her state, and maybe that's when the rage comes in where I want to say "Stand up for your f-ing self. Fight back. Stop being a punching bag. Stop just being someone to walk all over."</p>

<p>[32:02.9]</p>

<p>Because I used to do that to her because I saw that she was weak. And I still know she's weak and that's what bothers me. I want to say stuff. I want to tell people what's going on. And the difference between her and I is I'll say stuff and I'll go for the throat. I'm a mean SOB. But if I need to be mean once to get your attention, I will. And this all goes back to the control issue. It's just — I'm giving up control. I'm letting her be her own person, but I need her to be her own person. I need her to stop — and I think that's why she drinks so much is because she doesn't have a lot of self confidence. She's constantly thinking she's at fault. She constantly thinks she's doing things wrong. And that bothers me. That eats away at my insides.</p>

<p>[33:08.3]</p>

<p>Because I know how much she does. I know what a hard worker she is. You know, I know how good she is. It bothers me when she's telling me all this stuff and crying, how she's not worth this and blah blah blah and everything that comes out of her mouth is negative towards her. And I do feel bad. I do feel bad. But I do know she's going in the right direction. However, she does have all these setbacks that I don't agree with. And I don't want to talk to — I mean, eventually I'm going to have to, but I'm very cautious bringing this topic up with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because?</p>

<p>[33:58.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's sensitive. She'll think I'm attacking her again. If I question her drinking and ask her "Why are you doing all this stuff? Do you know it bothers me?" she'll think I'm attacking her, and I don't want that. I don't want to attack her. And sometimes it doesn't come out the way I want it to come out. The intention is that I'm attacking her, but the intention is how much I care about you. How it's not only hurting you, it's hurting me too. And she has a difficult time processing that and understanding that it's not just her that's hurt by it, it's me. It's a thin line that I don't really like to walk on because it's very bothersome. Because she used to do it with me and it was a tightrope, and she used to fall off the rope a lot. And I don't want to do it because I think I'm going to have the same problem.</p>

<p>[35:05.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you say "fall off the rope," how do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She wants to conquer it to get from here to that side. You need to cross a tightrope. So what she does is she tried to address the issue and cross the rope, but it just doesn't happen. She falls off and has to start back from the beginning. And that's how I feel. You know, if I bring it up in a way, I'm trying to think about the words to say in a positive way. But even the most positive words I think of, she'll probably read as negative. And I'm just struggling with how to communicate with her and how to get her to understand how much I don't enjoy this. I don't enjoy her drinking and the way she drinks. It's to the point where I totally want to cut off her drinking red wine. But I can't do that. I'm not the one that can do it. She's the only one that can do it. And it bothers me.</p>

<p>[36:15.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like it bothers you that you can't monitor or control her, that she's sort of beyond your reach.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I can't. And for me, I feel like I don't have the control because I already lost it when I was lying to her and I was doing all these other things behind her back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you lost credibility? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I have. I know I have. You know, and I ask her all the time and I tell her all the time the one thing I do fear is that she is going to get up and leave me because of all the stuff that I've done. Because of all the lying that I've done before. Because of the roller coaster emotionally and mentally that I've put her through. I do think that. And I've expressed that numerous times. There's just going to be one day where she's going to wake up and be like "You know what? I don't want to be with you." And that scares me.</p>

<p>[37:13.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how these two things are related at the moment though. I mean, because when you were talking about how angry you are about her behavior then to quickly thinking about her leaving you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's related to the point where I don't want to pick a fight with her because everything I've done in the past has been wrong. And if I pick a fight with her, addressing her negative issues, her drinking bothers me, her this bothers me, she can say — she has all this ammunition in my head. "Well, you lied to me here. You told me this and you did one thing. You walked out on me twice. How are you going to tell me that I have this problem when you've already done this to me?"</p>

<p>[38:11.3]</p>

<p>And for me, I feel that's a war I can't win because I don't have an answer for it. I do think under the circumstances, I had a lot going on. That's why I walked out on her. You know, but after having time to think and having time to process and having time to go over what I needed to go over and think about for myself, I understood now that I can't live without her. And I guess the reality is that from what I've done in the past, I've jeopardized that a little bit. Not a lot. I do know that she loves me a lot. I do know that she wants to be with me. But I am also very scared about if I push that wrong button, would it be over like that? And that bothers me because before there was a lot of anger in the relationship. There was a lot of fighting. There was a lot of miscommunication. But since November, there's been a lot more communication. There's been less fighting. There's been less anger. There's been a lot more positives than negatives. But those negatives that are still there are big negatives.</p>

<p>[39:32.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you almost feel like you're on probation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I do. I mean, I did a lot of things in the past and I just — I do get very cautious about what I do with her. I'm very cautious about how I approach her, how I talk to her, how I interact with her because I don't want her getting the wrong impression. And the problem is, from what I've done in the past with my lying and telling her what she wanted to hear, and telling her that everything is going to be okay, in a way hurt me. Because everything that comes out of here now is not valid. It doesn't have that strength that it did before.</p>

<p>[40:36.5]</p>

<p>But again, we did talk about how we wanted to be honest with each other. And when I told her that "I was just telling you this just to quiet you," you know, just to do all this stuff. But when I talk about it now, I mean it. But in her head, she thinks it's another ride. Or in the back of her head, she thinks it's probably another ride. I don't know. I think my problem is — everything I tell her now is really coming from my heart, but my problem is it doesn't come out that way anymore because of what has happened previously. And I guess that's why I struggle with her and with the way we communicate in our lives because I can see the self-doubt in her and then the doubt in me. My actions speak louder than words.</p>

<p>[41:39.2]</p>

<p>And I'm trying to do everything in my power to express through my actions the words that are coming out of my mouth. And for me, that's difficult because there's only so much I can do. Just expressing my concern for her and my concern for her health and all this, it's something that bothers me and I'm trying to work on it. I'm trying to work out my anger issues. I'm trying to work out my rage issues, and I have. I don't get angry at a lot of things anymore. I don't get in a rage about a lot of things like I have been in November. But this one thing is like a trigger. I think these are one of the triggers that I mentioned earlier is that when she drinks the wine or the beers, I think that's a trigger on my brain.</p>

<p>[42:45.0]</p>

<p>That sets off the anger, and I don't know how to get rid of that trigger or how to turn that trigger down to let the trigger know it's okay that she's doing this. She's going to be fine. She's an adult. But it's just a huge trigger, and I can feel it too. It's not a good feeling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can feel it when she starts drinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can feel the anger brewing, and that's what bothers me because once I see that first glass of wine, I get really nervous. My body gets anxious and tense. She has one, okay, good. Then she'll have another one and my body will start tensing even more. And then I'll start shaking a little bit.</p>

<p>[43:42.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you see it as a sign of weakness?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Because that's what I was doing. I've lived it. When I ran from myself in uncomfortable situations, I curled up like a ball and dove to what's comfortable. She does it with drinking. I did it with drugs. Maybe that's what bothers me is that she is doing it [a bit] and I want to help her. I wish someone just smacked me and goes "What are you doing with your life?" I kind of feel like that's how I want to be to her. I want to be that person that tells her "What are you doing? Stop doing this. You're not making anything better." You do bring up a good point. I guess that's what I was looking for when I was doing all my drugs and when I went back to my drugs.</p>

<p>[44:44.6]</p>

<p>When I was working at the restaurant last summer, when I went back to the drugs, I wanted that person to smack me and "What are you doing? Everything that you worked so hard to get over, this stuff to achieve, moving on, you're just throwing right down the gutters by hiding it with this garbage." And it is true. I think there's only so much that these drugs and alcohol can mask. The truth of the matter is you do have to fight your fears eventually. And I think this is one of my fears, and that's why I think I get angry is because I know unless we get some help with alcohol, I know from now until the day I die it's going to be a problem. And I think that's what scares me.</p>

<p>[45:38.8]</p>

<p>But I don't want to walk away again. That's not an option because I've done it and I don't want to. And that's the hardest part I have explaining to her is when times are tough, she's used to people just walking out on her and leaving her. I've explained this to her as best as I could and as sincere as I could that I'm not leaving again. I'm never leaving again. For me, like you said before, I don't think that has a lot of validity anymore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you feel it doesn't. I'd say it does but you don't feel it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't, because I have walked out on her twice. I have left her behind.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, please finish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it worries me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was about to say that we need to stop for today, okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will see you next week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alrighty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you, Dr. [ph].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My pleasure.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So where should we start?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I feel like it's been a while again, another three-week longer stretch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like three week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. But I feel like things have been going really well the last three weeks, too. I feel like whenever breastfeeding is going well now, I feel like that's when I'm feeling good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's the marker.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and so far, and I know I need to be good about knowing there are ups and downs with it. But for the past, probably since I've seen you last it's been going pretty well and I feel like we're just getting a little bit used to it all. So that's definitely been good. And he's almost - tomorrow he'll be two months old, which is crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my goodness. Time flew by for me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. Yes. It flew by for us too. Although sometimes we laugh that it just has felt like one long day because your sleep is just so off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, you never know really what time it is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a quote that someone shared with me. I don't know who the original speaker is but it says when you're a parent, the days seem so long and the years just fly by. I think that that's very apropos for —especially the early years when it does feel like one very long day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yes, but it is crazy that he's going to be two months old and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that's so different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we were just looking through, like we're taking tons of pictures on our phone so we were just looking through our phones the other day to see how much he can change to in just two months. It's crazy. And I know he's definitely gaining weight so I think that's another thing that has really put me at ease in terms of breastfeeding. I look at the beginning when he was just so little. It's scary to know to not know if he's getting enough. And now like we're seeing the little rolls on his legs and so we're taking bets on what he'll weigh when we go on, I think we go on Thursday. So I think that has been a whole other piece of it just knowing that he's gaining weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he's now had two months of experience and that's quite a difference.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And Todd even said yesterday, he was like do you remember when he was three months old and you were saying you can't believe you're doing something for eight time a day - no three weeks - eight times a day for three weeks and you can't get the handle of it. So breastfeeding, he's like doesn't that seem a little naïve now? And I was like I think so, yes. But so I do feel like it's getting better and he actually is sleeping a little bit once in a while giving us longer stretches. So I feel like all of that is just feeling like it's falling into place a little bit more. So, yes, and I just had...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you had a little bit of room to... [00:02:27]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, yes. And I know that's—it's hard to get into a routine right now, but it's nice to [inaudible at 00:02:33] studies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But at two months it's such a difference from what he can do and what you can expect then than at even one month or certainly at a couple weeks old. He's probably starting to distinguish a little bit between day and night and you now know what it feels like to have sort of a little bit of a routine and what to expect from him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, he did two four-hour stretches last night, which he's never done. So he woke me up at 4:30 and I put him back down at around 5:30 because it still takes us a little while for feeding. But then I was expecting him around 7:30 and I opened my eyes and it was 8:30 on the clock. I could not believe it. And Todd, we haven't been setting an alarm for him to get up for work because we're always just up, and he's like wow I guess we need to start setting an alarm now. So all of that is definitely feeling better that we're just starting to understand him a little bit more, so that's been good. And I had my own appointment with my OB last week and just to know that I'm back to normal. It just feels like things are starting to fall into place a little bit more, which is good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's good to hear that you're...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feeling good, yes. Yes. So that's been good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm so glad to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. And now I feel like we're moving into a whole different stage because Todd gets the whole month of June off, which would be so nice. And at first, when he first went back to work I was thinking to myself well I just need to really get through the month of May, kind of being with him on my own. But my mom and my sister have been coming, and Todd's mom came the other day so I still had lots of help. I haven't really felt like I've really been on my own. But and then we'll have June to all be back together and that will just be really nice to have him...[00:04:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you have the whole summer off as maternity leave?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do, yes, which is awesome. So I think I'll really get used to this, though. I think going back to school might be a little hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'll have some adjusting to do in the Fall but let's not jump ahead to the Fall just yet. Give you...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, no, I want to enjoy this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Give you the spring and the summer.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. Yes. So we're going to be going up to Canada, probably at some point next week, and spending time. Todd's parents have a place up in Central Canada on a lake. And then my family has a little cottage in Southern Canada, so we'll probably be there without them for a little while. And then as soon as my mom gets out of school my family will be going up there so we can kind of see everybody which will be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. They'll all get to spend some time with the baby.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Should be awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my grandmother, one of my grandmothers hasn't met him yet and so she'll be coming from Indiana, so that'll be very nice to have them together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the gambling grandma?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, yes. Everyone knows her as the gambling grandmother. That's so funny. But it will be really good because he is so lucky he has three great grandmothers which is amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, that is wonderful. I'm sure they're so happy to be able to see this part of their history...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes, it's pretty cool. So that will be really nice and I think it'll be nice for us to have a little bit of time because I know the grandparents will want to just take him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, they're going to want to - and this is a great age where he'll be able to get sit and get snuggles and you just need to be on call for a feeding or to pump, but you can have some time alone.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I think that that will be nice. And I have, I still have work to do though for school, which I feel is on my mind but not really. It's kind of like I'll need to just get time to just sit down and actually do it because I have until September 1st or something but I really don't want to have it hanging over me. [00:06:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hanging over, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm gong to try, in my head I've...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you have Todd home and doing it, might be a nice time to be able to...</p>

<p>CLIENT: To do that, yes. And then when we're in Canada, too, I was thinking that would be nice to kind of - he'll be with his grandparents and I'll have time to - so I think that that will work out well. And then I'm doing one other project with a friend. So that will be good, like the two of us can kind of motivate each other to get it done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you have? Are you working on papers from last semester?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it's mostly just - it's only finals that are due and it's like final project. So the final project for the Action Research project that I've been working on. That final - finishing the project and then writing the paper for that. And then another project for one other class and then for another class, my third one, it's nice that my project for that can kind of couple with my Action Research project so I'm just developing a website of resources for the teacher who I collaborated with for that other class. So it's nice that those two overlap. So it doesn't really feel like three separate...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So many separate papers, projects.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, projects, but it's just finding time to get it done because I think before he was born I was like oh well babies will sleep so much I can get stuff done during the day. And I really, I've gotten little things done but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [00:07:19]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's just you have to get into the mindset of getting back into it and then he'll wake up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't have this long stretch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So in that - in May because I did come back for the class that I was a teaching fellow for and to do grading because I was starting the semester and then didn't really do anything at all once Trae was born. And then I split the grading for their final projects with the TF who was kind of helping me when I left. So I was so glad that I asked to split it because I never would've been able to do it all on my own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you think how much it takes just to sit down and do stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So that was really good. And I was thinking that because this time last year I felt like I was just so stressed out with grading and it was kind of nice to look back on things now and think wow a lot has definitely changed. I think I was totally stressed out through finals and then it was like I almost looked for something to worry about next so then I put it all into grading and I was like...[00:08:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember talking about, sort of checking back to see where the grades came from so in case anyone ever questioned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it was hard for you to kind of let that go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I noticed, I was kind of wondering how it would be because I only had - usually you have around 12 or 15 and I only had 6 students to grade. So that was so much better anyway. And the TF who was sharing my role, we were kind of collaborating on them like she would send me - we fill out these rubrics - so she would send me the rubrics to just kind of look over because I knew the students too, and I would do that same. So it was kind of nice to bounce ideas off of her.</p>

<p>But I feel like I was wondering how I would do because at this time last year I was thinking about it at night, I was having trouble sleeping. I still remember this one student who was borderline and I wasn't sure what grade to give him and was feeling guilty about the grade that I gave him. And so I was wondering if those kind of feelings would come back and I definitely felt much better. There was one student this year, again, who was kind of borderline. But it wasn't keeping me up at night at all. I was just kind of thinking about it and it was nice to have that other TF who we kind of collaborated with to kind of bounce ideas off of her for a grade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And do a reality check.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so I feel like that was nice because it was definitely a stressful thing last year. And I even remember I turned in my grades and the next day we went to my sister's graduation. And my sister was just saying you know this day a year ago was my graduation - we were thinking back to when she graduated and my whole family went, and I was remembering oh I remember just enjoying being there but having this weight on me still kind of worried about those grades.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Making you uncomfortable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, so that was just a nice ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Think how different it felt this year not to have that be such a weighty thing. And probably, I know it was fewer numbers, but I don't think that was the - was not the difference. [00:10:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I don't think so either. And even just with my own finals, I think I was telling you this the first time I saw you that with that statistics final that I was so worried about and then I turned it in; I felt like I did well on it. And then I was trying to convince myself that we had cheated on the final or something because that problem we had worked out ahead of time actually was on the test. And I was just thinking back to that time and it's just felt exhausting to have so much that I was letting myself worry about. And I was kind of laughing to myself thinking well now I'm up with a newborn all the time and that doesn't feel as exhausting as thinking about all those things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All that mental work. Yes, that mental work of worrying is really zapping. And being anxious. It's the combination of sort of the mental worries that you're rehearsing in your head when you're doing that and just the toll that anxiety takes on your body is really draining. And sleep deprivation is also draining but you don't have this compulsion (ph) of the sort of mental exhaustion to go along with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and I definitively feel like that's no matter what I think that was a hard time because I think it was the next month really that I sought you out. I knew that I was spending too much time being worried about things that really weren't needed. So it was interesting to think back and now we have a baby and a lot has changed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There has been a lot of changes in one year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if also that's also. Like being up with Trae and being exhausted because of that is - it's for a good cause. You know why you're up; you know why you're exhausted. It makes sense that you haven't had an unbroken night of sleep now in several months. It makes sense that you'd be exhausted but it didn't really compute for you. You knew, there's one part of your brain that knew that this probably wasn't significant enough or important enough to be this worried about and - because you came in saying it's like I'm looking for things to be worried about and not even really worries. And so the fact that it kind of makes sense now why you're tired, you're not judging yourself for it, whereas before it really didn't make sense to be so concerned about whatever the focus was at that time. [00:12:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think that makes sense because it didn't ever make sense. I knew that I was worrying about things I didn't need to and I couldn't stop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and you didn't know how to stop yourself from doing that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. And I do feel like that's still at the back of my mind now, not wanting to get into that again and I feel like every time I've seen you since I've had him I've been saying that. Like things are going well but I'm worried that what if I start getting into that. And I don't really - the one thing I noticed, I caught myself. I think it happened on - it must've been just yesterday. We went for a walk and I was pushing him in the stroller and I hit this giant pothole and I felt so bad because his little head was bouncing. And I was worried that I had hurt him or something and he didn't cry or anything. And so I kept telling myself if he got hurt, he would've cried. And I said to Todd I feel badly that I did that. Do you think he's okay? And Todd was looking at me, he's like I think he's fine. But that was - a couple times I've come back to that and I feel like that would've been something I would've let myself worry about. And I think...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you definitely noticed it? And you checked him out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, and it's about the closest thing that I've had to something so far that's been a worry that I know I probably shouldn't worry about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. But you let it go. That happened yesterday, you slept as much as you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I was not thinking about that at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I mean it's one thing to sort of keep tabs on yourself because you want to catch yourself before that happens, before you make something an obsession. But staying in the moment and not worrying about what's going to happen next because thinking okay things are going now but what if? That only makes it more - that provides an opportunity for one of those to grow and you don't need to do that. You don't need to give yourself those opportunities. Stay - bringing yourself back to the present, whether that's a reality check like peeking in the stroller making sure he's okay, he's not bleeding, cry out and his head is still intact, and then let yourself move on. [00:14:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and I do feel like I've been...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have a nice bouncy stroller?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, we do. We got the bounce; we're good. It's built for that kind of thing. But I do feel like it's been a nice stretch and I think that that's what's on my mind now is it just feels so nice to not have those worries...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is the real you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes. And it's felt so good. And so that's the only thing now is just thinking I don't want to fall back into those same things that were kind of weighing me down before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what are the things that you can do to keep yourself healthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think what you said too, not letting myself worry about the future too because that's the thing that I think I'm always kind of anticipating and knowing to just stay focused on the day. But even just like general things like now that I know that I'm back to normal physically to be able to be exercising more, I think that kind of stuff will help me too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, I know you did a lot of yoga before you had him so I wonder if now that you have this time, seeking out some either some mom and baby yoga classes, there's lots of those that are offered around, or Todd will be around in June, scheduling some time where you can go off and take a yoga class and he can spend some daddy time. Finding ways to build those types of things that keep you healthy and keep you grounded back into your schedule. [00:16:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I think that sounds good because I really haven't done anything. I did find a mommy and me yoga class so I think something like that would be fun to try out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, yes. A little bit of a way for you to sort of bring back some parts of your life that were really helpful to you. And those were things that when you were really anxious helped keep you grounded, helped keep you calm. Yoga's a great way to practice on being present and centered. And so bringing those things back in and the way that they fit now that might be ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Might be a little different.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...might be a little bit different but it also - or else it could be the same it just requires a little bit more scheduling, finding someone to take care of him so you can go do one by yourself or trying it out and seeing how he does with a mom and me type class.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I think that would be good to try. And I think it would be nice with Todd home over June to figure out and try a class or something and then if I like it then know that that's something that we can do even when he's back at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, when he's back at work you can find a way to schedule that or trade off with somebody else if you need, something like that. You have a good network of people around you so finding ways to use them and involve them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know. That definitely has felt good to know that there's been so many people to help us out. And then I don't - for other things in terms of things to keep me healthy and feeling good. I feel like it definitely has helped to be talking with Todd a lot too and sharing that and so it's not - but I know we also talked about I don't want him as my sounding board or my mom or whenever I feel like there's a need to be my sounding board to check to make sure I don't, it doesn't need to be a worry either. [00:18:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're checking in with them about those types of things or talking a lot about just what you're experiencing right now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, more just what I'm experiencing. I don't feel like I - I think last night was the first time I did that with Todd in just saying he looks okay, right? I know I hit a big pothole. That, I think, really was the first time. Every once in a while there'll be - we put him in a sleep sac and it gets up over his face sometimes and we need to fold it over. Stuff like that, I feel like those are normal things and I'll check to make sure that that's tucked in and Todd would say oh yes, it looks fine. I think it's fine. But I think those are the kinds of things that parents will talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to not communicate with your partner. So, I mean that that's really (inaudible) for have to keep yourself honest about am I asking him to soothe the concern or am I just sharing in parenting? Because you do want to share in the parenting and you want to make decisions together about things. So it's - you kind of have to just judge for yourself about where that line is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that has been such a good feeling too, to know that we are sharing it together. It's hard and both of us are in it together and helping each other and that's been really nice. I think for the two of us, like for our marriage too, to do something that's a big deal but together has felt really good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really a bonding experience and I know, the quick snapshot I got of the three of you together when he came by with the baby, he seemed very enamored with this little being that you guys have created.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He is, totally, yes. So that's been really fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It can be really nice to see a new side of one another. He's seeing you as a mom for the first time and you're getting to see him as a dad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I know it's been really neat. We always knew. I knew he would be such a good dad but it's so cool to see it in action, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a wonderful thing to share. Well it sounds like you're doing fantastic. [00:20:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, it does - it feels good that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's okay to trust it. I'm waiting for you to say but, but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great, that is, but. I know and it is okay to trust it but I think that's what I'm having the most trouble with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's your next step. Your next step is figuring out how to feel good and trust it rather than worrying that it's going to go away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yes, I think that's exactly where I am, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's try - I don't know. Last time I don't think we had time to do a relaxation, so let's try to do a relaxation focusing on that. Focusing on the idea of how do you get comfortable with feeling good. So we'll sort of run through the relaxation part but then what I'm going to have you try is just kind of staying in that mode and seeing if you can let yourself be comfortable with the idea of things being okay because it sounds like what really happens is you feel good and then you're like okay I hope I don't mess this up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's a great step but to be able to feel good and enjoy feeling good would be the next place. So let's schedule for next time first so we don't sort of get you all relaxed and switch to scheduling, because I feel like that always erases the [inaudible at 00:21:20]. How are we doing on time? We're going to be a little bit over, is that okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, that's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm less good than I think I am about judging the time. I think I've gone over with everybody today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we've been doing around three weeks, is that - or two and a half, I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. The only thing is we're not quite sure because we will spend a whole bunch of time up in Canada. I know we won't spend the entire month. I'm sure we'll come down and Todd has a couple things for work, we'll need to come back home. But I'm just not quite sure...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to just call me when you know your schedule better or do you want to pick something to have it there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, maybe I should call you. I'll talk with Todd and figure out - because I'm just not - it's kind of nice to not know like oh we're just going to go up to Canada and see what we're doing, but I'm not quite sure when we'll be back. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll have a little bit more flexibility in my schedule June and July because a lot of students are away, so if you just want to sort of touch base with me we can probably fit something in. And if you know you're going to come home the next week, we can probably just squeeze in 1/2 hour somewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll just sort of make a note too. I will check up on you if you don't call.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, good. I'm sure I'll remember.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let yourself get as relaxed as possible. Close your eyes; get comfy. And start to settle into a comfortable pace of breathing full, deep breaths. Mentally scan your body, notice any place that feels tight or uncomfortable. Think about breathing into that space. And as you exhale let go of any tension or discomfort repeating that process as many times as you need to. Scanning your body noticing what it feels like. Inhaling, exhaling, letting go of any tension. Letting yourself become more relaxed. Letting yourself shift or move wherever you need to become comfortable. [00:23:47]</p>

<p>Keeping your body relaxed, also scan your mind, notice what your thoughts are. And as you exhale, whenever you're ready, let go of those thoughts, letting your mind get clear for now. Anything that's really important you can come back to later. For now letting your mind fill with something comforting, something peaceful. Notice yourself feeling relaxed. And as you notice yourself feeling relaxed, let yourself just breathe, trusting what you feel. Any thoughts enter into your head, let them go without any judgment, letting your mind return to that space of feeling comfortable, feeling relaxed.</p>

<p>If you notice tension creeping back into your body, let yourself breathe and let it go. Notice what it feels like to be relaxed, noticing what it feels like to let your mind be clear. Just stay relaxed. So let yourself take a couple more deep breaths, noticing what it feels like to be relaxed, almost memorizing that feeling of having your mind be clear. Let yourself hold onto that as you come back to the room at your own pace. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>The one line I used in there was just let yourself breathe. That's one thing. It's hard to tell yourself not to think about something, so when you notice yourself starting to think about the what if or I hopes type of think, you can tell yourself breathe instead, just breathe instead. And that sometimes helps you to stay in the present a little bit longer and that's how we'll help you kind of extend and trust that feeling is just to stay in the present just a little bit longer. So that's something you can try out when you get a quiet moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We're getting a few more of those now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure they come. It's just a matter of catching them when they're there and using them in a way that sort of reinvigorates you and let's you kind of practice that. All right. So I'll hear from you in a little bit. I think you were here for 1/2 session today.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [00:27:03]</p>
